<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone noticed how gimp warriors are? especially ones without uber taunt weapons?  I say we all petition for Sony to give them some kind of bonus because they are utterly useless in LDoN compared to a Pally and most likely an SK... i think i prefer a ranger to tank then a warrior because at least when i slow on the incoming the mob doesn't come after me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, they need to nerf paladins and shadow knights or, more importantly, nerf mana regen spells and items which allows hybrids to cast continuously. It should be a challenge to maintain aggro, not the brain-dead lock that paladins and shadow knights currently have. What's the challenge for other classes if nothing ever hits them, no matter how much they debuff or nuke?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I say we all petition for Sony to give them some kind of bonus<br />
Everyone is aware of the difficulty warriors have now in comparison to knights, and is much thrashed about on every board to no real conclusion.  One thing you probably didn't know is that warriors already have a 10% xp bonus.  Doesn't do much to bridge the gap, but then no bonus will help them with their existing problems, no matter how much it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i NEVER thought id say this, but sony is to scared of nerfs, i might be unpopular, but i think pallys/sks need a good whack with the bat.  I do agree WAR taunt needs an upgrade tho.<br />
<br />
also, are you sure the melee bonus didnt go away with the hybrid xp penalty?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>xDeMeNtiAx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">best thing is just upgrade the war and leave hybrids alone...<br />
<br />
id say giving war a 2nd taunt skill that they could use in conjunction with normal taunt . same reset timer as taunt, name its something like Warcry, 1-255 skill, adds skill/5 in hate on a success/fail (so +51 hate at max skill).<br />
<br />
then war can stop crying about being puss aggroers</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've noticed that in LDON it seems that they have an even harder time gaining agro. Either that, or the shaman has had a secret slow nerf slipped in...<br />
I pull with slow (or root depending) and then stand there for almost half the fight with all the agro, regardless of what a warrior does and sometimes even with a paladin.  If I move, the mob just follows for a fun match of tennis.<br />
<br />
Even PoP mobs don't seem to hate me so much after a slow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would be wonderful if that were the case.  Have you noticed a really popular sig going around these days?  Goes something like:  &quot;Classes are pretty much balanced - ABSOR&quot;.<br />
<br />
More accurately, everyone WHO PLAYS THE GAME is painfully aware of the plight of warriors (and monks, to a lesser degree).  Sadly, EQ devs are not in this category, apparently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally I think the monk is more in need of a boost than the Warrior.<br />
Every group I'm in in LDON needs a tank of some kind.<br />
I'll just as happily take a warrior as anyone else with the taunt skill (even a ranger).<br />
<br />
Monks have a harder time finding their way into my groups.<br />
It's not that I don't want a monk.<br />
It's just that I want any DPS class I can find quickly without waiting around at an adventure camp.<br />
There's War, Pal, SK, and Ranger with the taunt skill for tanking.<br />
For dps, I'll take pretty much anyone though.<br />
So for a DPS spot, a monk has to compete with 13 other classes for a spot.<br />
<br />
Feign pulling just isn't that big of a deal in LDON xp groups.<br />
LDON is all about &quot;go go go&quot; and get the adventure done asap.<br />
Feign splitting takes time.<br />
It's more efficient to just pull 3 mobs and CC them all than it is to let the monk feign split off 1 or 2 mobs.<br />
<br />
The only real qualifier to this is I'll probably specificly look for a monk when I start doing hard adventures.<br />
When the mobs are hitting for 900s, feign splitting isn't looking like that bad of an option, anymore.</div></div><hr />

Sure they're not *AS* good but they're damn close enough.<br />
<br />
If they can hold aggro just as well then what the hell is the point of having a sk/pal tank since they can't tank 'just as well'. The trade off is simple, groups need to hold off on spells at the start of warrior tanking. The lack of ability to cast slows etc, is offset by the fact that warriors can absorb the damage better. With a Sk/Pal tanking you can slow right away, with a war tanking you can't - but the war is a better tank so he can take the short duration unslowed with little problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">kaldron...perhaps those &quot;spell&quot; things that you cast would be a decent tradeoff?  You know, the agro whatever buffs, paladins insanely good heals, brells, root, SK snare, etc.<br />
<br />
The warriors on my guild all use the Great Staff of the Four Winds....they keep agro off me fine.  I occasionally get agro on a slow, but not usually for more than a few seconds.<br />
<br />
Edit:  By &quot;keep agro off me fine,&quot; I do not mean that warriors are fine.  They need something more.  If I seriously go for dps/agro on a mob, I can get it with a warrior tank.  That's impossible with a sk/paladin around.</div></div><hr />

Spoken like a true SK.<br />
<br />
Some of the Gods in PoTime are being tanked by Hybrids. When my guild raids we quite often end up with an SK tanking during fights with AE slow or agro debuffs. This is not after we've done the event 100 times. This is on the first or second attempt. Almost the same HPs with almost the same mitigation/avoiddance and vastly better agro generation. Sure sounds like the best of both worlds to me. What with PoP mobs being designed around phasing out /disc defensive... what else are Warriors good for? Suicide shielding your Knights of course!<br />
<br />
A Warrior without EB weapons is much worse off than a Monk atm. A Warrior with the EB procs isn't really doing all that bad... but not real good either. They proc often enough that they'll have agro in the first 10 seconds of an exp group. I don't know how to fix either of them. Higher availability of agro weapons was a reasonably good start though. In my opinion, Monks are and will always be a broken class. It's built into the design.<br />
<br />
Monks and Warriors are screwed. There is nothing they do better than any other class, and they don't bring any utility what so ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Interesting that this topic should come up. I've been playing my warrior almost exclusively in LDoN since it came out because it's a lot easier for me to get groups with him than it is with my shaman. He's gained 3 levels so far and most groups I've been in have complimented me on my ability to hold aggro. He's not uber (level 55 wielding only one proc'ing weapon), but he's not ghetto either. He doesnt have any trouble holding aggro over any of the tanks he has been fighting alongside regardless of class. The people that keep pulling aggro are the damn casters - wizard overnuking, other casters who cannot fathom the concept of sit aggro, etc.</div></div><hr />

I regularly play LDoN with a warrior friend of mine, he is my preferred MT because he's a mate... Whether he pulls or I pull, I use Tigir's to slow, it's innate hate reducer is invaluable.

Yes, I agree Warriors need a *little* upgrade, but you have to remember the 10% xp bonus and the uber tankage they provide once the mob is on them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Warriors who understand how taunt actually works have no problem getting and holding aggro. My guild warriors are pretty good at it - they can't get and hold aggro as fast as knights - but they gain and hold it pretty fast. Of course, this takes some degree of skill.<br />
If you have aggro the entire fight regardless, you may want to try a root and back off. Gaining and holding aggro is mostly the warrior's job but that doesnt mean you can't help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">SoE is scared to upgrade warrior taunt right now, not because they are so balanced in groups, but because giving them much more powerful taunt abilities would make raiding far too easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Warriors and monks are both screwed, but, having played my monk up to 63, I have to say monks have more issues than warriors, mainly for the reason outlined by Juujuu.  Monks have little to no utility since pac/lull spells were fixed.  They certainly don't have any when an entire expansion is essentially a lengthened PoJ trial.  The monk hybrid (beastlord) does more damage, takes less damage, and has infinitely more utility; at least warriors outdamage 2/3 of their hybrids, and take less damage than any of them.  Of course, they have zero utility. ;)<br />
<br />
The main problem is, as I see it, that it's hard to justify an upgrade to just warriors and monks, and leave rogues out, seeing as how they're pure melee as well.  The reason this is a problem is rogues don't need an upgrade.  Any upgrade to monks and warriors without an equivalent upgrade to rogues, regardless of whether or not they need it, will have the Safehouse up in arms.  We can't have that, of course...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
It is less efficient to work at it.  It is far better to NOT work at it and get the knight alternative.  <br />
<br />
The knight is a better all around exp group tank than a warrior.  And on raids the knights have other roles to fill that warriors are unable to.  So complaining that warriors are the best raid tank is not exactly true.  Knights and warriors have different roles on raids, each as important as the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thats the rub, aggro is not the groups' responsibility in ldon.  I went on a hole raid the other night, tanked by a warrior.  When time was allowed for the warrior to build aggro, it never left her.  Ldon breaks this, there simply is no *time* to let the mob get down to 75% before a slow or nukes or assisting melee to start hitting it.  Aggro needs to be faster than ever now, which pretty much means knight tanking or shaman.<br />
In Mistmoore the other morning, we had an sk for a tank, couldn't hold aggro for anything.  After about halfway, I started tanking.<br />
The tools for knights are incomparably greater for knights than warriors, however its still up to the player to use them.  It used to be difficult to play with a bad paladin, today they're everywhere.  I'm starting to find some of the better players are playing warriors, since it was just too hard for the chumps.<br />
If it sounds like I'm conflicted about this, its true.  Warriors dont have as many tools, but one that uses theirs well is still fine.  Knights have the tools, but a bad player is still a bad player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This argument is a complete cop out, because knights are capable of tanking everything a warrior can if it does not require defensive. That means roughly a dozen end game PoP encounters.<br />

When your tank goes, people want a hybrid replacement over a warrior replacement because yes, people do want to do the least amount of work for their exp. For reference:<br />

<br />
90% of the Shammies here that responded wanted a knight over a warrior. It is not just our class either, it  is the same everywhere it gets asked. That is a problem, and a big one...and it's been going on for over a year now, to this extent(And building up to that level since mid velious).<br />
<br />
<br />
at least warriors outdamage 2/3 of their hybrids, and take less damage than any of them<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors outdamage 1 of their hybrid classes, Paladins. SKs outdamage them, Rangers..well. As for taking less damage, equally equipped knights and warriors mean a warrior taking about 1%(heavily parsed and proven) less damage than the knights. So small as to be meaningless...which it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Well I couldn't resist posting since this subject is one of my interests.  Warriors who know what they are doing, are working hard to target fast and have good taunt equipment are fine. Period, period. In fact with ae taunt and shield they are great for the zerg groups.<br />
<br />
Now, that being said few warriors meet the above class description (although many more will will have better taunt equipment and increased aa's in few months).  Slap a couple of LDON taunt augments into their weapons and that should improve the situation a bunch.<br />
<br />
As it stands right now I generally prefer a pally/sk for a group but it doesn't matter too much since I can take a beating with 240aa's worth of protection.  But I do feel sorry for the lower 60's shaman who I am sure and getting slapped around something terrible with a gimpy warrior main assist.<br />
<br />
I personally don't see anything wrong with monks - heck they tank just fine in normal LDON if called to do so and they lay out the smack otherwise.<br />
<br />
I think the classes are beautifully balanced now at the high end - certainly the best I've seen in my 4+ years in EQ.<br />
<br />
I don't think there are any worst classes anymore (except what I mentioned above about the warriors), but a bad cleric or enchanter sure can screw things up, lol.  I suppose a bad shaman could also.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Sk's outdamage warriors only when they can do burst damage. If you parse during the main raid target chances are the SK is going full bore on DPS and do quite well, but they can't keep this up indefinitely like in say - a LDoN adventure. <br />
<br />
One thing neglected to look at is the fact that LDoN adventures require you to move at a fast pace with almost no meditation period. This greatly reduces the DPS of knight classes who are dependent on their mana. Thus, the faster you go the less mana knights have to use towards aggro management, lessening their advantage.<br />
<br />
Paladins do have it quite good in LDoN. Not only do they have their own pacify line, but with slay undead their dps is rogue-ish in over 60% of the dungeons. <br />
<br />
The problem has already been rectified however to a decent level. Besides for the lack of meditation time in LDoN there are also many new high aggro weapons readily available. Two examples are the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper plated hammer of striking from Droga. Both generate VERY good aggro, especially considering their ease to obtain (one goes for 14ish k on my server and the other for 5). The hammer has a similar proc to the SOD, and near as effective if you read warrior threads.<br />
<br />
I believe this is the right solution, adding higher aggro weapons to the warriors utility belt. As for the monk situation, I believe they could use help on the DPS department in order to up their value in groups. However, their damage mitigation is already high enough in my opinion - I have fellow guild VT equipped monks that surpass my shadowknights ac with ease and approach upon my hp, and my gear is fairly good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Pretty easy.<br />
<br />
Give warriors An enhancement to thier taunt skill. On a successfull taunt now Warriors (And any other taunting class) Gets Hate +1 of the aggro leader. This enhancement needs to be Taunt skill devided by 2 + hate added to  the warriors list. On a Failed taunt it adds the same amount But without the hate boost added to it.<br />
<br />
The other Enhancement to any of the Pure Meele classes is an immediate change to stats on items. Basicly Any +mana Will add Hit points as well If the class has no mana bar.<br />
<br />
Knights have aggro lock, And they should be able to spend mana for aggro lock. But right now thier most effective aggro spells are the Low level spells. With little mana cost. Clinging darkness should be a minor annoyance not the end all be all of cheap Aggro boosting. Same thing for the Pantywaist Baby slap stuns of ceise and desist.<br />
<br />
If the knights want aggro lock let them burn Actual Mana for thier aggro. Make aggro lock cost them the choice of Aggro or Mana. Like it was before FT 15 and C5 and All the other boosts.<br />
<br />
Now Monks. Well. My opinion is for monks to allow them back into the pull role once again. Like they used to have. With Lull and all the other stuff that is in the game. Well.. If that isnt unfair compaired to all the deaths that monks took then people havnt been playing attention.<br />
<br />
Also, Monks need the ability to be viable for damage comparable to thieves. I don't belive they have ramped up as much as thieves have and lost thier pulling role in 90% of the game now. And that aint right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Monks really don't need a whole lot...I would say change up ALL pure melee /discs to be effective choices and MUCH lower reuse time all ALL discs (not just pure melee but hybrids as well).<br />
<br />
Taunt currently if succesful puts you at the top of the hate list with 1 point extra over the last top person...for the first taunt I think that is great...however if you are at the top they should code it where you get 100 points of hate thrown on top of your current hate.  Or give them a seperate taunt that works like that.  This is not game breaking in the least.<br />
<br />
Monks I believe one of two things should happen...either take away our weight limit or make that weight limit mean something.  If we keep the weight limit take away the Mitigation nerf.  For the Knight that posted earlier.  Yes the monks might have more ac then you but an enchanter with 1700 AC (yes I said enchanter) cannot tank the Avatar of war near as effectivly as a Knight with 1300 AC.  Why...because cross class comparison of AC is like comparing apples and Oranges...when they nerfed monks mitigation they did not change the AC on our equpiment...they changed how much that AC ment.  If they take away the weight limit we can effectivly use the ANYTHING that has MNK or ALL/ALL on it and that could possibly fix our problem.  That and let me pull after PoS...thanks.  (So far BoT about as far as my guild has gotten PoP wise with actual flags and all)<br />
<br />
You can call this a nerf all you want but like the KEI fix I think it should be implemented...the level 9 stun should generate A LOT less agro then the 60+ stuns.  Scale the agro ammount by the level of the spell.  Same with the darkenss (Snare/DoT) series for the SK's.<br />
<br />
Rogues tend to be the only pure melee class that bring utility to a group.  Make that utility (disarm trap on chests) actually disarm it instead of them getting hit for 3k DD + a DoT.  The way this crap was implemented is idiocracy at its best.  Then if they actually get past the trap 75% of the stuff in the chests is CRAP.  Change that please.  DPS upgrade for rogues would have to be marginal if no one else in the pure melee department got one...if they up'ed monks they would HAVE to upgrade Rogues hands down.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I spent this past weekend powergaming to get through some levels and AAs as fast as I could on my weekend off. The whole time, I wanted nothing but a Warrior tanking. I play a Paladin. I know what they can do. But I wanted to see just how bad Warriors had it for myself.<br />
<br />
With seven different Warriors over the course of three days, I only had a problem with one of them. With the other Warriors we adapted to one another's playstyles. if they wanted to pull I'd slap a root on the MoB and then slow. If I was pulling, I'd pull with slow, Stoicism myself, and let the Warrior taunt off me if he needed that much time. I watched my aggro, as did the Cleric I spent the weekend with, and the Ranger and Monk adding DPS for us. We had a Mage, a Wizard, and a necro at various points. With the exception of a Wizard who was, literally, chain casting (without using that concussion spell or staff or whatever it is they use to reduce aggro) and who we let get eaten because it cost less mana to rezz him than to heal him. <br />
<br />
The one Warrior I did have a problem with? I talked to him privately in /tells and found out he was used to pressing the taunt button every time it refreshes. I explained how taunt worked for him, and after a few more pulls he started getting the hang of it. The bastard was wielding two Ykeshas and was in pretty gimp gear. He also had no idea that Shaman and Cleric spells stacked, at 55. (That's the real problem: the removal of hell levels made it too easy for Johnny LOIO and Timmy the Velk's Lab Retard to bum rush their levels.)<br />
<br />
We repped out a Warrior for a Paladin when a friend wanted to join us ... and the only difference there is that I didn't have to root or wait to slow.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't the Warrior class, it's the person behind it. Same with over-aggroing nukers. Knights make people lazy. Are you going to have any less fun if you make 5% of your level in a half-hour as opposed to 6%?<br />
<br />
Kind of funny how those Warriors from varying guilds and varying degrees of gear all managed to do a good job in a pick-up gorup where we only knew one of them, and invited the rest out of the /LFG tool. One of the Warriors was so good I don't remember having been hit once in a period of a half an hour, and was surprised to see red text flood up in my melee box. <br />
<br />
And for the naysayers: it has always been the group's responsibility to watch aggro. PoP XP just made people greedy and not care about having fun as much as maxing the XP potential. If you don't believe it's YOUR responsibility to watch YOUR aggro and keep YOUR ass from getting beaten into YOUR bind point ... then there's nothing I can really tell you to change that perception. We're all allowed an opinion. But I can't justify blaming or feeling sorry for a class designed to take hits (and yeahyeah, 1% difference in Plane of Time with Hybrids who have the points to fill every slot with PoT gear ... thank you 3% of the game population) just to make up for my own inability to control my own aggro because I want to be greedy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It takes a really bad paladin to lose agro. It takes a really good warrior to hold agro and the group has to adjust. Which would you select for your XP group? Oh yeah, and the one with better agro also has lots of utility to add.<br />
<br />
Warriors are broke, and need fixing. Monks are sort of pointless and need one. Anyone who disagree's is 90% likely to be a paladin.</div></div><hr />

Funny thing is, since LDoN came out I've started playing my warrior again. Funnier thing is, I've never had more success holding aggro. I'm having a hard time juggling time between my Shaman and Warrior now. I was wondering if they put a stealth change in there some how.<br />
When playing my Shammy, I have had several missions with a warrior as MA and NEVER had an issue with slow aggro. In fact slow aggro is my friend, in groups with no other crowd control I slow the add pull it away from group and root. I can handle 2 or 3 adds this way.<br />
By the way, in my opinion the most useless class in LDoN or the game in general is-RANGER.<br />

<br />
Again, with a knight a group doesn't have to do this. Given that people don't want to do more than they have to, that means they do not want warriors to tank if they can throw a knight in that spot and kill faster with less effort on their part.<br />
<br />
That translates into warriors not getting anything but pity groups unless there are no knights around. When 9 out of 10 groups(again, proven here and elsewhere with polls) want a knight over a warrior, there is something wrong.  <br />
<br />
The people who disagree on this point, such as KrysandTrip, are knights themselves wanting to hold onto the gravy train they've enjoyed for the last year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, monks were like your #4ish tank choice before that...they didn't have taunt, but they tanked better than a ranger, and did pretty darn good dps, plus feign pull was nigh irreplaceable in a lot of scenarios.<br />
<br />
But then a lot of stuff happened:<br />
<br />
- the revamp of the lull line (a very good thing IMO overall) gave other pull management options<br />
- the other DPS classes scaled up damage faster<br />
- the monk damage mitigation nerf<br />
<br />
Now they're about the #6 choice in tanks and their dps is down the line a ways as well... they don't really have a PURPOSE.  I tend not to be picky about classes, so I'll take a monk in my groups for DPS, but they need some love.<br />
<br />
Ditto Warriors -- I'll take them in my groups, but I have no illusions; it's easier and more efficient to have a knight tank in an XP group.</div></div><hr />

Classes that offtank better than monks: Warrior, Shadow Knight, Paladin, Beastlord. Well, a monk beats the hell out of a wizard as offtank, at least. Low AC (Relatively speaking) coupled with the mitigation penalty means monks aren't the offtanks they used to be. Sure, they can still do it, but any well geared 65 toon with a reasonable number of AAs can do the same thing, including casters. <br />
<br />
They have good frontal DPS which is hugely important.<br />
If by 'good', you mean roughly equivalent to a warrior, then sure.<br />
<br />
They are low-maintenance (self heal) with mend, which is hugely important.<br />
A 1500 to 2000 point heal every six minutes doesn't exactly make them 'low-maintenance'.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">The SK bitching about Shadow Knights is cracking me up.  What a joke.  <br />
<br />
Paladins and Shadow Knights need to have their aggro lock abilities nerfed a bit.  Period.  Aggro lock makes things very easy and very boring.  Giving warriors aggro lock doesn't help that problem.  <br />
<br />
If you don't do that, then warriors absolutely need a boost.  <br />
<br />
Sullon, the taunt button is probably best pressed only if the tank does not have aggro.  But that's a dicey proposition.  The tank needs to anticipate when he might lose aggro, because you don't want to keep waiting to lose aggro/get aggro ping pong about.  It's not so simple as it sounds to simply say, &quot;press taunt until you get aggro, don't press it until you lose aggro&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I have a 65 warrior, he's a gnome and not overly pimped in gear (8k in hps), has a blackout in off hand and a sword of the blood sworn in primary. He has a collection of 2hds from TOV and some other places. Mainly I use the 1hers though for the procs.<br />
<br />
Warrior Taunt is all about the people he groups with. PERIOD... No really PERIOD...<br />
I have been in groups with 3 rogues and never lost aggro once, then I can get another group and for some wierd reason I have to fight to get aggro... The only difference is the people I group with.<br />
<br />
Namely some people, aka rogues think they should never use evade unless they get aggro. A GOOD rogue will use evade just to lower him/her self on the aggro list.<br />
<br />
To the first poster.<br />
If you have a warrior in your group why are you auto slowing on inc, he's a warrior hopefully he has some HP's if not get a new warrior, but let him take the beating for a few seconds then slow... He's not a Pally/SK and doesn't need a slow to survive, you are only slowing mobs to allow the cleric to regain mana... (unless your pally/SK is in time gear with 10k hps and something stupid like that...)<br />
<br />
You could always remove the hybrid channeling skill from them...:) that would fix their auto aggro abilities when getting hit...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">If I am not entirely mistaken, a succesful taunt adds +1 to the aggro of the person currently on the top of the aggro list. <br />
<br />
Example (all numbers are completely fictional): Mob is in camp, warrior has landed hits equivalent of, say, 100 points of aggro. Shaman bounces slow, giving him 400 points of aggro. Now is the time for the warrior to press Taunt. IF the warrior taunts succesfully, he now has 401 points worth of aggro and the mob will turn on him once again. If not, he will have to work up aggro the old fashioned way until taunt pops again. If he now has aggro, there is no point in pressing taunt because he would only gain 1 point of aggro with the button.<br />
<br />
I really dont care what kind of tank I have - I know how to watch my aggro and will adjust within the first 3 or 4 kills. I consider it an integral part of playing and knowing my class.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Nerfing Knights doesn't help.  There are few melee skills in the game that are worth anything.  The moment you stick a player in melee range of the monster you take on a big cost.  This coupled with the increased strength of casters made dealing damage at range so much better than melee.<br />
<br />
The class that took the brunt of this was Warriors.  The moment you don't need a Warrior to tank, what is left?  This doesn't have anything to do with Paladins or SKs.  This seems to be an issue about Warrior skills instead of Paladin/SK nerfage.<br />
<br />
Warriors for sure need a boost.  I would like to see new skills and actions for them to take.  Monks need some spursing up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I agree with Icklymuk .. I played my lvl 57 warrior this weekend on 2 LDoN groups.  One of the groups I kept aggro 99.9% of the time and the other group all the rogue would have to do is get close to the mob and he would get aggro=)  <br />
<br />
Chanters get a spell which they can cast on others to give aggro increase .. I think other should as well or add this as a proc to weaps in the form of an augment.  This would be a way to increase aggro without nerfing anyone.<br />
<br />
BTW classes dont make LDoN useless .. it does it all by itself.  Seriously I have yet to be in a dungeon group which was challenging, and I'm talking groups with no chanter or mezzer at all.  They are truly worthless and sure they are new contient .. but its the same BS different texture.  Maybe I need to up the difficulty .. Getting through another LDoN run is like getting an AA, which I still dont understand why thats some major feat.  Why should I gratz someone who just grinded through lvl 51 when they are getting 2-5% of AA per kill.  Woopee your so cool .. 2 hours later, woope your so cool.  Final brain-fart the only good thing about LDoN I have seen so far is the ability to slow down peoples lvl progression because I have never seen so much wasted time before in my life.

Sorry, we forget that all the casters should just get to sit there and suck up exp without doing anything. If you're too damn lazy to control your aggro (once a *basic* game skill), then maybe you're just too lazy to play.<br />
<br />
I agree that the problem isnt with warriors, it's with other people being too lazy or stupid to know how to play with a warrior. A warrior can gain snap aggro - I do it all the time with my warrior. Warriors can also hold aggro the duration of the fight if you know how taunt works. I hold aggro through slow, snare, tash, complete heal, etc. It's when the idiot who just slowed it immediately sits down because he thinks he's good as gold that the mob ping pongs. That's not a warrior problem - that's a stupid shaman problem. How many times have we pointed that very thing out to new shamans here who were asking for advice on how to be a better shaman? So what was the point of telling that new shaman to stand next to the MT when slowing or wait a few seconds before sitting down after a slow, if that's not *his* responsibility?<br />
<br />

Oh, please. Hardly ever do you see a warrior bitching and moaning about shadowknights. Most of the time, you get your aggro from your spells that add direct hate. This is the way they were designed. You guys are absolutely awesome in groups, and in raids. Your buffs that add a hate modifier are a god send, but a band aid. I recall SOE saying that hate procs were a band-aid until they fixed the way the taunt button works. Apparently they are still trying to work on that. Our &quot;glory in raids&quot; is for 3 minutes, and for one warrior only. What about the other 4-5 warriors on the raid? They do nothing but sit there and pray to their deity they get aggro should the MT die. But most of the time, if your MT dies, you wipe. To be honest, I hate defensive. I hate it. It's the only thing I ever get chosen for on raids. If defensive isn't required, why have a warrior with inferior DPS (shadowknights) or inferior aggro (shadowknights and paladins)? Warriors have no beef with shadowknights, or at least in the lines of aggro. Itemization is another thing, but that's not the point of this.</div></div><hr />

I never sit down and when I see a shaman doing this he is either boxed, doesn't know what Canni is or just sucks because he doesn't know what a macro is.  Another thing that dinks me off if when a shammy makes the group wait for him to canns between fights ... there should be requirments for shaman =)  Real shaman dont sit and med .. if you do I feel bad for your group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">All this talk about nerfing is making me sick.  Please stop the nerf talk.<br />
<br />
So you know where I am coming from, I have played a warrior to 41, shaman to 40, an SK to 56, a cleric to 54, and every other class to 20 - 30 (I have a newbie disease).<br />
<br />
In my experience warriors have it the worst of any other class (right now).  They are dependent on others to get around and survive.  They are dependent on gear more than most.  I deleted my 41st level warrior out of frustration over the problems with the warrior class.  While I felt I had the skill, it just was a PITA to always ask for a port or a sow, get nearly killed by greens while running to a group, never being able to do anything without a group, and always needing to buy better equipment.  PoP changed the travel issues, but warriors still have my sympathy.<br />
<br />
SKs and Pali's do not need agro nerfs.  Low cost agro spells make sense.  By nerfing them, you make knights dependent on mana buffs, the issue will not be solved that easily.  Warriors need an angro enhancer, period.  Their taunt needs to be more than just a taunt, or they need an extra skill.  As masters of combat warriors need to be able to appear more ferocious to the enemy than they really are (read innate taunt modifier).  Much like the SK agro modifier spells (&quot;voice of&quot; series), warriors should just produce more agro.  Just like SKs have a spell that mimics the FD ability of monks, why not give warriors an innate ability (based on level) that mimics the argo modifier spells of SKs?  Don't like that?  Then how about a skill that the warrior can use that uses up his stamina and generates agro?  This would make the stamina regenerating spells have a little extra value.  Something, anything, that makes warriors the best all around tanks, since that is really all they can do.<br />
<br />
Before the knights start bitching about then being second in ability to take damage, and last in dealing damage (of the tank classes), and only be first in agro management, think for one second.  If you want to be the best, be a warrior, if you want to have fun, survive outside a group for more than 1 minute, for short bursts be more than the warrior could ever hope to be, have more overall utility, and have cool spells, then be a knight.  Let the warriors have first crack at groups, knights can solo some flies in PoD, while the warriors have to pluck daisies in PoK while looking for a group.<br />
<br />
Warriors should not have to be highly skilled just to match a &quot;bad&quot; knight.  A skilled knight should be able to out tank a &quot;bad&quot; warrior.  A skilled warrior should be able to out tank a &quot;bad&quot; knight.  Right now, based on my experience, warriors just can't match a knight unless the knight buffs them, or helps them build the agro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Talking about nerfing is NOT a bad thing<br />
Yes, it is.  Suggesting a nerf for a class you don't play can only generate bad blood.  If you've played a Palidan to 65 and still think they need to be nerfed, then by all means you have a right to speak on the subject.  Otherwise you are only instigating an interclass flame war.  And you are literally speaking from a position of ignorance.<br />
<br />
Knights have their weaknesses as do any other class. We have it pretty good as shamans.  Any other class could make a compelling arguement as to why we should be nerfed.  <br />
<br />
My main used to be a ranger. Playing a ranger I realized the innate strengths and weaknesses of the class.  Every time I'd check any random eq message board (other than the Glade) I'd find &quot;NERF RANGERS11!!1!&quot; spattered about by people who obviously didn't understand how situational ranger damage is. How weak they are until level 59+, and how mediocre they actually are at soloing pre 60.  All they knew was ranger's had all these nifty utility spells and could do a heck of alot of damage after level 60 and 45 AA's.<br />
<br />
Every time Sony Nerf's a class, they invariably screw them up.  Example Monks: Still not fixed...even after their &quot;fix&quot; a few months ago.  <br />
<br />
Why would you call for a nerf to a class that was underpowered (yes pre pop knights were WAY underpowered), then fixed. Now you want them broken again?  Look at SOE's track record with &quot;fixing&quot; classes. Who would benefit? No one.  Let's look at what might happen if Palidan's and knight's lose high agro.  Now what are they good for? They don't have warrior hitpoints, and don't do enough sustatained damage to be called a DPS class.  So let's see, why did we invite them into our group again? Guess they'd better solo...oh, wait, palidans suck at soloing ---&gt; Pre-PoP knights.<br />
<br />
Well wouldn't that be nice.  I think it would be far healthier to focus on getting warriors balanced rather than getting knights nerfed.</div></div><hr />

Cleric: Maybe ok DPS in undead gigs ... druids can port, nuke and heal. Porting alone cuts time to run back to camp thus more time for adventures.<br />
<br />
Who wins?<br />
Paladin: Hands down superior tank to anything, great DPS in undead gigs.<br />
SK: Pet + SK + snare = one nasty DPS class that can take a lot of punishment.<br />
Druid: Very nice heals, nice nukes, ports.<br />
Beastlord: Very nice slow, insane DPS, great utility spells.<br />
<br />
Who's underrated?<br />
Necros: Nice group heals, undead slow, great DPS.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">&gt;&gt;Suggesting a nerf for a class you don't play can only generate bad blood.  If you've played a Palidan to 65 and still think they need to be nerfed, then by all means you have a right to speak on the subject. &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
We're not speaking like we have no idea what the problem is. THere IS a problem and it needs to be addressed/<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Knights have their weaknesses as do any other class. We have it pretty good as shamans.  Any other class could make a compelling arguement as to why we should be nerfed.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Knights don't HAVE any weaknesses. Unless you consider DPS, and paladins say they made a paladin &quot;to tank&quot;, not to do DPS. So it's just clashing claims.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;My main used to be a ranger. Playing a ranger I realized the innate strengths and weaknesses of the class.  Every time I'd check any random eq message board (other than the Glade) I'd find &quot;NERF RANGERS11!!1!&quot; spattered about by people who obviously didn't understand how situational ranger damage is. How weak they are until level 59+, and how mediocre they actually are at soloing pre 60.  All they knew was ranger's had all these nifty utility spells and could do a heck of alot of damage after level 60 and 45 AA's.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I don't recall anyone being serious about nerfing rangers with exception to pre-Kunark. Rangers were warriors with spells, and warriors needed a boost to compensate.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Every time Sony Nerf's a class, they invariably screw them up.  Example Monks: Still not fixed...even after their &quot;fix&quot; a few months ago. &lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Mana burn NEEDED to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Why would you call for a nerf to a class that was underpowered (yes pre pop knights were WAY underpowered), then fixed. Now you want them broken again?  Look at SOE's track record with &quot;fixing&quot; classes. Who would benefit? No one.  Let's look at what might happen if Palidan's and knight's lose high agro.  Now what are they good for? They don't have warrior hitpoints, and don't do enough sustatained damage to be called a DPS class.  So let's see, why did we invite them into our group again? Guess they'd better solo...oh, wait, palidans suck at soloing ---&gt; Pre-PoP knights.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Guess what? Paladins have had snap aggro since Velious. They have had within 15% of warrior hitpoints since Skyshrine armour. Claiming that just because knights won't have snap aggro they won't get groups is wrong. Because right now, that's the current situation for warriors. We bring nothing that paladins don't. But oh wait, we can go defensive for 3 minutes to justify the permanent superiority of knights. Just because we want knights to be put back in their place (see secondary tanks). But I guess all the nifty spells don't do ****, right?<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Well wouldn't that be nice.  I think it would be far healthier to focus on getting warriors balanced rather than getting knights nerfed.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
Getting rid of snap aggro is one of the first steps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shadowknight aggro is silly stupid easy. They get taunt. And Clinging darkness. And Feign death. And tons of othre things to control aggro.<br />
<br />
Snap aggro has always been part of the Kinghts ability (Circa Disease cloud and the First stun spells.)<br />
<br />
What has changed was the ability of Knights to take the beats almost as well as a warrior , and much more importantly Mana regen.<br />
<br />
If you would make the knights have to burn level appropriate spells the knight would have to think about mana and Spell choices.<br />
<br />
As it is right now. A group can funtion with a knight as a tank with more efficiancy than a warrior. In all cases except for a defensive needed Mob, PLus bringing to the table utility, Paladins can res. What can warriors do to match that? Can warriors Add 325 hps to all 6 players? Nope. Or What about Symbol and AC buffs. <br />
<br />
Can a warrior Feign death? 95 percent as good as a SK? Nope. How about situationally. ? Nope. Can a warrior Heal the group? Or in the figts themselves heal themselves to save some mana? How about give mana to the rest of the group?<br />
<br />
Not one damn bit. <br />
<br />
That is the part that is broken. Knights have alot they can do. And still tank damn well. But they ignore that warriors can do nothing except tank.<br />

For Shadowknights, yes. Which is why few warriors complain of Shadowknights taking over their groups.<br />
<br />
We understand that Shadowknights have hate spells and DoT spells, which are good aggro.<br />
<br />
However, stuns were not made to have aggro.<br />

Paladins still tank just as well as a warrior on high risk.  Clerics, bards, and shamans &quot;RULE&quot; high risk.  Throw any plate tank or a monk in a group with those three classes I just named, grab two more classes, and you're set.</div></div><hr />

Keep telling yourself this...frontal DPS for a monk is still the suq and reposits still hurt (twice as bad if your duel wielding monk).  Monks have no way of holding onto agro so tanking really is a null and void subject for monks.  Offtaking is not needed when you have a rooter who can park a mob or a enchanter, necro, or bard who can mez the adds.  mend pops once every 6 minutes and with my buffed HP's that is roughly 1200 HP heal once every 6 minutes against mobs who even slowed will put out that much damage in 30 seconds.  (LDoN Mobs hit for roughtly 275 to 300 range for level 65 adventure).  Actually the same disc I use in PoP I use in LDoN, /stonestance (if you played a monk you would know that too, but I digress)<br />
<br />
About the only things monks have is pulling and sub-rogue DPS, sub-Druid tankability and their skills at overcoming the &quot;underdog&quot; class and making themselves just shy of useful.<br />
<br />
If you truely believe monks are that good you need to create one...but for now go back to playing your druid or bard who can solo 4 mobs in PoV AT THE SAME TIME, while at 65 with max AA I could not even hope to get one of them mobs below 90% before being forced to FD.<br />
<br />
Click your heals together 3 times and say &quot;Classes are not that out of balence, and Everything is working as intended&quot; 3 times...perhaps you are the one brainwashed by SoE proppaganda.<br />

Well I'm biased since I'm a bard. A monk in my group has &gt;100 extra atk, and 90% haste from songs. In my groups they sure as hell put out ****loads of DPS. They do slight worse in bard-less groups, but overall monks are very good sustained DPS (with shm haste+buffs), esp if you toss in a bard, ranger/bst (atk buffs), or SK/nec (atk taps). Occasional ripostes of 100-200 (on these gimp mobs) doesnt hurt much lol, a maximum of one quiescence per 2 mobs is the most you'll need (they have mend dont forget). It's only debatable in groups without shm, bard, sk, nec, ranger, or beast and even then it's iffy.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Offtaking is not needed when you have a rooter who can park a mob or a enchanter, necro, or bard who can mez the adds. <br />
<br />
Wrong. Mez/root is not needed when you can offtank. The best and/or fastest mission completion groups don't use mez or root. Those are for sub-optimal groups. These mobs are so gimp when AE slowed that with some form of regen anyone can tank. A necro can VERY easily lifetap tank them for example.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;LDoN Mobs hit for roughtly 275 to 300 range for level 65 adventure<br />
<br />
Huh? Get some AA. Pop mobs hit me for 100 or so average, and I'm a mere bard. This will apply to monks with &lt;70aa sure, but with 1 other regen class, a high AAed monk will need only about 1 quiescence every 2 mobs max. Don't underestimate regen.<br />
<br />
LDoN completely reverses traditional roles. In some of the best LDoN groups, there are no mezzes, no roots, and no target heals.</div></div><hr />

Under those conditions, a warrior, shadow knight, or beastlord will have &quot;very good sustained DPS&quot;. Not to mention the rogues and rangers, or the paladins in an undead theme. No real win for the monk there. Ripostes range right up to 350-ish, and are only occasional if you're swinging a 2hb, which isn't exactly an optimal decision if you're trying to generate aggro for off-tanking.<br />

<br />
Wrong. Offtanking is less efficient than Mez/Root. It requires more mana than a concentration of force approach. Sure, it's still a perfectly viable apporach, but it didn't somehow become better to heal the damage generated by three mobs than by one over the course of a fight.<br />

<br />
Of course mobs don't hit you as hard as they do a monk. Monk mitigation is even worse than that of a &quot;mere&quot; bard. Trust me, even with 100+ AA (focused on defensive AAs too) you still see many, many hits for max daamge. If you're tanking, it's more like a CH every mob to every two mobs depending on how kind the RNG is. How do I know? Well, I played that 100+ AAed level 65 monk in a normal difficulty dungeon as the main tank. Try it sometime, monks aren't what you think they are. <br />
<br />
I do find it funny that you claim that monks are excellent off tanks, and then proceed to point out that a necromancer can do the exact same thing.</div></div><hr />

You must be in Dreadlands or something, since the weakest mobs in PoP hit for 150-160 max, and that's in PoJ.<br />

There's no way you're in normal Tier 1 or higher groups getting hit for 100 on average. 200 I could see, but 100 is just absurd.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">SKs and Pali's do not need agro nerfs. Low cost agro spells make sense. By nerfing them, you make knights dependent on mana buffs, the issue will not be solved that easily. Warriors need an angro enhancer, period.<br />
<br />
The problem is that in the high level, mana buffs are a given.  As such, the spells used by high level knights need to be balanced accordingly.  They are not currently.  A knight should be dependent on mana regen, just like any other spell caster is.  Spells should be an option that increases their power, but with a cost...downtime.  This is more of an issue with paladins than Knights.  The paladin spells serve a double function.  Not only do they generate great aggro, but they let the paladin tank easier (stunned mobs don't hit you) and cover up the results of failing to get aggro (heals).  Heal cost is fine.  But stuns need a bump up.<br />
<br />
Suggesting a nerf for a class you don't play can only generate bad blood. If you've played a Palidan to 65 and still think they need to be nerfed, then by all means you have a right to speak on the subject. <br />
<br />
I play a high level paladin and I think, yes, their aggro ability needs to be nerfed a bit.  It's just too easy.  The only thing keeping the paladin class even moderately in check is that there is no other class that has a higher percentage of bad players in it.  Not because the class is hard to play that most underplay.  Because the class is overpowered that most never need to learn how to play.  Hand a paladin character to a non-paladin player and most of the time, the character becomes more useful as non-paladins are much quicker to use all the potential of a paladin.<br />
<br />
Wrong. Offtanking is less efficient than Mez/Root. It requires more mana than a concentration of force approach. Sure, it's still a perfectly viable apporach, but it didn't somehow become better to heal the damage generated by three mobs than by one over the course of a fight.<br />
<br />
Not true.  The cost of mezzing 2 mobs while you kill 1 is typically 3 mezzes.  Given Apathy, which costs 200 mana, that's 600 spent.  If the damage those 2 additional mobs would do during the time from when they are mez'd to when it is their turn to be broken out of mez is less than 600 mana spent on heals worth, it's more effecient to off tank them.  That ignores factors like damage shields, AEs, enchanter nukes being more effecient than cleric ones versus the living, time it takes people to taunt, cast a spell before breaking mez, and that sort of thing.  It also ignores how quickly you kill a mob.  The faster you do so, the less mana effecient a mez cast is, the less damage you'd have needed to heal.<br />
<br />
Sometimes mez is effecient.  Especially when dealing with multiple CHers.  Sometimes it isn't.  The better the gear of your party, the less worthwhile it is.  Just like Slow.  <br />
<br />
I'm a chanter and I offtank LDoN normal mobs from time to time.  My basic rule even when I do mez is the tank gets 1 taunt, 1 spell, and he'd better be hitting the mob.  If he doesn't, I will.<br />
<br />
Pallys rez .. 90 vs 96 .. I'll wait in 99% of the situations for the 96.<br />
<br />
You do realize that in the time you waited, you could have easily made that 6% and more back?  It's stupid to not take a 90% rez when offered unless the cleric is standing right next to the paladin or you're not going to be doing anything for the next chunk of time anyway.<br />
<br />
That said, I have to disagree about warriors being worthless in LDoN.  As long as the warrior has a brain (knows how to taunt, chooses good weapons) they do fine.  A bit of loss of aggro control is no big deal in LDoN.  Mobs don't hit hard enough for it to really matter.  It's in PoP where they hurt, where caster mana regen is higher due to horses, the ability to stun a mob for 4+ seconds prevents more damage, and losing control of a mob, especially an unslowed mob, can get non-tanks hurt badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Brutul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Something to keep in mind.  LDoN is not PoP.  Aggro management is not crucial.  Slowing on inc is not crucial.  A decently geared warrior is not going to die if a LDoN mob doesn't get slowed immediately.  A shaman is not going to die tanking a slowed mob for a while.  Every group I have done with a cleric they were nuking/meleeing all the way through, so it's not a cleric mana issue.  Last night in mistmoore our shaman was tanking two slowed mobs at once with quiessence up and not even losing health.  If tanking after a resisted slow is a problem for you then get some ornate pants and root while your spell gems are refreshing after the slow resist.  <br />
<br />
Now I agree that if there's a paladin and warrior with equal gear your mission will probably go better with the paladin, but unless the rest of your group is totally clueless, it's not going to be the difference between a win and a loss, and if the warrior is there now and the paladin is 3 zones away or the paladin is in crap gear, you would probably be better off picking up the warrior.  Warriors can tank just fine, and with minimal effort from the group they can hold aggro nearly flawlessly as well.  <br />
<br />
I agree that warriors and paladins are not currently balanced in exp groups, but I hate to hear the &quot;warriors suck&quot; BS going around, because that's just what it is, BS.  A LDoN group with a warrior tank is completely viable.  I do a couple adventures every night and haven't lost one yet.  They are completely trivial.  If the difference between a paladin and warrior in your group is the difference between winning and losing then your group was pretty weak to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">They really don't.<br />
<br />
But the problem is much like the shaman problem. Others get massive upgrades and we are given the normal 2% upgrade.<br />
<br />
A warrior should be the king of fighters. Because that is all they bring to the table. A warrior And a paladin are withen maybe 5% of tanking ability (until Defensive is engadged) But the Paladin has Anotehr 75% of Cleric ability under the table. Sure much of that isnt used when a cleric is in the group due to stacking But all of that certainly doesnt come out in the wash you know.<br />
<br />
Warriors Need a boost. And In my eyes Low level Extra cheap aggro spells should stop being the aggro maker of choice. If A Knight wants aggro lock make them burn for it, so that way the game becomes a bit more like of old.. A challange of gear choices spell loadouts and group makeup.<br />
<br />
Rather than No paladins available, okay take the warrior.<br />
<br />
Paladins and warriors are not equal not by any means. Paladins and shadowknights are winning that race now.<br />

They could still get the usage of their spells as long as they aren't being beaten on. This would have zero effect on their utility line of spells, including their combat spells(as long as they controll aggro).<br />
This approach would simply remove their ability to channel through direct combat, in essence making them rely on their taunt button much like warriors do.</div></div><hr />

Purdy, have you played a warrior?  I play both a 59 warrior and 52 shaman, and comparing 'gimpiness' it isn't even close!!!  My 52 shaman is a huge benefit to pretty much any group (including my warriors regular 58+ grp.)  However, my warrior can only be a benefit to a group if they adjust their playing styles for agro management accordingly (read lower dps, wait on slows, in general accomplish less in the same time period than if a pally or sk was filling my role.)  My shaman has a fungi and JBB and the rest of the gear cost about 10k.  I've got about 250k in gear on my warrior.  I use a GSoT for agro, but I will never get an EB item (no, I'm not saving another 250k for a single wpn.)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying warriors are completely broken (although I do think ldon hurt quite a bit by closing the gap with the knights even more), but to compare the utility of a shaman to a warrior...sheesh, at least make a credible argument!!<br />
<br />
By the way, /shield is an ability warriors get around lvl 30...it's not an aa.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From day one, warriors have been totally dependant upon gear, nothing has changed there.  The real difficulty is that knights tanking ability has over expansions caught up with warriors'.  To me, thats where the improvements to warriors need to be, tanking ability.  Utility is what knights hang their hats upon, tanking *should be* an obvious advantage for warriors.  Additional hp and ac either innate, via AA's or improved warrior only equipment seems appropriate.<br />
A narrow range of abilities is the price to pay for being the best in that one area, and examples abound.  Consider the wizard.  The best at nukes, with almost no other abilities.  But a well equipped, well AA'd mage can get pretty close to wizard nukes, but with the addition of awesome pets.  Outside of situations where ch is required, druids make almost as good of healers as clerics.  In all situations where mobs are magic slowable, enchanters are almost as good as shaman.<br />
Consider the new weapons that have been dropping recently.  The hammer from droga, Delightful something or other from ldon, proc augments.  Some attention has been paid to aggro weapons for mid level people, whether or not it makes the difference in the long run, only time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Hi there, oh I understand perfectly about warrior agro issues since I am usually the one getting the whooping!  But, you know shaman depend on equipment also - we need good hit points to be able to use canny5 safely and enough ac to avoid getting smacked around.<br />
<br />
I feel for the warriors, I feel for the druids (even though its getting better).  I go out of my way to invite both of these classes in my groups because I know they are having LFG issues.  The worst thing in Everquest is sitting around waiting to get a group - nothing else compares.<br />
<br />
Personally I feel that classes are balanced when there is no excessive LFG.  Its not about xheal or xnuke, etc. its about getting a group. Warriors were having a horrible time in POP getting a group because the mobs hit the &quot;support staff&quot; too darn hard.  My point on warriors getting &quot;relatively&quot; better in LDON stems in large part to the moderate smacking ability of the mobs.  I have played LDON a lot and I have not seen that many warriors going LFG like they were in BOT or Tactics a few months ago.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that warriors are equal to Pally/SK currently, but they don't suck as bad as peeps think or what the folks at the Steel Warrior are crying about.  Heck I even posted on the Steel Warrior board that I thought maybe an increase in DPS might be a reasonable alternative to help bridge the gap and I was roasted alive (last time I try posting there).  I just don't think Sony will screw with warrior taunt because the raids are tuned for it and they probably don't want to re-tune everything.<br />

Warriors do indeed need some help.   Screaming for the nerfing of the knight class is totally silly and shows HUGE ignorance of history.<br />

Nerfing a class that has slowly grown from a useless class to very nicely balanced one would show that there will never be hope of &quot;balance&quot;.

(spoken as a 65 monk, 60 SK, 65 shaman, 50 warrior, and others)<br />
<br />
Warriors accross the board get a 5-10% damage increase (along the lines of moving them to the monk damage charts but not that high (or ideally perhaps nudge monks slightly they are as others mentioned slacking a bit with LDoN comparitively).<br />
<br />
<br />
Give warriors an Ability (not AA) of /harass.<br />
This is a toggle ability (I.E. turned on or off, not timed).  When on the warrior does 10% less damage.  The advantage however is that ANY hit does 10% more aggro (based on original damage) in regards to taunt.<br />
<br />
Example.  Warrior hits for 100 points of damage.<br />
If warrior had /harass on.  The damage done would be 90 (10% less), but it would count as 110 damage (10% more of actual) for taunt.<br />
<br />
The actual values could be balanced allitle and the 10% (each way) just seem rougly 'about right' to me.<br />
<br />
This way even as 'secondary' melee  Warriors would have an option (though in truth Rogues or Monks should be preferred for DPS) yet if Main Tank, by sacrificing a litlte damage output, they can get a much higher 'taunt' factor.<br />
<br />
I would also buy giving a warrior /warcry (as either dicipline or AA).  With a few minute (3-6 minute) re-use, that is a AE taunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Zybann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">they have frequently revamped warriors to make them more desirable.  It seems their only purpose these days is to be an MT on major mobs.  Not knowing what they could do to remain in limits of the game, but one thing they shouldnt do is nerf pallys/sk's. thats just insane. So they cast constantly, with low mana spells mind  you. Being a shaman, to keep mana we have to use canni, but we do so much more casting, buffing/slowing/hasting/nuking at times.  Having a 65 cleric, in PoP, I was always FM, and could heal forever.  Why shouldnt sk/pally's.  The warrior class needs something.  Better attack, taunt, although some of those ae taunts are quite effective.  I had 1 bub of health after a heal with my cleric and the tank ae taunted and the mobs got off me. I thought i was dead being low hp agro, but both mobs jumped off me and on to him. Maybe an added skill is needed to enhance them.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Given:<br />
1) Three mezzes total 600 mana from the chanter.<br />
2) Three mobs, each dealing equivalent damage in the amount of time it would take your group to kill it. Let this damage be known as X<br />
3) Each melee, when tanking, will maintain aggro lock. Possibly unrealistic, but it simplifies the equation, and provides a bigger advantage to the off-tanking scenario than to the mezing scenario (do you want one mob rampaging around uncontrolled or three?)<br />
<br />
Now, suppose you mez two of the three mobs, your tank will take roughly 3*X in damage. You cleric heals 3*X damage, and your chanter spends 600 mana to cast three mezzes.<br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you decide to offtank each of the other mobs, the time required to kill each mob is tripled (one third of the group damaging each one), thus the mob's total damage output is also tripled. Each mob now does 3*X damage, for a total of 9*X damage dealt over the course of the fight.<br />
<br />
Thus the cleric has to heal 9*X damage, or three times the damage that he would have to if the chanter had mezzed. <br />
Allow Y to be the cleric's cost to heal X damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
In order for the total mana expenditure to be the same, 3*Y + 600 must equal 9*Y.<br />
Thus Y = 100. As long as your cleric spends less than 100 mana per mob on your tank (one CH every 4 mobs), it's efficient to offtank.<br />

Naturally, AE groups are a little different ;)</div></div><hr />

Warriors already have warcry. I am not suprised that you haven't heard of it as it is one of the useless class level aa's(group fear immunity for a few seconds at a cost of 18 aa's with a refresh time of over an hour).<br />

Purdy, I have to admit, if you actually believe what you post, we must be complete opposites.  Druids having it bad?? Before ldon it was hard to get a group as a druid below 58th lvl, but since ldon druids are now wanted in groups again...at pretty much any lvl.  Not to mention, druids can get better xp solo than a group can - especially if you include downtime forming a group, taking time for afk's, etc.  Warriors are only wanted if the grp can't find enough quality pally's or sk's.  Warriors are also very dependent on having the proper supporting cast in order to add to a group - the need slow, haste, someone to help with pulls if multiple mobs in agro range, etc.  (Note:  I'm only referring to non-raiding 50's characters/groups because I don't raid and all my characters are in their 50's)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Theres no reason to change damage tables for any of the Melee classess. This isn't whats broken.<br />
<br />
The correct Fix for the &quot;Aggro Lock&quot; issue would be to remove the SK/Paladin ability to channel. <br />
<br />
This would destroy their ablity to channel through being hit, but would have zero impact on any of their other abilities... They would infact rely just like warriors do on their taunt buttons, if they wanted to maintain constant aggro with a mob. regaining Aggro would still be a specialty of Paladins, and any mob that ran off to smack an enchanter could be stunned, and retauned back to the Paladin... What you would remove is the sure bet pattern...<br />
<br />
Insta aggro was already Nerfed once for SK's (Desease Cloud Nerf). It can only be a matter of time before it is taken away from the Paladins. It is coming...</div></div><hr />

I keep wonder, &quot;Why do they want to make melee weaker than it is now?&quot;  What melee tactics are worth anything compared to watch casters can accomplish at range?<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell the calls for nerfs are just ill will class envy.  Giving Warriors new skills and tactics is the correct fix.  It has nothing to do with Knight being too strong and everything to do with Warriors having too few skills to handle POP style monsters.  Goofing around with channel is a bad idea which will force Casters to find ways to exp WITHOUT a tank at all (even more than they do now).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a warrior, and I guess I'm the only one that feels that it's fun to be on the bottom, still fairly successful, and get to look forward to some future improvement, hooray!  The addition of LDoN proc augments help to obtain aggro faster than ever before.  There are also more aggro weapons available now than ever before, at every level of the game.  +taunt mods are also very helpful in some situations, and LDoN adventures are prime candidates.  The +10% taunt mod helmet from griegs effectively maxes a warrior's taunt skill to 252 (max).  In my experience, this makes taunt about 80% successful as opposed to 50% or so without it on exp-type mobs.<br />
<br />
I have played a friend's 65 pally a few times in exp groups, and I find myself laughing maniacally the whole time because I have such super god-like aggro.  It's a good thing I don't have this all the time as a warrior, or I might suffer some debilitating injury.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I have no problem with knights being superior tanks in exp groups.  It gives them something to do.  With AA's, I find my dps already encroaching on monk dps, and I don't think that's good.  With droga weapons, greatstaffofthunder, and proc augs, I don't think warriors will be able to complain too much.  If nukers/druid/necro choose to aggro, let them die.<br />
<br />
I'm confidant that 5 warriors and 1 cleric (or one shaman for that matter) could pretty consistantly beat normal LDoN adventures.  I have yet to find a group makeup that didn't work yet, and I'm enjoying the no cc, zerg groups the best!<br />
<br />
As a warrior, what do I want?  I want something on which to use all this damn mana that SOE insists giving me.  If I have to pay the same price for it as a pally/sk, I want to be able to do something with it.  Some additional aggro/taunt ability that used mana and only worked on up to level 65 mobs would be fine and not-unbalancing.<br />

Two thought experiments for ya:<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
<br />
Step 1) Paladin is tanking a mob.  Paladin has no channelling skill, hence cannot cast spells.<br />
<br />
Step 2) Paladin loses aggro.  Mob turns away and stops hitting paladin.<br />
<br />
Step 3) Paladin casts Stun spell.  Paladin is not being hit, so does not need to make a channelling roll.<br />
<br />
Step 4) Paladin has aggro.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2:<br />
<br />
Step 1) Shadowknight is being chased by 3 or 4 mobs.<br />
<br />
Step 2) Shadowknight casts Feign Death, a spell with a 1.5 second cast time.<br />

The solution is to take defensive from warriors, replace it with something moderately useful that won't be used as an excuse to screw them over for the next 3 years, and boost their innate mitigation by 35% or so. <br />
<br />
That way their current meaningless mitigation superiority gains some value, without affecting knights' aggro advantage..and with no defensive the impact on raid level encounters is marginal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">I like Jharassik's idea - make Warriors the Kings of Damage mitigation. I don't think any Paladin would have a problem with that. Take away Defensive and give them half of that naturally, without any decreased DPS. Then give them some other Abilities to play with. Knights have spells they specialize in (stuns, buffs, nukes, heals, etc...) why shouldn't all pure melee benefit from their own natural, non-mana skills and abilities? /Shield was a good start, give them something else, even if it's just for ****s and giggles. Disciplines were a good idea, but poorly implemented. Maybe use disciplines as innate abilities - +10 to all resist bonus for reaching 51, slight increase in fear resist for 54, and so on. Maybe not the full /disc, but something innate just for attaining the level. A Warrior at Defensive level getting an innate damage absorption bonus would be nice, and would allow them to be even less of a mana drain while waiting to slow, nuke, etc... it won't solve the issue of snap aggro, but it could be a step in the right direction, putting Warriors once again ahead of Knights as the King of damage absorption. Maybe even a further HP Bonus per level?</div></div><hr />

Bump up war melee damage by 10% across the board, allow them to assume their rightful place as kings of face-to-face dps and I think the aggro issues and desireability issues will resolve themselves.  Wars need help, but they aren't so horribly broken that other classes need to be gutted to balance things out.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that gimping knights wouldn't do a thing to address the (legitimate) concerns that wars have, it would just give them company in the unemployment line and make shamans the only logical choice for xp group tankage.  I think shamans have enough to do already.</div></div><hr />

As a note, Clinging Darkness and Fear (when mobs are over 55) is as much or more agro then disease cloud. SKs have as much or more instant agro due to their pure hate lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">Well before you remove channelling (very very bad idea imo), if this is the route you wanted to go, I would say remove the Knights ability to cast between swings.<br />
<br />
This would still allow the knight to 'get' the spell off while getting pounded (a very centric point to a knight, if anything a knight should have a channelling skill HIGHER than a pure), but would cut down on the on the chain casting of little (mana wise) spells between swings since it would cut into DPS.<br />
<br />
Personally as an admitedly (non-uber) 65 monk, 65 shaman, 60 sk, 49 warrior (......)  I do not think this is the way to go.  DPS / 'tankage' / increased taunt ability for warriors is were it should be.<br />
<br />
Personally I would say give warriors 'stances'<br />
<br />
'Aggressive'  This stance results in a 10% increase in DPS and a 5% reduction to damage avoidance.  (geared to secondary tanks when NOT off-tanking to help increase their DPS, they should do more damage than a knight)<br />
<br />
'Protective' This gives a 10% increase to damage mitigation at a 5% cost to damge done.  (For the <br />
<br />
'Normal'  As currently is, but ALL damage done by warrior adds taunt as if 10% more (basically give Warriors a 'built-in' verision of aggro enhancer line) <br />
<br />
This way warriors get a little flexibilty.  <br />
<br />
If careful with aggro,  secondary tanks can go 'aggressive' and do a little more DPS (resulting in people willing to have two 'warrior' groups).<br />
<br />
If 'Main Tank' Warrrior has the choice of his 'normal' mode where he can go hold taunt better than before, with no changes in his tanking ability, or if mobs hit 'hard' has a 'always' on baby verision of /defensive, lessing damage a bit (so people have to watch aggro closer), but tanking better than any knight could hope.<br />
<br />

- Lay off the crackpipe. Druids are one of the most powerful classes for LDoN: very nice heals, very nice DPS, snare and ports to cut time traveling.  Not to mention nice AA and superb HP/Mana regen buffs for the group.<br />
<br />
And in current raid situation they complement clerics very well. We had druids in CH rotations, we have regulary RT tank druid CH rotation and so on. Not to mention when there are enough healers around they nuke damn well. Oh and PoT9 is very nice too with MGB Spirit of the Wood. <br />

<br />
In Kunark, Velious, POP -- warrior armor had greater AC and hps than the knight armors, and didn't have mana.<br />
<br />
Look at all the armor sets in LDON.  All plate classes can wear the plate armors.  So now the knights can get the same AC and hp bonuses a warrior can -- and get the advantage of extra int/wis and mana off those same pieces.<br />
<br />
The only bone they threw warriors was the anger procs.  Which leaves warriors with another proc they can hope procs as they try to lock aggro.<br />
<br />
Yes, a well equipped warrior with AA's can 'steal the spotlight' at raids... but they have to get that gear and those AA's first.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Knights shouldn't be nerfed -- so far the best idea I've seen is the 'drop defensive and add mitigation' idea.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This wasn't really a direct SK nerf... as I recall, they decreased the hate generated by Disease counters a little while after they added disease counters to slows, and slowers were getting their butts handed to them repeatedly.  Nerfing SK aggro was an unfortunate side effect.<br />
<br />
Back on topic, nerfs aren't really needed, but warriors could use a bone.  I like the &quot;stances&quot; idea. <br />

I would still rather play with a good warrior than a bad knight anyway.  I've played with SKs and Pallies recently that had trouble taking aggro off my bard, and that's pretty sad. /boggle</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Heh, Zorlac for an anti-druid post from ya, that was pretty mild.<br />
<br />
I would agree druids are more balanced then they have been in years<br />
but like most classes they could use minor tweaks.<br />
<br />
1) Removal of Out-Door Only restrictions on all non-movement (sow/soe)<br />
spells.<br />
<br />
Game has outgrown them, and like the removal of night/day necro stuff.  It should go.  This incidently would really only effect 3 Lines of Spells for Druids: Stuns, Quad Spells, Harmony<br />
<br />
2) Is not unique to druids, Its a flaw in game design.<br />
<br />
Too many groups, make a REZ (pally, necro, cleric) a priority.<br />
Because they dont want the lost time, getting back to the dungeon, or want to wait 30 minutes after the dungeon.<br />
<br />
just some possible ways around that....<br />
2a)  A spell that summons a player back to thier corpse.  NOT A REZ.  no reduction on timer.  Just a simple summon back to corpse. This summon spell could be given to a large number of classes.  Say Shaman (for thier spirit links), Druids/Wizards (for thier porting abilities), Mages (for thier summoning).  <br />
<br />
2b) Or give all classes the ability to &quot;bind affinity&quot;.  <br />
You might even need to code such a spell towork only in LDON to not unbalance the game.  Or make a small area right outside each dungeon thats like the gypsy camp in NK where melee can bind.  <br />
<br />
Either works.  Rezzes can be done after the adventure.  But even the best shaman or druid healing groups can make a simple mistake now and then and suffer a death.   Casters can bind right outside, and not have an issue.  Its silly, but true,  that many groups want a rezzer because running back is too much an issue.<br />
<br />
2c) I'd also add in a new command to the dungeons.  /eject  which would spit out any corpses near the portal.  The other sad thing is LDON forces people to wait 30 minutes before spitting thier corpse.   So bringing any combo but a rezzer means a 30 minute wait.  While this may not be a big deal for some, for others its huge because they only have limited time before they have to leave forsomething (log or raid)<br />
<br />
Like personally my guild raids around 7 pm.  Raids are mandatory.<br />
Soif its 5:30 to 6.  I can start another ((most finish in 45 to 50.  And we tend to suck up the loss if not done voluntarily))  if we have to wait for someones corpse.  Now theres just not enough time.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a few minor tweaks to Shaman as well.   I'd like more AE ability.  Specifically, I think we need an PBAE Slow.<br />
<br />
Most casting classes can use some minor tweaking.  Its the melees that need major work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">Speaking as an SK, it's never made any sense to me that I would be better at dishing out melee damage than a warrior.  I mean, that's their specialty, right?  What they do, ALL they do, is fight with weapons.  There's no good reason why they shouldn't be the best at it.  Bump up war melee damage by 10% across the board, allow them to assume their rightful place as kings of face-to-face dps and I think the aggro issues and desireability issues will resolve themselves.  Wars need help, but they aren't so horribly broken that other classes need to be gutted to balance things out.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that gimping knights wouldn't do a thing to address the (legitimate) concerns that wars have, it would just give them company in the unemployment line and make shamans the only logical choice for xp group tankage.  I think shamans have enough to do already.<br />
You're on the right track, but let me just point some things out.<br />
<br />
1. We're made to tank, not do high amounts of damage. This is what monks and rogues are for (and need a big upgrade).<br />
<br />
2. Shadowknights were made to do more damage than a warrior. This comes in the form of spells, and as such you gave up some of your mitigation and HP for them. The hate spells were made so you can tank, which is your job, too.<br />
<br />
3. We don't think we're broken (well, taunt shouldn't work a mere 55% of the time), we just think that Kngihts are overpowered. And they are. A lvl 65 paladin is a 63 war and a 40 cleric rolled into one.<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;Things That Shouldn't Happen, But Do Happen Anyway&lt;/b&gt;<br />
1. Beastlords and Rangers (minus trueshot) should NOT out damage a monk or rogue.<br />
2. Beastlords and Rangers should NOT out mitigate a monk or rogue.<br />
3. Knights should NOT come within 20% of the HPs of a equally equipped warrior. Elemental armour puts us at a 9% advantage.<br />
4. NO CLASS should out aggro a warrior with spells, except for Shadowknights using their direct hate spells.<br />
5. Druids should NOT have their CH, they should have a similar spell to that of shamans. Clerics should be significantly better at healing than either druids or shamans, but not the only class that can heal. Give both druids and shaman a 2k-2400hp heal.<br />
<br />
(I'm not that certain on caster problems, so they are left out)</div></div><hr />

There's no reason why a ranger shouldn't out-mitigate a monk IMO.  Rangers are a chain class, monks are leather.  Thicker armor = more mitigation.  The rest I agree with though.  Mitigation should be based on Plate &gt; Chain &gt; Leather &gt; Cloth, with no class modifiers.</div></div><hr />

AC should be AC no matter if you wear a dress, or wear a steel suit.<br />

There is zero reason why a Warrior with 1200 AC &gt; Ranger with 1200 AC &gt; Monk with 1200 AC &gt; Magician with 1200 AC in terms of damage tanking per second.<br />
<br />
It's just that its inherently easier to find enchanted plate with greater AC then enchanted chain or enchanted leather.   AOW legs are fine.<br />
Blessed by a god.  They should be tougher than say Mithril Field Plate<br />

Fixes: Yes Warriors, they are aggro wussies past level 50something.<br />
<br />
I would like to see a warrior be the ultimate in combat. I wanna see him run out... plant his foot sqaure in the mobs chest, while at the same time spitting a luggy in its eyes. As the mob falls back from the blow and clears its eyes the warrior takes a shot at its groin and yells out &quot;catch me B**ch!&quot;. The mob is sooo pissed by the time it get to the ambush that it wants to do nothing more than to kill the warrior. This however is not what happens. <br />
<br />
What happens is, the warrior runs out and hits a mob for a few bits of dam... less if tagging with a bow. Attepts a mildly weak taunt that surely must cause the mob to giggle a bit. Mob thinks the warrior is some sort of sick joke... like a little puppy growling at the mailman. Mob goes after what it feels is the real threat with very little provocation... real threat is the Slower, Healer, DPS. Warrior has to do 10 to 15% damage to the mob to really be safe with aggro.<br />
<br />
How to fix: Not sure<br />
1) increase taunt<br />
- easy to see how this helps<br />
2) add a raw hate boost into taunt (warrior only - perhaps leaves a counter on mob so warrior can not keep re-hate increasing with taunt) <br />
- would allow a warrior to keep aggro when CH or Slow was cast in the beginning of fight yet still lose it if CH or slows are chain cast. much like SKs and Pallies have it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">My suggestion, which I came up with in one of the variants of this thread on another class board, ran like this;<br />
<br />
1) Stuns that can't affect a mob due to level generate no agro. A level 65 character should not be using a L9. spell to keep agro (which is why the mana cost of agro-lock is a non issue when it's meant to be part of the balance).<br />
<br />
2) Knights should get a mini-defensive (about 1/3 the warrior one) but in this mode they do less damage and generate substantially less agro from spells and DPS.<br />
<br />
3) Warriors should get a &quot;battlecry&quot; ability with a fast refresh that lasts a minute. It adds a small amount of AoE aggro and during it's duration the warriors taunt skill and DPS generate substantially more agro. A warrior cannot use defensive for the duration of this ability.<br />
<br />
And as a freeby,<br />
<br />
4) Monks should get their mitigation put back to normal, the itemisation on their gear balanced (done in PoP and LDoN) and intrinsically generate less agro from their DPS and procs. Durable but not tanks. This is needed because SoE cannot possibly balance any increase in avoidance, even if this might better represent monkly combat.</div></div><hr />

Snap aggro should NOT be in the game. You DON'T know your class if you've been going all out burning all mana on nukes since lvl 30. And right now this is the situation. Snap aggro is ruining EQ. Casters are getting lazy, they're becoming spoiled little brats.<br />

Easy doesnt equal balanced.  Most druids dont see the shortfalls of thier class till end of the game.  Where the game becomes more specialized centered, then generalist centered.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Snap aggro is not what you are talking about thaak, people get to go all out with knight tanks because of sustained aggro which is supposed to be there for knights(in return for worse mitigation, which is no longer the case and is the real problem).<br />
Stuns weren't made to produce aggro. They were designed to stop a mobs dmg output and movement. Then came along the stun nerf. Yes, nerf. They added the aggro modifier on stuns because of clerics stun locking mobs making their dmg output 0 with no chance for getting aggro. But when they did this, they over did it. I saw a parse of a shadowknight aggroing a mob with the 450 hate spell, paladin using FoA and BOOM, aggro. Next mob, shadowknight pulled with a DD (some low level spell, forget the name) and then the 450 hate spell, 2 FoA's later, aggro was pallies.<br />
<br />
Based on that, seems like stun is about 250-350 hate to it. Which means every 5 seconds paladins can get between 500 and 700 hate, PLUS the 5-10 seconds of the mbo being stunned. I see this as overpowering.<br />
<br />
This is why I want spell stuns nerfed. If a paladin can out aggro me using a weapon, then so be it. That's not a balance problem, thus I have no problem with it.<br />
<br />
As for the mitigation, it's not even there. Yes, warriors mitigate ~5% better than knights. However, the 1k HP (and I'm even stretching it) advantage warriors have is COMPLETELY nullified when a mob is stunned for 10 seconds. Hell, this gives paladins an advantage at taking damage from a mob.<br />

Their incomplete CH is good, and sufficient for healing a tank in exp groups, and even being part of a CH chain on a tank or RT. But clerics get a lot more than that. <br />
<br />
My wife plays a L 65 cleric with about 90 AA now. She can heal far far better than a druid. Group heals, heals over time, BIG spam heals, and AA abilities all help her heal far more. The area the difference is REALLY obvious is the abillity to heal multiple people at once. One of they key abilities is Divine Arbitration. At L 3, it takes all the damage taken by any groupmembers, and spreads it out over the group. And it's nearly insta cast. And it refreshes every couple of minutes (perhaps as long as 3?).  So if two or 3 people are all getting beaten down at once, instead of pickign which to heal, she can just hit DA and they all get a big influx of HP (at the cost of the uninjured, and unaggro'd, group members losing HP).  It's very common for her to use DA and then Celestial Regeneration, a group CH over time AA that also refreshes very few minutes. She can take the group from 3 people getting clobbered to uninjured with those two AA's every few minutes - without using a point of mana. In some easier adventures that's all she does for healing. DA and Celestial regeneration. In undead adventures, she's tossing all her mana regen (almost) into 300 mana 1200 damage low resist nukes while keeeping the group healed easily. And if things are really ugly, she follows the DA with a group 3k heal that takes 4.something seconds to cast (under 3 seconds with her spellhaste, actually).  <br />
<br />
That's just one example of how she can heal MUCH better than druids. Not to mention invulnerability spells, far more AC when she gets aggro, larger, faster, more mana efficient heals, etc... <br />
<br />
Finally, everyone likes to act like it doesn't matter, but every group I've ever seen wants a cleric, because they can rez. Yeah, we'll take a druid for a healer if we can't get a cleric, but they ALL want the cleric if they can get one. <br />
<br />
They have the healer balance right now, I think. You can take a druid (or even a shaman) as your healer and go to a dungeon, but you still want a cleric if you can get one (usually). That part's right. <br />
<br />
There is a problem with the tanks, but that's another issue.</div></div><hr />

And druids are not supposed to be as good of a healer as a cleric. Clerics gave up all those nifty utility spells druids have to be the HANDS-DOWN best healer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druids can fill in as a mini-CH no doubt. Its their utility that I really like, i.e. Evac, DS, nuking, and backup healing. Because of those utilities you can really go balls to the wall as the druid can relieve the cleric from time to time, and keep up doing a nuke per mob (or whatever he can do with his mana regen).<br />
<br />
I learned this lesson last night in my LDoN group (level 54-59). Makeup was me 54 shaman, cleric, paladin, enchanter, epic mage and druid. Enchanter LDs before we zone in and never came back. Between the epic mage's focused pet, and my alpha dog we tore through mobs faster than I ever have (MMc) with any balanced melee intensive group. The difference? Druid nuking as much as possible and backup healing occasionally to keep the mana flowing on the cleric, the mage nuking as much as mana permitted, pets at 70 percent haste the whole time and me running slow/cripple and 1 nuke per mob, and the pally nuking and smashing stuff. Finished the dungeon in an hour.<br />

Paladins tank everything up until the boss mob (at least from my experiences and from what I've seen). This is about 99% of the mobs, and they do it much better.<br />

Nerfing always creates problems, look at the enchanter charm nerf:<br />
<br />
Charm was overpowered at 65 with AAs, so they nerf the whole charm mechanic, basically erasing efficient charm killing at the lower levels.<br />
<br />
Monk mitigation nerf? That caused mayhem<br />
<br />
Nerf knights in some way? <br />
<br />
Lower spell aggro, they fall into the same boat as warriors, but cannot tank as well.<br />
<br />
Lower HP, prevent them from tanking much at all<br />
<br />
Lower DPS? Can't get much lower<br />
<br />
I play a shaman and a SK, I see no problem with having a warrior as a tank in PoV/BoT, it simply means i have to slow a little later compared to having a knight tank. The warriors difference in HP makes up for the amount of damage being dealt during this period of non-slowed hits.<br />
<br />
It is simple: Upgrade Warrior taunt, give them all they want, make them aggro better than knights, tank better and deal more DPS. /shrug<br />

<br />
- Monks.  (bless).<br />
- Pure casters.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming here that the reason that these classes here are doing the most /ooc lfa because they are not being picked for groups and therefore have to sit there longest.<br />
<br />
Monks I suppose are just nerfed to hell and the one job they can do - puller - is not really needed in the LDoN dps-centric mob harvesting.<br />

Pure casters I imagine just can't do sustained dps if they don't have the chance to med.  Perhaps not such a problem for people with FT15, but crippling for casual players.<br />

<br />
If a lot of necros or mages can't get groups, it's because people don't understand what they can do, or because generic DPS is the last thing you look for in making a group, and it can be provided by most classes. It's not because they're bad at it. It's because (especially in the case of a wizard or magician) it's all they can bring to a group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Deris the Reaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Well, this debate is interesting.<br />
<br />
The REAL underlying issue to me isn't aggro. Aggro is fine. The underlying issue is that warriors in NO way are scalable. Theres no real reason to have more than 1 or 2 warriors in a raid. And in the same tone, monks as well (monks are a whole other headache, they had their role taken away by BARDS :( ).<br />
<br />
I played a Warrior and was one of the first warriors to 50 after release, and I've played a SK since then, and played multiple warriors in all types of situations. <br />
<br />
First I had to attack a quote made by someone earlier - Warriors don't have a 3k HP advantage over Knights. They stun on inc, getting almost unbreakable aggro AND stop the mobs DPS COMPLETELY. When the mobs hit for ~600 the HP difference twindles VERY fast. is very funny. They refers to Paladins, not 'knights'. It isn't 'unbreakable' and does not 'stop' the mobs dps completely. The HP advantage is ONLY taken away at the PoTime gear level, where alot of ALL PLATE gear has bunches of HP's. Other than that, at Ele Level, Knights and Warriors are pretty good, and Casual gear level Warriors and Knights are balanced almost perfectly. <br />
<br />
My take on the entire melee rebalancing :<br />
<br />
Warriors Should be and ARE the best tanks at the moment. What warriors could use is mitigation boost - Give Warriors their own unique Damage Mitigation and possibly tap their DPS up a bit as well, even go as far as to give them 3 new (well 2 are just re-tooled Disc's) skills - Offensive Stance, and Defensive Stance, and Anger Management (only name I could think of. lol sorry :() BTW this is off the cuff so no making fun.<br />
<br />
Offensive Stance increases their DPS by 25%, but lowers mitigation by 15% This goes towards making warriors more stackable, a 25% increase in DPS is nothing to laugh at.<br />
<br />
Defensive Stance increases their DMG Mitigation  by 25%, but lowers dps by 15%. This can be their primary tanking mode. <br />
<br />
A third skill that is a bard buff - a War Song if you will - where it scales by level increasing with level - adding small bonuses such as resistances, a little regen (hp and mana) and some atk/ac. This skill cannot be used in conjunction with any of the warriors other skills - so you have to choose, Offensive, Defensive and War Song.<br />
<br />
Another idea is to boost Warrior Archery to near Ranger levels (Notice I said near.) but not give them Trueshot, so warriors can possibly function in another manner.<br />
<br />
Make these skills toggle on/off as much as you want unlimited useage, no re-use timer. Therefore a warrior tanking an Uber_mob_01 loses aggro, so he toggles defensive off, turns offensive on, and hits taunt, as soon as he gets hit, goes back to normal, then waits until he has established good stable aggro, then turn defensive back on.<br />
<br />
Then REMOVE defensive and the other gay DISC they are gay crutches and these would almost be balanced. I'm sure other people have better ideas, but I see lots of ways to increase warriors FUN and SCALABILITY. (this is what we're really after isnt it? - the game would be too easy if the BEST tanks had EASY aggro.)<br />
<br />
Within this melee fix ALSO fix Monk Avoidance tables, and DPS tables, increase monk DPS, give monks similar abilities except their defensive will affect their avoidance, a super dodge mode if you will. <br />
<br />
Also FD needs to be given some kind of boost, because no guild in their right mind would use a monk to pull over a bard :-P.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Actually, in a great many cases bards are NOT raid pullers. Usually monks are, in my experience. For a very simple reason: In a great many raid situations, bard lull simply doesn't work. At all. For one, it's capped at L 65 mobs. You can't lull anything L 66+. There are lots of places in Plane of Tactics I can't lull, as a bard. I can only assume that many raid areas in Elemental and beyond are similar (but perhaps I'm wrong). And in many cases where the mobs are low enough level, they are flagged immune to lull. Vex Thal is a good example. Bards don't pull in VT, because everything in the place is immune to lull. <br />
<br />
Bards, in my experience, have taken the pulling crown away from monks IN EXP GROUPS but NOT in raids. <br />
<br />
I also disagree on warrior scalability. Warriors scale just fine. There are NUMEROUS raids where you'd like to have several warriors. You want one to MT, you want one to RT. You want at least one to backup each of those spots. In many &quot;clearing&quot; style raids, you need lots of split tanks, or you want multiple warriors to take turns using defensive against the mobs.  Sure, in some cases hybrid tanks can take those roles, but unless your guild has moved beyond the level of that raid, you'd often prefer a warrior for each of those spots. <br />
<br />
I do kind of like the offensive stance idea for warriors, though. I don't like the defensive one, because it would require rescaling the damage of all the raid mobs that were designed assuming the larger damage reduction from &quot;Defensive&quot;. <br />
<br />
The warcry thing... don't like it at all. I do not want to see warriors start getting what is, for all intents and purposes, bard songs. And, in this example, one with group resists bonus, hp/mana regen (it's group right? or why mana regen?), AND AC and attack rating, would likely be better than most anything a bard can sing, because it does all those things at once. Well, this could be balanced out, I supposed, but I REALLY don't want to see anyone ANYONE else putting up icons in the bard buff window. Back before they put in that window, bards were becoming nearly useless because nobody had buff slots for their songs on raids. All it'd take is about two other icons popping up in there and you'd have bards not able to twist buffs in some cases (think about 2 AE songs taking up those slots, from other bards). It's a slippery slope we really don't want to go down again. At the least, make this ability take up a regular buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">1) At this point nerfing a class to fix another simply isnt a good idea. The classes at the higher levels are better balanced than they have been in EQ history IMHO.<br />
<br />
2) Any change to the current knight situation makes them undesireable. They have only JUST in POP come into their own become wanted and useful in groups. To reduce them in any way takes away exactly what groups want from them.<br />
<br />
3) There is no doubt that taunt as a skill is broken, and if warriors are relying on that to maintain aggro, then it desperately needs to be fixed FOR THEM. I stress this point, because to just fix taunt, means that it gets fixed for every class that has it, and that gets us nowhere.<br />
<br />
4) Warriors need a second taunt button. Taunt, and War taunt. The second taunt needs to be on a quick refresh, (look at the refresh time on some of the spells that knights are using to maintain aggro for a model, but just slightly longer, since there is no channeling involved or manna cost) and generate a comparable amount of hate to the spells the knights are using. What have you done? Given wars the ability to generate hate consistant with the knights, without taking anything away from the knights. Would you, as a pure caster care which groups with you? prolly not, as both types can generate and hold aggro with relative parity. (sure the knights have some utility spells, but thats why we have the EXP penalty, lower HP, and non EB weapons)</div></div><hr />

So tell me again, how is a class with 14 (or 16 if guk/MM) important LDoN abilities one of the most underbalanced?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Make the same list for Shamans and you will see why the Shaman class isn't balanced at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">1) At this point nerfing a class to fix another simply isnt a good idea. The classes at the higher levels are better balanced than they have been in EQ history IMHO.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're absolutely joking. You just have to be. NO WAY IN HELL IS THE END GAME BALANCED. To quote Raaj over on TSW...<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;It's about itemization. Guess what? 95% of the best gear for you in the game is also the best gear for me. That gear also has focus effects, mana, mana regen, int, and wis which do jack **** for me. At any point in PoP (and even Luclin, and parts of velious) a knight gains more power comparing apples to apples.<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? Here, I'll even do the research for you. Looking only at Elemental armor, the differences are easy to see. Warriors recieve:<br />
~9% more HP<br />
~10% more AC<br />
~3% more attack<br />
~1% more shielding<br />
<br />
Paladins get 1095mana, 30% healing focus, and 10% mana preservation.<br />
<br />
And this is CLASS SPECIFIC ARMOR.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
But of course, that's balanced, right?<br />
<br />
2) Any change to the current knight situation makes them undesireable. They have only JUST in POP come into their own become wanted and useful in groups. To reduce them in any way takes away exactly what groups want from them.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that the whole spellbook of paladins is irrelevent, right? Sorry, paladins will still get groups because they're the most efficient back up healer. 850 hp fast group heal &gt; 1900 hp 10 second spell single target. And I'm sure that BSS is just POINTLESS, right? Please. Warriors should have SUPERIOR aggro to Knights, our taunt skill is a mere 10 points higher but you should notice a difference in successful taunt %. We weren't even asking for that until we got absolutely pissed and stopped p'ussyfooting around. Even if Knight aggro = war aggro we'd be satisfied. If you think not being alone atop the hierarchy of aggro will make you undesireable, you're a bitch.<br />
<br />
3) There is no doubt that taunt as a skill is broken, and if warriors are relying on that to maintain aggro, then it desperately needs to be fixed FOR THEM. I stress this point, because to just fix taunt, means that it gets fixed for every class that has it, and that gets us nowhere.<br />
<br />
Taunt just need to work ~80% of the time for warriors and ~60% for Knights. This will make Knights have current warrior aggro (with exception to SK DoTs and Hate spells). Warriors will get the upgrade in Taunt they deserve and need.<br />
<br />
4) Warriors need a second taunt button. Taunt, and War taunt. The second taunt needs to be on a quick refresh, (look at the refresh time on some of the spells that knights are using to maintain aggro for a model, but just slightly longer, since there is no channeling involved or manna cost) and generate a comparable amount of hate to the spells the knights are using. What have you done? Given wars the ability to generate hate consistant with the knights, without taking anything away from the knights. Would you, as a pure caster care which groups with you? prolly not, as both types can generate and hold aggro with relative parity. (sure the knights have some utility spells, but thats why we have the EXP penalty, lower HP, and non EB weapons)<br />
<br />
This game shouldn't be dumbed down to chimp level. Your exp penalty was removed LONG ago, which shows that your about as dumb as a brick. Your lower HP is easily made up by ONE stun or ONE heal or ONE lifetap. So please **** off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Thaak, it breaks down to this: What do groups want in their tanks?  The skill sets Knights have.  Your solution is to remove the skills instead of addressing the problem.  Doesn't that seem a little weird since it doesn't address the issue.<br />
<br />
You want Casters in exp groups to be so miserable working with the limitations of all tanks that at some point they abandon them.  Have you ever watched the high level Beastie pet?  Solid agro generation, somewhat durable and has decent DPS.  Its only failing is that it pushes.  Charming although synged from nerfing still works well when a target can be charmed and can be used the same way.<br />
<br />
Nerf Knights into oblivion like you want Thaak and exp groups will flock to pets for tanking.  Is your ultimate tactic to nerf anything that can tank but not named Warrior into oblivion?  Bravo.  Way to ignore the problem and make Casters rock even more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u161"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p161">Aeko,<br />
<br />
I can't believe what you just wrote.  You seem to be clearly stating that warriors are so BAD as exp group tanks that, if paladins and sk's are nerfed, groups would prefer BL pets or charmed mobs to warriors as their tanks. You seriously think warriors are worse exp group tanks thank BL pets or the ever-unreliable charmed pet?  If you REALLY think warriors are THAT BAD doesn't something DESPERATELY need to be done to fix them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u162"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p162">EDIT: What he said ^^^^^^^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">Yes, yes I do.  You don't think power players out there would abandon player tanks in a heartbeat if another way is found to gain exp?<br />
<br />
Oh wait...that has already happened!  Silly me...I forgot about soloers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u164"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p164">Well, at least we're not as bad off as Monks.<br />
<br />
Monks need a somewhat big increase in DPS and some sort of mitigation increase.<br />
<br />
If you're going to talk beast lords you gotta include monks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">Of course power players will abandon player tanks if they aren't effective. Duh. But we're talking about how the game SHOULD be balanced. Hybrid tanks should be good enough that groups want them over no tank at all. So should warriors. You seem to be saying that you feel warriors detract from groups, and that this is OK. The game should NOT be designed such that anyone ever feels warriors are counterproductive for dungeon groups. <br />
<br />
After all, what other method of exp-gaining are they supposed to be good FOR? It's not like they can solo or really be a useful part of a group using any non-tanking strategy. If they're aren't a valuable addition to dungeon-crawling exp groups how are they supposed to get exp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u166"><b>Aeka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p166">Now hold on.  If you look around multiple boards I post on you will see I constantly and vehimately say &quot;Warriors need help.&quot;  You will also constantly see &quot;Do not nerf Knights.&quot;  I see Warrior woes as an issue of Warrior functionality.  Where do Knights even figure into the eqaution?  Warrior agro control, which effects their effectiveness as a tank, is in a state of disrepair reguardless if Knights even existed.<br />
<br />
There is this strange idea that if Knights get nerfed, exp groups will run back to Warriors with open arms.  That groups will simply &quot;put up&quot; with Warrior flaky agro control.  Everything I experienced says that many will simply not try.  The only thing nerfing Knights will accomplish is that groups will search for a new method of tanking with solid agro generation.  Whether that is making Rangers tank or using a Beastlord pet or just going without any melee, it will be done much to the dismay of nerf mongering Warriors.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, Warriors who scream for nerfs only want to make the low end Knights suffer.  Removing agro from spells will have a consequence for raids which I'm sure most do not consider.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">I don't want groups to welcome me with open arms.

<br />
One question, Aeka: how would putting spell stun aggro at about 1/2 of what it is now be detrimental for a raid? It'll allow paladins who aren't tanking to do something good for the raid and stun the mob, stopping the mobs DPS and helping cleric mana. If I'm missing something please do tell.</div></div><hr />

2. Good offtank<br />
Wrong. Monk's shoddy mitiagation means that they take more damage than most other melee classes, and they don't have a reliable method to lock aggro on them (disarm, beg, and Instill Doubt are unreliable at best).<br />
<br />
Classes that can offtank at least as well as a monk: Warrior, Shadow Knight, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Beastlord. <br />
<br />

Right<br />
<br />
4. Low maintenance (with mend + avoidance)<br />
Wrong. Monks still take more damage than almost any other melee oriented class. Yes, the mitigation nerf was that crippling. a 1500 to 2000 point heal every six minutes doesn't make them 'low maintenance'.

This simply isn't true at the high end game. It starts with VT gear, in elemental/time gear its completely gone. An elemental monk can tank better than any warrior in pre-VT gear in xp groups. I think you underestimate gear/aa. There are monks who could very easily tank King Tormax for example. There are a TON of monks on my server who could offtank a LDoN mob from 100% to 0% hp and not require a single heal. I know I can (bard). And Mend does a hell of alot more than 1500-2000 hp. Buffed well-geared monks have 7k+ hp and crit mend etc.<br />
<br />
I've done groups with vt/ep level players where necro is the primary healer, bard is secondary healer, and monk is MT or offtank.<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;Classes with better sustained DPS include Necros, Mages, Wizards, Rogues.<br />
&gt;&gt;Classes with equivalent DPS include Rangers, Beastlords, and Warriors.<br />
<br />
In LDoN monks will outdamage wizards, warriors and rangers. Mobs die so frickin fast and are walled constantly that backstab is negligible. Parties move so fast wizards can barely med (and cant use horse). Monks are tied for 3rd best DPS with bst/rog, the 1st/2nd being mag/nec.</div></div><hr />

Heh, goody... a time geared monk can tank like a Velious geared warrior. Forgive me that's hardy awe-inspiring. Of course monks can tank content that they're ridiculously overpowered for. Hell, a time geared caster can tank LDoN mobs. I've been in groups where it's done. The fact that you need to compare monks with endgame equipment to tanks with gear that's four expansions old proves my point.<br />
<br />
A mend for a monk with 7k hps heals 1750 hit points, exactly in the middle of the range I quoted. A critical mend may happen, but isn't something you can count on, even after spending more than 30 AA points maxxing the ability.<br />
<br />
I've done groups with vt/ep level players where necro is the primary healer, bard is secondary healer, and monk is MT or offtank.<br />
<br />
This proves my point, not yours. LDoN mobs are gimpy in comparison to EP mobs. Of course a monk can tank them... so can a shaman, <br />
<br />
<br />
In LDoN monks will outdamage wizards, warriors and rangers. Mobs die so frickin fast and are walled constantly that backstab is negligible. Parties move so fast wizards can barely med (and cant use horse). Monks are tied for 3rd best DPS with bst/rog, the 1st/2nd being mag/nec.<br />
<br />
You need to find better players. Reverse pinning isn't hard, and the speed of kills has no negative impact on rogues. All the rogues I group with get to backstab almost all the time. If they can't, I teach the newbie tank about positioning.<br />
<br />
Wizards with ft15, KEI, 150-ish AAs, and good focus effects do just fine. Sure, they're overpowered for the environment... kinda like the monks that you keep talking up. Even a poorly geared wizard does just fine... hell, a charming chanter can maintain their mana pool easily over the course of an adventure. How do I know? Oh, yeah, I play one.<br />
<br />
You completely neglected to address the point that a well-geared and AAed warrior will do comparable damage to a well-geared and AAed monk, while tanking much better. There's also the matter of rangers, whom you conveniently passed over. A ranger with the right AAs and a good two-hander will do more damage than he will with a bow, putting him right up there in the DPS standings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">Actually, in a great many cases bards are NOT raid pullers. Usually monks are, in my experience. For a very simple reason: In a great many raid situations, bard lull simply doesn't work. At all. For one, it's capped at L 65 mobs. You can't lull anything L 66+. There are lots of places in Plane of Tactics I can't lull, as a bard. I can only assume that many raid areas in Elemental and beyond are similar (but perhaps I'm wrong). And in many cases where the mobs are low enough level, they are flagged immune to lull. Vex Thal is a good example. Bards don't pull in VT, because everything in the place is immune to lull. <br />
<br />
Bards, in my experience, have taken the pulling crown away from monks IN EXP GROUPS but NOT in raids. <br />
<br />
- You either have:<br />
(1) Very incompetent bards in your guild.<br />
Or<br />
(2) Have never heard of Fading Memories.<br />
<br />
Maybe when you move to elemental planes you realize how powerful bards have become and how they almost eliminate the need for monk pulling. Oh and who pulls VT anymore? Just rush the damn rooms.<br />
<br />
Bards are the single most broken class in EQ. Nerf them. Now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u174"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p174">Some guilds ... the bards pull. Some guilds... the monks pull. It's really a situation that each guild has to work out for themselves and there isn't only one right answer.<br />
<br />
Yodelroy,<br />
<br />
Judgeing by your magelo (which I have seen linked in the bard board(or was it rogue board on the quote issue))<br />
<br />
You are not in the elemental planes and not one to speak about monks who blow away equilly equiped other classes.<br />
<br />
Compare the top 1% of monks to the mid-high bazaar equiped PLed class and of course a monk is going to do better.<br />
<br />
And as for monks being MT in some of your LDoN adventures I am sure they were VT / Elemental equiped and playing on Normal (a setting ment for pick up groups with players wearing average gear(average = less then VT with some Tier 1 gear)  Kind of like arguing that a level 65 monk going and killing Emp Chrush as an excuse for them not being broken (ok so this IS an extreme version of what you posted).<br />
<br />
As for mend being the save all for monks, you know we can only use it ever 6 minutes right?  That 1600 dmg (that even a slowed mob can put out in 6 minutes) means one less heal only...with the 50% chance of a crit mend thats 3200 hp...and even a slowed mob can put out that much hurting on a monk in 6 minutes.  To even mention that monks don't need healing while offtanking is a waste of breath as mend is an ability that is not up very often.  Then like in your other posts you say that even you (setting yourself below a monk) can offtank a mob is either very humbling or just the bard fear of nerfage coming out.<br />
<br />
I don't know if you have...but I have seen a level 60 enchanter (decked out in VT level gear) tank SoRZ and King Tormax.  (this was luclin era btw) to say a monk can do it 2 expansions later is stupid too.  You do know a monk can now solo one of the dragons in WW don't you?  You do know that SK's can duo Trakanon right?  You come here posting innane stuff that you believe is your gospel and then set yourself below monks so that we are like your human shield against a nerf bat or something.  Post something that is relevent (like a monk tanking an elemental god) or just quit spewing forth disinformation.<br />

<br />
&quot;If you can't dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with bull$hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think bards should be nerfed...I do believe that it would be ironic if bards were nerfed that their abilities were limitied to what they posted on other classes boards though.

Actually, my guild has some VERY good bards. I'm one of them. I know QUITE well what fading memories is. Yes, it's a fantastic skill. Yes, a bard with enough FT/MC can do some amazing things pulling. Yes, I'm one of those bards, too. <br />
<br />
But that makes what I said more valid, not less. And maybe Elemental-equipped guilds just rush VT when they're slumming there, but a guild on its first few trips there does not. It might be that bards are the uber pullers in the elemental planes. I haven't gotten there yet. <br />
<br />
What exactly do you want nerfed about bards? If they've badly designed the elemental planes zones so that bards are the uber pullers all they'd have to do is make a few more mobs immune to lull OR see invisible in the necessary spots. That's all it takes to make a bard a MUCH weaker puller in a particular spot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nerf bards. Now.<br />
<br />
I suppose they could, but I'm not sure it'd really advance the game much. Back in the day, monks were everything, when it came to pulling, corpse dragging, scouting, yadda yadda yadda. Feign Death was VASTLY overpowered. They've gotten around this without nerfing FD specifically by adding other abilities to other characters, with some of the functionality of FD.  In particular, the stealth AA and escape for rogues, and Fading Memories for bards. <br />
<br />
I will actually agree with you that they made a mistake, though. Making fading memories based off of mana usage was a bad mistake. It takes 900 mana to do it, and a bard ONLY gets mana regen from mental clarity or Flowing Thought. With no FT, this means one Fade every 900 ticks - 90 minutes. With FT 1 (earring of the solstice), you're talking 45 minutes. Add a couple pts of mental clarity and you're at every 22.5 minutes. At these levels fading memories is nowhere near overpowered. <br />
<br />
But you've probably got a point when you're talking about an uber bard with FT 15 and MC2 or 3. At maxed mana regen, it's 19 a tick (counting 1 for breathing), which means a bard can regain the mana to fade in about 4 and a half minutes. And you're right, that probably is too powerful. I'm only up to every 9 minutes (and that recently), and it's starting to be a VERY powerful skill now that I can (almost) do it whenever I want.   Way back when the bards complained about Fade working off our SLOW mana regen, Absor told us to get some FT and deal with it. Now that the high end bards have, it might be too good an ability. <br />
<br />
Of course, some things are designed with it in mind, I think. I can't imagine how I'll ever be able to pull a Hard level LDoN dungeon (with the huge critical failure rates on lull) without fading memories and a TON of FT (I need more than I have right now). I don't have enough yet, but working on it. Of course, I don't know how ANYONE pulls hard dungeons, heh.  <br />
<br />
Of course, they've put themselves in a box now, as they've left it this way for a year and all the bards have stocked up on FT, which has virtually no other use for them, specifically because of fading memories. A nerf would have to be done very carefully or it'd really screw people over.</div></div><hr />

When you get the chance, compare SK and warrior ELEMENTAL armours. ~13% difference.<br />
<br />
Then check out a fully time equipped SK and a fully time equipped warrior. Drops to within 8%, iirc.<br />
<br />
Paladins are even worse on the elemental armour. ~9% HP difference, there.<br />
<br />
And my guild warriors are all home-grown. We have about 5-6 ~60+ warriors.<br />

You need better wizards. When you drop as much damage per nuke as a wizzie does, you don't have to nuke early to contribute some monster DPS. I'm not saying this is wrong: wizards should have huge damage, it's kinda what they do. However, a lot of people seem to have modern wizards confusewith their relatively gimpy Kunark/Velious era predecessors.<br />
<br />

People are dumb. As I implied above, tons of folks refuse to evaluate classes as they are now, not classes as they used to be. A warrior with comparable gear and AAs can do 90+% of the damage a monk dishes out. (disclaimer: late game comparison only. I don't really have a grasp on warriors pre-65 with a chunk of AAs.)<br />

I don't doubt that a shaman could keep a monk with his defensive AAs and decent gear alive in Tier 3 planes. Again, that's not that big of a deal. A shaman can keep himself alive while tanking in Tier 3 planes. It's not the monk that's powerful in that pair. The rest is so wrong I almost don't know where to start. This may have been true a year ago (it wasn't, but it was much closer). Parse a monk against any other melee class. Presupposing comparable AAs and gear, the monk will take more damage than almost any of them.

In BoT, I'll always try to get a paladin or shadow knight over a warrior tank unless I have grouped with the warrior before and know he can maintain aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u186"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p186">1) At this point nerfing a class to fix another simply isnt a good idea. The classes at the higher levels are better balanced than they have been in EQ history IMHO.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're absolutely joking. You just have to be. NO WAY IN HELL IS THE END GAME BALANCED. To quote Raaj over on TSW...<br />
<br />
Read what I said again, I said that they are better balanced than they have been in EQ history. I made no claim that they were balanced. Perhaps in your absolute rage at the idea that I might be making a valid point you forgot how to read?<br />
<br />
&gt;&gt;It's about itemization. Guess what? 95% of the best gear for you in the game is also the best gear for me. That gear also has focus effects, mana, mana regen, int, and wis which do jack **** for me. At any point in PoP (and even Luclin, and parts of velious) a knight gains more power comparing apples to apples.<br />
<br />
Don't believe me? Here, I'll even do the research for you. Looking only at Elemental armor, the differences are easy to see. Warriors recieve:<br />
~9% more HP<br />
~10% more AC<br />
~3% more attack<br />
~1% more shielding<br />
<br />
Paladins get 1095mana, 30% healing focus, and 10% mana preservation.<br />
<br />
And this is CLASS SPECIFIC ARMOR.&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
But of course, that's balanced, right?<br />
<br />
/sigh.. once again I made no claim that they are balanced completely. And your claim about getting manna and and focus effects is not comparing apples to apples. You cant compare that, warriors dont need it to function properly. Sure it gives some more utility, but at this point, heals are still the realm of the clerics, (duids too in some cases) and we are still bringing only utility to the table, not overwhelming power. You make a point that there really isnt much difference between the armor sets, but there IS a difference. I can agree that the warriors could use an upgrade, but then I also say that in the later post. <br />
<br />
2) Any change to the current knight situation makes them undesireable. They have only JUST in POP come into their own become wanted and useful in groups. To reduce them in any way takes away exactly what groups want from them.<br />
<br />
I'm sure that the whole spellbook of paladins is irrelevent, right? Sorry, paladins will still get groups because they're the most efficient back up healer. 850 hp fast group heal &gt; 1900 hp 10 second spell single target. And I'm sure that BSS is just POINTLESS, right? Please. Warriors should have SUPERIOR aggro to Knights, our taunt skill is a mere 10 points higher but you should notice a difference in successful taunt %. We weren't even asking for that until we got absolutely pissed and stopped p'ussyfooting around. Even if Knight aggro = war aggro we'd be satisfied. If you think not being alone atop the hierarchy of aggro will make you undesireable, you're a bitch.<br />
<br />
Again, too angry to read proper english. Nowhere did I say anything about knights wanting to be alone at the top of aggro. To fill that tank slot groups want 2 basic things. HP, and aggro control. Again, Knights have only recently been able to fill those roles with the advent of PoP. If you somehow nerf the knights they cannot fulfill either of those roles. And then what good is that spellbook that you so spitefuly point out is so useful? None. Nifty heals? nope. Got a cleric for that. DPS? nope. Not even in an undead environment. Paladins of Norrath has done extensive tests on Slay undead, and proven that on average it does not add significantly to DPS. (10% IIRC) Sure Slay looks good, but it is as reliable as the procs that wars are forced to rely on to hold aggro. To do anything to Knights now is to send them back to the dark age of Kunark, where no hybrids were wanted in any group. If what knights are doing is working, why nerf them? The correct solution is to upgrade the warriors so that a warrior does a better job, but a knight can do it too. Not in a pinch, but as a viable alternative.<br />
<br />
3) There is no doubt that taunt as a skill is broken, and if warriors are relying on that to maintain aggro, then it desperately needs to be fixed FOR THEM. I stress this point, because to just fix taunt, means that it gets fixed for every class that has it, and that gets us nowhere.<br />
<br />
Taunt just need to work ~80% of the time for warriors and ~60% for Knights. This will make Knights have current warrior aggro (with exception to SK DoTs and Hate spells). Warriors will get the upgrade in Taunt they deserve and need.<br />
<br />
That is another way to fix it, one of several that have been suggested here. If your method was chosen, then you would have to leave the aggro generated by stuns and dot/hate spells alone. To reduce the effectiveness of taunt for knights AND nerf the spells removes the ability to be the tank in a group. And as I stated before, for the slots other than MT, a paladin simply doesnt bring DPS, doesnt slow, and heals are situationally useful. (knights have typically lower wis/int than their parent class and as a result have a lower manna pool. Yes I know its calculated the same, but we typically have less mana to play with)<br />
<br />
4) Warriors need a second taunt button. Taunt, and War taunt. The second taunt needs to be on a quick refresh, (look at the refresh time on some of the spells that knights are using to maintain aggro for a model, but just slightly longer, since there is no channeling involved or manna cost) and generate a comparable amount of hate to the spells the knights are using. What have you done? Given wars the ability to generate hate consistant with the knights, without taking anything away from the knights. Would you, as a pure caster care which groups with you? prolly not, as both types can generate and hold aggro with relative parity. (sure the knights have some utility spells, but thats why we have the EXP penalty, lower HP, and non EB weapons)<br />
<br />
This game shouldn't be dumbed down to chimp level. Your exp penalty was removed LONG ago, which shows that your about as dumb as a brick. Your lower HP is easily made up by ONE stun or ONE heal or ONE lifetap. So please **** off.<br />
<br />
Ok you got me on the exp penalty. I will be big enought to admit that. I started in 99' when there was one. /shrug I paid my dues. I think your lame attempt at a flame reveals your ability to think out complex issues. This last statement adds nothing to the conversation. Where I offered a possible solution, you attacked my idea without even an explanation as to how increasing the aggro generated by a war dumbs the game down. Sure, we can stun/lifetap to steal that aggro, my suggestion was that warriors should be able to do the same. I dont see the problem. <br />
<br />
As for the anger and namecalling. the simple fact that someone can get this angry over a game reveals the fact that yes, warriors are broken and need a fix.<br />
<br />
/highroad off</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">Now hold on.  If you look around multiple boards I post on you will see I constantly and vehimately say &quot;Warriors need help.&quot;  You will also constantly see &quot;Do not nerf Knights.&quot;  I see Warrior woes as an issue of Warrior functionality.  Where do Knights even figure into the eqaution?  Warrior agro control, which effects their effectiveness as a tank, is in a state of disrepair reguardless if Knights even existed.<br />
<br />
There is this strange idea that if Knights get nerfed, exp groups will run back to Warriors with open arms.  That groups will simply &quot;put up&quot; with Warrior flaky agro control.  Everything I experienced says that many will simply not try.  The only thing nerfing Knights will accomplish is that groups will search for a new method of tanking with solid agro generation.  Whether that is making Rangers tank or using a Beastlord pet or just going without any melee, it will be done much to the dismay of nerf mongering Warriors.<br />
<br />
As far as I can tell, Warriors who scream for nerfs only want to make the low end Knights suffer.  Removing agro from spells will have a consequence for raids which I'm sure most do not consider.<br />
<br />
This is quite possibly the most coherent version of what I am trying to point out. /clap<br />
<br />
The thread has been pretty much focused on exp groups. Bringing raids into the equasion, no one disputes the warrior's superiority at MT because of defensive. But changing how stuns work in EXP groups definatly changes the nature of stuns in raids.<br />
<br />
Regarding the use of stuns on raids. To reduce the aggro of stuns on raids messes with the raid system. BECAUSE of the aggro on stuns, paladins really only stun on a raid if A) add tanking B) the mob is trying to gate C) They need to pull aggro off the clerics/casters NOW.<br />
<br />
Currently, if a paladin were to be stunning during a raid to interrupt DPS of the mob or casting, he would be a grease spot for stealling aggro off the main tank. This is the number one issue with turing a grinding paladin into a raid paladin, gettin him/her to put away the stuns. If the aggro component were removed from the stuns, we would be stunning with reckless abandon, potentially perma-locking the mob if enough paladins/clerics were stunning on a chain. That I believe (and I think it was stated earlier) is why the aggro componnent was created in the first place. (Clerics were perma-stunning mobs in Seb) A perma stunned mob, doesnt fight back.. wheres the need for a MT there? Talk about the warriors shooting themselves in the foot. The one area where they are undisputibly the kings (MT on big mobs) would be gone. On a raid, a paladin CAN steal aggro, but a good paladin knows that he has no business doing that, because without defensive, we are nothing more than some dps, and some spot heals.<br />
<br />
And there it is. Changing stun to be less aggro generating will make raids more unbalanced. Catch - 22. Again, I see the solution as leaving Knights alone, and giving the warriors a boost at what they are supposed to do best. Tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u188"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p188">/sigh.. once again I made no claim that they are balanced completely. And your claim about getting manna and and focus effects is not comparing apples to apples. You cant compare that, warriors dont need it to function properly.<br />
<br />
No, warriors need hit points, mitigation, avoidance, and taunt to function effectively. Their armor provides them no significant advantage in these area to make up for the utility that the hybrid armor offers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure it gives some more utility, but at this point, heals are still the realm of the clerics, (duids too in some cases) and we are still bringing only utility to the table, not overwhelming power.<br />
<br />
That's the idea behind a hybrid. They combine two or more classes' abilities for greater utility at the expense of the power that specializing in one area can offer. Sadly, it doesn't work out that way in EQ as the specialists are oftern surpassed by the generalists in the areas they are intended to excell in.<br />
<br />
<br />
You make a point that there really isnt much difference between the armor sets, but there IS a difference. I can agree that the warriors could use an upgrade, but then I also say that in the later post. <br />
<br />
<br />
The difference being that hybrids get significantly more from their armor than the pure melees do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, too angry to read proper english. Nowhere did I say anything about knights wanting to be alone at the top of aggro. To fill that tank slot groups want 2 basic things. HP, and aggro control. Again, Knights have only recently been able to fill those roles with the advent of PoP.<br />

<br />
<br />
If you somehow nerf the knights they cannot fulfill either of those roles. And then what good is that spellbook that you so spitefuly point out is so useful? None. Nifty heals? nope. Got a cleric for that.<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone wants to see knights reduced to uselessness. A warrior needs to be much closer to the knight's aggro generation than they currently are. Say, as close to knight aggro as knight mitigation and hit points are to a warrior's. Given the paladins' ability to stun mobs (and interrupt heals and gates!) and heal, the Shadow Knights' and Rangers' DPS, and the overall power of the BeastLords, I don't think that's asking too much.   <br />
<br />
<br />
DPS? nope. Not even in an undead environment. Paladins of Norrath has done extensive tests on Slay undead, and proven that on average it does not add significantly to DPS. (10% IIRC) Sure Slay looks good, but it is as reliable as the procs that wars are forced to rely on to hold aggro.<br />
<br />
Well, given that a Paladin can do better than 80% of the damage of a warrior (http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8627) without being in an undead environment, I'd say their utility more than makes up the difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
To do anything to Knights now is to send them back to the dark age of Kunark, where no hybrids were wanted in any group. If what knights are doing is working, why nerf them?<br />
<br />
Because what the melee classes are doing isn't working. Simply boosting the abilities of melee classes to compensate would result in the instant trivialization of content. To level the playing field would require either an innovative solution or an across the board increase in tanking ability and DPS for melees classes. If you honestly think that SoE is going to pull off the former then I have a wonderful deal on some beachfront property in Arizona to offer you.<br />
<br />
<br />
The correct solution is to upgrade the warriors so that a warrior does a better job, but a knight can do it too. Not in a pinch, but as a viable alternative.<br />
<br />
<br />
So how much of a tanking advantage should warriors have over Knights? How much of a DPS advantage?<br />
<br />
<br />
That is another way to fix it, one of several that have been suggested here. If your method was chosen, then you would have to leave the aggro generated by stuns and dot/hate spells alone. To reduce the effectiveness of taunt for knights AND nerf the spells removes the ability to be the tank in a group.<br />

(knights have typically lower wis/int than their parent class and as a result have a lower manna pool. Yes I know its calculated the same, but we typically have less mana to play with)<br />
<br />
<br />
A paladin does bring:<br />
- Offtanking and crowd control. Not every group uses a chanter or bard.<br />
- Backup heals<br />
- Rez. Not every group has a cleric.<br />
<br />
A warrior who is not a main tank brings:<br />
- Offtanking</div></div><hr />

The problem with this is that not every group is willing to have 2 tanks in a group...takes up the spot of a vital class or someone with higher DPS...which in the end equals less effeciency which everyone has come to demand and anything less is unacceptable.  I and a lot of other people do not want Knight classes or bards nerfed...that is counter-productive.  Instead increase the abilities of the classes that have fallen behind...don't tell me its game breaking either...every expansion casters get upgrades in some shape or form and that trivialized content.  You really want an example how about buff bots on Naggy and Vox raids?  KEI.  2 SK's can duo Trakanon...1 paladin can solo Gore...a 52 monk with stinging wart potions can solo naggy AND vox.  Don't worry about trivializing old content...its already been done.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u193"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p193">I've said it before, but perhaps unclearly, so I'll try to say it again:  Wars are specialists.  What they do, basically ALL they do, is tank mobs IN TEH FACE, as it were.  They are already the best at taking damage.  Only 9% better?  Cry me a river, my SK is busting his fat ass for tankability improvements in the 1.5% range, and those same improvements are available to Wars as well.  There is no rational argument that says that wars are being superseded as damage takers.  Whats left?  Dishing out melee damage and aggro.<br />
<br />
The fact that my SK puts out measurably more weapon damage than a comparably equipped war is ludicrous.  I expect to do more damage once my spells are figured in, duh, but in a weps only fight, the guy who swings swords (or clubs, in my case) part time shouldnt be surpassing the guy who does just that all day long.  Thats just dumb.  They should get a boost to damage done in a face-to-face confrontation, since that's what they ought to be best at, and they should get more aggro per point of damage done (or however aggro is calculated) than knights do.  Does that give them snap aggro?  No, thats what knights are for (now that they finally have a job description).  <br />
<br />
What it does do is give them stronger aggro once it's had a chance to build up.  I see zero problem with giving knights the fast aggro the have now and giving warriors strong aggro, which they dont really have now.  Increase the aggro on nukes just a little bit too, and all of a sudden the skinny dresswearing freaks are clamoring for a war tank.  Might this cause issues in bossmob/endgame encounters?  Yes.  And maybe that's where the ultimate problem lies.  <br />
<br />
If Wars are given 'strong' aggro (as a byproduct of increased face-to-face melee dps, SoE would then have to actually put some effort into 'tuning' such encounters.  The fact that they have traditionally been reluctant to do so doesnt mean that its the wrong thing to do, it just means their priorities are ****ed up*.  <br />
<br />
*(Remember, this is a company that (STILL) can't seem to fix the fact that 2hb animations got mixed up with piercing animations even though it's well known and has been going on for over two years, but they'll pay coders god knows how much money to make sure that troll chicks in Gunthak or wherever have jiggly tits.  Please.)<br />
<br />
Knights are not specialists.  By definition they are hybrids, part-timers, and the inescapable consequence of being a part-timer is that you will never be quite as good at the job as a full-timer.  <br />

<br />
Well, given that my point was that warriors deal damage nearly as well as monks, I'd say this parse was fairly strong evidence supporting me. If anything I understated the monks' plight. <br />
<br />
I do think that most warriors will do closer to 90% of monk damage than 101% of monk damage. The cap doesn't close completely until the warrior has endgame weapons and has maxxed their offensvie AAs.<br />
<br />
Either way, my point stands: Monks are currently royally screwed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The monk would do slightly less damage with Vanazir than he would with Zha's. So yeah, there's a problem with the parse, but it's in the warrior's favor. <br />
<br />
The warrior is not benefitting that much from riposte damage. In the thread, Brodda quite clearly spells out exactly how much ripostes impacted each DPS set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now someone probably thought that if monk isn't tanking and neither is warrior, the monk will prolly do only a meager 10% more DPS with equivalent weapons and takeing out riposte AA and skill from the equation. This is quite true, warriors in my guild (similar amount of AA) with Blade of War do about same DPS as monks with the best weapons available pre time to them. &lt;------ This is wrong, class balance issue.<br />
<br />
Actually, if the warrior isn't tanking then things can get really silly with /disc Offensive. On the other hand, the warrior is likely to get reduced to a grease spot on the floor of the cave if he's fighting anything nasty. The monk still has the best aggro reduction tool in the game. <br />
<br />
<br />

True<br />
<br />
<br />
- Warrior is doing better DPS than a monk when both tank due in part to AA/abilities AND weaker weapon. Duh!<br />
<br />
<br />
Not so true. Read what Brodda had to say about the apparent AA and weapon disparities. The riposte AAs helped the warrior slightly and using Zha's helped the monk slightly.<br />
<br />
Overall, the parse fairly conclusively demonstrates that the endgame monk is even weaker than many people thought. The really sad part is that this is a comparison to a warrior, another class that needs some lovin', not a class with a spell book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u198"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p198">Give a Warriors two things. <br />
<br />
A New skill. Kick to the groin. (Or whatever) 1 Minute refresh + 600 Hate. No Fail.<br />
<br />
There is snap aggro Just like the incoming Stun from a paladin. Just like the Incoming CD from a Knight.<br />
<br />
And Give All Pure meele three stances. Attack defend and protection.<br />
<br />
If they have attack stance on  Thier Mana totals from gear Is worked into a formula (Even something as Simple as Mana/10 )for More attack rating. If It is to defend thier Total is worked into AC,(Again Mana/10) And if it is to protection The mana total is converted to hit points for then as long as they are protected. (Mana = Hit points)<br />
<br />
Monks under Defense stance get back Alot of the Nerf to mitagation. If not tanking they do more Damage and If they have to stay alive they can get more Hit points. Same thing for Thieves. The Defence can be when they take aggro and the damn evade is being more finiky than old grandma Jones.<br />
<br />
Knights still have aggro lock from burning Mana. So make damn fine tanks with all the utility they bring. Warriors can Have the snap aggro they need, but the Wizard that Drops The Big one 8 seconds in is going to get beat upon..<br />
<br />
And shaman Will be able to slow on incoming And not get beat down Plus it is a Fine way to keep aggro maintained in the face of the RNG being a punk.<br />
<br />
Heck make the delay 30 seconds if you want For those supposed Increadible kill speed groups. <br />
<br />
People will flip out and Say that will break the game in raids Cause the warrior will have 1000+ more Hit points... Well. So? Guilds inflated to 10+ clerics for the C heal chain, Maybe one of them can Not hot box for a change then.<br />
<br />
And of course the Warriors will roll on mana items. So? The extra Paladin would roll on it also. <br />
<br />
Verant needs to stop being head in the sand dumbasses and make the needed changes, and stop acting like sissies. Nerf the almost no mana cost Aggro boosters knights and Paladins are using to keep aggro lock and make them Actually want to use taunt now and again and suppliment with Level appropriate spells the taunt factor they use, Give warriors some form of non RNG aggo and let the damn mistakes of the last few years of item mismanagement work for everone.<br />
<br />
Or Mutter in the corner that it will all go away and classes are not that out of balance. All while friendships are being strained and morale is at an all time low because a staple of any fantasy enviroment (Warriors) are being laughed at by everyone and pitied by a few.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u199"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p199">Those suggestions would, in my opinion, go way too far. You're talking about a free permanent bonus of 200 or more attack rating to high end equipped rogues, as one example. That's a good idea? I don't think so. Very few people have even suggested that rogues have a problem. I certainly don't think they do. They do outstanding damage and have an extremely valuable utility role due to SoS. Tossing them a major bonus because monks and warriors need help would just create a new overpowered class. <br />
<br />
According to posts in this thread, monks tank like they are down 300 AC from where they are. Well, this suggestion would give high end monks the option of having most (or all, or even more?) of that AC available whenever they want it, and then flip a switch and turn it into an attack rating bonus whenever they aren't tanking or pulling. Or, alternately, just have 2-3k+ more hp whenever they want that more instead. Way too much. <br />
<br />
I think the warrior taunt suggestion. I firmly believe that warriors need some kind of improved innate taunt ability. A 1 minute recycle direct aggro taunt as you suggest. An automatic +100 hate every time they use their taunt button. Higher aggro generation from their melee damage. Something. It's daft that a warrior has to have an enraging blow weapon to be reasonably effective (and two are better!).  But thousands of free hp or hundreds of free ac/attack rating (freely switchable between the options, no less!) isn't the way to do it. I applaud the idea that they should get &quot;the same level of benefit&quot; out of gear that hybrids and casters do, but I don't see a practical way to do that in today's EQ. Besides, I think we're better off with a fix based on class abilities than gear. Gear isn't the real problem, as the disparities exist at all levels of equipment. <br />
<br />
I know it's kind of heresy, but I think I'd prefer to just see warrior/monk (and perhaps to a lesser degree rogue, just enough to keep them ahead) melee damage improved. If they have to boost up ranger damage a little as well, that won't really hurt anything. The hybrids could then be almost as good as warriors at tanking, plus have all their spell utility - but have lower DPS. That seems like a fair tradeoff. There is something wrong if the SK's really do have higher dps with 2h weapons than warriors do, as one poster has recently suggested.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u200"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p200">&quot;The one Warrior I did have a problem with? I talked to him privately in /tells and found out he was used to pressing the taunt button every time it refreshes. I explained how taunt worked for him&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
when are you supposed to press it?<br />
<br />
Taunt on incoming to gain aggro, and establish aggro...usually takes beating on it + 2 taunts.<br />
<br />
Once you have aggro, hold off on taunting unless you lose aggro.  That way you can immediately regain aggro on a successful taunt if your mob runs off and attacks someone else.<br />
<br />
Warrior 101, from someone with a Warrior alt. ;)<br />
<br />
IMO, warriors do need a stronger taunt, to balance their ability to take aggro against pallies and SKs...and that's about it.<br />
<br />
Even the way they are now, a warrior can definitely hold aggro.  He just has to know how to do it.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Warrior is one of the classes with a higher learning curve when you get into high levels.</div></div><hr />

Most of the shaman I know can handle a few rounds from most of the mobs that a knight is likely to be tanking. After all, warriors are the ones that tank the big stuff, right? Of course, if knights are tanking the big stuff (hint, hint) then the disparity between knights and warriors needs addressed even more urgently than otherwise.<br />

Sorry, but this isn't going to cut it. Of course a good warrior can still tank. It's just much less reliable and requires more work from their groupmates. I know several good warriors that spend copious quantities of time looking for a group. They all know how taunt works, they all have the best aggro generation that they can acquire, they're still passed over for knights in exp groups. The sad thing is, even a crappy knight can keep aggro as well as a good warrior, if you tell them what spells to mem.</div></div><hr />

Alternatively the shaman might learn about the proper combination of MR debuffs and timing that would keep him alive without needing a tank that has excessive ability to aggro.<br />
<br />
The MT in my group is a warrior.  He isn't uber so there's no EB weapon to trivialise aggro management for me.  I prefer it that way - EQ can be very boring if everything is made easy.<br />

<br />
<br />
I voted for warrior only improvements just because I worry that SoE would hit knights too hard with the nerf bat.  However, I really don't like the agro lock that knights have now.  I think it trivializes the game and makes it less fun to play.  <br />
<br />
By the way, my 60 warrior is my main, so I'm very familiar with the current warrior issues.  Even though I'm playing a warrior, I always recruit a knight for ldon groups because of their pulling abilities and their ability to quickly lock agro if we get adds.  In some cases they are reasonably close to me in terms of tanking ability, although usually I'm clearly the better meat shield (in case you're curious...I have about 1200 ac and 4k hp unbuffed, and no AA's.)  <br />
<br />
My preference is either a slight reduction in knight spell agro or higher mana cost so they can't cast them constantly.  I'd also like to see a slight increase in the warrior taunt ability, and better warrior agro additions that can be obtained by the non-uber warriors, similar to the new warrior only anger augmentations in ldon (I'm probably a couple months away from getting these, but they sound great.)  <br />
<br />
I see more complex changes such as changing how disciplines work, implementing fighting stances, converting mana to hp, adding warcries, etc. as so potentially unbalancing that I'm hesitant to even suggest SoE seriously consider them (well...except mana to hp...I kinda like that one  :) )</div></div><hr />

What it really says is that taunt does nothing until you lose agro, at which point you have to hope you can position, taunt, have taunt succeed and not have the caster regain agro on the next tick (eg. from a DoT) before the target needs a rez.<br />
<br />
As opposed to the paladin version where they can lock agro instantly on incoming and proceed to build their agro lock during the combat with trivial effort such that they simply don't lose agro.<br />
<br />
If that isn't the best description of why taunt is broken I don't know what is. Also explains the absolute importance of taunt procs, not for instant agro but to retain it.</div></div><hr />

I'm a DAMN fine warrior. I do everything within my power to make my group the most effective, anywhere.<br />
<br />
If a caster dies, I explain to them that they have to work with me. That they need to tone it down a bit so they don't die. Or if it's a slower, I tell them to slow a little bit later so they don't get aggro right off the bat.<br />
<br />
If the cleric is getting low on mana middle of a fight I /disc defensive so the mob makes my HPs go down slower, allowing the cleric to med a few ticks more.<br />
<br />
It's not because we're bad at what we do. It's simply because people don't want to have to work with us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u209"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p209">Regarding taunt, and waiting to taunt until you lose aggro:<br />
<br />
It's debatable whether or not it is worthwhile to wait until you lose aggro to taunt.  Tests have been done and posted on the Steel Warriors forum that prove that taunt actually does add a minimum amount of hate, and it is cumulative;  a warrior that taunts a mob 15 times will not lose aggro instantly when someone else comes up and starts attacking.  Taunt does add aggro in and of itself, even when you are already at the top of the hate list.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Ok, I guess it's been decided that it's better to wait.  Still, this results in the warrior waiting to lose aggro before getting it back, which is a situation encountered far less often, and resolved far quicker, by knights.  Ideally, taunt should be active, and not reactive. <br />
<br />
The main issue with the taunt skill, that they also discovered during the same tests, is that there appears to be a maximum amount of hate that can be gained from taunt.  Meaning, it's not always going to catapult the warrior to the top of the aggro list, even when successful (of course, we've all known this since at least velious, but it's never really been quantified).<br />
<br />
Edit:  Well, sorry for the misinformation.  They hadn't gotten that far when I read through the thread.  Regardless, a successful taunt does not always put the warrior at the top of the hate list, which is detrimental to the tanking ability of warriors, and should be changed. <br />
<br />
Radically improving taunt (making it work more often/always, making it put the warrior far far above the second place aggro position, etc.) would likely make raids too easy.  Giving warriors a new taunt, in theory, would have the same effect.  Either, of course, would help in exp groups.  So, how do you improve a warrior's ability to tank in xp groups and hold aggro?<br />
<br />
Easy, do either of the above but make it subject the same level restrictions as taunt used to be before they made it so you can taunt something over your level, at level 60.  Meaning, either add some new &quot;100% success&quot; taunt code for warriors, or give them a new, additional taunt at level 50 or something, but make it only work on mobs that are the same or lower level than the warrior.  I'm not entirely aware of the level of mobs you see on raids in PoP, but I believe for the most part the trash mobs are 66+, aren't they?  I know for sure the gods are.  <br />
<br />
A new taunt / improved taunt AA that only works on mobs of equal or lesser level than the warrior would be the perfect fix for warriors in (most) xp groups.  In xp groups that are commonly killing stuff that is level 66+ (are there any?  /shrug), I don't think you're generally having warrior aggro problems anyway, because your warriors are better geared to obtain aggro lock.<br />
<br />
I've turned down groups on my shaman (and monk, who is 64) that were going to have warrior tanks of lower level than my characters.  I grouped with a level 63 warrior last night on my monk, and I suppose his heart was in the right place, but I had to give him aggro *every* *single* *fight* by feigning.  There was not a single fight that he was able to hold aggro on his own.  Sometimes I would get aggro back after the enchanter slowed sooner than he would, and that was without trying; had I been chaining instill doubt (yes, it's not all that reliable, but when it lands, it's a virtual guarantee of aggro), I could've grabbed aggro back before the warrior likely over 50% of the time (and yes, he lost it *every* fight that the enchanter slowed before ~80% health.<br />
<br />
The warrior was using a Windblade; I was using a Delightful Orb of Forgotten Magic and a WLK.  I'm hardly a DPS machine; I parsed my damage out that night to be ~88 dps, including procs.  When I used to have a Staff of Flowing Water (sold it to buy level 65 shaman spells heh), I would routinely grab aggro over warriors with a BoC; if it didn't proc within the first 10 seconds of the fight, I had aggro.  I had fights where I could (because of a failed feign /grr) keep aggro through 1-2 EB procs.  <br />
<br />
Itemization is obviously not the answer.  Most people don't think of a warrior first for an xp group tank, and there are some people (including me, usually) that will overlook warriors and wait for a knight to show up LFG when my group needs a tank.  It's annoying for my shaman, and it's annoying for my monk to group with a warrior tank.  I don't care how good their EB weapons are; they're not doing any good unless they proc.<br />

I think adding a second taunt, or an AA that dramatically improves taunt, both/either of which that would only work on mobs equal or lesser than the warrior's level, would do a lot to restoring the viability of warrior tanking in xp groups compared to knights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u210"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p210">Just to clear up a couple bit's of misinformation.<br />
<br />
It's debateable whether or not it is worthwhile to wait until you lose aggro to taunt. Tests have been done and posted on the Steel Warriors forum that prove that taunt actually does add a minimum amount of hate, and it is cumulative; a warrior that taunts a mob 15 times will not lose aggro instantly when someone else comes up and starts attacking. Taunt does add aggro in and of itself, even when you are already at the top of the hate list. <br />
<br />
A successfull taunt adds a very  small amount of hate, and it is still generally accepted that mashing taunt is a nono under most situations.<br />
<br />
The main issue with the taunt skill, that they also discovered during the same tests, is that there appears to be a maximum amount of hate that can be gained from taunt. Meaning, it's not always going to catapult the warrior to the top of the aggro list, even when successful (of course, we've all known this since at least velious, but it's never really been quantified). <br />
<br />
This is inacurate.  The test you are refering to can be found here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1811) , with a very nice summary here (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?postid=32130#post32130) .  What you are referring to is that early in the test, there was some real confusion as to why, with how the test was done, a successfull taunt did not mean getting agro...it was in fact taking 4 taunts.  One of the early theories was that there was a maximum amount that taunt could give you.  This in fact turned out not to be accurate.<br />
<br />
What was discovered was the idea of a Hatebonus, and that agro = hate + hatebonus.  A successfull taunt will give you hate = to whomever has the most(plus a small amount), but if the hatebonus is larger than that small amount, then you will still not have agro.  Things that give a hatebonus include:  being first to enter hate list, sitting(it is why there is such a thing as sit agro) and proximity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u211"><b>Porunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p211">Without knowing exactly how taunt works, suggesting a possible fix is tricky, but I'm bored and the idea just occurred to me, so here it is.  Give warriors a one-tick snare ability (innate and lvl dependent or AA) that does no damage and adds no hate, just gives them a few secs to hit taunt or have the taunt button refresh before the mob is out of melee range.  Just being one tic wouldn't step on a snarers toes, or if possible even make it not work on a mob that is fleeing.  Call it &quot;Grapple&quot; or whatever, adds a little utility/dimension to the class without being a big deal, and if it had an emote (Soandso grapples with his opponent), others would see it and step away from the mob for a sec and let it refocus on the warrior.</div></div><hr />

Taunt = hate of the current person on top of the list +1.<br />
<br />
So if you're getting hit by a mob, and you hit taunt, you get 1 hate. Which is soooo worth it.*<br />

If any warrior reads this quote, please, please disregard it!!  Mashing the taunt button is the absolute worst thing a warrior can do.  Taunt, if successful, puts you at 1 more hate than the rest of the crowd.  If you're at the top it adds a VERY MINIMAL amount of hate.  So what if you're at the top and it adds 1 more hate...that slow comes in too early and you'll still lose agro...but now you won't be able to hit the taunt button for 5 seconds because you were mashing it when you already had agro = dead slower! :o   <br />
<br />
Yes, there are some very bad players that post on Steel Warriors that say to mash the taunt button...all classes have people that don't know how to play...but don't listen to them!  <br />
<br />
I visit Steel Warriors almost daily (main is 61 warrior), and 99.9% of the people there will tell you not to mash the taunt button.<br />
<br />
In fact, if you don't mind the abuse, feel free to post the question on Steel Warriors...but get ready for the responses because the one thing us warriors really can't stand is warriors that give the rest of us a bad rep (it's already hard enough to find groups - except with people I've grouped with before.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The warrior was using a Windblade;  <br />
<br />
<br />
If you group with that warrior again, tell them to sell the windblade and get something for agro (windblade isn't it anymore.)  Greatstaff of Thunder is great for agro and runs about 1k on emarr.  If they want to dual wield, go with the Sword of the Bloodsworn and Copper Hammer of Striking - these run about 16k on emarr.  For dps try War Marshalls Bladed Staff - about 8k on emarr.  <br />
<br />
I use these weapons and I generally don't have agro problems.  Also, I hear the anger augs in ldon are great for agro (don't have them myself yet.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u214"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p214">There's one circumstance (the only one I can think of) where mashing the taunt button works well as a Warrior.  If you have a Beastlord pet using a high aggro proc, three or four procs will put the pet at the top of the hate list by several hundred points. (Since pets can't keep aggro if a player is in range, this isn't noticeable as a tank.)  At that point, taunting even though the mob is still aggroed on you will add considerably to your hate level.<br />
<br />
(Of course if the Beastlord pet stays on the mob through the whole fight there's no real need to hit taunt anyway.  The mob won't be going anywhere and will stay aggroed on you.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u215"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p215">As a seasoned ranger whose been tanking a lot in LDON recently (and owner of a 64 shaman) just wanted to throw my 2c in.<br />
<br />
When im forming a group, and we have a spot for a tank, i look for palys and SKs. If i cant find any, I tank. I can keep aggro in LDON better then any warrior. In adventures you need to move move move. Waiting for 20 seconds till the warrior gets agro will lose you adventures. <br />
<br />
I can NOT get agro off of SK/PALs even if im trying like the debil and they are just doin their normal, not anything special, casting thing. Heck, shaman can keep aggro better and those that are used to soloing hard hitting stuff would make better tanks then warriors.<br />
<br />
Me: Snare, attack, proc, flame lick, proc, tangling weeds, proc, proc, ice nuke, proc, tangling weeds, proc, proc, fire nuke, proc.<br />
<br />
Pally: Stun.<br />
<br />
Pally WINS.<br />
<br />
IMHO, the only place warriors have are for /disc defensive tanking the uber mobs and DPS in xp/adventure groups. They are THAT broken.<br />
<br />
Pal/sks are fine the way they are. They are a small step down below warriors in the ac/hp department, where they should be, and they dont get /disc defensive.<br />
<br />
Warriors need a taunt boost, or they need to make the Fungus Beast Gland things (drop in caller cycle in Fungus Grove with 10 charges of clicky instant snare) drop off of orc pawns.</div></div><hr />
