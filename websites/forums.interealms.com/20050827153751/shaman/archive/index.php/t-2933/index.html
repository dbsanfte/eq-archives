<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kivorn Teleri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello there. I'm a frequent lurker of these boards thanks to my shaman alt.<br />
As for this post, it's about rehashing the common pooled of shaman knowledge regarding stats. It's my hopeful intention that this thread can serve as database to direct people mistaken of the roles of the different stats.<br />
Why? Well. Simple. I'm a numbercruncher. I like optimizing my character. I like knowing what stuff do, what they don't, and by how much or how little. I also really hate urban legends.<br />
<br />
So I ask the inhabitants of the crucible to correct me in my misconceptions and if possible, turn this into a healthy debate regarding stats.<br />
<br />
Here's what I believe. Feel free to prove me wrong:<br />
<br />
ATK - Broken down into two numbers. Chance to hit and damage affection. Call of the predator would increase your chance to hit, but not your max damage or increase your modal damage.<br />
<br />
AC <br />
- Broken down into two numbers. Damage avoidance and damage mitigation. <br />
- Avoidance allows the blows to miss (a drolvarg rager tries to hit YOU but misses!).<br />
- Mitigation part lowers the modal damage done by said mob.<br />
<br />
Strength <br />
- Increases your modal damage.<br />
- Increases your maximum hit limit.<br />
- Can be used as an alternative stat for skillraises within smithing.<br />
<br />
Stamina<br />
- Increases your max HP<br />
- Increases your lung capacity<br />
- Stamina beyond 100 allows you to expect effects of fatigue except for the inability to jump.<br />
*Does NOT increase your damage mitigation*<br />
<br />
Agility<br />
- Increases your damage avoidance (see AC)<br />
- Used for skillgains on defensive combat skills<br />
*Does NOT* increase dodge, parry, disarm, dual wield, double attack.<br />
<br />
Dexterity<br />
- Increases your chance to proc with the mainhand weapon (not offhand)<br />
- Increases your archery to hit percentage<br />
- Increases the chance to score a critical hit<br />
- Used for skillgains on offensive combat skills<br />
- Can be used as an alternative stat for skillraises within fletching.<br />
*Does NOT* increase dodge, parry, disarm, dual wield, double attack.<br />
<br />
Wisdom<br />
- Determines mana for priest casters<br />
- Determines skillraises on tradeskills (if INT is not higher or an alternative stat is used)<br />
*Does NOT* affect skillgains for combat skills.<br />
<br />
Intelligence<br />
- Determines mana for priest casters<br />
- Determines skillraises on tradeskills (if WIS is not higher or an alternative stat is used)<br />
*Does NOT* affect skillgains for combat skills.<br />
<br />
Charisma<br />
- Determines the prices you recieve from merchants<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What, nothing about cha?<br />
<br />
I can only offer my own observations about int affecting skill gains.  I started Gloriana (barb shaman) and Amalthea (high elf cleric) on the same day, Thanksgiving, 1999.<br />
<br />
I played them back and forth while I tried to decide which one I wanted to be my main.  Amalthea had an int of 90+ whereas Gloriana is not the brightest of snow bunnies and has an int of 60.<br />
<br />
I noticed a profound difference in the speed in which Amalthea gained skills, like sense heading.  I'm a rabid fan of sense heading and continuously clicked it whenever playing either character.  It maxxed for each level much faster for Amalthea than it did for Gloriana, the difference was significant (to me).<br />
<br />
I know people keep saying int doesn't matter, but my own experiences make me think it does.<br />
<br />
But then again, Wildaar thinks cha makes slow land easier, so who knows?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Let me add a few details.  :)<br />
<br />
STR:  I thought it only increased max/modal damage for tank classes- priests and robes don't get the bonus.  Can anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
STA:  Increases your HP by the following formula:<br />
Warriors:   HP = Base-HP + STA * (level / 10)<br />
Priests:      HP = Base-HP + STA * (level / 20)<br />
Robes:       HP = Base-HP + STA * (level / 30)<br />
Hybrids:   ??<br />
<br />
AGI:  Related to AC and level through the following table (note- this clearly slows the need for having your AGI above 75.)<br />
                 Level 40+     Level 20-39     Level 7-19     Level 1-6<br />

Int:  Stat that determines skill raises for all spell casting skills.  Pretty sure it also affects general skills such as swimming, sense heading, etc.<br />
<br />
Cha:  Gives better prices for buying and selling up to a point (Once Cha hits about 110 (I forget exactly) it maxes at effectiveness).  Also suppose to help with charming and perhaps some mesmerizing.  The latter is very highly debated among Enchanters.<br />
<br />
And out of curiosity, where was it posted or stated that higher Int/Wis reduces fizzling?  I have never heard of it and have my doubts.  Take no offense to it, just inquiring.<br />

<br />
My wisdom isn't that great but I don' t suffer from high fizzle rate.  Some where in that equation there has to be some reference to your spell type level (conjuration, abjuration, etc.)  I feel that level of spell skill, level of spell and level of character is much more important role than int or wis for fizzles, but that's my own experiences and opinion, nothing in concrete facts.<br />
<br />
I think we all can report various stories about trade skill increases with int vs wis.  I have trained atleast 3 different characters in blacksmithing and there is a difference between high and low values but I have yet to find int or wis more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My understanding is that STR does not increase modal damage, just max (and mean).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>philni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;Strength <br />

<br />
This isn't consistent with the various reports I've read.  As you state, we all agree max dmg is raised and as a result, raises average dmg a little.<br />
<br />
Some argue your 'below modal' hits tend to be closer to modal or your 'above modal' hits average more (this one seems reasonable).<br />
<br />
On the other hand rogue BS and the monk 'special' attacks seem directly related to str (both max and average hit raises linearly).<br />

<br />

<br />
-Used for skillsgains for various skills (including languages).  I think it's only Int but it COULD be higher of Wis/Int.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I believe that attack is not a composite of 2 numbers.  I think it's just one.  Yes, an increase in attack skill does mean you hit more.  I know there is a lot of conjecture about it, but I believe it is the same for mobs and players in this case.  If you recall from AC softcap threads, the soft cap on AC is dependent on the attack level of a mob.  The higher the attack skill, the more AC you require.  Higher attack means that the AC of the mob (or player) does less damage mitigation--hence more damage.  You can play around with avatar and get those numbers.  I have a monk friend that doesn't like avatar at all on raids.  She's at 1431 attack, but with avatar (and 1531) she can't attack because she gets too much agro).  However you cut the cookie, avatar will increase the average damage noticeably--even on tanks with maxxed strength.  I believe it is more correct to say that attack numbers determine the AC mitigation of damage of the target--and AC determines misses and amount of damage both.<br />
<br />
AC--see prior paragraph<br />
<br />
Strength--I may be mistaken, but I believe that strength does not affect the speed at which you learn, but gives you a higher chance at making a successful combine.  Think of it as a +smithing mod.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Broken down into two numbers. <br />
- Last FF, VI programmers said it's actually 4 numbers. Is it true? or is it not? Who knows. The fact that people argue about softcap this and softcap that, seems to indicate that there is more than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
Also I think ATK is a composite of 3 things:<br />
- STR, weapon skill, offense skill.<br />
<br />
--and AC determines misses <br />
- I think ... Hit miss ratio is based on level, AC is to mitigate damage. To avoid hits you need proper level and defense skill plus dodge, parry block and whatnot. AC might also mitigate damage to 0 so you &quot;don't&quot; get hit because of high AC.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Str<br />
- Increases your maximum hit limit. <br />
                         - Can be used as an alternative stat for skillraises within smithing. <br />
<br />
These are both correct.<br />
<br />
With a Warrior as my main I do notice and can document raised damage max with increased str.  Criticals land for more consistantly.  I need to do more log parsing to confirm if modal damage is truly increased though.  I do believe so but this is only my belief at this time.<br />
<br />
Also, it is an alternate for Smithing skill ups if your int is low.<br />
<br />
I have been doing smithing and with a int of 65 and wis of 70 I am one dumb dude.  But the frequency of skill ups is incredible and more than noticable with the higher str you go.<br />
<br />
Typically started with 140st and the difference between 140st 65int 70wis and 248st 65int 70wis was significant.  Over twice the frequency of skill ups.  Guild mates as well have noticed and use str boosts to help with Smithing skill ups.<br />
<br />
I wish I could remember where it was stated, but it was stated in a couple of places that only the highest of the two was considered.  So if your int/wis is higher than your str that is used.  If you str is higher than int/wis str is used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BTW there are 2 parts to attack, just as there are 2 parts to AC.<br />
<br />
ATK is made up of a component that determines chance to hit, and a component that determines damage distribution. Pure atk buffs modify the damage distribution part. <br />
<br />
AC is made up of a component that determines chance to hit, and a component that determines damage distribution. Pure AC buffs modify the damage distribution part.  <br />
<br />
I've heard those different components called hit/hurt and miss/soak for other systems.<br />
<br />
Those components can themselves be made up of other components. Avoidance AC is made up of defense skill and AGI, for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">&quot;Chance to hit and damage affection. Call of the predator would increase your chance to hit, but not your max damage or increase your modal damage. &quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Attk buffs like predator, the shammy group sow/attk, wolf form do indeed increase your average damage.<br />
<br />
I don't have logs to back it up, but I can tell you on my myrmidon, attk boosts mean I hit for more on average-it doesnt increase my max hit however. Becomes especially apparent on crits. I run into the same thing with my monk, where it shows up most often on fkick(tkick). Average goes ^ with attk buff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As far as i know, the only thing that affects hit percentage is your weapon skill.  Most likely the &quot;offense&quot; skill does also.  Attack buffs like avatar, call of the predator, wolf form, etc increase your average damage per hit... not your hit percentage.  I don't think this was always the case, but it is now.  Remember VI is constantly making changes to the game.<br />
<br />
As far as strength goes, my studies on my monk always showed a much larger affect on special attacks like flying kick then with normal hits.  Rogues report the same thing.  I'd imagine other melee classes get the same thing with their kick attacks, but that damage is so small anyway it doesn't really matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When i solo - and i buff my agi (rage + agi = around 100agi gained) i get an agi around 210 - and mobs miss me a LOT less when they try to hit...<br />
<br />
And its not just because of the extra AC the 100 agi gives - ive tried to use AC only buffs with no agi buff to check this out - and with the same amount of AC i was hit way more than when i did have my agi buffed...<br />
<br />
so imho:<br />
AGI = Helps for avoiding being hit<br />
AC = Reduced damage taken when hit, and if damage is reduced beyond 1dmg  (0 or less) THEN the message will show up as a &quot;miss&quot;.</div></div><hr />
