As for the &quot;racing&quot; thing.  Let's just say that if they tried that on my raid, we'd engage pretty fast or send a monk over their way with a few extra nasty mobs we didn't have time to deal with . . . And call it &quot;kiting&quot; of course.  <br />

What I really hate tho, are AE groups.  I hate them more than anything else.  Since wizards like to do them, pull massive  trains over anyone else in the zone, laugh about it when they take all mobs that 5 different groups were killing . . . lag up the zone something fierce . . . the list goes on.

 everything from the fan faire suggests that VI won't fix this broken ability <br />
<br />
These winners are on my server too Bahimiron. /Cry I am so ashamed. I Never thought that i would be one to call for a nerf until i read this.<br />
<br />
I really hoped there was some way for wizards to keep manaburn as i know they really needed a bone tossed to them but its gotten a bit out of hand. When you see a group of wizards take down or KS a Kunark dragon in a couple minutes without the tactics, risk, or other class support that we have gotten used to, you just feel like something is seriously wrong with the ability.<br />
<br />
This kind of thing just makes it harder for the guilds who are just now starting to attempt Kunark Dragons. I have to say i see a serious problem with the ability as it stands right now vs low hp Kunark draggie mobs. I Wish they would just adjust it vs the Kunark dragons, and not nerf the hell out of manaburn. Heck its nice to know you have a few mana burners in your back pocket when your going up against a high HP mob, but i dont think they should be able to replace all classes.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately from things said at  the fan faire it looks like VI in its infinite wisdom thinks everything is perfectly fine with manaburn as it is now, and that it is here to stay. I wonder if VI would still feel that way after being showed that link?<br />

<br />
As for fixing manaburn, I've heard several good solutions before, and then another one in this thread (Bullwolf's suggestion of scaling the effect of manaburn based on a mob's HP).  I also like the following ideas:<br />
<br />
-Giving certain mobs a manaburn immunity flag, or at least a certain resistance to it.<br />
<br />
-Giving manaburn a &quot;buff&quot; effect similiar to the one from the CH on Donal's Breastplate.  Each manaburn gives the mob one of these buffs, and if the mob has three of them, it becomes immune to manaburn (or maybe it gets 25% immunity to future manaburns from each buff, or something).<br />
<br />
-Limit the amount of damage manaburn can do to a mob.  For instance, make it not work until the mob is at 50% life (or since that would screw it's uses in exp groups, make it only work until the mob is at 50% life).<br />
<br />
I'm sure Verant could come up with more solutions, if they really wanted to.  However, this is not a coding problem (as group shrink with a confirmation box supposedly is), its a motivation problem.  For one reason or another (let your imagination run wild), the developers really don't believe manaburn needs to be fixed/nerfed.  I just hope they know something I don't, like that every class will get similiar power in PoP or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Originally posted by Bullwolf <br />

<br />
<br />
Actually, after seeing this link I posted to the developers forum, giving them a link and saying something to the effect of &quot;is this really what you guys intended?&quot;  I highly recommend others do the same.  If we don't tell Verant how we feel, we can't expect them to change things.  Granted, they have said that they won't nerf manaburn, but then again they also said they would never remove hell levels.  *shrug*.  In the end, its in their best interest to do what's best for the game, and I think they really do try to.  We players just need to help tell them when they fail from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Flagging Gore immune would fix it.  Nothing else really needs to be changed.  Manaburn is something I'm glad that at least 4 of our wizards have.  It makes dragons which are immune to normal spell attacks die swiftly.  It makes us able to kill bigger stuff faster.  We dropped Lord Vyemm last night in NToV for our first time as a guild.  There was only one MB wizard there, but I'm sure it helped.  Vyemm seems to be immune to cold and poison attacks, so I just healed the MA the whole fight.  And refreshed Plague of Insects from time to time.  <br />
But hey, a first for the guild and I was there.  That's two firsts in two weeks!  Tunare and Vyemm.  All that's left outside of Luclin is the AoW.  Actually both kills were messy, but having done it once we'll do em again and we'll do em better.  Vyemm was in flee mode for about 30 seconds haha.  I was wishing I had Rabid bear at that point hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What really made me laugh is that if you hire them to kill something, they get the loot, then sell it to you. (&quot;sure, 10k for one of us to take down Gore, and another 75k for what else she drops&quot;) If you pay 120k for them to take down a Kunark Mob, then take all the loot cept the one piece you want so there is no way you can hire them again by selling the loot you get? Thats like paying them 250k to take down a mob by themselves...</div></div><hr />

It's not exactly a good thing, but it isn't game-altering.  As far as I know, manaburn is not overpowering at all when applied to luclin content.  I could be wrong, but manaburn is not nearly as efficient as their uber nukes - just faster (good for when a mob needs to die NOW).<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind if they flagged the kunark dragons to only be manaburnable once, but beyond that I don't think anything should be done.</div></div><hr />

Not sure about other servers but my guild has sent tells to other guilds telling them if a primal is rotting that we don't need (usually 2hs or spell), and they do the same as well.   If the person that bought the key had a decent rep and was in a smaller guild or even indy, I wouldn't see why they couldn't help out on a raid, its @#$% hard enough to get people to go to that cesspool of a zone anymore.<br />
<br />
These guys must make a killing on playerauctions/ebay. I mean after making a few hundred thousand plat, why would you keep ganking these mobs over and over? Only reason I can think of is to sell for RL dough. <br />
<br />
Ever try being in a non-Uber guild and buying some top end gear?  Its going to take a bit more than a few hundred thousand plat.<br />
<br />
Recent Prices on Brell:<br />
Ring of Lighting - 120k<br />
White Dragon Helm x2 (need one for boots ;))- 400k<br />
Frostreaver's Embroidered Cloak - 90k<br />
Mask of the Dragonslayer - 90k<br />
Amulet of Necropotence - 100k<br />
SS or Kael Robe MQ - 50k<br />
<br />
Thats 850k, and thats just the beginning.  Now add in a twink or two and you can easily spend over a million plat on one character.<br />
<br />
<br />
At least they aren't shaman,  a few hundred thousand plat *might* be enough to buy you all your spells as a shaman :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You know . . . I could start a &quot;guild&quot; like this as well.  I'd recruit the best equipped most powerful PCs on the server of the &quot;right&quot; classes.  <br />
I figure about 10 of us could easily take down Talendor or Goreinaire, probably VS too.  Those dragons are cake if you have a shaman to slow them and everyone has super high resists.  Bring a bard along and AoEs cease to matter.  Given the super high melee damage possible with end game weapons, I think a two group raid of ubers could easily defeat anything in Kunark.  <br />
Have one person sell the lewt off and distribute to the people present.  Mercenaries for hire . . . . <br />
<br />
I hate to say it but the manaburn gig does make this concept much easier.  Still, can you imagine selling Trak teeth to people for VP keys?  Let alone the one or two bps that drop every damn time.  <br />
<br />
Whoa, this is a good idea!  The key would only be numbers of people.  If you had enuf to be online with sufficient force at almost any given time . . . well you'd get most of the kunark dragons, VS, and Trak every damn time they pop.

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
You cannot beat a handful of MB wizards to something with a conventional raid force. What was that saying about power corrupting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The biggest difference between wizards manaburning kunark dragons and the &quot;supposed&quot; ability of a single group of well equipped people to take out the same dragon is that with the manaburn wizards, there is absolutely no risk whatsoever. With the regular group, no matter how well they are equipped, there is still risk. The regular group has to deal with the damage from melee and AE, and the possibility of the RNG letting you get feared. With the manaburn wizards, they get their faction to ally with ring of scale and just stand next to the friendly dragon. Time their pressing of the button, and wham, dead dragon instantly. <br />
<br />
For those that might say that they deserve it for all the hard faction work that they do in Mistmoore or whatever, you are wrong. They do not need to spend days in mistmoore to get the faction to do this. It takes less than an hour for a person to go from max kos to ring of scale to max ally. That is how they are able to do this so often. <br />
<br />
The real problem comes when you try to think of exactly how to nerf manaburn. Surely, it should never have been added the way that it is. But since it is in the game, how do you nerf it for some encounters, but still keep its usefulness in largescale raid encounters? If you have 8 wizards with the manaburn ability in your guild, and you are fighting mobs such as AoW or whatever, and the choice is to have them manaburn AoW then something like the limiting buff on the mob making it so that it can only have 3 manaburns applied really will hurt your guild. When something goes terribly wrong and a mob is almost dead, but not quite, and most of the guild is dead as well, but a manaburn or two could finish him off. This would hurt you in these situations as well. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I think that at the least they need to put a HP limitation on manaburn. Mobs with under a certain amount of HP cannot be manaburned. It isnt like that is without precedent seeing as how dragonsbane and giantsbane both have HP limitations on the mobs that it can be used on. Where to go from there? I dont really know =/ But something has to be done imo.</div></div><hr />

I play on The Rathe.  I even had an argument about this kind of thing happening with a level 60 wizard who was 1 AA point from getting manaburn.  He said it NEVER happens thanks to the *MAGICAL* RTA that the GMs suppoesdly enforce... *rolls eyes*<br />
This is crap.  25k for tobrin's eyepatch.  It's not even that good!  Well, maybe for a cleric or a druid it's that good :)<br />
They'll never be able to sell most of that stuff though.  Not for the prices they're asking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I would have to agree that some sort of flag needs to be put on where certain mobs would be immune to it.  This does not negate its usefulness one bit because on those mobs wizards can still nuke with other spells.  As was posted earlier there is no RISK for wizards who MB Gore,Sev, or Talendor.</div></div><hr />

Assume Gorenaire is MB'd weekly by Wizards... <br />
<br />
Is that really fair if you are desperately trying to get your White Scale?<br />
<br />
I personally don't respect Manaburn. I believe it needs a nerf... perhaps the mob should be below a certain percentage of health, or flagged immune entirely. Hell, make it 50%... that way, you actually need to put some effort in on the mob (but MB can be a gaurenteed win if you get the mob to a certain level... thus justifying the skill.) But then again, I feel the same way about Dire Charm and how it corrupted skilled soloing. (*Cough* Kael Arena.)</div></div><hr />

Not to get off on religion or anything...but I think that is suppose to be applied to humans, not deities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, a good fix would be, make it so it wont work on mobs between 15 and 100k hps, that way, its still ok in normal exp groups, though I dont see a real big use in exp groups cept on named or something that need to die right away, and high end mobs, but wont work on sontalak or kunark dragons (Sont has 99k hps I believe).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">There is a very easy way to fix manaburn to allow it to be used on raids as intented and put an end to the greedy bastards.  Make manaburn give the mob a buff icon, that lasts for like 10-20 seconds.  Just like th CH bp icon, spell won't take effect if it already has it in effect.  Simple, effective.  It will put people like those linked here out of buisness withnout nerfing manaburn into uselessness.<br />
<br />
Yes, MB is a great ability.  No, it does not need to be nerfed, but it does need to be modified.  People like this (we have them on Terris too) stretch the rules and have a total lack of respect for other people. It's sad but is also a reflection of our society in general at this time.<br />
<br />
MB would not need any change if, and only if, people were nice enough not to steamroller over others preping for a kill.  Wipeouts are a different story.  True, its not against the rules, but thats not the point.   But alas, greed will prevent this from ever happening.</div></div><hr />

[Fri Aug 09 18:32:50 2002] Solomen says 'I have worked to chronicle everything from the beginnings of magic to what we consider the modern day of magic.  Solusek Ro has been very generous to those who wield magic in Norrath.  But throughout history there is one thing I have noticed - too much power corrupts the soul.  I have seen and documented that the strongest wizards and those closest to Solusek Ro become corrupted by their power.'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I don't think it's so much a problem that wizards CAN do it . . . it's a problem that wizards are RL people who are asses and are able to keep content from the people for whom it was intended.  It's kinda like giving a three year old kid a pin and telling him not to poke the cat with it.  It's just a matter of time before you have a bleeding *****.  . . . erm . . hehe.</div></div><hr />
