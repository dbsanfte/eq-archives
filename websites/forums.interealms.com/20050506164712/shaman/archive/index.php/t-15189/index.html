My husband is a cleric.. there are times when I have to go to bed and he is still playing in the group. I usually try to get a replacement shaman, but sometimes I have to get a chanter to slow. He said that he MUCH prefers shaman slow to enchanter slow.  He spends a lot more mana healing because the slow is not as good, and the chanter can't take hits if he gets aggro like us shamans can :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it depends on the make up of the group.  Clerics like Shams because we have the best slows and can heal them and others in case of an emergency where Enchanters can't.  All other casters preffer Enchs due to the KEI factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
Depends on the group &amp; location.  I've been passed up for guild enchanters as a slower in exp groups because it was a DC/CoD Enchanter and the cleric was very good.  If the enchanter knows what he's doing and the group is sensitive to his weaknesses (AC/HP), then they will do MUCH more DPS with an enchanter.  The difference in the 5% slow factor on non-mitigating mobs does not have an impact if the cleric is nuking every so often because he has extra mana.<br />
<br />
I've never been passed up for a beastlord to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
In other situations though, I'm slowing and healing w/ 5 others in the group.<br />
<br />
It doesn't really matter.  We're blessed with high desirability in groups for exp, and we have an important role in most raids (though we don't stack very well).  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Quick note to those not wanting to click on the link and also quite completely confused as to what those numbers mean.<br />
<br />
<br />
  It is the numbers from a poll on the Vazaelle boards (I assume that is a server?).  The number is how many voted for that class, and the percent is the percentage of the votes they have so far.   I guess the bar chart didn't cut/paste :P<br />
<br />
<br />
  Anyhow, all I know is EVERY group I have EVER been in has used a shaman to slow.<br />
<br />
  In unrelated news... I only play my shaman, no twinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyhow, all I know is EVERY group I have EVER been in has used a shaman to slow.<br />
<br />
Hehe, I'd hope so...  Certainly if a shaman is there, he should be the slower.  I think the poll is more along the lines of if you have a group with no slower, and need to pick from these slowing classes to add to the group, which would you pick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">With the new chanter runes and rune AA I'm quite impressed with how much punishment they can absorb these days. Especially considering that relative to the damage coming in Torpor / Quiscience doesn't seem nearly as powerful as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Having made a newbie cleric (L31) to group with friends in dungeons I'd rather have a good chanter using mez/stun to stop me taking damage than a shaman healing me. Don't expect this to change as we level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Everytime I've left a group where the chanter takes over slowing duties for me, the chanter has died. Either they've cast it too soon, or too late, or they've let haste drop yet AGAIN and get overwhelmed with how many things they have to do and forget to slow altogether.<br />
<br />
Chanters rock in so many ways, but slow is such a death wish for a class that can't tank a little. One resist and the chanter has more chance of dying than living.<br />
<br />
I can see people using the chanter to slow in an emergency, but outside of that a shaman will always be the king. Let the chanters sieve, mezz, stun and mind buff. That's more than enough for them to be doing without risking their life every single pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually...<br />
<br />
I've been in a BoT group where I was the main healer and chanter was slowing...<br />
<br />
It went well =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You could be the main slower and main healer of a group in BoT too.  I've been in many cases where I was the main healer in bot or tactics with an enchanter or beast lord in the group and I still won't them slow.  No one will take slow away from me when I'm in the group ;)<br />
<br />
If you haven't tried playing slower/healer in tier 2 and 3 yet you should definitely give it a try.  Granted you aren't going to be taking down any named (in most cases) but it makes experience grinding so much more tolerable.  It keeps you on your toes and after a little practice it isn't so hard.<br />
<br />
I think what sets us apart in the slowing department is that we can fulfill two of the very important roles in a group, slowing and healing.  Not to mention we can CC pretty damn well with root and really can do a fair amount of damage.  Add all that up and I don't know why anyone would choose anyone else for a slower in normal situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As one with a 52 Shammy and 61 Enchanter (see sig), I'd much rather see the Shaman slowing in a group. For one, this allows me to charm a MOB and use it for extra DPS. As was alluded too - with the new PoP spells, an Enchanter can take a lot of damage before they start taking damage.<br />
<br />
The problem is once a MOB has ripped through the Runes  et al, Enchanters (Even ones like mine who focus on HP and CON - yes you heard me), just lack the defensive skills, health and AC to tank 2 Tier-1 MOBs for very long. Stun - a great tool as is root, but sometimes ol stun ain't up to the task. <br />
<br />
Given a choice, I'd rather have a Shaman AND Enchanter in my group. At that point the other 4 slots can be filled with Orc Pawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was in a HOH entrance group last night where I was the healer and a BL was slowing.  The slow part was fine, unfortunately a 2k 10-sec heal is a little nervewracking healing a 5k tank in HOH.  The entrance mobs hit for 550 or so, so if they have a good run they can do a lot of damage in 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
Fortunately we got a 65 druid with healing AA's in and I could be the slower again :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You think that's tuff . . . trying being main healer in PoEarth.  Mobs only partially slow, hit for 750ish, and attack fast.  Was nail biting, but nobody died.  Needed a fast pally heal now and then tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've beein in PoEarth with a group of Rogue, Rogue, Ranger, Warrior, Warrior and I.<br />
<br />
Even with a horsie, it was quite the work to keep mana up, slow the mobs, not get squished and keep the MT healed. Quiessence helps ALOT ! having SCRM helps even more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The keys to that kind of situation would be how many HP the tanks have, whether the damage is steady or in bursts, and whether you have a spell cast haste item :-)<br />
<br />
My mobs were partial mitigating as well, and bursty - meaning if I waited until my 5k tank was at 60% health to cast, she was often below 20% or even 15% when the heal landed, which was not making her confident.  But if I cast at 70%, and the damage burst ended, I'd sometimes waste 700 or 800 points of healing power.  Having a pally would have helped a LOT, but a BL was my only backup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>slownsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">people like chanters cause they like their crack.   and who dosent?  and of course crowd control is always great to have.   but if the chanter isn't high enough level to have 1500+ hps worth of rune on at all times, they really can't take the beating that results from one or two resisted slows.  and often they don't have the mana to keep 4 mobs mezzed AND slow them all too.  so it is all really situation dependant.</div></div><hr />
