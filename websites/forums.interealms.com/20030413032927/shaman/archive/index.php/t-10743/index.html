<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When you hail Dar Collector Reokar he asks you for fish and rat ears . Well i thought hey cool a faction quest , so i start giving him fish cause im bored . Well after about a stack he says he doesnt need aymore and wants large severed rat ears . Im wondering how far this quest goes ..<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this yet ? Anyone even know where rat ears drop , i checked the swap and couldnt find any rats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They jumped ship with the last patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is another quest in there....not sure who it was (cause I'm at work and I just saw the quest right before I had to log off from lunch break).  But you hail the guy that is near the shaman spell vendors, and after giving him the proper saying, he asks for a rusty dagger, axe, sword, and spear.  I didn't have any of them on me for obvious reasons, so I didn't take it any further.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yup i found him too , im going to do that one once the servers come back up . =)<br />
<br />
i looked all over for &quot;severed rat ears&quot;<br />
<br />
nothing =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I give 4 rusty weapon to the named frog, and only gain exp, no faction hits<br />
<br />
Another quest need 4 fungus clumps(same as rog make poison herb) from fungus track man to make a suit special armor, reward is<br />
Fungus Flesh Sleeves: Ac 2 (Luclin version Cloth armor)<br />
<br />
There many trade skill vendors, however, I didn't find any forge or pottery wheel for tradeskills.<br />
<br />
There are 3 alchemy herb vendors, one of them sell Sea spirit(alchemy ver 1.0 herb)<br />
Froglok spell vendor HAD most Cle, Wiz, Pal 1~49 spell<br />
<br />
However, Shaman spells only reach lv 24, with their div spell like &quot;Serpent sight&quot;,  not sure where is other Shaman spells<br />
at Gukta<br />
<br />
There are animal trainer at Gukta, his pet is a &quot;water moccasin&quot; but died in a conflect with trolls.  Maybe Froglok will learn to be a Beastlord later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rat ears.... can't you get those off the rats in something like West/East Freeport newbie zone areas?? It's been a while since I've hunted there and all...<br />
<br />
Duurg<br />
Ghetto Oracle of Karana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hmm , well he askes for &quot;severed rat ears&quot;<br />
<br />
i was going to try that but got distracted takign revenge on the guards .. Ill go try that now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no dice =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I love how the ol' Troll Bouncers are scatterd through Gukta over various prisons that used to contain frogs or animals :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Animal Trainer's Snake did not die, it ran off, and is somewhere in Innothule Swamp (I looked for a while last night to no avail)  Its a giant water moccasin, might or might not be named, but the frog called her something with an Ssa, something like that.  You basically kill her and loot her pendant and give it back to the froggy, from what I read.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I really hope that this is not forever with Grobb being turned into Gukta.<br />
<br />
I know it sounds silly but I've always loved my home city.  Can work on tradeskills in peace there and there is zero lag ever.<br />
<br />
I can understand it for a few weeks as a storyline but I'll be very disapointed if it is forever.  Is it that hard to make a new starting cty zone ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">give time for LoY to come out before you get upset about not having a new starting city</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The collection thing works in an interesting way. When he has enough of an item, he wont take anymore. I dont recall all he takes, but if hes not rewarding you for say, rusty daggers, he has his quota of rusty daggers filled, so give him rat ears. Its the beginning of npc's understanding supply/demand. LOL, I say we petition to change his name to Greenspan.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cevyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14"></div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">/agree FloppyDisks<br />
<br />
Grobb was a really cool town, a TROLL town, made in the rock <br />
<br />
But let s see what will be our next new home</div></div><hr />
