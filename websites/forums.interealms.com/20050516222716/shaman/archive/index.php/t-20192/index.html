The following is my personal analysis of the current state of the high end shaman. It does not necessarily represent the views of other shaman who post here or of the Crucible as a whole.<br />
<br />
It is written from the point of view of a post-time shaman. As such it deals mainly with high end issues. Please do not attempt to apply my conclusions to such places as BoT, Cazic Thule etc.<br />
<br />
It is applicable for parts of PoP, hard LDoN adventures, LDoN raids and GoD, especially the single groups trials.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Part 1 - Versatility vs Power<br />
<br />
One of the shaman's biggest strengths is supposed to be his versatility. We have a great number of abilities we can use. Most other classes have far fewer options. The questions is, &quot;How versatile does one have to be to make up for lost power?&quot; or conversely, &quot;How powerful do my extra options have to be for my versatility to be useful?&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are a few different types of abilities - some abiltities you either have or have not. Spells like Levitation or Ressurection or abilities like Invisibility fall into this category.<br />
Other abilities are innate, like tanking ability or a necromancer's mana regeneration.<br />
And yet other abilities are mutually exclusive, meaning using one of them makes using other such abilities impossible. Healing, doing damage and shaman mana regenration fall into this category.<br />
<br />
The first category is pretty easy to evaluate - any extra ability will be just as useful to a class as the first ability.<br />
<br />
The second category is similar, though additionally these abilities have a degree to their usefulness, like warriors tanking better then knights. However extra abilities are still as useful as the first ability and a more powerful ability is more useful.<br />
<br />
The third category is radically different. Adding new such abilities to a class will provide more options but every such ability after the first is less useful then the previous. In game terms, being able to heal is very good. Being able to heal and nuke is a decent bit better. Being able to heal and nuke and mez is a tiny amount better. Being able to heal and nuke and mez and stun is still better but by such a small amount as to not matter.<br />
<br />
Thus a class that can nuke for x amount and heal for y amount is (all other abilities being equal) strictly worse then then a class that can nuke for 2x or a class that can heal for 2y. Basically, for versitility to be useful any exclusive abilities have to be quite close to the benchmark (usually the best ability).<br />
Let me show a few (simplified) examples:<br />
- A cleric's CH heals for 7500, a druid's for 4680 and a shaman's for 1950. It is generally agreed that a druid CH is acceptable as a substitution for a cleric CH in most situations. Thus the druid's versatility is useful in this case. A shaman CH however is nowhere close to the cleric CH and thus, while not useless per se, is not worth losing other abilities for.<br />
- A shaman's best strength buff is Ferine Avatar at 140 strength. A ranger's strength buff adds 35 strength. Even though this is not an exclusive ability, the ranger buff is so far behind the shaman buff that it's loss would hardly be noticed.<br />
<br />
The above examples are of course oversimplified in the extreme. They do however illustrate one of my main points:<br />
An exclusive ability should be within 30% of the top ability in question to be a viable alternative. A nonexclusive ability should be within 50% of the top ability in question to be a viable alternative. Else the ability will be better left to others.<br />
<br />
In game terms:<br />
Druids can in many situations act as a main healer instead of a cleric (main healer being defined as having a large CH-type spell within 30% of a cleric's).<br />
<br />
Shaman are not able to do this in a large part of the content (because their CH-type spell is not in this range).<br />
<br />
Paladin buffs are an acceptable substitute for cleric buffs as the stats are within 50% of cleric buffs.<br />
<br />
That being clarified let me explain a few key problems of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
A shaman is to a certain extent a jack of all trades. Shaman have a large variety of spells for a lot of situations. Many of these spells used to be pretty close to the best spells in their category. Expansion by expansion many of these spells have been scaled back compared to other classes' spells until today shaman spells are often the worst in their category.<br />
All the versatility in the world is useless when all the options are third class or worth in their category.<br />
<br />
- Shaman HP buffs are the weakest of any class (tied with rangers).<br />
- Shaman healing is tied for third place with paladins (only beastlords and rangers heal worse) and is solidly past the 30% difference from cleric healing to be considered a viable alternative.<br />
- Shaman nuking is the weakest of all casters.<br />
- Shaman DoTs are solidly behind necromancer DoTs and (due to resist modifiers) behind druid DoTs.<br />
<br />
That leaves a shaman with stat buffing, slowing and haste as tier 1 / 2 abilties.<br />
- Stat buffs are largely useless due to caps.<br />
- A very large part of this (and the last 2) expansion mitigates slow. Even a minor slow mitigation easily halves the effectiveness of slow.<br />
- Haste is still pretty useful.<br />
<br />
This is part one of the shaman problem. There is two things shaman do really well - buff stats and slow, both of which is getting more useless every expansion.<br />
As an example for versatility done right consider the bard. A bard is among the best at<br />
- hasting (first)<br />
- mana regeneration (first)<br />
- crowd control (close second)<br />
- pulling (first)<br />
- resist buffs (first)<br />
- damage shields (first)<br />
- slows (4th but within 30% of the top slower)<br />
This is why bards are a great class. They are actually good at what they can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Part 2 - Active mana regeneration<br />
<br />
Just about anything a shaman can do seems to have been designed with cannibalize in mind. Whenever a shaman complains about any of his abilities one of the arguments invariably is &quot;but you can cannibalize&quot; (the other being &quot;but you have slow&quot;).<br />
<br />
Cannibalize does have a major problem though. As noted above cannibalize os one of our mutually exclusive abilities. While we are cannibalizing we are not doing anything else. This used to be no problem at all back in Kunark - back then med breaks were common, every caster conserved their mana and cast spells sparingly, giving shaman the time to cannibalize without falling behind.<br />
<br />
Apparently this was deemed to powerful and every shaman spell since Kunark is, compared to the upgrades other casters got, more expensive as well as slower casting and has a lesser effect.<br />
<br />
Fast forward to today. Whereas a healer used to be expected to cast a heal or two every minute they are now required to spend half of their time casting. Similar things are expected of the damage classes.<br />
Now, given slower casting times and lesser effects a shaman will easily spend not 50% but 80% of his time casting these spells and still pay more mana for them. He now has little time left to cannibalize the additional mana back.<br />
<br />
This not only puts the shaman on par or below over long durations, it also means that shaman burst healing or damage capabilities are much less then other classes' abilities - and burst healing and burst DPS are becoming more and more critical in the last expansions.<br />
<br />
This is part two of the shaman problem. We simply do not have enough time to use our active mana regeneration if we want to match or even come close to other classes' capabilities.<br />
<br />
______________________________<br />
numbers for the above<br />
<br />
At first glance shaman mana regeneration seems impressive.<br />
Cannibalize IV will bring back 82 mana every 5.5 seconds.<br />
In addition the cannibalisation skill will generate 1066 mana every 3 minutes.<br />
This adds up to a total 3712 mana every 3 minutes, or 124 mana per tick<br />
<br />
Druids on the other hand only regain 12 mana per tick (Blessing of the 9 + Mask of the Forest).<br />
<br />
Now let me show you a scenario - we will compare sustained shaman nuking to a druid's. I chose nukes for my comparison because the druid DoT spells have a resist modifier, which is hard to account for.<br />
<br />
Both the shaman and the druid will have a mana preservation item (10% average), an improved damage item (10% average) , a spell haste item (10% fixed), flowing thought 15,  and mental clarity 3. Both will use a horse. In addition the shaman has the cannibalisation AA.<br />
Both will be buffed with Blessing of the 9, Voice of Quellious and Spiritual Dominion. In addition the druid will be buffed with Mask of the Forest.<br />
I will assume assume neither shaman nor druid are specialized in evocation (thus a 3% mana saving on all spells).<br />
<br />
To account for the nature of cannibalizing I will first compute the shaman mana regeneration as if he was doing nothing but generate mana and then add to the cost of each spell he casts the mana he could have generated in that time.<br />
<br />
Shaman mana regeneration:<br />
One cast of breath of Trushar costs 285 mana and heals 4*360 =1440 damage.<br />
Focused mana cost is 214.<br />
That is enough damage healed to offset 9.7 casts of cannibalize IV.<br />
One of these cycles generates (9.7*82)-214=583 mana and takes (9.7*4.75)+7.95=54.2 seconds.<br />
Shaman mana regeneration from cannibalize IV is thus 10.8 mana per second or 65 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
The cannibalisation AA will bring back 1066 mana at the cost of 1924 damage. Healing this damage with Breath of Trushar takes 1.34 casts, which costs 287 mana. The total mana generated by one cycle of cannibalisation is 779 every 3 minutes, or 26 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
The shaman's mana regeneration over 3 minutes is thus 779 (from cannibalisation) + 1909 (from 177.5/54.2=3.27 cycles of cannibalize IV) = 2688 mana every 3 minutes, or 90 mana per tick (14.93 mana per second).<br />
<br />
Now, this was the mana from cannibalizing - added to this is the mana from the above sources (same for druid and shaman).<br />
<br />
28 (meditation mana at lvl 65) + 8 (Blessing of the 9) + 18 (Voice of Quellious) + 9 (Spiritual Dominion) + 15 (Flowing thought) + 3 (Mental Clarity) + 4 (Mask of the Forest; druid only).<br />
<br />
This brings total mana regeneration per tick to<br />
171 (shaman)<br />
85 (druid)<br />
<br />
Now let us compare the nuke spells available to both classes.<br />
<br />
The shaman will be using Velium Strike.<br />
Velium Strike does 925 damage every 10.05 seconds. Accounting for focuses and specialisation brings this to 925*1.1=1018 damage every (7.8*0.9)+2.25=9.3 seconds for 300*0.87=261 mana. We do also lose 9.3 seconds worth of cannibalize mana, which amounts to a total mana cost of 400.<br />
A shaman can thus cast Velium Strike every 400/171=2.3 ticks, or every 14 seconds, which amounts to 1018/14=72.9 DPS.<br />
The shaman's burst DPS is 1018/9.3=109 DPS.<br />
<br />
The druid will be casting Sylvan Fire.<br />
Sylvan Fire does 1705 damage for 430 mana every 9 seconds. The numbers adjusted for focuses are 1705*1.1=1876 damage for 430*0.87=374 mana every (6.75*0.9)+2.25=8.3 seconds.<br />
A druid can thus cast Sylvan Fire every 374/85=4.4 ticks, or every 26 seconds, which amounts to 1876/26=72.2 DPS.<br />
The druid's burst DPS is 1876/8.3=226 DPS.<br />
<br />
Now, this is over an infinite timespan. If we instead allow for a med break every 20 minutes both the druid and the shaman can also empty their mana pool.<br />
A mana pool of 6000 mana emptied over 20 minutes amount to another 30 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
With this extra mana the shaman damage rises to 1018 every 400/191=2.1 ticks for a DPS of 1018/(2.1*6)=81.3 DPS.<br />
The druid damage rises to 1876 every 374/115=3.3 ticks for a DPS of 1876/(3.3*6)=96.1 DPS.<br />
<br />
So even chainnuking for 20 minutes straight the shaman does not match druid nuking damage. Chainnuking for literally an eternity the shaman pulls ahead of the druid by less then a percent.<br />
<br />
Note that this shaman has no lag at all, does not stop casting for even a quarter of a second, never overheals his cannibalize damage and never fizzles. He also magically finds something to cast in the 0.75 seconds between casting cannibalize IV and the cannibalize IV gem refreshing and he never moves.<br />
The druid on the other hand is only casting 30% of the time and thus has ample time to move or make up for lag or fizzles.<br />
<br />
Neither character is using resists debuffs - this would skew the results further in favor of the druid due to their cheap and fast fire debuff line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Part 3 - Mana regeneration for everyone<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration is supposedly the area where shaman excel and we do have the biggest potential mana regeneration. The ratio of shaman to non-shaman mana regeneration has shifted a lot though.<br />
Every casting class now has some mana regeneration buff now, many of them castable on others and many of them stacking. Flowing thought gear is easy to get nowadays. Horses add a large amount of mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
Now, all of these are usable by shaman too. But every time a fixed amount of mana regeneration is added to everyone the shaman suffers. We were balanced to regenerate not a fixed amount more mana then other classes but to regen a multiple of it, and this multiple is shrinking with every expansion since Kunark.<br />
<br />
At the same time this ontributes to problem two - the more mana everyone regenerates the more a shaman is expected to do, further reducing the time to cannibalize and thus reducing the advantage in mana regeneration even further.<br />
<br />
This is part three of the shaman problem. Our mana regeneration, while impressive on paper, is not nearly enough to sustain our ineffective, inefficient, slow spells to a degree where we can pull our weight in groups. This is getting worse every time more flowing thought gear enters the world, every time bigger mana regeneration buffs are created and every time another horse is bought.<br />
<br />
_____________________<br />
numbers for the above<br />
This is a comparison of the mana regeneration available during Kunark and today. It is listed in mana per tick. The last column shows the upgrade percentage. The figures for magicians, shaman and necromancers do not account for damage taken  and the magician figures do not account for the mana cost of generating mod rods. This is mainly a comparison of the various upgrades the classes received, and thus the results should still be valid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman       72 self                     89 self                 +  24%<br />
Enchanter    11 self   11 group          18 self   18 group      +  64%<br />
Necromancer  31 self                     50 self   30 group      +  61%<br />
Bard                   14 group                    21 group      +  50%<br />
Druid         3 self                     12 self    8 group      + 300%<br />
<br />
(Magicians are not listed in this table as the recast time of their mod rod was added later.)<br />
<br />
These classes had the following mana regeneration abilities added since Kunark<br />
<br />
Shadowknight           10 group<br />
Beastlord     9 self    9 group<br />
Wizard        8 self<br />
Cleric        8 self<br />
Paladin       3 self<br />
Ranger        3 self<br />
Magician                9 group<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can easily see shaman have received the least upgrade to their mana regeneration (in addition to profiting less from flowing thought and other classes' buffs then all other classes).<br />
<br />
Mana regeneration used to be precious, an ability few classes had in any form. Today literally every class that can cast spells has a form of mana regeneration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Part 4 - Casting times &amp; Impact<br />
<br />
The obvious general spell design for a class with active mana regeneration would have been expensive but fast casting spells so as to leave time to make up for the mana. Shaman spells however are slow, inefficient and have a lesser effect then comparable spells of other classes.<br />
<br />
Shaman are thus simply unable to match the short term damage or healing output of other classes. These days &quot;short term&quot; might as well be defined as &quot;anything under 5 minutes&quot;. That is the point where other classes might start to go out of mana. It does not mean a shaman starts to overtake a cleric's healing or a necromancer's damage. This is where a shaman starts to catch up. With the inefficient and low impact spells shaman get catching up to either over any length of time is simply impossible.<br />
<br />
This is part four of the shaman problem. Slow casting times and low impact spells prevent us from matching anyone at all in the short term and from ever catching up to the top classes in the long term.<br />
At best we can hope to catch the secondary healers or secondary damage dealers in the long term - however these long term fights do not exist anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
_________________<br />
healing numbers<br />
<br />
I will compare the nuking and healing capabilities of the priest classes over 1 minute, 2 minutes and 5 minutes. The comparison will look at single targets heals only, as druids and shaman do not have group heals.<br />
I will also list paladin capabilities for the one minute period - I do not know where meditation caps for paladins so any long term numbers would be off (though certainly behind shaman numbers due to their inefficient single target heals).<br />
<br />
I will be using the same numbers for this scenario as above (10% average focus items for heals, nukes, mana preservation and spell haste, specialisation: alteration for all classes.). The mana regeneration for the classes is:<br />
174 (shaman)<br />
 85 (druid)<br />
 81 (cleric)<br />
(for details see above)<br />
<br />
The shaman will be using these heals:<br />
Tnarg's Mending<br />
1430 HPs healed in 5.6 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 422.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar<br />
1440 HPs healed in over 24 seconds with a cast time of 7.7 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 331.<br />
(for the concept of adjusted mana cost see above)<br />
<br />
The druid will be using these heals:<br />
Karana's Renewal<br />
4680 HPs healed in 12.25 seconds with a mana cost of 510.<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion<br />
2310 HPs healed in 5.6 seconds with a mana cost of 375.<br />
<br />
The cleric will be using these heals (I will assume CH lands for 5K):<br />
Complete Healing<br />
5000 HPs healed in 12.25 seconds with a mana cost of 340.<br />
<br />
Holy Light<br />
3603 HPs healed in 5.6 seconds with a mana cost of 488.<br />
<br />
The paladin will be using these heals<br />
Light of Order<br />
1100 HPs healed in 3.25 seconds with a mana cost of 387.<br />
<br />
Light of Nife<br />
935 HPs healed in 3.25 seconds with a mana cost of 360.<br />
<br />
Light of Order + Light of Nife<br />
2035 HPs healed in 6.5 seconds with a mana cost of 747.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 minute:<br />
Shaman:<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*171(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 7710<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Tnarg's Mending 60/5.6= 10.71 times for a total of 10.71*1430= 15315 HPs healed with 3190 mana left over.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*85(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 6850<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Sylvan Infusion 60/5.6= 10.71 times for a total of 10.71*2310= 24740 HPs healed with 2834 mana left over.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*81(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 6810<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Holy Light 60/5.6= 10.71 times for a total of 10.71*3603= 35932 HPs healed with 1584 mana left over.<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
Total mana to spend = unknown - I am going to assume it is enuff for 1 minute of alternating Light of Nife and Light of Order<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Light of Nife + Light of Order 60/6.5= 9.23 times for a total of 9.23*2305= 21275 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 minutes:<br />
Shaman:<br />
The shaman is not running out of mana yet thus he heals double the above amount for a total 30630 HPs healed<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Total mana to spend = 20*85(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 7700<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast Karana's Renewal 3 times and Sylvan Infusion 6170/375= 16.45 times for a total (4680*3)+(2310*16.45)= 52040 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Total mana to spend = 20*81(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 7620<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast Complete Healing 3.5 times and Holy Light 6430/488=13.18 times for a total (5000*3.5)+(3603*13.18)=64988 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 minutes:<br />
Shaman:<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*171(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 14550<br />
<br />
Keeping up Trushar is 300/24= 12.5 casts of Trushar for 12.5*331= 4138 mana. That leaves 10412 mana for 10412/422= 24.67 casts of Tnarg's Mending.<br />
This will heal a total of (12.5*1440)+(24.67*1430)=53278 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*85(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 10250<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast Karana's Renewal 10250/510= 20.1 times for a total 4680*20.1= 94068 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*81(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 10050<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast Complete Healing 22 times and Holy Light 2570/488= 5.27 times for a total (5000*22)+(3603*5.27)=128988 HPs healed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking at the numbers it is clear that shaman cannot come close to druid or cleric healing in anything remotely resembling a short fight. We actually do comparatively better in 1 minute fights as the various spot heals are not as far apart as Tnarg's is to the percentage heals.<br />
<br />
Furthermore paladins easily outheal us in the spot heal department.<br />
<br />
Note that a cleric can, with group buffs, keep chaincasting complete heal for more then 6 minutes before going out of mana. Also it takes the shaman a 65% slow to keep up with the cleric, assuming said slow is never resisted, does not draw aggro, is not mitigated, casts instantly and costs 0 mana.<br />
<br />
This is over a 5 minute fight (and holds true for a fight duration of up to 8 minutes - after that a shaman starts to make up ground). Even given infinite fight length a shaman will never catch up to a cleric and it takes well in excess of half an hour of fighting to catch up to a druid.<br />
<br />

<br />
The shaman will be using<br />
Velium Strike<br />
1018 damage in 9.3 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 401.<br />
(for the concept of adjusted mana cost see above)<br />

The cleric will be using his 2 best nukes, as the recast on them is pretty long.<br />

1331 damage in 8.1 seconds with a mana cost of 349.<br />
<br />
Condemnation<br />
1210 damage in 8.1 seconds with a mana cost of 318.<br />
<br />
Order + Condemnation<br />
2541 damage in 16.2 seconds with a mana cost of 668.<br />
<br />
1 minute:<br />
Shaman:<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*171(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 7710<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Velium Strike 60/9.3= 6.45 times for a total of 6.45*1018= 6566 damage.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*85(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 6850<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Sylvan Fire 60/8.4= 7.14 times for a total of 7.14*1876= 13395 damage.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Total mana to spend = 10*81(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 6810<br />
<br />
60 seconds is enough time to cast Order+Condemnation 60/16.2= 3.7 times for a total of 3.7*2541= 9402 damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 minutes:<br />
Noone will run out of mana yet, so just double the above numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 minutes:<br />
Shaman:<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*171(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 14550<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast 14550/401=36.28 casts of Velium Strike for a total damage of 36.28*1018=36933 damage.<br />
<br />
Druid:<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*85(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 10250<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast 10250/387=26.49 casts of Sylvan Fire for a total damage of 26.49*1876=49695 damage. Time spent casting is 26.49*8.4=222.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
Total mana to spend = 50*81(mana regeneration) + 6000(mana pool) = 10050<br />
<br />
This is enough to cast 10050/668=15.04 casts of Order+Condemnation for a total damage of 15.04*2541=38217 damage. Time spent casting is x*16.2=243.6 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you can see shaman are dead last in the fast damage category. Simply put, mana regeneration and mana pools have increased to the point where noone is running out of mana on a single fight, even if it involves multiple MOBs.<br />
As shaman nukes are slower and smaller then comparable nukes of other classes there is simply no way to catch up to anyone in the short term, and it takes way longer then any single fight to match even a cleric.<br />
Note that the shaman is rooted to spot, while the 5 minute numbers leave the cleric and druid ample time to move (and the druid has a 0.5 second window each nuke to move in due to recast).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Part 5 - Raid stacking<br />
<br />
Some spells, noticeably buffs, change their value on raids - for example noone is going to use a ranger's natureskin as it will be overwritten by the better druid spell. These are the spells a shaman might use on raids:<br />
- Focus<br />
- stat buffs<br />
- Slow<br />
- Malos<br />
- Malosinia<br />
- Nukes (Velium Strike)<br />
- DoTs (Bane / Blood of Saryrn)<br />
- Heals (Tnarg's / Quiescence)<br />
- Ferine Avatar<br />
<br />
Focus + the few needed stat buffs can easily be done by a single shaman. Another major part of this list is debuffing (Malos / Malosinia / slow ). Debuffing does not stack however - you can only slow a given MOB once after all. However due to resists and the spawned adds on today's raids there is usually work for two, sometimes even three shaman.<br />
<br />
DoT usage on raids is tricky - unless there a multiple MOBs to spread the aggro on a shaman will easily pull aggro of even the best equipped tanks when stacking DoTs. Multiple MOBs are generally killed or mezzed though - meaning DoTs are at best used to augment nuke damage.<br />
<br />
So the stacking roles for a shaman on a raid are healing, nuking and casting Ferine Avatar. Shaman nuke damage is the worst of any caster and shaman healing is the weakest of the priests (and arguably worse then a paladin's). Shaman mana regeneration also does not come into play on raids - I can not remember the last time that people actually ran out of mana ona given encounter.<br />
<br />
This is part five of the shaman problem. The stacking abilities of a shaman are the weakest parts of the class. Every shaman after the second will feel like a second rate druid (and be about as useful).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Part 6 - Fast fights &amp; constant movement<br />
<br />
Planes of Power introduced MOBs with huge damage output and comparatively very low HPs. Lost Dungeons introduced the concept of constant movement.<br />
<br />
Neither of these concepts are bad per se. Both do however reduce the effectiveness of the shaman.<br />
<br />
Short fights mean that the contribution of slow is lessened. If a MOB spends 90% of the fight slowed the overall slow percentage will be very close to the maximum value of 75%. If however the MOB spends a third of the fight unslowed this overall slow percentage drops to 50%. As the corresponding MOB damage output is 25% and 50% this means that the effectiveness of slow is halved.<br />
<br />
Constant movement simply means less time for a shaman to cannibalize. Everyone looses mana by moving, but buffs still provide their mana regeneration while the extra mana from cannibalize that the shaman was balanced around is lessened.<br />
<br />
This is part six of the shaman problem. The short brutal fights and constant movement of GoD (and to a lesser extent the previous expansions), while not a bad thing by itself, indirectly nerf key shaman abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Part 7 - Slow mitigation<br />
<br />
Slow is also adversely affected by another thing - slow mitigation. Slow mitigation lessens the percentage by which a MOB is slowed. Due to the way slow works the scaling is a little curious however.<br />
Reducing a slow by a third from 75% to 50% halves its effectiveness.<br />
Reducing a slow by two thirds from 75% to 25% quarters its effectiveness.<br />
Reducing a slow by half from 50% to 25% halves its effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, those last couple percent of slow (from 50 to 75 %) are the most effective and are the first to go when slow mitigation is applied.<br />
<br />
Even a small mitigation in slow effectiveness of a quarter of the original value gets very close to halving the effectiveness of shaman slow. Just reducing the slow percentage of a shaman by a tenth reduces the slowing power by 30%.<br />
<br />
Bards, beastlords and enchanters, though similarly affected, experience a lesser reduction in the effectiveness of their slows.<br />
<br />
This is part seven of the shaman problem. Slow mitigation, even the least variations of it, have a huge impact on the effectiveness of slow. As slow is the only contribution to a group that shaman are clearly best at this greatly reduces the overall shaman contribution.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Part 8 - Shaman healing &amp; slow<br />
<br />
Shaman healing seems to have been designed with slow in mind. That is, a shaman would be able to keep his group alive after he slowed the MOB.<br />
<br />
Aside from the obvious problems - MOBs generally do not arrive slowed, adds have to be slowed separately, spell and riposte damage is not lessened by slow - this might well have been true during the Luclin era.<br />
<br />
Nowadays however, even on non-mitigating MOBs, the short fight durations reduce the effectiveness of slow a lot. On the other hand the comparatively greater increases to cleric and druid mana regeneration compared the tiny increases shaman got mean that we have more healing to do then we used to so we can match a cleric's or druid's overall healing.<br />
However we have to do this with spells that cast slower, heal less and take more mana.<br />
<br />
In GoD another problem has become apparent. It is very possible that a shaman can just barely keep up with an unslowed MOB by chaincasting heal. That means that in the case of a resisted slow the tank will need chain healing, leaving no time for a new try at slowing.<br />
<br />
Druid or cleric healing does not have this problem, as their heals were not designed with a resistable spell in mind.<br />
<br />
This situation of course does not get better when you take into account slow mitigation or flat out slow immune MOBs.<br />
<br />
This is part eight of the shaman problem. Our healing was designed with slow and our superior mana regeneration in mind. Neither of these applies to the degree it used to and this is if we even get a chance to use any of it. Even if we can slow a MOB decently we barely break even with other healers and are much much worse when emergency healing is needed (such as in the case of an add).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
_________________________<br />
a healing scenario<br />
<br />
This scenario will compare the healing capabilities of the classes over a timeframe of 30 minutes in a static camp with non-mitigating MOBs who last 1 minute each. Pull time between MOBs is 5 seconds. MOBs will not resist slow once Malos has been cast.<br />
<br />
Reposted numbers from above:<br />
Mana regeneration:<br />
171 (shaman) for a total mana of 57300.<br />
 85 (druid) for a total mana of 31500.<br />
 81 (cleric) for a total mana of 30300.<br />
<br />
The shaman will be using<br />
Tnarg's Mending<br />
1430 HPs healed in 5.6 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 422.<br />
<br />
Breath of Trushar<br />
1440 HPs healed in over 24 seconds with a cast time of 7.7 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 331.<br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects<br />
Slows by 75% in 4.95 seconds (2.7 seconds until slow hits) with an adjusted mana cost of 262.<br />
<br />
Malos<br />
Debuffs by 55 in 6.75 seconds with an adjusted mana cost of 401.<br />
<br />
<br />
The druid will be using<br />
Karana's Renewal<br />
4680 HPs healed in 12.25 seconds with a mana cost of 510.<br />
<br />
<br />
The cleric will be using<br />
Complete Healing<br />
5000 HPs healed in 12.25 seconds with a mana cost of 340.<br />
<br />
<br />
The shaman will be keeping up Trushar. 1800/24=75 casts of Trushar, leaving 57300-(331*75)=32475 mana for slowing and using Tnarg's. Malos/Turgur's will have to be cast 1800/65=27.69 times. Each such debuff cycle uses 262+401=663 mana and slows for 1-((100%*9.45 + 25%*50.65)/60)=63% overall.<br />
This leaves us with 32475-(27.69*663)=14117 mana for Tnarg's. 14117/501=33.45 casts for a total healing of (33.45*1430)+(75*1440)=155836 HPs healed. Accounting for slow this means (155836/(1-63%))/1800= 234 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
The cleric casts Complete Healing 30300/340=89.12 times for a total healing of 446000 meaning 446000/1800= 247.8 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
The druid casts Karana's Renewal 31500/510=61.76 times for a total healing of 289037 meaning 289037/1800= 160.6 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, on long fights, fighting nonstop for 30 minutes our hypothetical shaman outheals a druid and is still outhealed by a cleric(who does not has a slower in the group), even on nonmitigating MOBs. Lets see what short fights, slow mitigation and movement do for the classes.<br />
<br />
The scenario remains unchanged except for:<br />
- MOBs last 30 seconds<br />
- after every kill the group will move for 5 seconds instead of pulling for 5 seconds.<br />
- MOBs mitigate slow by 25% to 56.25%.<br />
<br />
Moving for a total of 1800/35*5=257.1 seconds reduces the available mana by the cannibalize/meditation mana to:<br />
Shaman 57300-(257.1*129/6) = 51972 mana<br />
Druid 31500-(257.1*28/6) = 30300 mana<br />
Cleric 30300-(257.1*28/6) = 29100 mana<br />
<br />
The shaman will now have to debuff 1800/35=51.43 times leaving 51962-(51.43*663)=17864 mana for actual healing. That is enough for 17864/331=53.97 casts of Trushar for a total healing of 53.97*1440=77716 HPs healed. Due to slow mitigation we will have to recalculate the slow percentage: 1-((100%*9.45 + 56.25%*20.65)/30)=30% overall.<br />
Our total damage mitigation is thus (37771/(1-30%))/1800= 61.7 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
Now, clearly it is not worth casting slow under these circumstances. So the shaman will just heal instead. Keeping up Trushar takes 75 casts, leaving 51962-(75*331)=27137 mana for Tnargs. This is 27137/422=64.3 casts of Tnarg's for a total healing of (75*1440)+(64.3*1430)= 199950 HPs healed and 199950/1800= 111.1 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
The cleric casts Complete Healing 29100/340=85.59 times for a total healing of 427950 meaning 427950/1800= 237.8 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
The druid casts Karana's Renewal 30300/510=59.41 times for a total healing of 278039 meaning 278039/1800= 154.5 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
On the type of fight prevalent in LDoN and GoD it is not even worth to cast slow unless you have several other healers in the group. Even over extended periods of nonstop fighting we still heal less then a druid and clerics outheal us by a factor of more then two.<br />
This does not take into account that the shaman healing is mainly coming from HoT spells, which, while efficient, are far too slow to keep a tank alive in GoD or even in a hard LDoN adventure. Also these spells do not stack, whereas cleric and druid heals have no such issues.<br />
Note that a few seconds of moving, the lowest level of slow mitigation and 30 second fights reduce a shaman's healing capabilities by 53%, while only reducing cleric and druid healing by 4% and 3.8% respectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Part 9 - Nothing new for the shaman<br />
<br />
Shaman have literally not gotten a new spell line since Kunark. The closest thing to a new spell line is the Bane line from LDoN - which is just another DoT, albeit with a different resist. We have gotten upgrades to existing spell lines, and smaller upgrades then any other class at that.<br />
<br />
Lets take a look at the other classes shaman compete with in certain areas. I am going from memory here so I might well miss something.<br />
Shaman - bearform<br />
Cleric - spell haste line. pacify line. hammer line. vie line. self buff line.<br />
Druid - mana regeneration added to the skin line. various debuff lines.<br />
Enchanter - spell damage rune. side effects removed from nuke line.<br />
Necromancer - group lifetaps. group mana taps.<br />
(Beastlord - entire class is new)<br />
Paladin - unique HP buff line. self buff line. group heals.<br />
<br />
Overall shaman have not only gotten the least upgrades to their existing spell lines, they also got the fewest and least useful new spell lines.<br />
<br />
This is part 9 of the shaman problem. We have now gotten the least upgrades of all classes who can cast spells from six expansions straight and it shows. In addition every new ability implemented went to other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Conclusions<br />
<br />
Shaman feel neglected due to a variety of reasons. We have not gotten the same amount of upgrades to our spell lines as everyone else did. Our existing abilities have been nerfed directly (slow mitigation) and indirectly (fast fights) to a point where many of us feel that we no longer adequately contribute to a group, much less a raid. Our key abilities, slow and mana regeneration are no longer as useful as they once were and we received nothing new to make up for it. Our healing is arguably weaker then a paladin's, our buffing is arguably weaker then a beastlord's, our damage is pathetic.<br />
Basically there is not much left of a class many of us have grown to love. We would like to once more feel like we contribute to a group. As is, I have not been in a group in months where I could not have been replaced by someone better suited for the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What to do now?<br />
Shaman have been neglected for so long that we need help in a lot of areas. I will try to tailor my proposals so they are useful for fixing the current shaman issues as well as helping provide a role on raids.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Shaman need a better patch heal, both for raids, backup healing and (on easier content) to be able to recover from slow resists when main healing. The following are all options for patch heals.<br />
<br />
Tnarg's Improved Mending<br />
610 mana, 3.5 cast time, 2.25 refresh, heals 1800 HPs<br />
<br />
Spirit Shifting<br />
AA ability in 3 tiers for 4/4/4 points. Creates a hotkey with a 0.5 second cast time and 1 minute reuse time that damages the shaman by 20/30/40 % of his current HPs and heals an equal amount of damage to the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damage<br />
Shaman damage is not only largely useless (DoTs) or horribly underpowered (nukes), we also cannot keep up with any class remotely resembling a damage class (i.e. druids) even on long (20 minutes and longer) fights, which is supposed to be a shaman strength. In addition, one of our supposed strengths, DoT spells, do not have the favorable resist adjustments druids and necromancers have.<br />
These are some options to increase shaman damage.<br />
<br />
Winter Spirit<br />
400 mana, 6 second cast time, 2.25 refresh, does 1250 cold damage.<br />
<br />
Doom<br />
same stats as Bane, except change resist adjustment to -100.<br />
<br />
Venom Strike<br />
330 mana, 5 second cast time, 2.25 refresh, does 1000 poison damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Shaman buffs not only have received less upgrades then other classes' buff lines but also had their stat buff parts rendered useless due to stat caps. Hence shaman require a slight upgrade to their non-stat buffs and a replacement of the stat buffs to be brought back in line with other classes.<br />
<br />
Focus of the Heyokah<br />
same stats as Focus of the 7th except<br />
- increase HPs to 600<br />
- replace stat adjustments with 3% DoT shielding, spell shielding and shielding.<br />
<br />
Kragg's Avatar<br />
1200 mana, group buff (not /TGBable), lasts 20 minutes.<br />
140 ATK, +20 strikethrough, accuracy, combat effects<br />
<br />
Talisman of Swiftness<br />
same stats as Talisman of Alacrity except increase haste % to 60% (same as Swift like the Wind)<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
The defining class ability of the shaman, slow, has not been upgraded since Kunark, yet other classes now slow within a couple percent of our best slow. As the slow percentage on Turgur's is as good as the game design allows it any upgrades will have to come in other areas.<br />
Resist and stat debuffs have been largely static for everyone (and are a far less integral part of the shaman class), so no adjustment are needed there.<br />
<br />
Teger's Insects<br />
280 mana, 3.0 second cast time, 2.25 second recast time, -40 resist adjustment, 75% slow, 7 minute duration<br />
<br />
I am not sure if the above is enough to rebalance shaman to the current content but it should be enough to balance shaman against the other classes. Depending on how much GoD encounters get retuned it may at least be enough to not make us shaman feel useless in the short fights of the last 3 expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What to do in the future ?<br />
- Do not try to fix a class that is or seems to be overpowered by nerfing it in small steps in half a dozen different areas over six expansions.<br />
<br />
- Do not change the basic way the game is played (i.e. Luclin -&gt; PoP) without readjusting the classes that get hurt and those who profit from the changes.<br />
<br />
- Do not create horribly one-sided content such as the whole one group content of GoD (so far). Even fundamentally balanced classes have issues when they have been balanced around content that no longer exists (i.e. Knight classes not being able to tank nameds in GoD).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Very nicely done. I can only disagree with one of your points, and that is that Shaman cannot be effective healers in &quot;much&quot; of the content. This is simply not the case. It is ONLY this newer content that Shamans healing effectiveness is severly limited. I can still effectively do my duties (Malos, Slow, Heal group) in 90% of the games content, even in XP groups in the EPs. <br />
<br />
The rest I agree with wholeheartedly. <br />
<br />
Solutions: Once again, I will say how I feel. A slight bump to our fastest heal and nuke (a 1600-1800 fast heal, a 1K fast nuke) and I think we will be effective again. IF, and I say this with some reservation, IF they are going to change BoT to 460 a tic, that would be wonderful, and added the changes I have suggested, it would make us &quot;whole&quot; again. <br />
<br />
The game has become more of a &quot;how fast can you . . .&quot; type of play than the grind we have been used to for years. How fast can you kill 50 things? How fast can you kill this mob that is quadding for 1200? How fast can you kill these 4 that all charge? This change in focus toward speed is what is killing us, cause our &quot;fastest&quot; spells just arent cutting it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KumarriTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">great post to begin with btw. I agree with alot of what you say it's all is pretty much dead on. I assume your on a blue server only because there is no mention of pvp so i'll toss my 2 cents in about that.<br />
<br />
A year ago b4 everyone had tons of elemental/time gear i could go into a fight 1 on 1 with just about any class and kill them in pvp. now i find it hard to kill anyone. No changes to resist checks on spells I or any shaman uses in PVP alot have been made and 95% of my stuff gets resisted. Albeit i'm damn near unkillable with Breath of trushar and the gear i have but the lack of KS's in pvp i get now have taken alot away from game for me. With everyones HP and resists getting better daily our DPS hasn't gotten better at all. jeez i first heard about Bane when ldon was coming out and was praying for something that would land pvp. instead they gave us a DoT that takes forever to pop when memmed and has a huge recast time. so it gets resisted and i have to wait to try it again. As far as pvp with this spell well there isn't any. It's 100% useless in pvp cause anyone with 200mr will resist it 100% of the time and anyone that i could otherwise land it on newbiewise will die fast enough that it's a waste of time to mem it. Evereyones toons get better and better as time goes on and ppl get mreo aa's and we just get absolutely nothing pvp wise to counter this. every other class pretty much gets upgrades. Druids got swarming death/better nukes, wizzies got better nukes and have lures for pvp and most other classes can be very usefull in pvp.<br />
<br />
Now as far as Pve is concerned well if i didn't have a closeknit group of friends in EQ then i would prolly never get groups. Pre god i was hella sought out and never i mean never had a problem getting a group. Now every group wants 2 good healers ie cleric/cleric or cleric/druid an enchanter a warrior and a puller leaving very little room for me. I dunno our pve usefullness has dropped so much that i'm chomping on teh bit for WoW to come out so i can do something else. i just don't have it in me to lvl a new char and i refuse to ebay anything or use someone else char fulltime. hell i tried lvl'n a char again. made a monk just to play something drastically diff then a shaman and got him to 51. now he has like 3 elementals pieces waiting in the bank for him for 65 that he will prolly never hit and i have tons of stuff prolly 1million plat into him. ornate tunic. Ton po's staff fungi tons of other good droppable stuff but the XP grind is too much for me.<br />
<br />
I just want to feel usefull again and would love to see some of the stuff mentioned above adressed.</div></div><hr />

See it's hard to not flame you for the ignorance you are showing, so I hope you appreciate that I am just going to ask you a question. Which class' HP buffs are NOT stacking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">While this is a great thread, i think its getting carried away. We are focusing on healing issues right now and just cause we finaly got someones attention some what, pounding them with every single problem of the class is a mistake i feel.<br />
<br />
But thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I have a suggestion for a &quot;new&quot; and &quot;improved&quot; line for shamans in the spell/nuke category. <br />
<br />
Disease Based Nukes. <br />
<br />
We are shaman, afterall. We are witchdoctors. We can heal you or we can curse you. We know stuff about DISEASES. Keep our other spells the same, dots don't need to be altered. They manage to keep us effective in some of the older but as of yet not outdated content. Just give us something to make us useful in the NEW content.<br />
<br />
With Disease based nukes it NEEDS to be something with quick casting time. If I were a voodoo master, it would take nothing more than a mere pinprick to get the intended boils and sores to cover my target from head to toe. In fact, make THAT the spell message:<br />
<br />
So and so has inflicted %t with boils and sores.<br />
Your skin bubbles with infection. <br />
<br />
Don't reduce the cast time on Poison Nukes even. It would take &quot;time&quot; for us to gather poisonous materials to conjure the spell. Disease is an altogether different thing. Make us masters of Disease in the nuke category. Make us keep that Malicious Decay spell memmed the same way we keep Turgur's memmed. Make me a scary thing for a mob to see, please. Make him worry about his pristine appearance.  :p<br />
<br />
Just to place this thought here as I read it by another poster elsewhere...I like the idea of rain based heals as an &quot;upgrade&quot; to our healing abilities. PC's out of the &quot;range&quot; of the healing rain would still be in peril. In fact, it might be &quot;balanced&quot; (thinking raid, here, where MA and his nearby compadres are the target for the cleansing showers) for the range to be close. Thus, the healing aggro would affect us and keep the peril a factor in gameplay.<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yes this is a great post and does comment on most the problems faced.<br />
alot really only need minor changes to spells we already have, for instance if malos had half the cast time and slow didnt have the 6 second recast time, this would mean we could have more time to heal/dps.  As for our cold nuke, although i would wish for higher amount, if they again halved the cast time then our dps would double for short fights, making it decent if not great.<br />
Dots just go out the window, there useless in less than 1 minute fights. necro must have the same problem (but least thier other dd spells are much more effective and pets) we need dots that work like bane (30 sec high damage per tick), though often even this will not do full damage. but if you speed up our debuff so that we can debuff a mob in 5 sec instead of 15, then it might.<br />
The only thing that wont be helped but just decreaseing cast time is our heal. We should have go an u/g to this for our quick heal to about 1.7k .<br />
<br />
but as said great post, i think we should direct benlo here. to get some ideas. also should be said that up to 60 (non lodn or pop) we are ok, however past 50 some changes for some spell would still help for pop and lodn. most problem i see though are post 60. (but dots are wrong from about 50 onwards)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nine, Virtue don't stack together.<br />
Brell line ( Paladin ), Spiritual Line ( Beastlords ) don't stack together.<br />
<br />
So now, yes I do believe we don't need to add more hp to our Focus line, just change the stats mod on it.<br />
<br />
On a raid, HP buffs will work this way:<br />
1) cleric with Kazad's mark: 910hp<br />
2) druid with Blessing of the nine: 618hp<br />
3) shaman with Focus of the seventh: 544hp<br />
4) Paladin with Brell's Stalwart Shield: 330hp<br />
<br />
Shaman HP buffs are the weakest of any class <br />
Where do you see that we are the weakest hp buffers ?</div></div><hr />

Focus of Spirit does not stack with :<br />

and of course it does not stack with Talisman of Kragg (beastlord)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Another Issue at the High End with Focus - the overlaps that focus has compared to the equivalent Cleric and Druid buffs also cast focus in a poorer light by far that those comparable buffs.  <br />
<br />
Focus is incompatable with the Shielding Line that casters get.  This is in fact more significant than it first appears:<br />
<br />
Shield of Maelin:  350hp, 39AC, 40Magic Resistance.  <br />
Focus overwrites this giving 544HP.  This is a clear gain of 194hp for the 4 Int caster classes, but at the loss of the AC and Magic resistance.  The Druid and Clerics hit point buffs stack straight on top of the Int casters self buffs and provide 'full' increase.  <br />
<br />
However, Focus is also incompatable with the spell Shield of the Arcane (300hp, 36ac, 30MR), and this effect is on the Ornate Breastplate for Rogues, Berzerkers, Warriors and Monks (the pure melees).  In High End guilds it's not unreasonable to expect characters to have Ornate that they switch in for the clickety effects, or even wear full time.  Thus the value of Focus is dramatically reduced for these pure melees (the Str/dex on focus are irrelevent) compared to the equivalent Druid and Cleric Buffs.  Focus providing only +244hp at the cost of Magic Resistance and Armour Class - clearly not a zero sum gain.  I am not aware of equivalent armour that provides buffs for the melees that are incompatable with the symbol/virtue/9th lines.  <br />
<br />
Focus is also incompatable with the Cleric Self only buffs (admittedly on raids this doesn not apply as they will be using 9th instead).  The Cleric's incompatable buff provides Mana Regen and AC, and thus will be perfered to focus in most XP group circumstance.  <br />
<br />
Focus is also incompatable with some ranger buffs as well - but I'm not up on what rangers can do. <br />
<br />
In terms of buffing at the high end, the shaman clearly brings far less than the Druid or Cleric.</div></div><hr />

Even the BL has superior spells. <br />
<br />
Talisman of Kraggs is 395<br />
SV is 225hp's and 40 atk<br />
Infusion + single buffs+tureptant spirit will max out stats to be sure<br />
Ferocity = +65 to all saves, 150 atk and 40 sta.<br />
Nice 9mana/9hp regen from SD<br />
<br />
Lets see here, that is:<br />
620hps<br />
Probably capped stats<br />
190 atk (more if melee)<br />
65 to all saves<br />
9mana/9hp regen<br />
40% haste<br />
<br />
We can do:<br />
544hps<br />
Capped stats<br />
140 atk (more if melee)<br />
disease+poison +65, others +40<br />
60% haste<br />
<br />
As the *super buffers* we are getting outbuffed by our damn bastard child hybrid class?  Does anyone see anything wrong with this?<br />
<br />
Stat buffs are a thing of the past.  Until they up the cap to 400+, it is trivial to get nearly every meaningful stat capped well before I pull out Daiku, Primal essence (doesn't stack with Avatar) and the lot.  <br />
<br />
We are no longer the buff kings.<br />
<br />
Today, mana cap increase/mana regen, HP cap increase and ATK+ are the king and we are near last in two of those.  Yeah, I can buff my SK to 400 str/sta...but it is capped at 270 now for him, what good is that?<br />
<br />
If they want to see the REAL power of FA and our buffs, up the stat cap to 600 or so and see people running around with 500+ STR/DEX with FA and THEN you will have something to be in awe about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Stat buffs really become more useless, because of all the higher-end pieces of gear having +20 to 30 to each stat.  That adds up fast with the stat caps.  Gear in GoD is the same way. <br />
<br />
I see this as more of an issue than the stat caps itself.  If SOE would rather have players be more dependent on gear for stat increases than buffs, then they shouldn't bog us down with so many stat buffs and give us something more useful in its place.<br />
<br />
Long, long ago, disesase dots were increased to 2 minutes because that combined with poison was deemed too powerful.  Times have changed with the speedy DPS life EQ is now.  Lower disease dots down to poison, and increase the amount per tick.  If nuking isn't our thing, can even go farther into suggesting having 15 or 20 second dots doing large ticks of damage (750-1k).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">What about a Group Cani where you can cani the entire groups hp down or you can feed the group mana from your hp bar? <br />
just one big BOOM and youre at 25% and everyone in the group just snagged 2-300 mana?<br />
<br />
the Focus/sta thing on raids is kinda silly. it would be nice if 7th HAD sta on it so we could do away with the extra buff slot. the ideas about dumping stats for overhaste/strike through and stuff like that is one I like alot.<br />
<br />
I agree that the shaman hybrid getting a passive mana regen, better atk buffs (**** dont even think about mentioning FA) and an mgbable Aa thats mana and hp is insulting. its as if they created a new class with all this neet stuff and forgot the part about it beind a Hybrid of a class that needs work.<br />
<br />
bigger faster nukes, disease nukes that dont break root but have a longer recast? <br />
1 tick Dots with huge nukes, say a 500 point nuke with 1 tick for 500.<br />
a ****ING SOW UPGRADE (sorry had to get that out) no the extra 5 min Bih li lasts is not what I have in mind.<br />
Double attack aa's, Bash as a skill (bash added to the New Graphic bear form :))<br />
Higher dodge cap, add a low cap parry. once upon a time we were the melees of the caster world.<br />
<br />
its weird grouping with people who think I can heal for them when I cant. I heard &quot;dont shaman have a 2k fast heal&quot; yesterday from an experienced friend...I  had to tell her that was a crit and that our 10 sec heal is UNDER 2k, the group had to change plans.<br />
<br />
hell I LIKE disease dots, I use BoU and Poxx all the time when I solo...but I solo alot. <br />
<br />
passive mana regen Vrs active...after 65 lvls 54 with can1 (well not counting pre cani lvls but whateva) because the quest for can2 requires lots of high lvl peeps to get you a 39 spell is imho broken. a few with can3 and now a hp/mana pool that makes chain cani required to put a dent in either is getting old. how about necro style spells for mana regen. <br />
how about a cheap aa thats fast refresh can4?<br />
how about just finding a few shaman and asking them for some time to chat online or on the phone...you will get some good info and insights from alot of people here.</div></div><hr />

It's useless to debate why this perspective seems to have escaped them up to this point; this summary offers a baseline from which to move forward.  veeshanMurtak took the time and skull-sweat to compile a valuable problem analysis for SOE -- let's hope they make full use of it.<br />

(give druids a 70% one or somin). make rain spells better or 3 tick dots.  any way just things i seen that would help.<br />
some better mellee skills might be fun for groups too, but its not too high on the list, though i would like to get back to being the best mellee caster and semi passive tank. i dont like that witha 50 damage weapon though i cap at 210 damage whereas mellee can get 350 or more hits (also crit melle hits might be fun) {again not high on list but just fun}<br />

<br />
the short summary:<br />
Hard hitting + slow mitigation + low hitpoint mobs make shaman slow a LOT less useful.  Shamans don't do well in another role as it stands (3rd tier with paladin on heals, and very bad on dps) so there's no place for a shaman at the hard ldon/gates difficulty of the game.</div></div><hr />

I do not - it is not worth the hassle of memming it and certainly not worth a buff slot. The additional mana gained would be minimal anyways - replenishing our HPs after cannibalizing is close to free already.<br />
<br />
Rough numbers: replenishment saves a trushar every 6 minutes, that is a single canna every 6 minutes or 1.3 mana per tick.<br />
<br />
That is if you are never, not once, at full health. Real world numbers will be closer to 0.1 mana per tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hmmm...with replen I'm regenning 46hp/tick, or 460hp/min, 1380hp/3minute, in other words it takes care of ~70% of each AA canni. With regen focus effects it would be more. That isnt insignificant, particularly if you are in combat and want to conserve mana or cant spare the time to Q. I'm seldom at full health if my mana bar isnt full, so it works in down time as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hmmm...with replen I'm regenning 46hp/tick, or 460hp/min, 1380hp/3minute, in other words it takes care of ~70% of each AA canni.

I'm seldom at full health if my mana bar isnt full, so it works in down time as well.<br />
<br />
That is not replenishment, that is replenishment + natural regen. Even counting your natural regeneration this saves you around 200 mana every 3 minutes (and costs 275 every 13.9 minutes).<br />
A gain of 85 mana(after focuses) every minute, if you are an iksar and make sure to never be at full health.<br />
That will up potential mana regeneration in my scenariois from 174/tick to 182/tick. Of course now I would have to account for the druid using replenishment for healing. Oh, and that reverse damage shield that clerics get.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: I already made a huge assumption in that my hypothetical shaman never overheals himself with Trushar. I made another huge assumption in having that shaman find something useful to cast between cannibalize IV refreshs. I am not going to add an even more hypothetical replenishment and I am certainly not going to account for iksar racial regeneration. Trushar is close to free as is anyways.</div></div><hr />

Apart from your choice of words - I fully agree. Spending your time giving classes mana, while possibly being useful, is no fun at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">your probably right the canni for mana just isnt needed.<br />
<br />
but i had an idea that helps our getting mana back and dps, i was thinking of a offensive canni spell/aa that damages the target (rather than us) and turns that to mana, possible at a lesser rate than normal canni. aa version the near 2k for 500 mana, i thought about a spell version but basically it wouldnt work as it as it becomes a free/very low mana nuke which just too powerful, but the aa can be sorted and lots classes have multi freee dps aa.</div></div><hr />

This is a summary of a more full excel spreadsheet I have of the data. It assumes a short fight where there is massive incoming DPS that needs to be basically chain healed by both a primary and secondary healer. It also assumes Improved Healing IV and Max Healing AAs. It does not consider heal focus effects greater then IH IV, and it also does not include mana regenned during this very short fight as it would be almost negligible (I might include that on a future one). Additionally, this is only each classes fastest cast direct heal(s). It also includes just certain time points where I could match up most classes, and it assumes a 2.25second recast delay on spell gems: <br />

Finished and newest healing changes accounted for. I may go back over my numbers and I might do the numbers for GoD damage spells (currently only up to PoP/LDoN spells) but my conclusions should not change.<br />
Please read(or re-read) and tell me what you think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Some well adressed stuff here.  Couple very specfic things Id like to know thou are the following:  <br />
<br />
Why does FA have a 1 min refresh timer?  All it does for me is annoy me.  FA is already 1/4 or less as effective as Vallons Quickening for increasing DPS, lasts 1/7 as long and is only single target.  What good reason is there for there to be a refresh timer at all on this spell?<br />
<br />
Why do dots have ALOT more agro then a Nuke dealing equal or more damage?<br />
<br />
Both of these issues have been around a long time (like years), and I've never seen any kind of reasonable explantion.<br />
<br />
And I dont mind that FA isnt even comparable to Ench haste, I just dont see why it has to be so annoying to cast.  Also I dont mind that Dots are long term and that Ill never be good at Fast damage, but why on earth should I have to die from agro to do that small amount of damage.<br />
<br />
I dont hold any hope at all that any of these issues will be fixed, played for too long and observed SoE/Verant track record of responding to the player base to have any illusions of that.  But I think we are at least entitled to an answer why these things are broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">What to say. Your numbers are great and the changes are reasonable.<br />
<br />
After these changes the Shaman class would be fun to play and balanced. That Spirit Shift AA is great for that patch heal on the tank, when Slow was resisted.<br />
<br />
I hate to know that all your efforts are a waste of time though. I don't think the responsible people over at SoE are ready to take responsibilty for changes like these at this point of the game. It's all about &quot;safe&quot; changes.<br />
<br />
Awesome job, man.</div></div><hr />

What can I say, I still have hope. Besides, this way it will at least be impossible for Brenlo to say we are not giving him concrete proposals and numbers.  :)<br />

Everything is there and accounted for and should be enough to get someones attention.  I just hope they can do something with it. <br />
<br />
Only points again I disagree on are the AA for the heal.  I wouldn't want to transfer my health.  <br />
<br />
And the aggro issue.  We are the only class that slows and heals.  No enchanter wants to tash and than slow cause of aggro.   Clerics always have about three heals loaded.  They won't drop the large heal till a mobs is slowed or under control with the tank. <br />
<br />
I don't think you have accounted for aggro reduction. <br />
<br />
May want to address that somewhere too.   Druids deals with aggro cause we slow and get aggro above there heals and so does the warrior.  No other class deals with the aggro we get.  <br />
<br />
Please see if you can come up with a viable solution for this issue.</div></div><hr />

Don't talk class balance without all the facts please.  Shaman do have serious issues and need fixing.  But it doesn't help to ignore things.<br />
<br />
Druids do have agro issues very similiar to a shaman actually when it comes to reliably healing.  A good druid will debuff the mob with his 2 Ro Attack Debuffs. The effect will make the mob dps lower, and allow the druid to heal.  Exactly the same way a shaman does.  And like Slow, the Ro Debuffs ((what I nickname Ghetto/Crap Slow)) are huge agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">The Spirit Shifting AA is the best idea I have heard in along time. It would be something unique and at the same time deal with the problem of resisted slows, which I tried to adress with my 1 second/ 5 second recast 1800 fast heal proposal.<br />
In my opinion it's more likely they would add a spell like mine than this AA, however the AA would be preferable in every way.<br />
<br />
Corlathist: The resist rate of your RO's is nowhere near the resist rate of slow nor were your heals balanced around the damage reduction through them. If you want to discuss Druid issues like the cast time nerf(0.2 second with haste item and higher HPS overall for the spell, but whatever) or aggro issues, do so on the TDG please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">This is one of the best summaries of the Shamans plight that I have seen in awhile.  It addresses all of the problems I have with my shammy.  Very well done veeshanMurtak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Murtak has given us some outstanding posts with some great suggestions for improving our situation. Let me just say that anything to take away the nightmare that is FA would be a blessing - I can't think of anything that takes away from the fun of grouping more than having to maintain an FA rotation. No one, not even a druid, deserves the horror that is FA.<br />
<br />
I would like to see one more thing added, and that is an upgraded slow. I mean a true upgrade, not a situational spell like Balance of the Nihil. Something along the lines of:<br />
<br />
75% slow<br />
1.5 sec cast<br />
2.25 sec. recast<br />
5 min. duration<br />
300 mana<br />
-55 resist mod<br />
<br />
This slow essentially has Malos built in with regard to MR. In the fast-paced, massive DPS environment that EQ embraces these days, landing slow early is critical. Having to Malos before is really time consuming and heavily impacts my efficiency (and I have 18% spell haste). It's not merely a problem of mob resists - it's that the consquences of a slow resist can be very messy. I know I can't stand up against an unslowed elemental/hard LDoN/GoD mob for very long. Perhaps the Time shaman have had different experiences, but for me, even with max defensive AA, resisted slows can be lethal.<br />
<br />
Another way to address this would be to add an AA that gives us an innate resist modifier on our slows. For example: 3 levels, 3/6/9 AA, -15/-35/-55 MR mod to all magic based slows.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just thought of something else. This has been suggested before, but our new Canni spell should not be ancient. This is a needed fix, not something I want to wait 3 years for. Reducing tedium and increasing the amount of time I can spend doing something besides regenerating mana is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">yes very good, some nice ideas. a few others i have seen <br />
<br />
healing, %type heals that either heal to a said % of target ie heal up to and no further than 80%, 60%  short of thing. or heals that heal a % of max hp , like 40% of target (ie 10k tank healed for 4k, 6k caster healed for 2400)<br />
<br />
and some damage ideas, new rain spell  750*3 ? (2250 total) (druid have 850)<br />
a spell like beast dd spells, ie 30 sec recast, but do nice burst dps. (beast highest with god ancient 810, normal 742, 274 mana) goin on the lower double it for 1484 , 548 mana. possible have this line from 50 onwards 3.2 sec cast time. and dont dimiss this cos of 30 sec cast cause you can cast canni etc inbetween:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Just had an idea - taking my above scenario of 30 second fights, constant movement and &quot;mostly successful&quot; slow mitigation, let us compare two shaman to a cleric. One shaman will slow and heal with the remaining mana, the other will just heal.<br />
<br />
Over 30 minutes shaman one will slow (for 30% overall) and cast 54 Breaths of Trushar. That leaves 21 Breath of Trushar casts for shaman two (so Trushar will be running fulltime). This leaves 51972-(21*331)= 45021 mana for Tnarg's. 45021/422 = 106.68 casts of Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
Total healing is Trushar * 75 + Tnarg's * 106.68 = 1440*75 + 1430*106.68 = 206552 damage healed.<br />
<br />
Damage negated is 206552/(1-30%)= 372217 damage negated.372217/1800= 206.8 DPS negated.<br />
<br />
As shown above a single cleric with can negate 237.8 DPS under the same circumstances.<br />
<br />
That is two shaman who perfectly coordinate their heals for maximum effects and are chaincasting for 30 minutes straight compared to a single cleric who is just landing CHs for 5K on average.</div></div><hr />

Shaman have been Tnarg's Improved Mending<br />
610 mana, 3.5 cast time, 2.25 refresh, heals 1800 HPs<br />
<br />
<br />
The mana cost here is too high.  The efficiency is about 2.9 hp/mana, which is in line with Tnarg's but not Daluda's Mending (3.2 hp/mana).  The mana cost should be around 500, which would give it a mana efficiency of 3.6 hp/mana, which is still less than the comparable druid spell, Sylvan Infusion at 3.8 hp/mana, or Holy Light, which sits at 5.0 hp/mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
now i thought, could all other pets user do with this to make all pets scale? necros and beast and us:)  <br />
prehaps a spiritual focus that improves our pet?  pet are the one thing that cant be increase if no new spell for pet level made:) also it like getting a improved weapon:) in fact it probably could be linked to weapons used by these classes (ie that class only) and be good for all pet using classes.</div></div><hr />
