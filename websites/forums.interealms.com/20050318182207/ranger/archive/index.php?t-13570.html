<br />
Given that the lines for the exe trial reach around the block, and the other 5 trials are completely unused...<br />
<br />
How would you rate the other trials?  Which is a good alternative to try instead of executioner?<br />
<br />
The answers I've been getting to this question have been rather varied.  Lashing and Hanging tend to come up in discussion a lot, but opinions vary quite a bit about how they compare in difficulty to executioner.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juneau</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 11:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Suffocation and Lashings are doable.  Need bout the same groups as Exe trial, DPS is key to surviving.<br />
<br />
They arent as straight forward as Exe, but are well within capabilities of competting with the right groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thicket</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lashing is easier than exe if you know the secret<br />
<br />
Hanging is easier than exe again if you know what to kill first<br />
<br />
Fire is the hardest<br />
<br />
Stoneing is harder than exe but the same idea <br />
<br />
Torture same idea as exe need dps but also who to kill first.<br />
<br />
If I were to rank them from easiest to hardest <br />
<br />
1 Hanging<br />
2 Lashing<br />
3 Exe<br />
4 Torture<br />
5 Stoneing<br />
6 Fire<br />
<br />
But just my opinion</div></div><hr />

<br />
with a solid enchanter i made it to the 3rd to 4th round a lot... no clue what the boss was<br />
<br />
might go back for fun in a week or so, but i ended up getting my mark off exe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruven</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have my mark, but we have some folks that still need them that we have not been successful getting them marks, especially our enchanters (not doing enough damage and their nukes seem to resist more than others).<br />
<br />
I keep hearing lashing is easier once you know the secret.  Well after getting wiped 12 times, this ranger still hasn't figured it out.  Any clues what this secret is?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Teche Widowmaker</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is some information I tossed together for my guild about the trial of torture..<br />
<br />
The group that beat the Trial of Torture that I was in consisted of a Pally, a Rog, a Ranger, a Clr, a Sham, and a War .... It took us 7 tries but was fun and better than waiting in line for Exe..<br />
<br />
The Trial is timed but we NEVER lost due to not being quick enough .. If your group can kill them all you WIN ... the waves went something like 4, Wrath, 4, 4, 4, Boss <br />
<br />
When you Kill the Wrath it will Heal EVERYTHING in the room including YOU <br />
<br />
Mobs where Undead(robes) and Necs(razerfiends) .. Heal agor was Bad so portect the Clr ..<br />
<br />
Named ones can be in with the normal mobs they hit harder have more HP and have Loot.. we got some 13/19 hammer(stats) .. some caster head gear .. and a parchment...<br />
<br />
This in my opinion was way more fun than standing in a line to do the Exe trial.<br />
<br />
When you pop in .. run down the hall to the left and in a door and down a ramp .. chop chop ..  To Exit If you fail and dont want to die ..you have to kill a prisoner and then run back up to the guy and /say return ...</div></div><hr />
