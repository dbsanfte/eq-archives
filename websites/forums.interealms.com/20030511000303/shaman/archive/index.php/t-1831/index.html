<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you do all the previous stages of the quest in the correct order?<br />
<br />
Specifically, did you hand Neh's diary to the spirit sentinel and get told the next part of the quest?<br />
<br />
If yes, then /petition, hopefully you will get some help.<br />
<br />
The fact that you were ally doesn't mean a lot though, there are many different 'levels' of ally faction you can have, and you have no way of knowing your faction more accurately than the con message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Their shouldnt be any problems if you did each step correctly, you must of skipped a step somewhere.<br />
<br />
1 Step alot of shammies forget to do is as Grippa Mentioned, where you do Rak before handing in the Neh'shiirs diary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Khabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only part I skipped was the hole, if I work on my faction and become max ally will I still need to the the hole part?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bite the bullet and go kill High Scale Kirn in the Hole, it's actually good fun once you get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since the shaman epic is based purely on faction surely it doesnt matter what I do as long as my faction is high enough. <br />
<br />
Alot of people have done the epic without doing the hole so is it just a matter of becoming max ally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was max ally when turning in the tear. Would think you were too low on the ally scale for it.

<br />
Why not just do the Hole part?  <br />
<br />
It was alot of fun when I did and I get the same reaction from other shaman, best part of our retaining our Epic is doing the Hole Crawl IMO.<br />
<br />
I still go their regulary, I love this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Something to keep in mind is that recently they changed how faction affects the middle parts of the quest.  It is now possible to have too high a faction standing to do the Ghiosk's books part (in other words, if you repeat earlier steps, at some point the Sentinel Spirit will no longer accept the books from Ghiosk.)  I'm not sure if other early parts of the quest were affected the same way.  This was done to force shamans to do the quest the originally intended way instead of the 'faction short-cut' (which actually takes a lot more time, though maybe less resources.)  Whether there was much reason to do this is debatable, but there it is.<br />
<br />
If you have the forces to take on Rak, you pretty much have the resources to do the Hole crawl.  Also, there are two or three npc's for other epic quests in the vicinity of Kirn, which makes guildmates more interested in the crawl, as well.</div></div><hr />

Also Azhdarkhos, when you say 'have the forces to do Rak', what do you mean by forces, only takes 2 people :)<br />
<br />
By far the easiest epic quest imho.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How did you do Neh and get the diary without killing kirn to get the ring?<br />
<br />
Just go to hole and do it.  It's very easy and fun.  We had a really great time doing hole for my epic last week.  I got about 2 and a half blues of exp (sweet!) on the way down, and we knocked out a ranger epic mob on the way.   We also had two IGS drop.  We knocked out kirn and evaced out (not a single death the whole time.  a big accomplishment for us).  Was a really great experience.<br />
<br />
The next night we got owned in CoM, though :(<br />
<br />
btw, I am glad that verant is attempting to fix the quest to keep it from being cheatable.  I wish they had thought of a better way (people that have to do a part over again for legitimate reasons can get screwed), but I'm glad they're at least trying.</div></div><hr />

You've gotten my interest. How can they do this? Given the game engine's abilities, how is this possible? I'm at a lost.<br />
<br />
Plus, this would also cause 100% screwage to all shamans that wish to move servers, since it's only faction that really gets transfered.<br />
<br />
NPCs have no idea you did &quot;Y' before &quot;X&quot;. They can't know that in the currect engine functionality, to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
That's the whole reason for &quot;faction levels&quot;. To make sure you have X faction before you attempt Y quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a really hard time believing this as I dont think the actual steps and items you receive have changed.  All they would have to do to stop the faction skips is make sure that after each large fight (kirn and the ones in CoM) you *have* to turn in a looted, nodrop item from the previous encounter.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, theres no relevant item to turn in to Rak after going through the rest of the steps.  The Shaman epic is very linear all the way up to the tear in fear...its like OK your unravelling this giant story based around Spirits in CoM...oh btw you gotta stop by fear too.<br />
<br />
Shandora, can you provide any kind of proof that the quest has changed at all?  If so Im sure the community would greatly appreciate such a huge discovery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The known change to the quest is that it is now possible to have too high a faction standing to do at least one of the middle steps (Ghiosk's books hand-in), perhaps other middle steps.  The result of this is that it is no longer possible to repeat some of the steps endlessly to max-out faction in order to skip other parts.  It may still be possible to do earlier parts to max faction (I haven't seen reports on those steps yet), but it would take a good bit longer that way.<br />
<br />
Basically, if you intend to go the 'max-out faction' route and skip Kirn and Neh, there is now a roadblock or two you would have to deal with.<br />
<br />
As to the 'forces necessary to take on Rak' and Kirn, I've seen claims of others doing it with one group, and that's not exactly farfetched.  The only tricky bit is getting to the point where you can IVU up the tower to the Kirn/Kindle area (and yeah, you can do Rak with just two people - cleric and mage - it just takes forever ;).)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The faction range limits are on Ghiosk's books and the Wandering Spirit.<br />

It is no longer possible to skip the bulk of the quest by repeatedly turning in the books, or Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise.  Once faction hits where it should be for having completed that leg of the quest (plus a little for leeway), one can no longer get improvements.  Kinda forces folks to make the trip to the Hole, and chat with Neh.<br />
<br />
This means that you cannot replace your Shield of Falsehood should it rot.<br />
<br />
edit:  It also means that should folk be SOL like I was (faction hit from helping that newbie fight what I thought was a wisp in WK) we can no longer repair it simply.  We can repair it to where it should be at the end of the Ghiosk's books stage... but then we'd have to redo Kirn and Neh.  *shudder*  Once doing Kirn was enough.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Talanie Glacierwind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I went to City of Mist last night with an epic shaman.  So, surely she has enough faction to do the quest.  She handed in the tear so that I could MQ it with her.  Rak ate the tear (no agro).  I hadn't even touched Rak at this point.  But if you must know, I have done all parts of the quest except for looting a tear.  I conned Rak, and I'm ally.  We petitioned, and of course there weren't any GMs on.  A level 50 guide said she would tell the GM so that the other shaman could look into the possibilty of getting her tear back.  Anyone else MQ'd this portion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I was Max Ally before I turned in my tear, so it's not that the faction is too high.<br />
<br />
Not *just* that, at any rate.<br />
<br />
From what I've seen, these kind of bugs are not limited to just our quest...  There seem to be MANY quests that are having spawn problems lately, and some quests where creatures, instead of speaking key words, just say &quot;unable to open file O^O^O^O^O...&quot; or some similar.  A little annoying if you're trying to pay attention to trigger the next phrase.<br />
<br />
Had some problems spawning the Dark Elf Corruptor for a druid acquaintance.  Everything had been done properly to that point, but the Corruptor and co. didn't pop.<br />

/em sighs and thanks the Tribunal for nudging Rak into respawning for her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I went to com tonight to finish up my epic.  We had a really tough time getting to neh, but we finally did and I turned in my ring and we killed her and I got the diary.  Went and turned it in and went to try and kill rak.  It took us forever to get set up and make sure everyone was clear on their roles, but we finally got started.  I did it just like I thought I was supposed to... parked 2 fire pets next to him and got everyone back, then I turned in my tear.  He aggroed on me and after about a minute he finally procced his AE and killed me, aggroing the pets.  I had bound myself just outside the castle, so I respawned naked and started healing the pets.  I was expecting about a 30 minute fight (from reports i heard here) but it actually took about 10 minutes.  When he was around 20% or so, the melees got bored and charged him.  His AE really isnt that rough.  If you got a bunch of monks and rogues wear FR resist gear and had a cleric or two with group heal, you could probably beat him down fast enough to not need fire pets.  anyways...<br />
<br />
We killed him and I looted my scale and went out to the spirit in the jungle.  Up until this point, I hadn't had any problems.  I had followed the instructions of the spirits and the orthodox epic guide that everyone uses.  I hadn't tried to cheat or trick the quest in any way.  I turn in my scale, and guess what happens?<br />
<br />
It works.  I get my epic.  The quest is working fine and there is absolutely nothing wrong with it.  If you failed it is because you did something wrong or skipped a part.  If you tried to cheat the quest with a faction bug, then you deserve to get your piece eaten.  We have the easiest epic in the game - just do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Just wondering, but it would seem to me the most skipped part of the quest would actually be the test of patience.<br />
<br />
If i WERE to skip a part(which of course i wont), i would deffinitely not do that one, cause its so damn boring.  <br />
<br />
It would seem to me that what alot of people would do is just go to eruds isle, hand in the piece, then go to rathe and do woe/envy.  <br />
<br />
Of course, the thats horribly cheap, even if it is an early part, and the quest is so darn easy, we should do the WHOLE thing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wintermute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well to me it seems like most people skip the Fear part.  Sorry but some of us have a real life and can't camp EQ 24/7 to get in a Fear raid and do that stupid bottleneck part of the Shaman quest.  My wife has gone on several Fear raids only to be dissapointed that the golems were never up.  She even spent most of a saturday waiting and they never popped.  Rediculous.  So since the tear part can be supposedly MQ, this is the better option.  Only when she tried it, the person who had their epic and gave it to Rak ate it.  She has skipped no other parts of the epic and has cheated on nothing else.  This shouldn't matter anyways since it's the other person handing it to Rak and obviously if that person had her epic and it conned Ally then there shouldn't be a problem with not a high enough faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yea Wintermute, you people that have  &quot;a real life&quot; are entitled to take short cuts... because YOU have a real life. Us losers that don't have &quot;real lifes&quot; can spend the time and do things right so we don't have to cry here when our wife fails on a hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Now now .. Dont star bashing everybody for taking short-cuts.<br />
<br />
Shot-cuts are just that .. short ways to the end route. Sometimes you reach your destination, other times you end up 200 miles off.<br />
<br />
It's a risk one takes. Nobody is right one way or another.<br />
I admit, I've taken short-cuts here and there on different quests I've ran. If I lost out, it's my fault for skipping it.<br />
<br />
Nobody should claim to be &quot;able&quot; to take short cuts do to time frames. Epics where created for the gamers, and it was stated a while back.<br />
Now, more powerful things are in game, but the fact still remains, epics where created for the gamers+.<br />
<br />
Wintermute, if you taken a short cut and your wife for burnt cause of it. Please first check all your bases - Faction, order of quest, etc. If it all looks good, petition here, dont postthere sobbing claiming you're entitled to shortcuts.<br />
<br />
Do also note - The Tear turn-in has 100% to do with the one turning it in, not your wife :)<br />

Just wanted to get this post back on track, it's getting a bit off. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">it seems VI still hasn't figured out what's wrong with the faction bugs introduced in the last set of patches. on sunday, i turned in my 3rd set of woe/envy/marr to the wandering spirit. got the normal faction hit, ask for the shield, got the no duplicate lore items message. i forgot to con the wandering spirit though, so i can't comment on that. <br />
<br />
still seems to be working as intended...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I have my epic, and i MQ the tear for some guy who needed it. Evedently the first time something went wrong for him..(no idea what exactly, i dont know this guy other than this one time) but he agro'd and all and the mage pets killed him (ye gorra we cheated, we are horrible horrible people) but when the dude handed in for the spear itself it didnt work for him. /shrug no idea but i get the feeling this does all have to be completed in order. I didnt skip any parts myself. Now what i would suggested is, work the enitre strength of elements quest up to doing Yael then go do both hole parts and complete that part of the epic and finish str of elements adn have a sweet ass shoulder slot item. <br />

Ohh and who ever thinks the Hole is &quot;fun&quot; has a sick sense of fun.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Sheymalra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I have an extra tear on me now.  My understanding is that in order to MQ it, the shaman who is questing the epic must have already attempted to turn in their tear, but failed.  If I remember correctly, when you turn in the tear (and assuming you are ally, etc. and the quest is working), you take a faction hit from Rak.  THEN, if you lose to Rak, and thus lose your tear, you can MQ it with someone like me.  THus, I would hand the tear in, Rak would aggro, then once Rak was dead, the questing shaman should loot the corpse for the piece to finish the quest.<br />
<br />
If the questing shaman has never had a tear and thus never taken a faction hit from Rak, I don't think it would work.  (Would it?)<br />
<br />
I could be wrong... never tried to MQ the tear with a shaman who has never gotten the tear and attempted to turn it in themself.<br />

I got my epic and sometime later looted an extra tear and banked it.<br />

A shaman on my server did everything up until Rak including handing in his tear, his raid was wiped out and Rak despawned so he never got a chance to loot the scale.<br />
<br />
me &lt;-- epic shaman, max ally<br />
other shaman &lt;-- got the necessary faction hit for turning in the Tear<br />
<br />
I turned in the tear, we successfully killed Rak, other shaman looted scale and completed the quest successfully.  <br />
<br />
This was about 3-4 months ago.<br />
<br />
Sheymalra, I think people could at one time build faction by repeating earlier parts of the quest over and over again to get the necessary faction (ie, ghiosk books, woe and envy).  Then, an epic shaman with tear could turn in the tear, the second shaman (who never had a tear, or even been to Kirn or to Neh, but had done multiple low level faction steps) would be max ally, loot the scale and be able to turn it in for spear.<br />

Sounds like they've changed it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Syrellian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I received my epic last night.  I hate to admit it, but I am one of those that took the short cut by maxing out faction.  I completed everthing in order and turned in the books.  From that point on, I became guildless and was not able to do much on my own.  I decided to max out faction by doing the early steps over and over again.  I skipped Neh and the Hole.  Recently, I joined a great guild and the main Shaman (who has epic and max faction) multi-quested the tear for me.  He turned it in to Lord Rak and Rak aggroed on him.  The Fire pets (3 used for the fight) subsequently aggroed and killed Rak.  I looted the scale, turned it in to the Spirit Sentinel and luckily received my epic.  There have been several posts as to where and what changes were made in the quest.  As posted earlier, I believe the faction changes are at the point where you turn in the books.  If you choose the short-cut method, I would suggest doing EVERYTHING in order up to turning in the books; and doing each step only once.  From there, my assumption is you can do the faction method to become max ally.  Obviously this method still works.  Otherwise, there would have been no way I could have recieved my epic.  Anyhow, take that for what it is worth and I hope that a questing Shaman can actually use this information.  Good Luck!!!!!<br />
