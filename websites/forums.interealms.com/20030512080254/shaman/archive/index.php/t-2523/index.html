<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jannia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I soloed and killed three Ice Giants. After several attempts with my JBB, they always resist the effect even after debuffing them with Malisement. Is it possible to ever damage Ice Giants with a JBB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am 99% sure that Ice Giants are immuned to cold base attacks/<br />
<br />
So the answer is No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DevvNull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've found similar results.  But my question is this: <br />
<br />
Do you find similar resists to giants in EW and GD?  I'm looking at this as an avenue to work on my factions as well as start my shawl quests.  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No, the JBB works in EW, might need to malo to get full effect.<br />
<br />
GD iam not sure, never used it their.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Ice Giants in Everfrost/Permafrost are immune to cold-based spells. If you want to fight them, you need to rely on the poison and disease dots and or the poison based DD spells. I usually slow them, cast plague, ebolt and sic the dog on 'em. I refresh ebolt if necessary and by then the IG is pretty much a goner. Just keep an eye on the pet's health. The IGs hit hard, so be careful. Good luck to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am an experienced Ice Giant slayer, I soloed them from 49-54, with occasional excursions to City of Mist and Chardok. I have found that the JBB will indeed land on a Ice Giant &gt;IF&lt; you Malosi it, simple Malaisement will not debuff the save enough to allow it to land. I only found this out by accident, having Malosi'd a IG after it resisted 2 Turgor's in a row and I never fight one unless its slowed :-)<br />
When the beastie turned to run, I jumped in and started swinging my Rune Etched Icewurm Fang at it, and to my surprise the proc landed...after a little experimentation I found that the JBB would land as well, but is more often than not near fully resisted, doing in the low teens damage, sometimes 1/2, and I have yet to see a full damage blast.<br />
As others have stated before, the best way to solo the Ice Giants in Everfrost is to root/rot and/or use Dog-Dog, always include a nice slow in there, whatever flavor your prefer, it will save your life if you go LD or if you get a resistant one and need to head for Bandl :-)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IGs are turning light blue now, at 52.  /mourn the passing of another milestone, and the loss of yet another creature that used to absolutely terrify me.<br />
<br />
Root<br />
Set dog to work while slow casts<br />
Curse of the Spirits<br />
Scourge<br />
E Bolt<br />
Root again.<br />
Beat it to death when it reaches 30-40%.  IGs usually up and dies about the time Ebolt's done.  Usually, there's a root-break when Scourge lands.  I can channel through the occasional hit til Ebolt's done.<br />
<br />
Puppydog's usually got Harness and Alacrity/Spirit Quickening, and I'm fully-buffed with Alac going as well.  Melee consists of either Tarmok Battle Staff (when not on loan) or my whackamole mallet (Barb Spiritist's Hammer--which usually does about 10 pts of proc damage when it fires).   I switch to piercing every now and then for the heck of it.<br />
<br />
And since I have no JBB, no fungi, or Ikky BP, this is my usual M.O. when soloing other critters, too.  Having the Spear of Fate at my level is HUGE.  Not noticable to you superuber folks, but at 52... man, is it worth all the effort.</div></div><hr />
