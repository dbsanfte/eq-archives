<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shailona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hello all )<br />
<br />
i am oracle with torpor, malo, epic, jbb and a beautiful white horse<br />
 <br />
so my question is can i solo in the grey for some nice upgrade of my equipement ??? :)<br />
<br />
thank for responde</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cebilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">easily - I see shamans soloing there all the time<br />
At 60 you can single pull the Revenants around the Ssra temple and can easily hold a couple of the camps there.<br />
<br />
Some of the named snakes that spawn (and the named golems) drop grey flesh gear - good monk gear that sells very well. Also a chance at getting a Golems Jawbone (cant remember stats offhand - go look on Allakhazams)<br />
<br />
Only things you really have to avoid are the many trains by Idiots running to Ssra to raid, Boulderlings (pain in the ass for my wizard - may not be too bad for a shammy), and the many roaming traps. However if you stay close to the temple you should not get aggro from any of the roamers and the traps do not come too close.<br />
<br />
My main piece of advice is to get a second EB item as soon as you can and keep it in the bank - if you do manage to die (difficult as the zone to the temple is only a few yards away) you will need it to get back to your corpse, as i have yet to find a decent supply of fishscales on the moon. That said if you are non-KoS to katta, by hunting in the grey you can collect the 3 snake organs needed for a neck EB item (no drop)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bjarni Bludfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i can single pull at 58 around the temple.<br />
i couldn't at 57.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This zone has angered me like no other the last few times I was there.<br />
<br />
First was the time when the resident server uber guild decided to go to a raid in Ssra.  Fine, no problem ... except for the fact that gimp_warrior_01 was apparently &quot;lost&quot; on that oh-so-difficult run to the temple and did 3 laps around the temple, depositing a half dozen mobs on me in the middle of a fight.<br />
<br />
Not to be outdone, a few of his guildmates zoned with 4-5 of the see invis/undead skeletons afterwards.  I could not get out of Ssra: the rest of the guild kept showing up and re-agroing the skeletons so they would never path back away from the zone line.  Invis didn't work because they saw through it, and after waiting 15 minutes, I just gave up and gated out.<br />
<br />
Then there was the time where I went LD fighting one of the snakes and came back naked at my bind point.  I was infuriated.  I could solo one of those things with my eyes closed, and I was killed and my body ended up somewhere across the zone.  What a joke.<br />
<br />
Finally, I was camping the temple and was about to engage one of the named golems when a druid snatched it away and started going to town on it.  Not about to get involved in a dispute like this, I gave up and left.<br />
<br />
The Grey sucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Anyone know if the named stuff is possible at lvl 58?   Just dinged and want to go there to get my EB Neck, the grey flesh stuff would be gravy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are lots of nameds in the Grey that drop really nice stuff.  Be prepared to get Bogarted by someone with tracking (usually a quadding Druid) as soon as it pops.  As soon as it pops you'll see 3 people right on top of you.<br />
<br />
Once you get past that infuriating aspect, you can get decent exp in the Grey.  Just learn the traps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I soloed the ancient golem at 55 (dropped the sleeves). it was very very close.  I had to root n' rot w/epic to keep mana for the fight. no jbb for me. <br />
<br />
At 58, they should be much easier with the new heal. You could probably melee it if ya wanted to. I've been grouping/soloing here since 53. It's good XP if you can get a camp.</div></div><hr />
