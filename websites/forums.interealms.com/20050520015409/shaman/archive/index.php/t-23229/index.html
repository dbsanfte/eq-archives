Goup heal is nice, cast spells with hp is pretty situational mostly for use in fight with mana drain ae's i guess ....as for ward  ...if not a serious heal upgrade ...crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Armak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Now those three shaman specific AA points are what?<br />
<br />
YES CRAP!!<br />
<br />
At least when you compare the to the other classes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Man I HATE how I always say this... but let's just wait and see what pans out.  The other AAs are insanely good.  And yes so far the ones that look like they belong to us kinda suck.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those AAs look pretty creative to me, at least Spirit Channeling.  What's the issue?  I think 99% of you are going to be unhappy no matter what Sony does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That link posted originally by Nadia shows the list more detailed and splitted into class specific sections.<br />
<br />
Overall the shaman's part doesn't look too bad, especially when compared to previous expansions ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Critt HoTs (Healing Boon), improved RC (Resplendent Cure), new spellgem (Mnemonic Retention) / buffslots (Mystical Attuning) and less agro (Slight of Hand) sounds the best ones for me so far.<br />
<br />
I'm only OOM / LOM when I have to chain spam DM, just rezzed or have to buff a raid in uqua after a wipe without MGB. With this in mind Spirit Channeling sounds intressting but won't help much.<br />
<br />
Well, the other ones aren't killer AAs but not so bad either. Improved FT / resists limit, larger unconscious HP buff... yup, I like them.<br />
<br />
edit: the list on the chanter site (http://www.therunes.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=5199) looks a little bit better formated ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I hate to say it, but some of those AA's are actually very nice... But then again i'm also crazy and am at 1573 out of the 1750, and a 203 alchemy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you notice the order, they seem to be in class order, alphabetically, now look at where &quot;Call of the Wild&quot; is on that list... you do the math.<br />
<br />
and without breaking the NDA, I'll say this much... if I was buying Omens before (which I wasn't)... I definitely wouldn't be now. Period.<br />
<br />
(This is not because of the lackluster AA ... again, and the fact the costs will be extravagant, again, I'm sure... but just, overall impressions without saying anything I can't, not that it matters anyway, like they have yet to actually enforce one of those things)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Judging by chanter list it looks like both shaman AND druids will get the new semi-rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah it's nice that we apparently get Call of the Wild, although the name is way druidy.  I was hoping it was a spell and not an AA though.  If it's an AA with a long reuse then it's ONLY handy for summoning one dead cleric on a raid or it you happen to lose just one person on an LDoN.  I wonder how many people will mistakenly loot all their gear?<br />
<br />
The hitpoints for mana AA sounds great on paper, but I expect it to have the wonderful timing of Rabid Bear and besides, mana is not our issue, we got mana coming out our ears -- it's something effective to USE that mana on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">going through the list I found quite a few AAs I liked. It actually starts with  Eternal Breath  , lol, never worry about fish scales ever again (yes, I know there is a componentless EB out there).<br />
<br />
More buff slots, more spell slots and higher FT are things we have been begging for for ages.<br />
<br />
But this one,  Delay Death , is going to take out all the fun of purple club! I just wonder if it will do much good the way mobs have been hitting the last expansion.<br />
<br />
Overall a surprisingly creative list, imho, lets hope it makes it to live. <br />
<br />
Will it make me buy the expansion? No idea, but at least it won t turn me off like those GoD AAs did. The way spells are handled will most likely be  the deciding factor for me. Concerning content I have little hope. That will most likely continue with this sucky alien theme I find simply ugly and the high dps/ low hp combat style GoD began and that makes us shamans mostly useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What i wondered about delay deathis this.  If you are at say -50, will the mob still attack you becase you will have low on health agro, or will it ignore you because you should be dead?  I'm guessing the first as i still remember getting beated while KO as a newb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience, as long as the server doesnt have you registered as &quot;dead&quot;, and therefore transfering you to your bind point, you still retain agro your original agro AND you get sit agro as well.  So all that the Delay death AA would do (IMO) is allow your healer a second or two more to get the heal off.  Im thinking its one of those &quot;ok Ive got 880 AA's..now what do I get&quot; type deals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">most likely youll still have aggro.. but this gives priests a bigger margin of error when healing<br />
<br />
i really like some of these AAs.. it shows theyre actually thinking of unique and fun ones, i absolutely love the mage elemental abilities, and the wizard familiars for focusing their power, the secondary bind point is also cool.. although shamans and clerics have always had a secondary bind ;)</div></div><hr />

A few other classes got a wipe hate type ability before the monks finally got theres, the monks are just now getting it? It just doesn't seem fair and I'm sure toss in the super high aa cost they'll throw at you.<br />
I didnt' see anything particulary exciting. Using Hp for mana looks interesting. Crit HoT's I think should have been available to us before this. The few pet aa's don't look that interesting... but why should I care were not a &quot;pet class&quot;. It will be interesting if we get the rez type spell... it still doesn't fix my biff with waiting for the timer to end plus 30 minutes in instance zones to get a rez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Some nice new ideas for some classes, although I can see a few classes that will be disappointed.(ranger, necro,Wizard)<br />
<br />
Can't believe they've made aa's for some of the abilities, like another raise in stats, and increased regen caps. Was going to say Delay death too, but I can see that as quite a useful aa for warriors tanking, giving an extra 300 hp margin.<br />
Improved suspended minion is another one which I can't believe they've had to add a aa. Fun time for the 700 aa people when it comes out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">those AAs look pretty creative to me, at least Spirit Channeling. What's the issue?&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, from my perspective, here is whats wrong:<br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling<br />
While this ability is active, all of your spells will be fueled directly by the energy of your body, consuming hit points rather than mana.<br />
<br />
I have an overabundance of mana right now.  Rarely do I run out.  For me, the issue is my available spell set doesn't do anything really beneficial for an encounter, not that I run out of mana.  In GoD, for example, By the time the mob is 'debuffed', I can either A) maybe toss one nuke which is weak, or toss one heal, which is the weakest of any class.  Not to mention, my slow was probably mitigated.  <br />
<br />
What would make that typical god encounter desire a shaman more?  Well, perhaps an AA that instantly transfers my life to another?  Or perhaps an AA that partially bypasses slow mitigation?  Or perhaps the chance to crit slow?  Or perhaps a long re-use timer AA that makes all our nukes crit for 3 casts for raids?  Bascially, anything that is A) instant, and B) more powerful either in terms of healing or dmg.<br />
<br />
Boon of the Ancients<br />
Use of this ability creates an enhanced version of your Call of the Ancients ward. Increased ranks improve the healing capabilities of this ward.<br />
<br />
Uhm... do I even need to say why this totally sucks?  Completely useless for raids with any AE.  Does anyone actually use this now?  The benefits were only slighly noticeable, and I expect this to be similarily lame.  A ward that has 100 hp and little visible regen will still be useless even if its doubled in power.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid<br />
Through use of this ability, the shaman can call upon their ancestors for aid, providing healing and rest to their group.<br />
<br />
This is the 400 hp per tick + end regen AA.  And its probably the best one of the lot.  IF, IF, it can be mgb'd.  Yes, shaman in groups have it tough as the the main healer, but even moreso in raids.  We don't contribute squat.  Last night, I was in Yxxta.  Every single mob, except for a series of spiders and beetles during a trash phase, were UNSLOWABLE.  Again, I could contribute mitigated slow on the trash and perhaps one nuke.  If this can't be mgb'd, it will at best give us a few more zones to play main healer in.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, even if it can be mgb'd, clerics, druids, and our hybrid beastlord already have this, and are getting it upgraded as well.  Not exactly a role defining upgrade imo.  <br />
<br />
---------------------<br />
<br />
So what it boils down to is more mana to burn on spells that aren't very effective, a hp ward we already had and never used, and at best a possible raid heal that 3 classes already have (and the endurance regen isn't a big deal imo.  Its not like we don't cycle tanks anyways, so endurance is never an issue in my guild).  <br />
<br />
Combine these with what I assume are our new spells:<br />
New 1.5k ice nuke<br />
Pr/DR debuff<br />
New pet<br />
Stat buffs<br />
<br />
And I see the exact same shaman as I did before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Judging by chanter list it looks like both shaman AND druids will get the new semi-rez.<br />
Judging by the people who hve reported from the beta itself, we do not get it, just druids do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">in my opinion they are not adding enough aa.<br />
<br />
There should be a considerable amount of aa available. For the base level of focus effect.  For improved weapon skills. For combat effects and Modifiers for ac improvements and attk improvements. <br />
<br />
Basicly for every stat in the game there should be an upgrade path. An improvement path.  2% increases for 3 aa to base damage of DD. 2% for dots. 10 ranks of each. 5 points for a +5 to cap for weapon skills. to worn attack through items and such.  Want more avoidance. Pay for it. Want to be able to regen 50 hps a tick innate. Pay for it. <br />
<br />
That would allow for multiple ways to get the improvements for your charecter that you choose. Outside of the level path or gear paths as well. <br />
<br />
I have always hated that Bob the warrior god of all that he surveys can use a sword exactly like Fred the Bazzar weekend warrior. There should be weapon styles bought with AA that allow different things.  + 3 to main hand bonus damage When Bob uses any 1 hand slashing weapon. <br />
<br />
But Fred likes Crushing weapons.. So he gets the +3 chance to crit when he stricks with a Two handed hammer. <br />
<br />
If a shaman likes to meele even though it is not the basic gist of the class. they should be able to spend a considerable amount of time to become semi effective in that role. Like 30 points to get main hand damage bonus. 10 points per 30% of the normal warrior Main hand bonus. Same with Double attack. And weapon skills. If I spent 100 AA I should be able to meele with a chosen weapon style almost as good as a meele. Just like if he spends 100 AA a paladin should be able to direct heal almost as good as a shaman.  (All based upon the spell ranges and such. So warriors could get + 50 to thier heal spells but it would only happen on Lifetap procs cause they dont have any other heals availble to them.<br />
<br />
Of course my opinion only.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I really like a lot of the basic AAs on the lists, but the class ones seem like we are getting gimpped a bit because we wear so many hats.  They toss us the crit nukes and the pet AAs, then say that our list is just as long as every other classes list is.  But the pet and nuke AAs do us VERY little overall good.   I had been hopefull reading through the lists at first seeing the VERY nice enhancers to people's primary jobs (SoS staying up through spell casting, an FD that INSTANTLY mem wipes, etc).  Then I got to the shaman and I am only barely happy about those ones.  Using HP to cast spells can come in handy on rare occasions, and if I have 1 or 2 more spellgems I might even see OOM a bit more often than 1 or 2 times a month.  Enhancing the boon better enhance it a LOT, like to the point of being a HoT instead of a regen.  And then the group heal, well it's a mana free heal, so as long as the re-use on it is around the same as canni5 I don't mind too terribly I suppose.<br />
<br />
  Oh well, on the upside I cannot play at all for another couple months due to RL, so i will get to see how this expansion fleshes out before deciding on purchasing it.</div></div><hr />

Give them a new class AA and make it available to everyone else like all the other general TS AA's. Its not like its a class specific tradeskill like alchemy or make poison. <br />

The shaman specific stuff is kinda weak compared to so the chanter stuff and I'm still really worried about the cost and the prereq's considering GoD AA's.</div></div><hr />

Nothing in that AA list will make us any more interesting to groups.  It makes the specialists more specialized (clerics and wizards and necros, for example), but leave us generalists further behind.<br />
<br />
Consider:  10% more to heals. Before OoW spells, that's +325 for clerics, and +155 for shaman . . .<br />

<br />
<br />
Mages can't solo anything that would be able to kill them anyway. Considering that they will get this AA after they're 65, it won't do them any good. Mages can't solo the same things true solo classes can since they lack snare and they don't have root or dots. The best they can do is charm a kjal in BoT and use it for a pet.<br />

The mana regeneration comparison between classes just became even tighter.  The new cannibalize spells have not recieved significant upgrades in efficiency.  With the new AA allowing casters to increase how much FT they can have, combined with our lack of real upgrades in the mana regeneration department, we're losing out.<br />

Critical affliction still not up to par of Fury of magic.<br />

Beastlords can buff ATK higher than Shaman<br />

Slow has been crippled from the mitigation and slow caps implemented into the game. That and that fact that we SLOW... Slowly!<br />
<br />
We are the least potent of the healing classes and lack any means to give our mana to other classes combined with the fact that our stat buffs have become unnecessary in the END GAME. Unless I want to group with level 50ish toons in tier 1 POP or older zones and/or be a noob buff bot in POK to fund rerolling another class that can more actively particpate in the end game... Shaman days are numbered.<br />
<br />
From being the BUFFing gurus and the default slowing class. The game has developed to the point where other than Wizards all casting classes can share mana (Mod Rod, Mana Dumps, group buffs with mana regen components) EXCEPT shammie's. All healing classes will now be able to REZ except shammie's. And equipment and necessity means most level 60+ folks are near or at stat cap and have no need of our stat buffs..... But even if someone NEEDED our buffs that would not motivate anyone to including a Shaman in a group at GoD or above zones.<br />

Quote:<br />

Shamans serve as priests to the tribal races of Norrath, able to draw upon the power of the spirits and focus it for their own purposes. Shamans are primarily a magic-using class, able to wear chain armor and wield blunt weapons and spears<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
.<br />
<br />
This opening description indicates to me PRIMARY HEALING for the tribal races (Barb's for example can't be Clerics).<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies. A shaman's enhancement spells are always in demand, massively improving the strength, stamina, health, and other physical aspects of the shaman's group. Shamans also are able to heal their allies and have excellent health regeneration spells.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How pray tell have Shamans enhanced the &quot;MIND&quot;. I've long felt shaman should be able to use their life force &quot;CANNI&quot; to help others by means of CANNI-Heal, CANNI-Cure, and/or being able to invoke spirits to rez (Even summon spirit of fallen comrade to corpse such as what is being given to druids), cast a form of DA on others (Like Wizzy mana burn, Shaman's should be able to burn mana/hps to shield another member of their group).<br />
<br />
<br />
Quote:<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly. A brutal line of crippling spells can slow a monster's attacks, hamper their resistance to spells, and lower their physical prowess.<br />
<br />
Shamans are a well-rounded class with strong abilities in both group and solo situations. An experienced shaman can turn the tide of any battle, bolstering their allies while weakening their enemies significantly. The shaman is an excellent class for players who enjoy working in groups.<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The remainer of the definition of a Shaman. Over the past years the Shaman class has lost many of it's CLASS DEFINING abilities to other classes and I completely agree with reduction of dependacy on any one class.... I don't think the DEV's read the class definitions very often nor do they feel it necessary to include role play in thier considerations for duture exspansions. I'm not alone in this..... The one spell this has cast on the Shaman community is &quot;Hive of Bees&quot;, they is even talk of a community wide boycott of all Shaman.<br />

PS.  I am more than willing to listen to reason, but as it stands now unless the Shaman class gets something to make us appealing to join GoD groups other than us begging, or something that defines us better in the END GAME.... I stand ready to go shoulder to shoulder with the Shaman community in the vien of the &quot;ONE VOICE&quot; concept just let me know when we are gonna do it!</div></div><hr />

What good would that do? I can't see the majority of shamans (excluding the highly skilled) even remotely noticed by anyone. Takes long enough for the skilled bunch to find/make a group, let alone try to &quot;stand up for their beliefs&quot;.<br />
<br />
As it is, people prefer chanters/beastlords over a shaman anyway, because they bring more versatility in today's &quot;mob must be dead within 30 seconds&quot; world as opposed to the old &quot;will take at least 60 seconds&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Based off when I see you retired, you probably have never cast ancient canni huh. So you probably have no idea what you're talking about too huh. Im sure myself, Gangas, Vals, Zunayn and others would happily vouch that it is indeed a lot of mana regen. Its 1/3 of a canni5 that you can use ever 18 seconds. At the moment the recast isn't tied to canni4 either. Hence you can &quot;twist&quot; the 2 different cannis, use AA canni, and get to FM from 0 in under 3 minutes. You're right though, wizards are gonna med just as fast as us still np.</div></div><hr />

Not my idea, has been suggested by others.  But I WOULD support it.  My ascertion is we are becoming mid-50ish level buff BOTS or the most sought after class to PL 50ish level folks in Tier 1 pop zones.  Our desirability in the end game is low and getting lower.  Atleast the end game as it relates to GoD and above expansions.<br />
<br />
Of course the role of being primary healer and slower for the EC/WC camps in POV will ALWAYS want a Shaman!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Rtugok, here is what I meant.  If a magician has 15FT post OoW, he earns 9000 mana more per hour (600*15).  A shaman has 15FT too, and thus, regenerates mana at the same rate of 9000 mana per hour.  In addition, the shaman has an AA, which for the sake of argument, adds 6000 more mana per hour.  Lets say with OoW you can raise the FT cap by 10, allowing for 25FT.  This would mean that both these classes can now regenerate 15,000 mana in addititon to their meditations.  Since the shaman still has that AA, you have,<br />
<br />
Pre OoW:<br />
Magician 9,000 mana/hour<br />
Shaman 15,000 mana/hour<br />
<br />
Post OoW:<br />
Magician 15,000 mana/hour<br />
Shaman 21,000 mana/hour<br />
<br />
Basic math tells us that the margin between shaman and magician mana regen is the same (6000 mana), but that the ratios are now different.  Comparatively, the magician now regenerates mana faster in a post OoW world because of basic FT changes.  Though you point out that we can twist our cannibalizes, I can't honestly say that I expect Sony to allow us to do that for long given that that idea specifically was such a burr in their underwear when the idea was first proposed.  Though I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Regardless, drop the high and mighty attitude.  So many people on this board have uber loots and so many more do not even play their shaman anymore.  We all contribute.  This isn't monkly business, this is the shaman's crucible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">To all of you that whine about our AA list supposedly being bad, I'm ashamed to share the same class as you.<br />
<br />
Ability: Slight of Hand SCS is one of the very best shaman AAs that exist.  I was thrilled to see this existing.  Good stuff #1.<br />
<br />
Ability: Healing Adept Mastery<br />
Ability: Healing Gift Mastery More healing AAs are good.  Good stuff #2 and 3.<br />
<br />
Ability: Improved Critical Affliction Dotting is one of the main ways we can do damage.  I saw no complaints over getting Critical Affliction.  More crits is always better.  Good stuff #4.<br />
<br />
Ability: Improved Suspended Minion This should be free.  If pets can zone, then suspended pets should zone.  It's dumb that I summon a pet, suspend it, invis through hostile terratory, unsuspend it, zone, suspend it again, invis through more hostile terratory, unsuspend it, zone, repeat as I travel.  That's bull****.  This AA should be free.<br />
<br />
Ability: Advanced Pet Discipline Weak ability on the first level.  Useless 2nd level, unless possibly your duel wielding pet won't proc mage weaponry anymore, when you are fighting mobs that reflect spell.  Ya.  Weak.  Better than alchemy mastery though for last picks on AA skills when you get to the 800 range or so, though.<br />
<br />
Ability: Healing Boon More healing is always better, whether it's crits or whatever.  Good stuff #5.<br />
<br />
Ability: Resplendent Cure This is sooo needed.  For anyone that thinks this is a crap ability, take a look at RC3.  It cures 16 points.  Now take a look at just about every spell effect that mobs cast that you want to cure with this.  It's either 18 or 36 counters.  ***.  RC3 wasn't any better than RC1 when it comes to curing, because you can't get rid of almost any spell effects with it.  Now, it will be useful for curing all sorts of ailments.  It'll be of the most use for people still in the ele planes, but will still be useful for many other fights beyond.  Good stuff #6.<br />
<br />
Ability: Destructive Fury More standard crit damage increases.  If you want to do damage as a shaman, you are either nuking/raining or dotting.  Crit nukes or crit dots is the way you'll wanna go.  More good stuff #7.<br />
<br />
Ability: Call of the Wild INCREDIBLY useful ability.  You don't have to leave expeditions and start over if the cleric dies and is only healer.  You can do some trials and dungeons without a resser, and if something goes wrong, you can just carry on and worry about getting an xp res later (if you even need the res considering how fast xp comes back from a death).  Good stuff #8 (should be more like #8 and #9 just because of how good this is).<br />
<br />
Ability: Spiritual Channeling Depending on duration and reuse, this will has the potential to be broken in power if it's rapid reuse or long duration/permanent.  If it's short duration it won't be that big a deal.  If it's long reuse, it'll just be useful for raiding infrequent targets.  Using the AA, it'll cost you a few hundred health to cast a hot on yourself, you'll heal it all back in full in 1 tick, and the rest of the 4-8 tick duration will be health that can be converted into more spells.  If you fight a mob that drains mana, you can ignore it.  If you run out of mana spam healing a tank for some hard encounters (think Ikkinz single group trials or raiding big targets like Quarm or Uqua's Furious/Enraged etc) you can just pop the AA for a whole new reserve of &quot;mana&quot;.  I'm loving what this can do, especially coming from a high end raiding background.  Good stuff #9.<br />
<br />
Ability: Boon of the Ancients *yawn*.  The wards are fairly inconsequential.  I can't ever notice if they are around or not.  I know they do a bit, but it's not much.  Wouldn't care if they never invented this.<br />
<br />
Ability: Ancestral Aid If this is an AA hot, it'll be nice.  Otherwise, this may or may not be useful in any way.  The healing wards look good in theory, but turned out to be pretty crappy expenditure of points unless you don't have much else to pick after you have 400+ AAs already spent.  Maybe good stuff #10, maybe crap.<br />
<br />
There's 9 good AAs out of the 13 listed.  It's more of the same AAs that I already love having.  We get some new AAs that are incredibly useful.  There's not much more I could have asked for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well howler, if were gonna use the basic math you talked about lets try and do it right. You said that we have an aa that gives us 6000 more mana an hour. That's simply incorrect. Canni 5 is 1924 HP for 1200 mana every 3 minutes. 60 / 3 = 20. 20 * 1200 = 24000 not 6000. Also, there is the spell canni which you seem to have forgotten about. It adds about 2 more canni 5 worths over the 3 minutes. 668 hp for 360 mana every 18 seconds, so about 3 times per minute which is 1080 a minute or about 3000 mana every 3 minutes which over an hour is 60000 mana. So you have 15000 which you claim is how much mana youd get from Ft assuming the cap is 25 (which we dont know what the new cap is) + 24000 mana from canni 5 + 60000 mana from ACP is about 100,000 mana over an hour.<br />
<br />
so with ft 25 in an hour the shaman regenerates 100,000 mana to your mage that you calculated at 15000 an hour. These are assuming no mental clarity aa or anything else AA wise. We still regenerate a **** load more mana than them but yeah, youre right, theyre gaining on us. NERF MAGES! ****in dumb ass.<br />
<br />
And for the record, just because I have like 6700 HP unbuffed doesn't mean everything I say is all &quot;high and mighty&quot;, but if you're gonna talk like a b i t c h i'm gonna slap you like a b i t c h. Next time do some more math before you post bull****, or maybe you quit before shaman got canni ...<br />
<br />
EDIT: And why did you say for the sakeof argument canni 5 adds 6000 mana an hour instead of 24000? Is it because we don't need as much mana is it is capable of generating? Because if that's the case then I don't see why your post even matters. If you do need the mana, maybe you should 1) learn to do math 2) calculate the canni spell in to the equation 3) cast canni 5 more 4) retire fromt he boards as well<br />
<br />
I can go from 0 - 8100 mana in just under 3 minutes as is. You go find a mage or a wizard and ask them how long it takes them to get FM after a rez. I guaruntee it isn't anywhere near 3 minutes unless they're recieving pumps. Mages are a weak class that recently have gotten pretty shafted, so I don't see why more mana regen that they can get is going to hurt us when we get 2 new canni spells and they don't. I just don't understand why the amount of mana a mage will regenerate in an hour matters when shaman can regenerate a truckload more, maybe you could enlighten me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Howler's right.<br />
<br />
(I'm not positive how much standing mana regen is as a base.  I think It's 1, but I'm not sure.  Assuming it is.)<br />
<br />
Standing mana regen with c5, 9, sd, MC3, FT15:<br />
1+ 18 + 8 + 9 + 3 + 15 = 54 per tick.<br />
Using your math, 60000 mana in an hour is about 100 mana per tick on average.<br />
Mage to shaman ratio before oow:<br />
54/154 = 0.35<br />
Mage to shaman ratio after oow assuming increase in FT cap to FT25:<br />
64/164 = 0.39<br />
<br />
Basic math says, with FT cap increasing, other classes are closing the gap between our mana regen and theirs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Spiritual Channeling LOOKS cool... though I believe my casual Group clerics despise my yo-yo health bar enough already, heh heh.  Seeing as how Health is so much more easily restored than Mana, I would assume that they water this ability down so much that it would become more of a playtoy than a consistantly useful ability.  Perhaps if they blocked new heals during the duration, but perhapsallowed you to cast a HoT beforehand, and allowed you to end the effect when you desired by clicking it off or whatnot.<br />
<br />
Healing ward upgrade?  Assuming the ward can be shredded and used as toilet paper, I might just invest in this one, for after a few hefty Halas 10 lb. Meat Pies.<br />
<br />
Ancestral Aid says it provides Healing AND Rest.  Could this imply that it heals endurance?  That would be nifty.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Its generally acknowledged shaman are behind the power curve now - maybe with 8100 mana and 6-7k+ unbuffed you can function just fine but *average* shaman are hurting. <br />
<br />
Going along with your statement I bet I could do a decent job of healing in the areas you are fighting, with 13k tanks who have 2500ac. I bet most bazaar geared shaman with decent aa's could do a reasonable job - the problem is getting to this content in the first place. Most of my guild tanks are 8.8k - 9.5k raid buffed and 1600ish ac and we are just starting to look at Fennin Ro, Coirnav etc in the EP's. <br />
<br />
As for the list of aa's - you do realise that the vast majority of those you listed are all available to the classes we are directly competing for with our group slots. So, we are going to end up in exactly the same place relative to all the other classes - that in no way is an upgrade if everyone else gets the same upgrade.<br />
<br />
General AA's (lump them all together)<br />
<br />
All classes getting these so shaman end up in the same place we are at the moment.<br />
<br />
And for our class only aa's we get<br />
<br />
1 useful - Call of the Wild (personally I would rate this lower - with druids getting this most groups will still take cleric/druid and go for enchanter or BL for slow anyway)<br />
1 Crap - Healing ward<br />
2 we have no idea if they are going to be useful or not (probably not, knowing SoE's reputation)<br />

Exactly.  Ass shouldn't be an upgrade for a class over another.<br />
They should all be balanced among each other for relative power increase.<br />
<br />
AAs don't balance a class.  They never have.  They should be used to.<br />
Classes are balanced up to the point that someone can start to gain AAs.<br />
Classes are balanced up to level 60.<br />
Classes only get out of whack when you get from the 60 up to the 65 jump.<br />
That's where class balance gets out of line.<br />
Classes should remain balanced before you even get any AAs factored in.</div></div><hr />

You are putting how I feel into words much better than I have been able too (yeah yeah, I keep trying, anyone who has read some of my &quot;ramblings&quot; knows . . . I can RAMBLE). <br />
<br />
I am happy. I think we are stepped up quite a bit. Trust me, I was shopping for a 65 + 250aa Bard to switch to my main (our guild recently had the best Bard I have ever known retire, /salute Aanerin). I love EQ, but I was getting tired of my class being bitch-slapped by SOE. I was quite preprared to &quot;follow the road&quot; to the obsolesence of the Shaman class . . . til now. I think we are back. You people who seem to want SUPERMAN class again are not thinking clearly. <br />
<br />
SOE has done a fantatic job pulling this game back from the brink of despair. If OoW is even 1/2 as good as its starting to look, then WoW better start upping the ante, cause people arent gonna stay there.<br />
Gates is going to become MUCH more accessible. OoW is going to make the EPs a high probability for anyone who wants to put time into Pick Up raids. Even the high cost of Gates AAs are starting to look smaller with the amount of XP available to anyone with a half solid group (ANY decent group can XP at the ZI area of Vxed, trust me). Not a big assumption to suggest that OoW will have even better XP areas for the climb to 70.<br />
I'm just happy that the new stuff will help me do my part better. It may not be the list I'd have made up, but it'll do. For me. For now.<br />
Hear here, Samanna, well said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">My numbers weren't precise, they were intended to convey the basic meaning of what I was trying to say.  So when I said that it's 6000 for the sake of argument, I'm saying it could be 1000, 10, 10000000, or 24000.  It doesn't matter.  Simply put, if the FT cap has gone up by the same amount for all classes, and the FT generated by our cannibalize line has remained the same, we lose comparative mana regeneration capabilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">Whatever Griz, its the same thing I was rounding some on the math too. The point is the mana regen howler claimed we had was a slaughtered version of what were capable of. And the other guys math is a bit off because he didnt include mana regen from can 5. But basically were regenning about 3 or more times the mana a mage does. They took away pet canni, I don't see why you have to be a dick when other casters that have mana regen issues get an AA that helps that WE GET TOO. If a mage gains 10 more FT does that not help you out in groups and raids? If wizards gain more mana regen does that not help your guild dps targets faster? If clerics gain ten more FT does that not lengthen the amount of time that they can keep your tanks up on raids? You don't need to be the super god of mana regen, you need something useful to focus all that mana on. We are at a point in this game where we don't need mana regen, we just  don't. Complaining over trivial issues like this mage almost gained more mana regen from OoW than I did takes focus away from the real issues. Don't ask why you can't regen your mana faster, ask why you can't use the mana you have better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">It's NOT that the AAs themselves are bad (with the exception of the pet thing), it's the relative scale of them.<br />
<br />
These AA make the generalists more general, and the specialists more specialized.  10% more healing = 325 to clerics, and 155 to shaman.  The raw gap is increasing.<br />
<br />
That's true of almost all of the stuff we get.  Sure, we get some new ones--the rez and the mana/hp thing.  However, SCS doesn't work NOW, why are you so gung ho about more AA for something that won't do crap for DoTs?<br />
<br />
NOTHING in there is likely to make us more groupable than we already are.  They make the specialist classes stronger than us on a raw basis.  No one would want to take a generalist over a specialist.  Nothing there is going to get us any groups over a cleric, druid, enchanter, or BL.<br />
<br />
THAT is why the AA kinda suck.<br />

I would also like to see them bump the banked AA bank.  Its going to be enough of a grind getting to 70 without having all those AAs tempting me.  30 is no where near enough.</div></div><hr />

Are you nuts, Kiebler?  If they have a pool of 50 or 100AA, they'll make AA that cost 50 or 100AA points.<br />

But if he cant bank all those AAs then how would he be able to use a couple of days to fill out his reserves so he can buy all the AAs when the expansion is released? We all know that is the way its supposed to be. Because if one thing is certain it is that the expansion will be a thoroughly tested and balanced product that will need you to be maxed out AA-wise.<br />
<br />
If I have to be serious for a little while I agree with you Chutoi ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Problem with an improved SCS is it does nothing for DoT aggro. Add on even more aggro from more crits and well...you will need super glue solvent to remove a mob from me. Or just wait a second and I will be at my bind point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Benedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">To all of you that whine about our AA list supposedly being bad, I'm ashamed to share the same class as you.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Since your post is within the thread I posted and you didn't address *ANY* of the points I raised am I supposed to think your reply is to me?<br />
<br />
  I didn't say the AA's proposed for the shaman class suck nor did I whine about them as you claim in your reply.<br />
<br />
  I posted a message about where are class came from, where it is, and where I believe it should be going.<br />
<br />
  I'm in a family based guild on a blue server, I have not been Zerged, Ebayed, or twinked out since day one.  Those situations may apply to others posting here that think all is right with the world cause the end game of EQ was spoon fed to them.<br />
<br />
  I'm not asking anyone to HELP me or place the Shaman class ahead of anyone.  I'm asking SONY why the DEV's don't follow the definitions of the class and include more in game content that supports this from a logical approach (Can you for example explain why the BST epic is a clicky SLOW and for us it's a EP drop. Meaning didn't exist until well after epic's were added). I for one enjoy our classes uniqueness and promote future additions to the game that contain both growth and can be logically traced to our roots.  I enjoy the complexity of the game and doing things that stretch the limits of level, class, race, and amount of AA's.  Sometimes in the heat of the moment I may post a message with some negative comments, and of course ANYTHING I post I welcome comments and thoughts I may have not considered...... Something that allows me to learn and improve.<br />
<br />
  A message that starts with &quot;For those of you whining I ashamed to be of the same class&quot;..... It kinda bodes to me that I'm not gonna learn much from someone so self centered and such on their uberness to actually discuss a topic.... Any topic in a mature and thoughtful manner.  Imagine my surpise to scroll down and see that on many of the NEW AA's you and I are in total agreement!<br />
<br />
  Course I won't agree that the attitude would not have been better &quot;Checked at the door&quot;.  After all this isn't the Crucible Flame Board it *IS* supposed to be where Shaman share, discuss, laugh, learn, and help each other.  Okay so  now I ****.... Get back in the game cause I'm a noob, that just total sucs.<br />

It's not that these AA's are bad, just that they don't do anything to<br />

There is only one way to play EQ?  Hmmm, can you forward me the link to that information please.  I would hate to be out of step with the chicken littles.</div></div><hr />
