<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is from the Community Leader boards on SOE's website: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We are starting to put together a list of some more community changes that we can roll out in the weeks and months ahead and we would like your help. <br />
<br />
Other than backflagging and class definition, what ideas do you have for improvements to gameplay and general improvements to the game. I only exclude class definition and backflagging as we are looking into those already. <br />
<br />
So pull out your thinking caps and let's start a good list. Please refrain from adding affirmations to ideas on the list. If you wish to add commentary, then please do, but no &quot;I agree with Number 352!&quot; posts please. <br />
<br />
Other things we have heard from the community are as follows: <br />
<br />
General - <br />
<br />
Bring back the boats <br />
<br />
Show pet hit points in numbers not percentages <br />
<br />
Put the POD on /find <br />
<br />
Allow no-drop items to be turned in for Tribute <br />
<br />
Improve EQIM and support it <br />
<br />
Give titles for having the Wayfarer augment <br />
<br />
Add titles for home towns <br />
<br />
A time stamp for chat logs <br />
<br />
Make the second and third rings for mark NPC and delegate main assist look just like the first ring (Change the colors to make them look more different) <br />
<br />
The ability to choose which LDoN missions you want to do <br />
<br />
Add guild chat to EQIM <br />
<br />
Add the ability to name your pet or horse <br />
<br />
Class Specific - <br />
<br />
Lower the Fizzle Rate for bard songs <br />
<br />
Increase Pet speed so they keep up with their masters <br />
<br />
Pet messages go in tells to the pet's master (&quot;backing off&quot; &quot;holding&quot; etc) This will eliminate spam. <br />
<br />
Add an endurance regen items, spells, or items <br />
<br />
Increase pet focus drops and availability <br />
<br />
Make Call of the Hero and summon corpse equal - Make CoTH available in all corpse summoning zones. If a small area of the zone is necessary to have both coth/corpse summon blocked for potential exploit reasons then just block that small area of the zone. <br />
<br />
Decrease the Feign death failure rate <br />
<br />
Allow for more trade ins - Tunic to Robe and vice versa (this is a caster and monk request) <br />
<br />
Increase the number of Undead and Summoned NPC’s overall zones <br />
<br />
Improve Track for rangers <br />
<br />
Add an AA that prevents leaving group mates behind in teleport and evacuation spells (Druid and Wizard issue)   <br />

So what would you add to the list? Please try to think holistically, responses should not be limited to class balance issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm.  One thing I've gotten in the habit of using extensively is the Group Leadership AA, Health of Targets Target.  It's so usefull, that I really miss it when I solo, duo, or the current groupleader doesn't have it.<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
An AA to let you use any of your own purchased Group/Raid leader AA's any time.<br />
<br />
Having this AA will let only you use these when solo or duoing.  If duo, your partner can't use them.  If 3+ in the group and you're the groupleader, anyone can, as normal.<br />
<br />
Considerations would have to be given to the stacking of ability boosting skills, so that you don't gain hp/mana or whatever from your skills and from the current group/raid leaders skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>StormCrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Add an option like in EQ2 to have you helm visible or invisible to you and other players.<br />
Not exactly a game improvement, but I hear alot of people that like/hate having a graphic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe bump up the effect from the innate regen line of AA's now that all the spell regen's were raised.<br />
<br />
<br />
Change the pet affinity AA, make it were instead of costing so much and your pet gets all group buffs split it into 2 ranks.<br />
First rank your pet gets an group buffs you cast, second rank your pet gets all group buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Add a book or portal spell to the arena.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reduce the spam from low or no food/drink.<br />
Not really an improvement to game play, but it does get annoying sometimes.<br />
<br />
Add augments to the bazaar search option now that we have droppable augments.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Get some staff that are willing to see reason , answer specific questions , not palm off folk with worthless bull****e rhetoric , and timewaste (*cough*)<br />
<br />
Maybe I could go into more detail and produce facts , but I think issues are blatantly there for all to see . Just another stalling device to keep 'the lines of communication ' very one sided ..<br />
<br />
sorry if my opinions will offend but hey at least I'm entitled to them outside sony boards<br />
<br />
<br />
ohh on a side note &gt;&gt; I WILL keep playing till sony bring down all servers , so does that make me a voice in the woods whilst no-one is there apart from trees and shrubs ..<br />
<br />
Thanks for your / my time Sony</div></div><hr />

Expand this idea to fix some really ugly graphics stuff. Like backwards weapons when in main hand or off hand. If they asked for lists of all the equipment graphics issues that are race/class/slot they would get a ton of responses of things to fix.<br />
<br />
Notable one that comes to mind is the Velium Inlaid Claws graphic.<br />
<br />
Important? Heck no, would still like them fixed though.<br />

<br />
What seems to be the 2 BIGGEST problems people complain about.?<br />
<br />
Backflagging and class definition.<br />
<br />
What dont Sony want to hear about ?<br />
<br />
Yes youve guessed it backflagging and class definition :).<br />

1 thing thats always bugged me is spell interruptions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Racial AAs.<br />

Make all racial benefits accessible to every race and remove the exp penalties for all races in the process.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">On your (SOE) next expansion, put alot of thought into the AA's.  Make them all original.  Do not put an AA or AA's that copy existing effects on some equipment.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Perhaps they could have &quot;gearsets&quot; just like they have &quot;spellsets&quot; to allow people to swap gear around with fewer keystrokes.<br />
<br />
I'd like to be able to spawn instanced dungeons solo rather than logging 3 accounts in to do it, then logging 2 of them out.<br />
<br />
A web interface to &quot;trader mode&quot; in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
An option to make horse heads invisible so you don't have to shrink yourself to make them go away or buy a goofy looking lizard to avoid them.<br />
<br />
Fix the graphics engine so I don't look through the world when shrunk and running up stairs or along mountainsides.<br />
<br />
A tweak to forage so you can set it up to exclude certain items which you'd prefer never to forage.<br />
<br />
Allow shamans to have a special version of forage that yields alchemy herbs rather than traditional forages.<br />
<br />
Better in-game diagnostics so you can figure out what's causing game problems like lag so you know what you'd have to turn off to fix it.<br />
<br />
Optionally visible Cloaks.<br />
<br />
A command to allow a hot key to invoke a hot key.<br />
<br />
The ability to create an autoreply without going AFK.<br />

Stop making content 'harder' by just giving mobs more hit points and making them hit for more.  Put some creativity back into zone design and make people actually play their classes.  Big open fields with roaming mobs that get plucked one at a time is boring as hell.  Put dungeons back in the game -- why are there no more guks, sebilises, splitpaws, and crystal caverns?  LDoN was nice, but the zone design was uninspired to say the least.  <br />
<br />
Challenge my abilities, not my gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'll answer more tomorrow, but my immediate thought when I saw Glori's post (Big game versus WFU this weekend Glori) was:<br />
<br />
'Haven't we been down this road before?'<br />
<br />
What next - a-NOTHER guild summit in San Diego?  Man, they must be getting some preliminary numbers back from whose taking off to W.O.W. and not likign what they see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">God, please don't bring back boats.  Just make them optional.  If you want to sit and wait 20 minutes to get to a zone, have fun with that.  I want them to implement a value added feature for like $5/mo that lets you port yourself to any zone you have access to.  Traveling across zones is stupid.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Anything that saves me time, I want in the game.  Now that they have the new tradeskill UI, make it allow multiple combines at once.  I hate combining 80 celestial essences, or what have you, by clicking Combine then Auto Inventory.  That's total crap.  It should bring up a window and ask how many you want to combine and do that many combines, with a line that says &quot;You succeeded X time at making Y and failed Z times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Make the game more enjoyable by cutting out the timesinks.  You have enough of those with epics and camping spells and the like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For me:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&quot;God, please don't bring back boats.&quot;<br />
<br />
It will never happen, but I know, and I agree with, the general viewpoint of people that want that to happen.<br />
<br />
EQ used to feel more 'real'.  You had a sense of distance with boats.  Just the simple act of moving from place to place created a sense of accomplishment.  <br />
<br />
With LDON and the general faster pace of battles now, EQ feels more like a first person shooter to me.  Log on, run ten feet, click twice, and spam keys in an instanced zone for 45 minutes.  Sweet.  I really felt immersed....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Naming Pets<br />
More Titles (hometown, wayfarer stone, more AA thresholds)<br />
Visible back items<br />
Fix swimming - why does it take me half a minute to get out of the water at Halas now? Put in ramps if you have too...<br />
<br />
I'm somewhat against tributing nodrop stuff, now that I can get GoD trials groups together with me being the only chain class, because then every moron in the group will want to roll on the chain stuff! :D<br />
<br />
EDIT: oh, yeah - gearsets would be great.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Play another game la~  EQ was never big on the immersion factor anyway.  I've never felt &quot;immersed&quot; in the group content.  Raiding is where that feeling is at.  Group content is used to make me stronger outside for future raiding.  It's a means to an end.<br />
<br />
It's not like they have to appease a single group of people on the timesink factor.  Put boats in AND put translocator NPCs in.  Give the option to single combine TS items or multiple combine.  Give people a choice.  If you want to run about for 40 minutes to get somewhere, that's great, but I want to be where I can get to business in under 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Leadership AA was poorly thought out.  What happens when you group now?  Two things: 1) someone says &quot;I have all the leadership AA, does someone else want to be leader to get the leadership xp?&quot; or 2) everyone says &quot;I need more leadership AA, let me be leader&quot;<br />
<br />
In both cases you're probably not getting the benefits you could be getting.  Other people in the group should also get some leadership experience if they have the option turned on, but not as much as the true leader of the group.  Or if the true leader of the group has his experience option turned off, the next person who has the option turned on should get it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Allow ammo slot items to have stats and take hold on the player.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">More solo content!!<br />
<br />
I want solo style LDoNs, <br />
<br />
I want More 60+ tasks (or at least a wider variety) with easy, medium hard settings for people of differing gear (or more settings)<br />
<br />
I want all velious quest helms, and other special quest helms (ie. nurga and others) to work with the special velious helm graphic change.<br />
<br />
I want a few more special dungeon crawls... specifically, 2 or 3 opposing factions in the dungeon with different bosses and loot.  Have the bosses be in different sections  with say... 3 tiers of mobs designed for level 60 then 65 then 70, all groupable with non-raid equipment.  Make the loot velious quality for level 60, VT quality for level 65 tier, and EP quality for the level 70 tier.  Maybe 2 of these, perhaps in Kunark and Luclin?<br />
<br />
Porgy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">- Move the Shaman/Druid revive down from being a level 70 aa skill to being a level 55 aa skill.<br />
<br />
- Improve the level 70 titles for most classes. <br />
<br />
I've lost track of how many people tell me they can't stand them, like soothsayer and natureguard.<br />
<br />
- More combined buffs. <br />
<br />
There are so many buffs now that we badly need combined buffs. Of the Faerune type, to give a sense what I'm getting at.  I'd put these new combined buffs in as quests of the protection of the cabbage type.<br />
<br />
-- a long lasting under level 50 mana regen spell. <br />
<br />
 Once the ability to cast KEI on low levels was nerfed, it became super annoyingly hard to level up a caster. Admittedly KEI was overpowered on a level 10 or 20, but there's no reason we can't have a long lasting 2 or 3 point mana regen buff for enchanters to give out. It would make people happy without greatly imbalancing things.<br />
<br />
- Shamans need a spell canni in between Canni 4 and Pained memory. Like 200 mana gain for 450 hps, something in that area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Progressive quests, like newbie, Sol Ro temple, &amp; Luclin armor, the Var Shir &amp; Iksar ones, &amp; the initiate/disciple/warden ones.<br />
<br />
A lot of those old quests could stand being revamped, like the gem costs being removed from the TSR ones, &amp; the stats greatly increased to reflect the difficulty vs reward of the Luclin ones.<br />
<br />
It would be great to be able to go out &amp; kill level appropriate mobs for your equipment, rather than camping tradeskill drops to sell in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
LDoN addresses this in a way, but the level appropriate gear is way too expensive for the points involved. That needs to be looked at.<br />
<br />
I think it would be great if you got adventure points for tasks.</div></div><hr />

-Mark the leader of the group in the group dialog somehow<br />
-Create a method for targeting pets of players outside the group more easily (without having to guess if Jabober of Gabaner is the one belonging to Player_001). Maybe use an extra character in front of the name for target, to avoid targeting beasty pets when trying to target the player. For example &quot;/tar Playername&quot; to target the player, and &quot;/tar &amp;Playername&quot; to target the pet. <br />

They had &quot;Magic Mail&quot; in The Realm Online. I'd just like to be able to log in in the morning expecting to help my friend with his epic and see &quot;Sorry Griz, I got called into work, go back to sleep&quot; instead of standing around. Maybe to make it toally not un-RP there could be post offices you run to to get your mail? /shrug.<br />
<br />
Other suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Reduce the casting time of all damage over time spells to 3.0<br />
<br />
2) let only the highest version of shielding block focus if it must do it. Obviously no melees with those damn breastplate clicks are going to want that over focus, but it makes my life hell. I know this is more shaman specific, but it affects all other classes.<br />
<br />
2b) More stuff with confirmation boxes. Maybe if a spell would be blocked due to a blocking restriction, allow a confirmation box so someone can choose? and do it for shrink and invis too. Since they're making pets not poof when you invis, let invis work out of group.<br />
<br />
3) more mobs and longer fights when doing exp. Really, it's better for everyone.<br />
<br />
4) Go back and make stuff from old expansions Droppable. obviously quest stuff shouldn't be, but like Exhiled loot...<br />
<br />
4b) Allow a way to de-attune an item that was once attunable, maybe with a lot of plat or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">OMG, how did everyone miss this<br />

Make shaman pets come with Spirit of Wolf - Sheesh they are a spirit wolf after all.<br />
Make shaman pets dual wield innately, like they can do when they are given 2 weapons - they're a lvl 62 warrior, at least let them dual wield like one :p<br />
They allowed mage pets to appear with all the summoned armour - allow shaman pets to appear with best haste, regen and HP buff their master can cast (this would be nice but probably not something they would consider :p)</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't want this to happen, as it would make dispelling detrimental spells without losing buffs a lot more difficult (if not impossible), unless they change how dispell works. Being able to do that is definitely worth more to me than a neat and tidy buff bar.  :p<br />

So when fighting an ae, buff dispelling mob you want all your decent buffs to scoot to the top of the buff bar so they can be dispelled more easily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">hmm, for me a revamping of alot of classes is now needed, alot of classes like us are now not balanced for the new game, only problem i see is it would be a lot of work and likely not of interest to them as they might have to redo the encounters if they do this too. but i feel shaman need a complete revamp, but still based on battlepriest/spirits.<br />
<br />
general things , i would like to see tasks haveing a ap point reward maybe, and able to hand in no drop items to ap merchant for ap, i still have alot of nodrop stuff i got just because of the memory and i hate destoring things:) ldon needs some u/g and a medium level to make it more fun.<br />
<br />
old world zones need updated drops, some drops are still from orginal days that just have no realavance to todays game. the reason old zones are empty is that new zones tend to have better exp and drops, surely they could make new drops and raise exp for old zones  not to be better but least the same?<br />
<br />
basically the most fun you have is when you get nice exp and good drops, thats the fun , thats what eq needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">===== General ======<br />
<br />
LDoN needs to be upgraded to stay in line with the new levels. Available gear needs to be jacked up as well. +55 hp augs, near-EP level gear (pre-aug, when auged, SLIGHTLY better than EP) should be added at a new &quot;tier&quot; of 2250 points. Foci 5 augs should be made available as well. Make them identical in % to Foci 4, just working to lvl 70 at that %.<br />
<br />
EPs (Sol Ro at LEAST) should be opened up to players VIA an &quot;Epic 1.5 style&quot; back-door quest doable by 1-2 groups. It would certainly help alleviate the current overcrowding in WoS, offer people an alternative place to get XP and respectable loot from one-groupers. Make it hard and long, but make it doable by 1-2 groups TOPS. <br />
<br />
Since people are already circumventing the 3-player instance limit to solo them, make solo instances availalbe. Solo LDON advntures should be included in the upgrade. <br />
<br />
PoK book for Natimbi, Nedaria or Abysmal. Its time to be able to get to Gates without having to run to an LDoN camp. Possibly a Magus in POK with a birdbath, with the power to send you to ANY other Magi in the game, inc all the LDoNs and all the Gates locations (none of this one magus to anothe magus to another magus, zoning itself is a bigger pain than running across a zone IMHO)<br />
<br />
===== Class =====<br />
<br />
Enchanters - with the recent nerf to Charm, create a NEW charm spell where the mob still does his old, full DPS but the charm lasts only 45-60 seconds (not set). This would offer an alternative. Safer, half-DPS charm that lasts longer, or risky, short charm where the mob is a MONSTER.<br />
<br />
Shaman - Swap the Ancient heal for a DOT. Give us the 2K heal at 70<br />
<br />
Clerics - 50% slow vs undead. Give them SOME soloability utility.<br />
<br />
Monks - Bigger badder discs that make them either put out more DPS or mitigate more damage. Call it &quot;Live or Let Die&quot; or something. Monks need a bump. <br />
<br />
Knights - Mini Defensive, even if it has a long recast. Currently most Knights are fine vs regular XP mobs, but the problem is vs bigger namaed. Give them 15 seconds of Defensive. <br />
<br />
Other classes - working as intended because I cant think of anything!</div></div><hr />

The issue I have with the nerf is that the mob is a puss when charmed, but instantly shreds the charmer when it breaks.<br />
<br />
Titles for char creation dates.  Titles for days played milestones?<br />
<br />
As far as EQIM goes, just want them to support what they do have.  Don't break it again!  And don't change it so much that it breaks ximena!<br />

- on every expasion, take at least one suggestion from one community of each class and impliment a balanced version of it.  That way you hopefully get more creative spells/AAs.<br />
Class:<br />
- no more mitigation on 25% or more trash mobs in any zone and no more full slow immune mobs.<br />
- give clerics a new res where the target comes back with all the buffs they had when they were killed.<br />
- Give clerics a 33% undead only slow<br />
- improve shaman healing by 10%<br />
- Give mages a buff bot pet that buffs only the mage's party like an appropriate level PC (make like 3-4 versions of the spell, each version only buffs 1 spell).  The goal would be to reduce BoTing and buff vendors, plus provide some interesting functionality to the class.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Arching Adventures or quests. Do a Collect mission and during that find a note that you hand to the LDON guy and he tells you of a Kidnap mission. Do that mission and rescure the fella And he wants revenge. Hand in his token to get a slaughter mission. In the course of the slaughter mission you Find out about a named that is masterminding the whole damn thing. and Once done witht the slaughter you get an assinate mission. <br />
<br />
Mini rewards along the way. That if you don't want you can sell. Or can turn in for added AP.  And All the mini named drops in all LDON's should be able to be turned in for AP. <br />
<br />
Make the instances in Omens More intresting. Give us an in game reason or 7 to be there. Not just the out of game reason of xp and spell farming.<br />
<br />
Multiple Zone Population instances. Like you have a Old VP and a new one. But make both accessable. Not just ditch the old one. MAke a quest where you can time travel back a few game years to when the sleeper was not awakened to do some sort of quest. And get the flag where when you zone in it is the pre awakened Tomb. And the same for many other zones. <br />
<br />
Also in that vein add varying spawns for things like the old world cities. Let them travel on a story arc of good to evil and back depending on quest related hand ins. Let freeport get darker over months of change till the last bastion of good is near the Paladin encampment  by changing the spawns to more and more of the guards and vendors that are symapthetic to guards by increasing costs to the bad factioned. (Newbies would not be affected as much till they worked on the factions.) If they had 5 variations of the spawn table Going from Number 3 (What the zone is now)  to 1 for the paladins are winning  or 5 for the guards are winning. Then by doing the quests to change the factions you could have a small effect on the game world. And it would be a font of ideas for more progressive quests and variations on the themes of LDon and beyond. <br />
<br />
Instances could be triggered by NPC's That are only up when certain zones and situations are right and it would be much more of an adventure than a spoiler hunt then camp that the game has become. <br />
<br />
You could have tailored instances for 6 man groups to get to Elemental plains. If they do a story arc that could be a fantastic reward. And is controllable by the limits already in game Vrs. expiditions and lockout timers. The tools are in game for an almost limitless supply of variable and intresting adventure but all that is lacking is the time and the creativity to do so. 6 man 12 man 18 man. and up Story arcs. Reasons to adventure besides the loot. With branching plots. <br />
<br />
Oh bring back resonable factions. The omens factions are not making much sense at the moment. I can't really make heads or tails of it with the dragorn spread through the middle of the zones and such. And the mata muram faction hits. It is just odd. cause I know that no matter how many dragorn I kill I won't be welcomed into Mata murams ranks. And the historian will still show me right to his old caves of hiding to slaughter more?<br />
<br />
The concepts for EQ have always been steller. it is the implimentation and lack of followthrough that sucks. In customer service as well as in game itself. Look at the leadership Points.. Why was this just abandoned. Look at LDON. Abandoned. The Camps should have great intrest in the omens loots. And should offer AP for it. Or valuable tribute. not 1400 Tribute for stuff that is new. <br />
<br />
Don't come up witha  new system to discard it after the luster is gone for another new system. Refine and improve upon all of them. Give us choice! And make those choices meaningful.<br />
<br />
<br />
More to come I am sure. This is something I am intrested in. But coming from Brenlo I am not sure why I am responding. It will just get lost int he shuffle.<br />

Revamp ToFS and make it an instanced zone GoD style (i.e. respawning mobs) and points tied to LDoN. I've always loved that zone and I think it would make a great instanced dungeon.<br />
<br />
I think re-working alot of the old dungeons like this would be a great way to get people back into them and being that they would be instanced, they could still cater for lower level characters just fine. You could even go as far as instancing something like the Plane of Fear as a raid only zone that has different difficulty levels and a lockout timer along the lines of GoD.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">just read through to find out what has already been sujested. so here are some stuff from my end:<br />
<br />
- make ALL PoK stones exsept your home town stone level 45 restrickted. and that is only if you want to keep the library open to the genral public. travel was just made to easy via that.<br />
<br />
- sence you love AA and all, give shaman the choise of buying a Double attack AA, or put in a new upgrade to voice (or add to the hole vioce line) of the berserkerthat gives us some double attack skill (maybe 100 max on the voice or the upgrade top and another 75 to 100 from AA we could buy) we would still hit less then knights but we would then start hitting for around what a cleric is doing via there weapon procs. I know rabid bear has double attack on it so I know a buff can have it.<br />
<br />
- Iksar progrssive quests and the cats quest opening up new titles for you. have my cudgel and would make me difrent if I could display that.<br />
<br />
- perhhapps haveing your spell casting specalization opening up a title to you (again I would be one of the few shaman that could sport the conjer title) at skill 200.<br />
<br />
- ether via AA or Quest give the casters and melee some option to ferther specalize there charicter. melee maybe thay pick one and only one wep skill to become more proficant in (some accurice bones, damage bones, possable crit bones, strickthough). casters can get a specalize bones bassed on there class. WIZ could get a specalieize on one type of spell in which thay get a damage bounes, resist bounes, a mana saveings bounes. Shaman could couse ether healling foucesd, combat foucesd, or support focused. where as the healing would get a decent bones to healing spells and HoT's in both healed amount and mana cost, cast times, and crit chance along with some what small bounes to debuff. support would get a decent bounes to Buffs, Debuffes with bounes in resists, mana costs cast times length of effects, with a small bounes in healing. combat would get a decent bounes in Dots and melee with bounes in resists, damage incress, mana costs, cast times, full or partial acsess to damage bounes (adn would go with the double attack thing stated earlyer), crit chance (and yes this may me giveing the shaman a small chance to crit with melee somethign along the first level of crit AA for melee or a little more), Also would get a small bounes with dd's and debuffs. <br />
oks could go to the who range of classes but this just gives a range and most classes should get 3 options in where to go. this is to give the guilds more variaty in there make up (have a guild that highly deadly to fire via there casting classes or one or 2 support shaman with a couple of combat specalist and 4 or so healing shaman really what happons in the guild already BUT your giveing them advantages for leaning this way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Gameplay<br />
<br />
1.  Fast Corpse Loot option (stuff that stacks in multiple slots will appear on the cursor, so you can pick where to put it)<br />
<br />
2.  More High Level, High Difficulty zones in old world areas.  The Revamp of CT was great, at the time.  We need more zones like this.  (These should be *free*, hint hint)<br />
<br />
3.  Once a guild manages to kill a keyed/flagged/soul-marked mob, the ENTIRE GUILD is flagged.  Period.  No more backflagging.  No more dragging endless people through Vxed/Tipt trials.  No more &quot;going backward&quot;.  Once you join a guild, you gain all the keys that guild has automatically.  Once you leave, they are stripped from you.  <br />
<br />
4.  Make Shrink MGB'able.  I'm not putting this under class balance, because, c'mon, this affects everyone during a raid.  <br />
<br />
5.  Change the Bazaar to a &quot;Store&quot; instead of Traders.  <br />
<br />
6.  Make Insta-Gate potions stackable.<br />
<br />
7.  You should always have an option to buy spells, IMO.  Make them expensive (20K+), if you want. Spell &quot;drops&quot; has always been a horrid way to fill up your spell book. (I will give Kudos to the way OOW changed it up, tho.  At least you don't get saddled with 5 of the same spell).<br />
<br />
8.  An option to refund AA's if you don't like, or can't see, an apprecialbe difference after purchase.<br />
<br />
Class Balance<br />
<br />
1.  Group SoW + Levi + See Invis.  Why do druids get it, and we don't?  And why is it FASTER than ours?<br />
<br />
2.  Group Cannibilize, or targetable Cann 5.  Re-use timer--10 minutes.  <br />
<br />
3.  Please make all buffs and their groupable versions the SAME FREAKING level.  Shrink and Tiny Terror are what, 50 levels apart?  I mean, what are the spell guys thinking?  This makes NO SENSE.<br />
<br />
4.  Make Rabid Bear and the Avatar line stackable.  Rabid Bear is unused in it's present form.  It should have a 15 minute re-use timer.  It is not &quot;game changing&quot; in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
5.  I've noticed some of my skills going up in OOW, that have been static for years.  But now I don't have any weapons to use that are worth a crap.  Where is the SHM usable 85/40 2HB with a 300dmg proc?  How is giving us the same weapons Monks use, who will still do 3x-5x the damage we can, un-game-balancing?<br />
<br />
6.  Can you tell I'm a Battle Priest at heart yet?<br />
<br />
7.  Our heals still arent really good enough, IMO.  It's not that I mind clerics being better healers than us, but I mind them being leaps and bounds ahead. <br />
<br />
8.  Alchemy that really makes a difference....I don't care if it's expensive, but it needs to make a difference.  Stat boosters that go above even the OOW limits;  Mana regen that goes above FT cap;  Regen potions that go avove Regen cap;  Resist potions that go above resist cap...you get the idea. <br />
<br />
I'm going to add a third title to mine, and call it Fun Stuff.<br />
<br />
1.  Group Bear Form!!<br />
<br />
2.  Make our pet type selectable--wolf, bear, alligator...perhaps give them each a special attack/ability?  Yes, I want a Polar Bear for a pet, dammit!<br />
<br />
3.  Names for pets. C'mon!  Why does Tundra Jack get to name his bear?<br />
<br />
4.  Reincarnation--we should have always had a 0% rezz, but ours changes people into an animal for a short while!  <br />
<br />
5.  Spirit Guards-- assign your pet to guard a party member, which would allow it to /shield that party member.  Ok, so not fun so much as a cool idea.<br />
<br />
6.  Animal form potions that give boosts to certain stats that would go over stat caps or give unique abilities- <br />
<br />
Example-- Essence of Lion....increase HPs by 300, increase ATK by 300..duration 3 minutes...gives Lion Roar atk which stuns/freezes opponent for up to 15 secons.<br />

<br />
Now, that's a nice idea. Put a &quot;loot all&quot; button right under the &quot;link all&quot; button on the corpse loot window. Add it to both PC and Mob corpse windows, but flag NO DROP items on mob corpses so that they cannot be automatically looted with the button.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Just a quick few from me:<br />
<br />
Re-look at no drop / lore items.<br />
<br />
Particlarly having the collect items in ldon as no drop causes problems and has no value to it. The items cannot be used for anything else so why make them no drop.<br />
<br />
Having loot items lore like the weapons in Echo caverns and Plane of Tactics causes them to end up rotting alot.<br />
<br />
Create the ability to spawn quest and flag mobs with a suitable delay, like you can the VP key dragon, but have it so the spawned version drop only the quest item or flags.<br />
<br />
Re check the respawn rates of old world mobs, as these mobs are becoming more and more killable as levels/gear increases.<br />
<br />
Create an NPC to allow people to access the Plane of Sky in the same way you can access the Plane of Hate now.<br />
<br />
Add spiderling silks to some merchants as the need for these great exceeds the supply as can been observed by the high prices in the bazaar. Possible add Leather padding as well as this again is used alot.</div></div><hr />

So many times to people loot their corpses then realize a split second too late they never got a rez.  Esp with the horrid xp that is 66+.<br />
<br />
A prompt box like: &quot;This corpse has not yet been rezed.  Do you wish to destroy it? Yes No&quot;  If Yes is clicked, corpses poofs like normal.  If No, then the naked corpse remains until the rezz is given.<br />
<br />
This only shows up when you loot the last item off an unrezzed corpse.   Leaving 1 item, no msg.  Rezzed corpse, no msg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Right now when you login I bet you can count the number of zones you expect to get a group in on one hand. You wouldn't dream of going to any other zones because the experience would just be pathetic (which is probably a good indication that the loot there sucks too). Now, while I never tire of bettering my character, I do tire of the same camps, the same mobs and the same loot. Although OoW has done a good job of addressing this (for now) there is still a HUGE redundancy in zones throughout EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Well, here is my idea ...<br />
<br />
** Mobs will not have levels until they agro a PC.<br />
** This level will be determined by the PC's level and his/her group member&#8217;s levels if he/she has one.<br />
** As soon as agro is lost by the PC or his/her group, the mob resets back to its initial state, including health/dots (in the event that the group dies or zones). This makes trains just as deadly but no more deadly than if the training group was all your level.<br />
** Some zones/mobs will have predefined lower limits.<br />
** Experience earned should be the same across the board, with loot perhaps being the sweet spot of keyed/flagged zones. Yes I am flagged for the elemental zones and I love the experience there.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this is that younger characters can still experience in these zones while at the same time giving the majority the player base (60+) a change in scenery if they want.<br />
<br />
I am certain that such an idea would require quite a lot of programming to be implemented initially, but once implemented essentially ALL zones are open for people to get experience. I want a change of scenery and I want to kick some level 70 orc's ass :)<br />
<br />
Again, just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Oops forgot one,<br />

Let Shaman and all classes that get summon food/water get the summon stack of food/water as well. Surely even the dumbest caster you learns to summon food/water will be able to learn to summon stacks sometime over the following 60+ levels.</div></div><hr />

Possible improvements:<br />
- Add a convienient, safe bind spot at a central place in GoD. Maybe even with a PoK stone or a Wayfarer mage. <br />
- Tune mobs towards OoW standards, more hp, less dps (if I read your comments correctly, no OoW here yet, waiting for class balance).<br />
- Remember to give it a graphical facelift too, its just ugly now.<br />

Solo instance zones<br />
or at least scalable difficulty were solo is possible.<br />
Timer bar underneath your buffs similar to the way exp bars look.<br />
There are so many people that two box(three box and more). Why not support it. Give tools that allow you to switch inbetween the two, and maybe even give discounts for having multiple acounts. <br />
Offer any innate racial abilities. I think this would be fun, some classes can hide(50),sneak(50),forage(50), etc. Even lvl 70 req, some of these would be fun, I know almost every shaman here would get forage. Frontal stun immunity  I am sure everyone would want would most likely cost alot of aa.<br />
Maybe make a zone full of low hitting mobs that die fairly quick. Very full, a normal group would take on 10-20 monsters at a time. These mobs would have to have certain resistance to AE spells though, or wizards  would slaughter them all.<br />
Ability to have a hide people button, we can do this in the bazaar, example a raid 40 people healer wants to hide all except the people he's healing, reducing great amounts of lag, or you ignore someone he's completly ignored and invisible to you.<br />
Make all LDON items avalable, not having to &quot;unlock&quot; certain zones. It can be extremly difficult to convince a group of people to do a adventure that no one wants to do.<br />
Give poor melee's there &quot;openings&quot; you were talking about before, or something to give them a chance to solo something other then a light blue mob.<br />
Customize tasks to each class. I feel for melee classes that have it tough.<br />
Bring back monster button! I never got to try that out, it sounded very fun. Perhaps the more &quot;monster&quot; experiance someone gets he/she can progress to a tougher spot. Maybe even implement it in PvE for certain zones</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Belor Pyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Make encounters very in difficulty based on raid size.  Raid mob difficulty starts based for 25 people (2 can engage it, but its going to be designed for 25), and progressively gets harder up being designed for a 55 person raid.  After 55 the mob gets harder exponentually, so if you happen to have 56 online nobody has to spend the night in LDON, but on the other hand guilds shouldnt have 100 active members.  The larger the raid, the more loot the mob could drop, so as to not punish the larger raid by equiping the smaller raid faster, though only have one loot table.  I always hated the ever increasing numbers needed for raids which hit its peak in POP with the absolutly loony numbers needed to do about anything, and putting flat limits on everything is not much better, as raids are still fairly large, and you are often short people, or have to send people away.  I would gladly accept having the loot cut in half if it meant my 25 man raiding guild could progress at equal footing with a 50 man raiding guild.  Challenge our gear and skills, not our numbers.<br />

1. Fix that +++ing horse bug. Introduced several months ago. Large races who are shrunk and sitting on a horses are often bugged that their group spells wont hit anyone.<br />
<br />
2. Make Rabid bear useful. Rework its stackability and reuse time issues<br />

3. Review those horrid AA prices of GoD<br />
<br />
4. Introduce a mechanism which makes Shaman as stackable ar raids as other classes.<br />

5. Give the Shaman an ability to counteract slow mitigation. Not completly, but i think something like adding 1-5 percent slowage on our slows for mitigating mobs should be a viable option.</div></div><hr />

At present, if I am using an AA to cast a spell, like cannibalization, I can freely target other group members with function keys.<br />
If I am casting a regular spell or clicky, I cannot target them.<br />
If I am casting a spell, I can target someone in my group by clicking on their name in my group window, by hitting the target nearest PC hotkey, and face them and hitting the U key.<br />
But if I'm casting a spell, I can't target them by hitting the function keys, or by /assist'ing the mob or anyone else.<br />
I'd like to be able to hit a hotkey that tells my pet to attack things while I'm casting a spell, just like I can do if I manually click the pet attack button in my pet window.<br />
Clicking on hotkeys should be allowed while casting spells, unless it starts up a new spell, activates an AA, right clicks an item, or activates an ability/skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">God, please don't bring back boats.  Just make them optional.

<br />
Edit:  Anything that saves me time, I want in the game.  Now that they have the new tradeskill UI, make it allow multiple combines at once.  I hate combining 80 celestial essences, or what have you, by clicking Combine then Auto Inventory.  That's total crap.  It should bring up a window and ask how many you want to combine and do that many combines, with a line that says &quot;You succeeded X time at making Y and failed Z times.&quot;<br />
<br />
Make the game more enjoyable by cutting out the timesinks.  You have enough of those with epics and camping spells and the like.<br />

And while at it, make it so I don't have to buy the ingridients, just click what I want and the amount is subtracted from my bank. 1 click halas pies I don't want to do sub combines.. <br />

<br />
Options is key. But always make the person take the boat at least once. Then char flag the person. Same thing with all the PoK stones. Every one should be one way first. You should have to visit the area first before being able to go there with Impunity. And once you get there there should be an xp bonus along with the charecter flag. <br />
<br />
Exploration should be important. And the Maps. Even if downloaded should not function until you have first explored the zone. At least enough to get the basic idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">I think most of my complaints are involve issues that are too fundamental to the game as it is now, but what the heck:<br />
<br />
1.  All the game is (and really has ever been), is log in, kill mobs as fast as you can to get new aa's level's, etc.  The idea of immersion, storyline, a reason for doing things is simply not apparent, especially after your first toon hits 30 or so.  Why do you now get 4 spirit pets instead of 3 with that new aa skill?  Well, because you killed more rats.  In fact, killing more rats is the answer to every question in the game, more or less.  Even in OoW, the reason for caring about any certain faction is not apparent, although I suppose it will be as time goes on.  The &quot;hamster on a wheel&quot; effect becomes ever more obvious.  (I guess the whole Mata Mura thing may give us all a story line, but not yet, it's just random factions at the moment.  I doubt if most people even notice that differnt mobs give different faction hits for the evil mata mura.)<br />
<br />
2. We don't need more zones in the next expansion.  We need more content.  Ldon was one way to recycle old zones somewhat, we need some other ways as well.  Maybe an expasion with nothing but quests, and fresh content in old places.  Nothing has happened in Halas in 4 years, except the Pod crossing the street to the other side.  Why not have the tribunal visit Halas for a few weeks, give out some quests, mete out a few judgments?  <br />
<br />
3. Whatever happened to the idea of zonewide game changing actvities?  An ongoing battle for grobb, or an invasion of dark elves, where you could play either side, even a scripted event, when someone collected enough dark elf heads (or whatever). <br />
<br />
As far as I can recall, there have only been two game changing, in-game events in the history of EQ, the fall of grobb and the waking of the Sleeper.  The 10th ring war kinda qualifys as well I guess. <br />
<br />
4. someone already mentioned this, but the lack on cohesion between expansions is a mistake.  Velious meant nothing to Luclin, which meant nothing to PoP, which barely had anything to do with GoD, and only slightly to do with OoW.  Ldon got tossed in there someplace, and wayfarer camps popped up in an abortive attempt to give the game a story.  (The story here failed because folks want to be the main characters, not some rogue who solos the world.  The story should encompass groups/factions, not joe the superrogue)<br />
<br />
Many of these things they are probably fixing with EQ2.  That game appears (from a non-beta-player's perspective) to be setup as a blank slate, with destroyed cities, barren wilderness, and locked races.  Quests done by the opposing sides will hopefully alter the course of the game.  Somehow qeynos and freeport will be at dds, although without PvP, I guess.  All the empty space allows for content to be added within the gameworld, as opposed to 20 new zones you get by clicking the magic portal to gooworld. <br />
<br />
Eq was pretty amazing when it came out, but it's definately dated as to the life of the world within.  This will become ever more obvious when one of the other games does something a bit more inventive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">Some sort of zone connection map.  Yes, I know we have maps of most zones, but I'd like to be able to look at a map and see how to get there (without alt-tabbing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">real fixes for EQ.<br />
<br />
* pull back how many PoK books there are, maybe 2 per continent, similar in style how the Luclin spires were done.  Luclin changed the game subtly, but didnt completely nerf the &quot;exploration&quot; aspect of the game.  PoP, though i have enjoyed all the new zones i've been able to reach, really spoiled the exploration aspect of the game.  obviously there would have to be some story line/quests involved with this so that it makes sense and not have them just POOF with no explanation.<br />
<br />
* upgrade (slightly) the old world loot drops.  rather than nerfing the old world with all the new content, give some slight upgrades to old world zones.  maybe add the occasional finesteel or +1/+2 items in places like Befallen, Unrest, etc. similar to the stuff that drops in Warrens.  keep the drops uncommon/random to avoid over farming, but common enough to lure appropriate level'ed toons.<br />
<br />
* add more epic 1.0 pieces.  personally, for all classes, it would have been nifty if the epics were more like the shaman epic, where you get various armor pieces as well as the final weapon.  the shield gets kind of lame after about 46, but i was still wearing the insta-sow boots into my 60's because they had such a decent stat/resist/ac spread and clicky sow.  granted there were better boots available, they were still quite a nice piece of gear.  maybe bolster out the epic lines with a BP, gaunts, helm and pants elements.  they could backfill the epic quest so that you can go back and do the armor segments even if you have the epic, for those who enjoy the story lines or are casual players and like questing for gear rather than farming/buying it.<br />
<br />
* fix the pathing bugs in all the zones that have been hurting for, LITERALLY, years, like PoStorms (crap ending up pathing &quot;outside the zone walls&quot;), oasis (crap poofing 1/2 across the zone), warrens, sebilis, etc.<br />
<br />
* stop class balancing, they screw it up every time, just leave it and let the players create the balance.  just because some people can solo well, doesnt mean the class needs balancing.  just prevent attrocious unbalancing issues like when BLs were first introduced.  spend more time QA'ing and less time hyping crap.<br />
<br />
* have buff duration be augmented by level of receiver, and remove level restrictions on buffs.  if a lvl 70 casts an extended Aego on a lvl 1, have the spell duration scale down to like 20min.  this way, lower levels are less likely to super buff and go solo, thus, possibly, promoting more grouping at the mid game.<br />
<br />
* introduce some more mid level content.  realistically, no one plays their sub 50's anymore because there's no compelling content for those toons,  3 of the last 4 expansions (PoP, GoD, OoW) were primarily 55+, and the other one (LoY) was primarily 35+.  even though LDoN was introduced for 20+, the rewards are meaningless until about 50+, except for the moderately decent XP.<br />
<br />
i could list many more, but these are pretty major content issues as is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I would vapourize PoK. Ok so that won't happen so at least cut down on the books.  PoK is the worst thing to happen to EQ.  Every city is a ghost town now.  Travel and exploration are dead aspects of the game.  People have multiple characters over 60 but don't know how to cross a zone.  The books made travel TOO easy.  SoE seems to never do anything halfway. Travel too hard? Ok let's get rid of it.<br />
<br />
On an RP perspective don't you find it silly that you have a vast world across many continents and every adventurer and hero in existence is floating in some other plane of existence?<br />
<br />
Maps.... What a missed opportunity! They could have made them vendor bought, looted, traded.  You think some players would just love to start map collecting?<br />
<br />
Events!  They can scripted if you want. Just something to make zones a little less static.<br />
<br />
How about some better quests too? Like some that hand out some better experience so that you . Sorry tasks don't cut it.  It changes things from &quot;whack a mole&quot; to &quot;whack 10 of a specific mole&quot;.  Like someone said earlier, the solution to everything is to kill more rats.  How about an AA quest? Its not that crazy, you get them for PoP flags.<br />
<br />
Titles. Don't just hand them out just becuase you have x level or x AAs. How about doing a quest?  I believe you get a title for doing your epic 1.0 now. This is good!<br />
<br />
Make factions matter.  Remember when playing an evil race was something you had to think about?  Now you've got Trolls shamans buying their spells from Froglok NPCs.  Faction is largely irrelevant (thanks again PoK).<br />

However, I like the PoK books since I can be anywhere in 15 minutes or less. Although maybe they should add a feature that opens PoK stones up, only after you've clicked into PoK using that particular book.

I like, how the new epic quests link expansions together and 'force' players to leave their favorite grinding zones once in a while. More of that.<br />
<br />
Zones:<br />
OoW zones were a nice improvement. Every zone of a given expansion should fit into the given topic of the expansion and have a specific flair of it's own.<br />
<br />
Communications: (Uh where to begin)<br />
Add a 'bug number' system to bug reports or keep an actual 'Open points list' somewhere on your website with estimated status overviews. Giving the players, that are interested in improving the game the feeling to talk to a brickwall is highly discouraging. Make sure you got enough staff to atleast look at constructive, reasonable bug reports.<br />
<br />
All players that take the time and do testing on the test servers (what would be your job to begin with) should get atleast some kind of status information regarding every single of their own bug reports.<br />
<br />
When you answer a player request and deny it, explain your reasons - even shortly is enough. When you answer and need more time - STATE that timeline and come back with an update in time. Hint: 'soon' and 'eventually' are not acceptable time statements - a specific week or in worst case stating a month are. <br />
<br />
Drop the 10 issues list completely or start working AND communicating on it - your choice. I for once get tired of that crap.<br />
<br />
Update the petition queue to allow 3 petitions at once. 2 petitions working like today, 1 petition with priority high (setting by player) to show up as 'urgent' to GMs. High priority usable only once per week (or maybe even per month).<br />
<br />
New commands:<br />
/altstatus &lt;player&gt; - show all toons of that player's account (to avoid scams and harassment), usable once per game day<br />
/grprando and /raidrando - random rolls are directed to group or raid channel without any limitations to range, LoS, zones whatever. When somebody is in that channel, he can see the roll period.<br />
<br />
Random stuff:<br />
Get rid of up and down floating while levitating - now.<br />
<br />
Fix my white bear animation with the brown head part, it looks like i got some serious fur sickness there :D. Make bear illusion work on horses - atleast the effect, not necessarily the animation.<br />
<br />
Raid shuffling - moving people inside raids - is nice but there is no need to lock the whole raid for it. At the very least check which groups are included in an intended move and only lock those groups. Locking of the whole raid can stay as an optional tool for the RL though.</div></div><hr />

Also it would be nice to see a few more dragons again. Xana was nice to see in PoP, brings back them olden day feelings of naggy, vox, then trak and kunark dragon love followed by velious crawlin. * shrug Can't go wrong with dragons i say.<br />
<br />
Lastly guild Halls with perhaps even tradeskills in relation to various portions of construction. Such as masonry, carpentry, furniture etc. Inside said halls are various posting boards both public and private ( ie key required to get to back room). Guild only massive banks in guild halls to place items in or take out of. Perhaps a library inside filled with tomes that guilds can place overflowing numbers of spell scrolls for other guild memebers to access and take. Perhaps also installing various tradeskill areas, pottery wheels, ovens, alchemy tables (for poison and alchemy to be used at,)  as the guild hall reaches certain sizes. It's a long shot but i think it would be pretty neat to see how peopel could decorate thair guild halls. Maybe make rare drop items in game that if aquired by guild can be placed inside their guild halls giving various prestige. Perhaps this prestige is a way of measuring bonuses that are given to members of the guild. An example might be a rare statuette found in the dark corridors of SSra that when placed in your hall gives off a radiant glow. Giving your guild 250 prestige points. As u gain prestige points you can purchase things like innate increased success rates on trade skills of certain sorts in guild hall. Or perhaps guild wide aa type purchase. numerous idea's or spinoffs i am sure are possible. Maybe instead making donations of prestige points gives the guild memebers a better rate on selling /buying/trading in that home city. Perhaps harder to find items will become available for purchase that were once hidden since your guild has a great &quot;reputation&quot; within that city. Making being part of a guild not just a vending machine selection but a point of pride for what not only what you have done for guild but what the guild looks like to others. Almost like a demented in game faction. Just some thoughts though.<br />
<br />
All of that is a long shot but never hurts to toss in 2cp for it.</div></div><hr />

I would DEARLY love to be able to dump off old no-drop items that have been rotting in the bank for ages.  Even if they made the amount of tribute points trivial in relation to the &quot;level&quot; of the item, at least it would finally serve a purpose!  <br />
<br />
I am unguilded by choice and as such don't know much about the guild tribute situation, but I use the personal tribute system as much as possible...it has been a big help to me since I am definitely on the far away side of uber...and being able to add extra FT and focus effects has made a huge difference in my playing efficiency.  <br />

The Idea for religus augs was a great one. but I am all FOR being class restricted. gives more variaty. Actully anything that gives more variaty is a good thing. I know that it was nerfed out abit ago but I realy think it was a bad desision to not extend the racal bounes to AA (IE regen). Maybe since you love AA add in some race spasifice AA tab. or extending the abilitys (why yes iksar can have 40ac from our scalls that we max out at level 35 or so but why does it never incress from there?). It was pretty oviase that some of the races where more desined for a sertian class or group of classes (high for int casers mainly wizs or enchanters, woodys for bards or druids, halflings for rogues or some what druids), why not give the races a set of AA that thay can earn that would further help them or would be available for them based on what there race and class is (maybe the high elf pallys had finaly learned enough to add elemental damage to there weps, or there wizards where able to find ways of better menipulating the energy of there spells and there by incress how efectivly thay percie resistance or thay couse more damage) I personaly think that these should be gained via just levels and not AA but I dont think you all would do that so went the AA route. now you could also just couse certian traits to be improved (inate skills could go above there previace caps like the halfings sneak and hide or the dark elfs hide or the iksar forge) also it could be a refine ment of skills that realy cant improve like swimming for the races that started with it like thay get interupted less or treat swimming like thay are on solid ground, iksar AC bones would incress or we would finaly learn to use our tail for something usefull (like back in stated relice that we would get a tail strick that would function like a base [IE why we would be on equal footing to other shaman] or just have it act like a low skill skill of the monk ability of same name (the iksar monk ability anyway). make so that besideds just the classes that races add a certian flavor to what the charicter can do if the player is willing to play to its strangths.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Personally I wouldn't want to see racial AAs. I think that race is something that should not have any more effect in the game as it does at the moment. People should be able to choose a race they like without losing a significant benefit over the choice (some people already choose ogres just for frontal stun immunity etc). Besides, balancing classes is probably tricky enough without having to balance races. Not having access to a racial ability you like because of a race choice you made 3+ years ago (due to looks or abilities at the time) would probably not be fun.<br />
<br />
Storywise a good idea, and might work if the abilities are more about flavor than efficiency (bonuses to a race specific resist, skill bonuses etc), but it would probably end up as balanced as these examples:<br />

Iksar, extra AC and Regen, at the very least.<br />

Conceptually not a bad idea but I would tell you your pts are too high. You are talking 500 easy 250 hards for VT? Thats a minimum of 250hrs of somewhat challenging content (assuming hard). The only challenge to a VT key is the Emperor. And this coming from someone who has over 400 wins :)<br />
<br />
And as far as race and god goes there should be more impact. That being said a free switch should be given to ALL players when the changes went in. In DAOC every time they do a major change to the equivalent to skills/AAs they usually provide a free rewrite (they have stones that you can also win to completely redo the equiv to skills/aas, recognizing that skills mean FAR more in DAOC then they do in EQ).  How about giving out a loot that changes your race or god (more likely quest) after the changes of course.<br />

Credit folks with aa for the exp difference in racial aa (form the exp penalty they paid) and give them enough racial aa to repurchase initial starting abilities.<br />

Sorry I dont think the racial penalties are still fair especially when some abilities do not scale with level.<br />
Iksar may have a high penalty but at least the regen and ac scale with level. Barbs while having a lower penalty Slam is capped at a skill of 1 for 70 levels.<br />
<br />
Besides bonuses like sneak and forage on a race with an exp BONUS is hardly fair.<br />

It just isnt fair or balanced the way it is now.<br />

No more &quot;going backward&quot;. Once you join a guild, you gain all the keys that guild has automatically. Once you leave, they are stripped from you.&quot;<br />

The idea is good in concept, and some of it is good, but some people have worked very hard to get flags, just to have their guild fall apart on them. So, say you are a founding member of guild a under this system. Guild a kills up to elementals, does rondo vxed tipt the whole 9(I am flagged for all of this, no rondo yet though, did all sewers). This member attended 90% of all the raids, and got flagged with them. Now he has the option of exping at any of those zones in the elementals, or kod'taz. His guild has been around say two years now. All of a sudden a group inside his guild all have a problem and they deguild. Then, before that is over, a few more decide they want to go with them for one reason or another and people start to leave.<br />
<br />
Now, person A while wearing this tag can still have access, but cant raid because his guild can. Or he can deguild, and have no zone access despite having countless hours invested in flagging and keying his guild up for these zones, and then has to app to yet another guild and be flagless for a long while until he eventually gets in, just to regain access he spent time earning.

At 65 (and now i guess 70) EQ is just not fun anymore...unless you treat it as a job and work day in and day out for tiny increases in your equipment. And even then there is a ton of zones you will never get access to unless you join major guilds.<br />

I can guarrantee that EQ will loose lots of players unless some serious changes are made in this direction.<br />

In WoW i have spents lots of time solo in instanced dungeons where no mobs gave any experience but the zones are just so well-designed that its fun anyway. SOE's designers just have to get their act together.<br />

The penalty for exploring/dying is also far too great in EQ. The only thing this does is that it either makes people avoid exploring or they make sure they always get a res. Neither of these adds anything positive to the game in my view. The penalty for dying should be that you didnt achieve your goal with your current strategy and have to come up with something better.

The better solution would be to have the guildwide flags and also individual flags. If you join a guild that has the flags you have access while in the guild, but if you are actually there to get the flags yourself you will always have it whether in guild or not.</div></div><hr />

Problem solved. <br />

EQ is still fun for me. It is just a different kind of fun than when I started. It has moved from a world to a collection of zones. It has moved from an adventure RPG. To more of a tactical simulator with RPg elements. <br />
<br />
While I wish there was more of the world feeling and more rpg element.s Oh well. <br />
<br />
It is still the cheapest form of entertainment out there. But it is entertainment that requires a time investment. A Hobby. You can't devote 1 hour a month to baskettball and be any good either. <br />
<br />
(Shrug) I dislike what SoE has done to EQ. But not enough to leave my friends. And thankfully I do enjoy Tactical simulations a goodly amount. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">You sound bitter.<br />
<br />
Why shouldnt I be? I spent many many days played on this game and now it has turned into a complete mess that I dont enjoy anymore.<br />
<br />
We even have shamans here on this board (that have already done it) lobbying to make the 1.5 epic harder so they can feel more &quot;special&quot;. Why shouldnt I feel bitter about that? Some people have gotten so focused on making themselves look better by locking others out of content that its just sick. I dont know about you but I dont really care what others have or can do. I care about what I can realistically get or do.<br />
<br />
You name 3 major positive changes to the shaman class since SOE - I think it might even have been way back when they were called Verant - started talking about class balancing. And in my view rare items or spells dont count as part of balancing.<br />
<br />
It is still the cheapest form of entertainment out there. But it is entertainment that requires a time investment. A Hobby. You can't devote 1 hour a month to baskettball and be any good either.<br />
<br />
If its still entertaining I agree its cheap. I never said I want to be able to get everything by putting in 1 hour a month. But thats often what people try to make it sound like when I complain.<br />
<br />
Maybe I misunderstood this entire debate. I thought we were supposed to say what we think needs to be done with EQ if it is to be our #1 choice for MMO entertainment in the future. But it sounds like some of you here are looking at a world with only one choice: EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>Ruuka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">I don't know how maintream any of these suggestions are but for me they are big issues. If implemented they would make things fun, rather than a stuggle or pain in the __. <br />
<br />
You need more rezz classes out there. Revive for Druids and Shamans was not enough. The game is great, but the game is huge. Groups hold out for a Cleric as healer so they can get a rez on the spot rather than having to beg a Cleric to go Rez them later. The size of the game aggravates this problem even more. Why go in to a deep dungeon with a Druid or Shaman as healer when you are in the middle of nowhere and may have to get a Cleric or Paladin for a rezz later anyway? Clerics and Paladins will scream of course, but 11 other classes will cheer. <br />
<br />
Do something to allow players to log on, form a group, go have fun, and log out easily. Not Log on, look for the perfect group,  (contains Warrior and Cleric now), then go have fun. If a Warrior or Cleric leaves the the group there should not be groans from the other group members when a Paladin, Shadow Knight, Druid, or Shaman takes one of those two spots. <br />
<br />
I still see guild recruitment posts that say &quot; Where are you Clerics?&quot; Why is a guilds fun held up because they don't have enough Clerics? A guild should be held up because they don't have enough healers, not because they don't have enough Clerics. Something is wrong here. <br />
<br />
Lack of graveyards in LoY, GoD, and OoW was a giant step backwards. Despite what some EQ Fanatics dressed up as elves at a fan fare may have told you, corpse retrievals are the pits. <br />
<br />
LDoN was a game saving expansion for non - raiding players. The point requirements for adventure gear was just stupid high (my opinion). Cut the point requirements for all LDoN items by half. <br />
<br />
Always ask when implementing changes, &quot;Is it fun? Or is this just a pain?&quot; Go with the fun stuff every time. <br />
<br />
Put all spells on vendors and forget all this rune drop/ spell drop/ buy it in the Bazaar from farmers madness. This just makes many casters angry, which does not seem to be a smart way to run a subscription service. <br />
<br />
&quot;Raid in EQ or quit EQ.&quot; &quot;Raid or be a fourth rate, gimped player.&quot; Thats the game you made.  You wonder why Non - Raiders have left in droves? Everyone likes phat loots, especially non - raiders because they see it so rarely. <br />
<br />
I had a lot of fun in EQ. The question of if I play EQ or another SoE game again will be answered by Blizzard and how fun WoW is. You dropped the ball and kicked it into Blizzards court. Ask yourself why SoE.</div></div><hr />

I know i'm dreaming but hey worth a shot, if those are too much wishful thinking then maybe a 80% slow with a mitigation factor thats greater then enc/bst slow something/anything that makes us more priority to slow since we were the best at it from eqlive to PoP why break tradition i ask. why make it so people put enchanters/shaman/beastlords in the same sentence when they shouldn't be  :D<br />
<br />
EXACTLY!! Shaman are known for slows, it is what helps us do what the other preist classes can for healing. Really this is the biggest beef I have had with what SoE has been doing, we keep having slow nerfed. The one single improvement I think many of us would like to see is to be crowned king of slows again. There are a few ways to do this: One is the way Bangor suggested but I think that would be hard to put in game. Another would be to give us an AA slow that was unresistable and slowed to 1 level higher than the mob would be slowed with another class. Immune to slightly, slightly to partially, partially to mostly, mostly to fully, fully to fully+10%</div></div><hr />

No matter what the best path is there should be multiple paths to all content and gear. Raiding should get the rewards the fastest. A Huge named mob should drop items for at least half the people involved. With additional teaser/ quest items. as well. But there should be a route for the smaller groups as well that have the same power level but different lore/non game changing attributes. <br />
<br />
For spell aquisistion there should be many multiple ways to get them. Vendors for a large amount of money, tradeskill drops for the researchers. Drops. And quests as well. Skills should be the same as well. Some dojo/teachers where you prove your worth (Quest) Some where you pay your way past. (Coin) Zones the same way. Flags for achivement. Quest based flags as well. And Coin based flags for the key to the backdoor so to speak. <br />
<br />
Tradeskills are an intresting example of this. Some choose to do the farming. Some will pay to have others farm it. Some will buy things off the vendors at a higher price. <br />
<br />
Just a few ideas<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u118"><b>Kerberuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p118">I'd like to see more random content. A random named that can spawn and own everyone in his huge aggro range. I really love what has been done with SH in WoS. It puts a little edge back into the game. Campers beware! Add more of this content, deadly roaming named!<br />
<br />
Going along with first item. A named that spawns in random zones. Non campable, either you run across em and can kill them or not. No despawn, once it is killed it will go into a random timer / random zone. Doesn't that sound like fun! Surprise a chest! (2 groupable)<br />
<br />
Quit making tradeskills easier, these should BE an undertaking.<br />
<br />
Also would like to see more race specific abilities and being able to hon those abilities. I'd like to be able to do something no one else can. <br />
<br />
How about an AA path that would lock you from other AA's? Like a new form of specialization<br />
<br />
Quests for elemental flagging for those that don't quite get to raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Elementals do not need to be all access, and you shouldnt be able to buy access with coin. A long, and difficult quest, involving a large number of Sewer trial like events for each elemental plane and I could see it.<br />
<br />
As far as your phat lewt coments. Shove them up your ass. OOW has given VT and to an extent, elemental or better quality gear. It isnt as good as elemental raid quality just yet, but some of the stuff that drops off of single group, or less, mobs in zones like WoS, and PG are as good, if not better then the single group stuff in elementals, and the exp in rifts and PG at least compares to all but possibly tables with a damn good kite group.<br />
<br />
I dont see why you would want elemental access. It really isnt all that great. There isnt much room for exp groups in any of the elementals but maybe fire and water. Air is pretty hard to do for exp, and earth cant hold all that many exp groups.<br />
<br />
Then there is KT, there is a zone that is now a ghost town except for the wandering raider that passes through. You all want open access zones? I would almost say be my guest, but good luck getting groups in those zones. Most groups I know only take players that they are sure know their stuff. Trust me, if you had store bought KT access, and the average BoT/WoS tank tried to group in that zone, he would have to have a damn good cleric or not mind seeing &quot;Zone loading please wait.&quot; Because I have had tanks like that, and he bit the dust every couple of mobs with a pretty good cleric on heals.<br />
<br />
If you really want access though, and sony would give it, go nuts. The exp isnt that great comparitively anymore. Fire is the only zone that really sees traffic for exp purposes anyway. Maybe you will see people in earth if they are farming AA, but it is nowhere near as full as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">The one thing that I really want back is that I can buy my spells from Vendors, I dont care what people say but spells do not drop that common and then you have to be lucky in winning the roll with your group.<br />

If they insist that they have to have spells drop thats fair enough, but you should still be able to buy some im sure in all the new expanisions there have been im sure some of the NPC have killed mobs to get runes/spells to drop or what ever.</div></div><hr />

I actualy like this idea,, i mean, they already did it once with RGC,, you can make a droppable lore version, or  you can do 8-20 NRO adv for a no drop version.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">The one thing that annoys me the most, is the filtering of skillup messages, there is no separate filter for skillups, they get lumped in with skill messages so if you put skill messages into thier own window you get the following :-<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Cablaam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">I like the idea of having the next expansion have AA paths.  What I mean is if you go for AAs that increase your DOT damage you give up the option to get the the Healing AAs for that expansion.  EQ may get some customized Toons this way . . .  a Defensive MONK or a DSP Shamen . . . OR a Slowing Cleric?<br />

Not sure how it would all work . . . but could be cool!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u128"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p128">AA specialization ... only if you can erase the AA (losing the points) to try another path. And even then I don't like it.<br />
<br />
Real Rez For Shaman/dru ... I'm sorry the AA thing is to little to late. I know 2 people that ate an exp death because they didn't realize it was a shaman/dru rez instead of a cleric, also Remove the EE requirement for necro rez. <br />
<br />
Spells off vendors (and disciplines) Casters are not effective when we only have the spells from 2 expansions ago because we cannot get them (gates spells in particular). Not to mention the Ancient spells ... some of us cant get those simply because no one wants to go to Sleepers Tomb or any other older high end zones, I still want ancient bane of nife :P. Use the Task system as stated above for the higher end spells, just make them accessible.<br />
<br />
Duo able / solo able LDoN ... try getting an adventure group now :/  <br />
<br />
a wider variety of augments with Focus effects avaliable ... maybe all but the Highest level foci. <br />
<br />
lower the refresh times on the new clickies, I mean come 10 and 15 minutes between uses ... ridiculous<br />
<br />
anyway that is all I can think of ATM</div></div><hr />
