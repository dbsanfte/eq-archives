<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>F15E0476</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this isn't the right place to ask this.   But does anyone know about some new nebie quests out there.   I seen a warrior wearing (Steel Warrior) armor and i ask him where it was from, he said new newbie quests that are out.   I was wondering if there was Some for a Barb shaman i just made a newb on the Pvp server and since its a new server to me i think it would be eaiser doing these quests, then to save cash up for armor.  Since its bad enough saving for spells.<br />
<br />
Only posted here cause i was hoping for a quick response.  So i could get started on it asap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">about the only newbie armor you can get in the barbarian area is patchwork for turning in the polar bear skins, or if your a rogue turning in mammoth calf pelts for the black armor (forgot what its called) seems that verant is adding armor quests to different cities, so far, ak'anon, rivervale, freeport, neriak have had new quests added, and I think they are working to get new quests for all the cities</div></div><hr />
