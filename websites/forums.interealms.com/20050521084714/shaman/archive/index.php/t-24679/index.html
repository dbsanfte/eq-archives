<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wow, My guild has just started a requirement for all Shamans (only me and one other in guild) to have a certain amount of AAs.  This means that I will have to grind out 25 AAs in 3 weeks.  I can only play about 2-3 hours per night and more on weekends.  My magelo is linked in my sig banner.  Does anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I were you, I would just switch your exp to  full AA and hunt in the areas that you would normally group in.  You have about the same amount of time to play as I do, and I have managed to get about 14 aa's in about a week of off and on grouping in BoT at level 62.  I would think in OOW zones like WoS, with all exp set to AA, you could easily get the AA's you need in a half decent exp group.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  You should be fine though :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
_________<br />
Make that 16 aa's in one week</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, maybe off topic, but just do as suggested, get as many as you can playing in high exp zones (with 100% aa's turned on of course) on your regular schedule.  If you don't get 25 and they make it an issue, tell them to kiss your rear end.<br />
<br />
THIS IS A GAME PEOPLE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe you have to smack them so they will understand that outside you getting MGB, you being level 70 will be of much larger benifit than you getting 25more AAs...<br />
<br />
edit-The more flags in pop you get the easier AA will come...in fire i can easily do 1 aa every 30 mins...sometimes faster without problems...i have been known to do 15 AA in a day in plane of fire, while playing xbox...if they are going to bitch about people in your guild being under AAed, perhaps they should be more actively makeing a push for EP or KT (in doing this they will realize spells/discs+levels&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;AA.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well granted you probably can't do this, I agree with Galelor.  And he's also right about the ele exping.  The reason ele flag still boosts your exp, is it provides atleast 2 more very nice zones to exp in.  Since most of us only group in Earth and solo/group in Fire.  If you need quick AA I would focus on WoS and/or Ruined City of Dranik exping.  I'd bet in the time you have each night, you can knock out a good 3aa a night if you focus.  On the weekends you can really knock out alot more.  The exp in these places is probably comparable to KT.  I would say MPG, but I think that would be pushing it.  Better to go with a more stable WoS group or even better RCoD.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There are alot of AA's that would be completely unnoticable by other players :)  Think about it, you have Canni5, MGB, VP, Crit AA's, Healing Adept, SCR type AA's that would stand out to others.  Most of the other AA's don't show up very well to other players, such as the innate stat boosts, metabolism, regen, MC, even the Durability and Agility AA's will be hard to notice.  Just maxing Natural Durabilty and Combat Stability would take 36 AA's and would be hard to measure from another player's screen :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Of those, I would save Spell casting subtlety for last, since that one could be fudged on :)  Just make sure to control your aggro, and if you are with a really good tank, you probably won't have trouble with aggro anyways.</div></div><hr />

It's Captain Obvious on the line.  He said if you want to develop guild requirements for shamans you should ask the shamans who are already in the guild.<br />
<br />
MGB.  Radiant Cure (1 or 3).  Canni5.  Mnemonic Retention.  Ancestral Aid. Call of the Wild.<br />

THOSE are AA's that should be required.  AAs that directly help the Raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kydaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My suggestions<br />
<br />
1) 100% to AA<br />
2) Try WoS the NW caves I can get about 1 AA/hr there with a good group<br />
3)Vxed with a good group<br />
4) or as suggested PoF<br />
<br />
I have also noticed from my bf who is at 67 (I am 83% into 65 then went 100% AA - I only have 10 right now am new to the game - 3 months old) that he gets less AA xp then I do at 65 when we both are in the same group and have our AA meter set to the same %.  This seems to be the same for all I have talked to.  As soon as they hit 66 AAxp went down.<br />

[/qoute]<br />
<br />
ROFL, i totally agree.  however, i would say SCS 3 is a direct benifit to the raid as you will agro much much less...that means quicker slows, more slow resists, and potentially chain healing even after the MT dies without you getting agro (my brothers druid has zero scs and i notice a significant differance between his agro and mine on raids.)  I wouldn't say mnemonic retention has a large direct effect as usually you can do a quick sit/mem deal to change out spells.  but, after all, what AAs are usefull and what AAs are not usefull really has no bareing here.  <br />
you are right, it is quite obvious that whoever came up with these requirements has no clue what they are doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I didn't get SCS3 and don't plan to for a long long time. I usually have malos on inc mobs before its in melee range and slow as soon as my gems refresh. The only time I ever pull agro on a raid is if there is no tank on the mob (seems to happen a lot in water with mobs above/below the tank) or I want to get agro (off a cleric or something). Unless several tanks die and I've been doing some hard core dps I should never see agro on a raid. <br />
<br />
The only thing SCS3 would be remotely useful in in my opinion would be dot agro which is doesn't really work on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i think SCS3 is one of those abilities that you don't truely see how usefull it is until you get it.  i am faulty of this too.  i never relized how great scs was until i maxed it out.  <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
you touched on a major flaw in this AA..it doesn't work well with dots =/  not haveing a toggle switch that would on/off this AA skill is the only other problem i have. i however do not agree that dot agro would be the only worthy use of this AA.<br />
<br />
btw i have noticed several high end guilds making this a req AA for most classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I logged on one day to a MOTD that stated that unless shamans and clerics get Blood of nadox they will be penalised 50dkp (i think it was 50, not sure exact amount).<br />
<br />
I was pretty pissed off I had attended almost every raid the guild had for the past two months, and really was at burn out point. I was going to wait and off they took the dkp off me then de-guild, but a friend of mine talked me into getting it. He basically ported me to the boat and started running to nadox 8)<br />
<br />
In any case, the guild ended up self distructing because the leadership started introducing harsher and harsher rules, people started leaving then the officers server transferred to get out of the obligation.<br />
<br />
DKP was bought in, i was fine with officers assigning loot. Then all of a sudden roting loot was destroyed, twinks or candidates couldnt recieve it, it started getting resentful. All of this indicated that the leadership of the guild was starting to buckle under the weight of the wingers, haters and negative bozoes.<br />
<br />
Its the beginning of the end.<br />
<br />
Once people start to think thier contribution is greater than others, but they do not get rewarded for it, it is a ever hasteneing spiral of death.<br />
<br />
But how do you reward people who contribure more without alienating the others?<br />
<br />
Tough questions. These are the questions that make a difference.<br />
<br />
For regardless what people say, you cant take out RZTWL with two groups. You need to include others and bring them with you.<br />
<br />
This analogy is soooo like running a modern day organisation.<br />
<br />
Its not easy. Not everyone gets it right. Your gonna **** it up a few times. Pick yourself up and do it again.<br />
<br />
Its amazing how much this game and its social tentacles is like what we do in RL.<br />
<br />
Be well all!</div></div><hr />

SCS? Make the MT's spend some LDoN points on Hate-increasing augs. I can control MY aggro &amp; NEED to get aggro when it comes time to peel something off the cleric, enchanter, druid, or whoever.<br />
<br />
Intentional rot? Thats just absurd &amp; selfish. I've seen friends of the guild, unflagged ones, get 85/15'd in &amp; CoH'd to the spot to prevent rot. Hell, at least check in the zone to see if there are any &quot;friends&quot; who can use first.<br />
<br />
It sounds like your guild/raid leader is hell-bent on getting the guild to Time. That's great, but they're going about it the wrong damn way. Stupid minimal requirements are inherently Devisive. What you need is cohesion &amp; teamwork to get there. Resentment breeds contempt &amp; I'll bet a lot of your guildmates are resenting this AA crap.<br />
<br />
Start looking for another guild. Without a big paradigm change SOON, yours will be but a memory.<br />

Rot and DKP go hand in hand.  If an item is worth using, it's worth paying for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/nod Was referring to the jillionth silk glove pattern in PoF. Everybody who could use, had already. We don't use DKP so I'm not too familiar with how it works, but have an idea. Use a numerical merit system instead. Points accrued by attendance/performance. They get spent &amp; on we go. Everybody knows who has how many points. Very elegant system, fast too. Values of drops are calculated using a cute program you just drop the item into (figureatively). No &quot;bidding&quot; persay, but you do pay for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Required number of AA's / Level / HP/ mana/ etc etc is all fine and dandy as a PRE-requisate ti joining a guild.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure, that once your in, especially if there is only one other Shaman in the guild they wont send you to Everfrost on a slave train.....<br />

IMO- Let em try how they like raiding with no Shaman buffs or slow. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />

Our current requirements were discussed and voted on by our shaman.<br />

<br />
<br />
no clue if this is the actual guild leader but if it is...&gt;&gt;&gt;<br />
no need to insult us or our perception of you..i was just curious if your active shaman told you what the entire shaman community thought of the situation presented...we were in fact giving a shaman in your guild advice, and attempting to help your guild in the process.  a group of my friends + me prolly out AA half your guild if your guild tallied AAs (as several of my friends have over 1000 AA and play mult toons with that AA status...).  does that make us better than you? not at all, but it does put me +them in a position to offer AA advice to someone asking for it.  Advice of which we could care less if it is taken or not...<br />
<br />
btw i have over 250 days of actual play time on my shaman and hit 500 AA (not that 500 is a lot, but it is enough,) so i know a little bit about what i am talking about (not to mention i was an officer/shaman leader in a guild that was pushing for time during the hight of PoP so i know a little bit about your situation...)<br />
<br />
BTW-torm seems like a really nice person from what i have gathered in his/her posts.  he/she also seems like one of the few shaman you have in guild that attends raids.  if you frequent these boards you will notice that many shaman are leaving EQ1 so finding more shaman to join your guild could be a problem.  honestly i wouldn't piss torm off since in the long run you could end up lossing someone totally loyal to the guild and wind up being ****ed over.  as a shaman verteran and a leader in the 2 guilds i was in previous to the one i just joined, just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Heya. :)<br />
<br />
No need to get all sarcastic...nobody called you evil.  I did say you should ask the shaman in the guild for their input.  Considering that 1 of the 2 shaman in your guild started this thread (and he said he was the main one online) I thought it was a pretty safe bet that you DIDN'T ask them for their input. <br />
<br />
And yes, chanters and Charisma AAs go hand in hand.  You are teh debil!!1 :)</div></div><hr />

Here's how I see <br />
<br />
Previous advices : OMG your guild leader set up new rule regarding AA requirements, that is the sigh of satan!!, quick! LEAVE your guild asap and find new one with no AA rules.<br />
<br />
Some unrelated advices : DKP is ebil, your DKP guild suck , omg you let the loot rot? !!!!....make the fake Magelo no one wil know!!<br />
<br />
After I post : We were just giving him GOOD advices about AA, you should be appreciate that we are helping your guild shaman out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">1)  Those bits of &quot;advise&quot; were only given to a person that was in a guild, had been established as a frequent raider, was 1 of only 2 shaman in the guild, was given the requirement to get 25AA in a few weeks. That idea to most is not a very good one.  Granted, that person came back later and said you were bending the rules a little to help out on his times.<br />
<br />
2)  *** does a beastlord know about my class?  Unless they have roled a shaman to any part of the end game, they know jack sh*t about being a shaman.  Sure they can slow almost as well as us, but since they can, we as a community have had to change our playstyles some and make ourselves more &quot;wanted&quot; in grps.  Yes we slow, but there is a WHOLE lot more that we do, that goes unappriciated IMO by the rest of the game as a whole.<br />
<br />
Ill leave it at that...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Gembone_ner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Beastlord = Monk + Shaman , I even ask the beast(s) in guild for monk class AA requirements. <br />
<br />
here's the monk list.<br />
If you don't agree, go ask any monk with half brain and they will agree. <br />
<br />
Combat Fury3, Innate Agi5, Advanced Innate Agi 5, Fear resistance, First Aid3, and Finishing blow3, also every GoD AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You have seriously flawed views.  So do you go ask a paladin for AA requirements for clerics and warriors?<br />
<br />
My lord, please quit now before you make any other stupid decisions.<br />
<br />
Beastlords know nothing about how to play a shaman.  They are in no way similar to a shaman, except for the fact that they have a slow spell and a few buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'll go with the topic of Retarded Guildleaders for $500, Alex!<br />
<br />
Canni<br />
RC1<br />
MGB<br />
9th spell slot<br />
Run3<br />
Those are the only really required AAs a shaman needs.  Each of those is literally game changing in what it allows you to do.  All other AAs are things nice to have, but in no real way should limit a shaman into a guild, except for the group heal over time AA combined with MGB.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha.  You *would* need half a brain to agree with that list.<br />
Spending points into agility.  That's beautiful.  And finishing blow.  Ya.  That does a whole lot of good when all those raid mobs you hunt below level 60 start fleeing...Oh wait, they don't flee.  Oh wait, none meed the required level.  Oh wait, if it were to even flee, then it doesn't matter because you've already killed the mob and it's not hurting anyone anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gembone_ner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Paladin = War + Cleric ? naww...<br />
<br />
Paladin = Ranger ( die alot) + Shadowknight (everyone know they are the same class just difference name) <br />
.........................................................................<br />
We don't recruit warrior in guild, because everyone know they are simply useless. Instead we have 20 rangers to rotate WS tanking. <br />
<br />
Why don't monk need AGI ? Agi = ac = dodge ! l337!<br />
our monks always try to solo everything they pull anyway, so AGI is a big factor ;)</div></div><hr />

Heres where the shaman community has come down (for the most part) about your guild shaman's post.<br />
<br />
1. Some of the specific aa's you require are absurd.<br />
<br />
2. Adding requirements to Current members is asenine. New members, sure, that's your perrogative.<br />
<br />
Are you guys Time &amp; KT? Can you kill any elemental boss on raidnight with average attendance? If yes, great, more power to ya. If no, why the hell should anyone join your wannabe &quot;raiding guild&quot; with its monumentally stupid requirements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Gembone_ner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">We raid NToV</div></div><hr />

Gembone_ner, you blew your cover when you talked about WSing rangers.  Should have stuck with the monk=AGI and NTOV stuff...you could have kept trolling. ;)<br />
<br />
Should have posted how you use Shadowknights to tank everything since they can pull and already have aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Gembone_ner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Arrowed !!!  <br />

btw the ranger part is quite true, sadly.<br />
<br />
feed me!! I am a troll ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Tormidon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Ok, I'm here just to fill the readers of this post in about Gembone.  He was actually a great leader, and he was extremely knowledgeable about the game because he has been playing for the majority of its existance.  I'm sorry if you took any of his sarcastic remarks personally, but he was not trying to make personal attacks on you, but more likely, just stir up the bee hive a little bit.  I am very fortunate to have met him in-game as his guild was just being formed, consisting of many seasoned guild officers.  In mere months, Gembone was able to form one of the strongest guilds on Bristlebane, and we made it to the Elemental level faster than any other guild on our server.  Overall, he was a laid back kinda guy, but very intense when in raiding situations.  Just a day ago, after experimenting with WoW, he decided to guit EQ for good.  He was  a great leader, and we will be hard-pressed to find anyone that will able to replace him in our guild.  Again, I'm sorry if he offended or angered anyone in any way.<br />
