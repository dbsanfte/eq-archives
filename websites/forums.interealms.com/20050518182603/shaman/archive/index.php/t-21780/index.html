<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mulleteer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
Knights Nocturnal are now accepting cross server applicants for our guild. We are a small tight knit group of similar minded individuals who like to have fun playing Everquest. Our raid times are quite rare, not just on SolRo but on most servers. We do not begin raiding until 10 pm PST. This allows our members time to spend with their families in the evening and is perfect for those who work late. <br />
<br />
However, our play times make it tough for people in the EST, as not a lot of us are online early in the evening. <br />
<br />
Currently our guild is working on Emp and VT keys. We are hoping to begin our progression through PoP soon. We have aspirations of exploring all of Everquest's raiding content. <br />
<br />
For more information on our guild loot policies and requirements visit our website at forums.eqnocturnal.com <br />
<br />
You can also send a tell to one of our officers: elrico, ziluk, xenidor, gretl, wildeagle, doktorr, and ariocc. <br />
<br />
I look forward to meeting you in game, keep safe and good adventuring to you. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this dude spammed every single server board with this, I'm assuming he did all the class boards too. I just deleted his post on 7th, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wonder why he hasn't posted on Solro's boards yet.</div></div><hr />

Haha, got sucked into CoH eh ? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mulleteer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We posted on one of the Sol ro boards.  The main reason we are posting on more boards is that we raid on a real niche time.  They are only a small group of people who would raid that time on any given server.  Most servers don't have guilds which raid times like ours.  So some people who play those times and want to raid may be intrested.<br />
<br />
Cross server transfering recruiting is probably going to become more and more popular as everquests population decreases.  This will be even more true for groups of people who raid at non peak times.<br />
<br />
Take care<br />

The guys raid at a wierd time and probably have a hard time finding people.</div></div><hr />

Ofcourse another way to look at it is, if he lets this guy do it then someone else will then another, then suddenly your forum is a advertisment for something you dont want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then open up a section of x-server recruiting..... honestly, people are looking for anything to get annoyed about. You should all be happy that at least one guild is looking for Shaman! Jeez......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">at least one guild is looking for Shaman<br />
No, at least one guild is looking for warm bodies, 'cause this was posted on Monkly-Business too, and apparently several other class/server boards.  Whatever, though.  I wish the guild luck.  Glad to see people still interested in playing the game instead of pissing and moaning at every turn.</div></div><hr />
