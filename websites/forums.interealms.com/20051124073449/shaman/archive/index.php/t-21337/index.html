<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm playing a mind/empathy controller on Protector server named &quot;Balix&quot; ...<br />
<br />
Currently lvl 5 and having a BLAST with him ... any thoughts, opinions on this combination as I level or concerns / advise now?<br />
<br />
I'm looking at the following power trees for progression:<br />
<br />
Mind Control / Empathy - primary secondary (obviously)<br />
Teleportation (all 4 - max.  teleport foe, recall ally (summon corpse), TP self, and group TP (Evac) )<br />
Flight: (Hover only)<br />
Stealth: (invis only)<br />
<br />
The way I see it, I'll be able to rez, summon corpse, heal, AE heal, mez, AE mez, buff, TP, and evac.<br />
<br />
I won't have a lot of offensive &quot;Ooomph&quot; to bring to the table, so I don't know if I'll be able to solo well, but groups ought to be scrambling for me.<br />
<br />
Thoughts, opinions, powersets?  What should I beware of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you can choose from a fourth pool as well. I've heard really good things about the Fitness pool, especially the health/endurance regen.<br />
<br />
I've been doing the same thing...trying to come up with the most combinations of &quot;must have&quot; powers. It's a little easier for me, since I'm playing with my boyfriend so I just have to come up with 1/2 of the &quot;must haves&quot;.<br />
<br />
Characters I currently like:<br />
<br />
Controller - Gravity/Kinetics<br />
Lifting is fun! Currently, I lift them up and smash them, my boyfriend pushes them away and shoots them. I can't wait to get Propel so I can do a little more damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Defender - Dark Miasma/Psychic Blast<br />
<br />
Drop a tar pit, subdue the mobs as they slowly run through it, blast them!<br />
<br />
Considering my EQ background, I can't imagine living without invis... how do you guys rank that as a &quot;must have?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wouldn't 4 pools water you down a lot?  Primary / Secondary are what I've heard are the meat and potatoes to invest in - then get pools for misc. little things you want to round yourself out.  I can see a LOT of use for going 4 investments in teleporting, or at least 3 (if you don't want teleport foe), although teleport foe would be GREAT to single-pull :)<br />
<br />
The other teleport series would be for summon corpses/ally to you, and evac - both of which I can see as really beneficial.  Then just get hover for aerial and instead of bothering with flight for long-distance travel, just use teleport and travel yourself, so I think fly/teleport would be a wash... and self TP may even be useful as a shadowstep type utility so I can see that.<br />
<br />
Mostly I was just thinking of a class that could invis, TP/evac, summon corpse, and REZ would be a NICE thing for any group to have handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gravity control gets probably the most fun power in the game, with Propel.<br />
<br />
The higher your level, the larger the object it creates and throws at your target. It starts out with garbage cans and other small items...towards the end, it's a forklift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">HA HA HA HA! I can't WAIT!<br />
<br />
As far as primary vs. pool powers, I can see what you are saying Ciccero, but I've always played a support type with EQ.<br />
<br />
I love the ability to be a tanker that can heal, or adding ports or invis! Just like EQ, I like doing lots of things :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, next question - Fly vs. Super Jump....discuss!!!<br />
<br />
I think Fly is by far the sexier ability, but the ability to jump buildings in a single bound...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dullsville</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, next question - Fly vs. Super Jump....discuss!!!<br />
<br />
I think Fly is by far the sexier ability, but the ability to jump buildings in a single bound...<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's hard to say.  I've seen people make the argument that Super Jump is more endurance efficient than Fly, but if you're just using it for travel I don't see how that factors in.  I've always heard people claim that Super Jump is probably the fastest form of travel in the game, but since I'm only level 12 I wouldn't really know.  <br />
<br />
I'm personally going Super Jump, but that's because I've already taken Combat Jumping for the additional Defense bonus it gives, which is pretty beneficial to me as a Scrapper.  Plus, the Super Jump fits my character better I think.  Granted, I have made an alt I play with a bit who was made specifically so I can eventually have Fly because it looks so damn cool.<br />
<br />
As Ciccero has mentioned, Teleport is pretty damn nice too.  It came in handy last night when I got brutalized by a room full of Abominations and Mortificators during a mission, and my friend who was with me was able to run and then TP my corpse to the entrance so I could revive myself.  Plus, when we're running missions in higher level zones, he will hover to the mission and TP me there so we don't have the two of us running around taking the chance of finding a fight we don't really want to be in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dominate appears a LOT better than mez. Its basically hold person from D&amp;D. Or a super long stun if you wanan think in eq terms... like 20 seconds. It deals a dd component, the mob is helpless about as long as a mesmerized mob but you can attack it, it has a much faster cycle timer... I honestly see NO point in mez when you get Dominate. Am I missing anything? Currently level 12 (mind/empath)<br />
<br />
Absorb pain is your main heal. Deals about 20% of your life, heals a LARGE chunk of hp. Heal other is kind of crappy, but its nice to have a backup heal I GUESS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I like Mez strictly because you can use it while Dominate is recycling.  Makes handling several mobs at once easier.  But maybe a reduction enhancement makes that point moot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I cycle dominate, mez, and levitate.<br />
<br />
I'm level 8 now and I normally tackle groups of 5 or 6 by dominating the first one - generally a lieutenant, then mezzing one of the runners as they come in on me.<br />
<br />
I can usually then levitate a 3rd before they get to me, and dominate another again - then mez the lieutenant, and levitating one of the others on me.  dominate / mez / levitate whoever's wiggling, and keeping the lieutenant mez/dom'd (whichever is up) as I'm dispatching his cronies, and basically just mez/dom'ing whichever is up.<br />
<br />
I've invested 4 enhancements in levitate all at 10+ improve damage so it hits fairly hard and has good range.  With dominate, I can usually dominate, then lev/lev/lev dominate again before dominate wears off... mez I use just to lock 'adds down until it's their turn to go on the dominate / levitate ride.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I guess. It just seems wrong that the power that requires less finess (ie targeting the one not being attacked, no coodrination needed with group etc) is so glaringly superior.</div></div><hr />
