As many shortcomings that we have in the end game, 30-60 sure is fun again.  I cheated a bit with a 2 night PL to 35, but I love my Dog Dog so sue me!!!  I'm also 2-boxing a Cleric with this Shaman as I ran my first alone.  Kinda keeps me busy so I don't get Canni mezzed :D<br />
<br />
BTW, you wonder where you came up with the money for all these overpriced spells.....sigh.<br />

Mind you there alot alot of fun classes and classes im envious of. I wish i could charm like a chanter for example. But at the end of the day a shaman is who i fits me more then anyone else.<br />
<br />
In WoW i plan on making a shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would re-roll with a SK or a Paladin without a second thought.</div></div><hr />

This isnt to say I didnt enjoy a shaman, but the total and complete lack of attention (for lack of a better description) from SOE towards the class, while at the same upping Mob's DPS, resists, other class slows/buffs, etc etc ad nausem...  completely stinks.   <br />
<br />
That almost hurt to admit that  :confused: (about wanting to be something else)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd rather be a shaman than anything else, but if I was a comparably geared and AA's necro, paladin, or bard - I would have no complaints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 to 65 back in the days was a fun and almost forgotten time =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have said this before but I will say it again.  I am a Hillbilly in RL.  I also am the type of guy who likes to have a lot of his own personality in his character.  If FV would have been up before I got Sion to a higher level I would have played on FV.<br />
<br />
Hillbilly = Barbarian.  So I picked Barbarian first.  When I started playing Rogues seemed to have problems.  I was afraid Warriors would be too boring (wrongly) so I picked Shaman as it was the most flexible Barbarian class.  <br />
<br />
Now with two new classes I am not so sure that I would pick Shaman given that I can still play a Barbarian.  I know the point has been argued but I think comes down to personal situation and play style.  For some folks the Shaman is now broken but for others it is still doing well.  I think it is situational.  In my guild I am redundant and I have a hard time finding groups for LDoN.  I can still solo pretty well.  So for me the class is broken.<br />
<br />
As a matter of class spirit I would have a hard time playing a class (Beastlord) that I hold responsible for screwing my beloved Shaman.  Don't get me wrong I thing the BL is fun and the folks who play it should not be screwed because SoE's mistake.<br />
<br />
Bezerker looks like a fun alternative.  I don't think there is any good reason the class should have been implemented but it looks like a goo alternative to work with my current beleagured Shaman.  Don't know if I would have picked it on its own though.  Much like the Warrior.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are versatile, fun to play and if you play well you can really make a difference in a group, or on a raid.<br />
<br />
If I could trade my shaman for any other class with the same level of gear and AAs, I wouldn't do it.</div></div><hr />

But I can't deny that I really enjoy the shaman class, I enjoy our capabilities (at my level of the game, anyways) and I really can't see myself playing another class. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One has to wonder why there is even 2 sides to this poll. I have to wonder why people, if they are so unhappy, are still playing a shaman. Mind you the 2nd chioce was &quot; another class please&quot;. So why are you still here?<br />
<br />
Im not trying to be mean, im trying to understand why people will play a game in a way they dislike when there are other options. Getting to 60+ is not that hard, especialy witht he help of friends. You can get right back to where you are now minus some AA and gear and in some cases you can even swap out the gear for your new toon. If i hated my shaman i would put him on the back burner and just go, not delete him mind you, but simply play something i enjoyed. <br />
<br />
If your answer to this inquiry is &quot;I have too much time put into my toon&quot; then maybe you need to question what is it your getting from EQ ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What's this bull**** your serving us here sir?<br />
<br />
Getting to 65 with a decent amount of AAs (~120) takes a good 3 month, with no raiding.<br />
<br />
Do you think anyone in the areas of the game where shaman are lacking (think elementals/time/GoD) want to give up a probably nicely geared char with a decent amount of AAs?<br />
<br />
Do you think everyone have the time and patience required to start, lvl, equip a new character, while your &quot;friends&quot; advance further into the game and get way ahead of you in terms of gear and power?<br />
<br />
Do you know what a pain a complete reflagging in PoP can be? Did you ever kill Teh Rathe Council?<br />
<br />
Those are multiples reasons why many of us complain but still play: the introduction of AAs greatly hindered the possibility to reroll. Pre luclin i had 3 lvl 60 characters, now only the shaman is 65 with AAs, other got left out: i just had no time for screwing around on them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would play a monk.  The only reason that I'm playing a shaman is because I gave away my original 52 monk account when I quit for the first time.  Came back, and some dick (not the person I'd given the account to) had my monk...so his cousin gave me a spare 51 shaman he had.<br />
<br />
In my current EQ situation though, I'll be sticking with the shaman (though I have a 50 monk twink)...better for my guild and the people I play with (which is my guild  :p ).<br />
<br />
It's not that I dislike playing a shaman, I do like it.  It's just that I really like playing a monk.   ;)</div></div><hr />

Like i said. no one is saying to delete your shaman and never use it again. Keep him on the back burner and use him only for raids or when you just DESIRE to play a shaman. Sounds like your in a Time flag guild im sure you got uber duber loots, so whats the big deal of easing off your shaman and playing something you really enjoy ?<br />
<br />
Again im talking to the people that hate their shaman. Im talking to the people that loathe the shaman but still play and come here and complain about every lil detail. If you dont fit this description then im not talking to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 65 Shaman, decently geared with 100+ AA's, elemental flagged.  I love it.  However, it gets to be a pain to see our class get left behind so many times.<br />
<br />
I also have a 65 monk on another account I 2box with.  I love the monk class, but they too are so screwed over most of the time, it makes the shaman situation look good.  Why am I a sucker for punishment!!!  Monks get some crap AA's and the promise of a melee revamp and end up with a nerf of anything decent they get.  Rangers, on the other hand, get even MORE archery AA's to help with DPS.  They are already the best, or one of the top 2, DPS classes and they get more, while the monk is left behind.  It seems that both the Shaman and Monk are getting judged by the uberness we had back in Kunark or so.  I still love em, but man.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, I have made a BL and got it up to 58 with no 2boxing or PL at all.  Holy crap they are powerful up to those levels.  I can only imagine they get even more so.  It is almost like they get all the good stuff we have, and then tons of other good stuff we don't get.  Aren't we the parent class?  Just absurd.  Made a 55SK too, fun fun class.  <br />
<br />
I still prefer Shaman/Monk, but sometimes it is a beating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I love Thorzion.  I love that at the end of a hairy overpull I can be at 60 health and 80 mana and be bugging people to hurry up and start pulling again.  I love that I can stand alone with 3 baddies and not break a sweat.  I hate the fact that our heals have falled so far behind the curve.  I hate that my melee damage sucks and my main form of damage (dots) is really a solo only tool (aside from once a fight Bane).  But those things aside, I still love the shaman.<br />
<br />
But I've rolled up a ranger as an alt to play with.  It started as just another alt (Ive an army of them), but Ive had so much fun that I'm going to try to get him to 65.  I dont know if I've got the juice in me to gear (I'd like to get Kael/HoT gear for him, just because I never got more than 2 pieces for Thor) and flag another character, but Im sure as hell gonna try.  Hes on another account, so Ive been able to assist him with Thor.  He just hit 45 yesterday, so hes almost ready for planes.  Its kind of a full circle for me, as my first character many years ago was a ranger.  (back when the ranger jokes were all true)  <br />
<br />
So, would I be a shaman again?  Yes.  THere are some things that I would have done differently, to be sure, but the Shaman class was the first class that I played that I loved everything about, and the first class that I took all the way.  I'm one of those that may move on, but will always consider myself a shaman at the core.</div></div><hr />

I know exactly how you feel. Especially since my shaman will have a nice berserker companion soon  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Hmm level 1-60 was the best fun as a shaman, the progressional spells, the increase in power etc etc, it was immensely satisfying and fulfilling. 60-65 I found more disappointing. I played a shaman twice, the first time to 51 and the other to 65. Don't think I could play another shaman, but they're a fun progressive class, and there are different ways of playing a shaman levelling up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Oddly enough, out of the group of dozen guildies I usually play with, 3 others used to play shamans, but gave them up in favor of alts that became mains (ones a cleric, ones a pally, and the other is a bard).  I’ve been really torn between starting a BL.  Although I think I’d like the BL class better, I know I’d miss playing with Tormac, just because I’ve had him so long.  He’s like an old VW I used to have.  Sure its getting a little old, and has lots of little problems that can add up to be a pain at times, but at the same time I had a lot of good times with it, and it become very personalized. <br />
<br />
I wonder what ever became of my old VW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I voted that I would pick another class if I could start over again.  But there is the sticking point.  I'd rather quit than start over now because I know how much effort it would take to make a new toon anywhere close as useful to my guild as Mitrian is now.  In fact, that's probably not possible.  Since joining my current guild about a year ago, I've given up all my alts in favor of making my character the best it can be.  My toon has over 500 AA, and every last item I have came from a guild raid, and is No Drop.  Sorry... even with the complaints I have about the class, I'm not starting over.  I have more commitment to my guild and my toon than that!Again im talking to the people that hate their shaman.Who said they hated their shaman?  Crusty already quit the game.  It's kind of funny how you can make such an insightful and well thought out post in one thread (on the state of Sewer trials), and seem so clueless on another one ten minutes later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Shaman is the best class. I notice my utility especially if I'm with some lower level friends who don't have all their stats maxxed. We can do almost everything. Mind you I believe we have some issues with SoE and we could use a perk or two but in general I got very few complaints.<br />
<br />
Started a dwarf Berserker yesterday and having alot of fun with him. The GoD potions I made for him help alot. The DD ones that is...stun and snare might be useful in a group situation later but I didn't find they were in lowbie levels.Otherwise I never touch my alts. Only other class I'd consider is necro.

Actually, you echoed my feelings quite well on this topic Litgruv.  I'm at the state where my shaman is not enjoyable to play regularly.  He sits on the backburner until guild raids, or enough guildies bitch and moan that they can't do xxxx without me on my shaman.<br />
<br />
Once my bard is lvl 65, I intend to start pushing harder to switch mains to him, with the shaman as a backup if more shaman are needed.  I still enjoy playing the shaman, just those times are few and far between.  More often than not, I'm a bit grumpy when I'm pushed to play him because 'guild/guildmates/etc' need me on him, and my bard can't contribute to the guild to anywhere near the same degree (yet!!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">i ran a barb shaman to 40 on Vallon when 50 was tops.<br />
<br />
i ran a barb shaman to 52 on Sullon when it went to 65.<br />
<br />
currently a barb shaman at 63.55 on Prexus. <br />
<br />
before i ever make a 4th shaman, i would make a cleric, make friends with another cleric and swap heal/melee/nuke roles as we had mana.<br />
<br />
and it is not the degradation of the shaman in pvp that bothers me overly, it is the realization that starting over thru all those expansions i continued to get weaker.  now on any guild event only the highest lvl shaman is needed for buffs, the rest of us can go solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think people got a bit off topic there talking about how much they do/do not like their Shaman. I think the real question is-If you had it to do over again (not getting rid of your current Shaman), knowing what you do now about the class, would you make the same choice? <br />
My answer is most definately NOT. No reason why you would, its an excersize in futility trying to be a good Shaman.<br />
Putting my money where my mouth is, I've got and enclave of lower level characters over on Kane Bayle and not one of them is a Shaman. The day after the newest server went live, I started another conclave of characters. Again, not one of them a Shaman. There's just no reason why you would start putting work into an obsolete class.<br />
<br />
Not saying I never enjoyed being a Shaman. There was a time when this class was ultra fun to play. Thats when you are lower level and doing older expansion content. Playing at the highest level of the game currently, is a completely different matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Already made the switch to beastlord. Shaman and relegated to farmbot for my little sister who plays on Saryrn. Why? Between guilds grumbling or being dead air, cockblocking ubers, bad timing, using the same spells i was using in Kunark, and saving up several thousand K just so I could get ONE of my pre-65 class-defining spells burned me the hell out. i ground out 6 AA to have a pretty little &quot;Baroness&quot; in front, but that's it.<br />
<br />
I might come back, but it'll have to take a good rework of the Shaman class to not be a bard that can't melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Well, I love my Shaman, but I made a Pally to &quot;truly tank&quot; with, and I am having a ball with it.  LDoN missions are great with the Pally, and I get compliments everytime about my excellent pulling.  Funny thing is, the skill I learned about pulling and not getting adds, and how to pacify mobs and such, I learned from being the shaman on the adventures (where you need to pay close attention to the puller and be ready for the slows, roots, etc...)  I know that I am preaching to the chior here when I say that the Shaman is still a great class, and I love Shandrillar, but I am truly having alot of fun with the Paladin atm!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">A lot of folks saying they wouldn't want to play a shaman again are saying so because of all the hellish flagging, AA grinding, and obtaining of no drop gear.  If you had to restart at any class you'd face that.<br />
<br />
If I had to restart I would likely make another shaman.  There are some things I could do differently.  I'm also not as far along as many here in regards to the flagging hell, gear, or AA, so it probably wouldn't be as traumatic to redo what I've already done.<br />
<br />
I very much enjoy my shaman and feel more empowered all the time.  I have 7 alts and find several other classes enjoyable but I rarely have time for my alts because there is almost always something I'd rather do as a shaman.  Usually when I play an alt I find myself...missing my canni hotkey...I need help!<br />
<br />
I also agree with Litgruv in that if you don't enjoy the class then don't play it.  EQ is a game and is supposed to be fun. Who cares about flags, access, gear, and AA - if you're not having fun do something else (play another class).</div></div><hr />
