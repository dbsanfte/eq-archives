<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am thinking about buying a new system. I know very little about computers so I am asking for some advice if you think this would be a good computer to run EQ and the upcoming SoL expansion.<br />
<br />
Base System: Intel Pentium 4 processor at 1.80 GHz<br />
Memory: 512MB NONECC SDRAM (2 DIMM)<br />
Hard Drive: 20 GB EIDE 7200 RPM Hard Drive<br />
Monitor: 19&quot; Grey Dell M991 (18.0 vis)<br />
Video: 32 MB ATI Radeon w/VGA Cable<br />
Sound Card: Soundblaster Live! Value 512V<br />
Primary ROM Drive: DVD-CDRW Combo<br />
<br />
I can get a very good deal on this. Any advice and/or help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That system &quot;should&quot; work.<br />
<br />
The ATI Radeon cards are new I think and I also heard the SoL grafics are tuned for Nvidia Gforce boards using Dx8.<br />
<br />
the g2 cards are less than 100pp the g3 cards are still 350 or so.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are also some issues with soundblaster live and EQ but not sure which models.<br />
<br />
You should avoid windows 2000 and the soon released windowXP operating systems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mishlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killer,<br />
<br />
It looks like a nice system. The only thing that you may want to upgrade to later would be the video card but that's just mho. Otherwise processor looks good, ram looks good. HD 20 gig storage will work depending on what else your going to use it for. Just curious what size Cashe this baby has? But over all not bad. You may be able to save yourself some money if you don't want the monitor and just use the one from your old system. But if the old monitor is gone the go for it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That will be an awesome system except for the video card. The Nvidia Geoforce line now is the king by far for the money you spend. The more you pay the faster your graphics. Even the lowest end Nvidia seem to be faster than the Radeon line though. I know the inexpensive Geoforce GTS card I bought is much faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you care at all about dollars, don't go with a Pentium.  The Athlons are cheaper and faster.  <br />
This is what you want for an ultimate and still affordable system:<br />
All prices from www.pricewatch.com from a vendor I used for Hammer's new system.<br />
<br />
Base System: AMD Athlon 1800+ XP with and Asus Motherboard (I'd recommend the Asus A7V266)<br />
<br />
Memory: 512MB NONECC SDRAM (2 DIMM) <br />
For memory you can go top end and get Corsair memory CAS2 or for a bit less cash go with Micron.  You can get 256MB CAS2 Corsair chips for $57 each.<br />
<br />
Hard Drive: 20 GB EIDE 7200 RPM Hard Drive <br />
Dont bother going under 60GB for a HD, you'll only save about 20 bucks.  Western Digital 7200RPM drives are great and have a great warranty.  Just make sure you get the ATA/100 model.<br />
<br />
Monitor: 19&quot; Grey Dell M991 (18.0 vis) Don't go Dell.  Viewsonic is a great monitor and much more affordable.  <br />
<br />
Video: 32 MB ATI Radeon w/VGA Cable <br />
GAH  NOOOO!.    Get yourself a Gefrorce card, that is what the SOL upgrade is being designed for.  Best card is the Geforce 3 Ti500, great power at about $300 US.  Next step down is the standard Geforce 3, for around $225 to $250.  For those wanting to save some cash but have great perfomance go with the Geforce 3 Ti200 @ $180.<br />
<br />
Sound Card: Soundblaster Live! Value 512V <br />
Go with the new Audigy Sound Card from Creative Labs.  The SBLive is old technology and you might as well get the newer card.  Go with the low end Audigy card though for around $60.  You won't need the Midi crap or other hookups with the more expensive versions.<br />
<br />
Primary ROM Drive: DVD-CDRW Combo <br />
There is no DVD and CDRW combo drive that I've ever seen.  If you aren't going to create CD's then go for any DVD drive you like the look of.  There is no real difference to the ones out there that I've seen but don't get a cheapo model, it's not worth the hassle for a few bucks.<br />
<br />
Total for a complete new system that is the best of the best I've been able to put it together for around $1300 US (was $1400 last week) plus shipping.  That is a complete system with Windows XP and all hardware required except a mouse and keyboard,  better you pick that out at a local store with the &quot;feel&quot; that you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am also looking to upgrade my system.  Me personally I would stick with nVidia.  Question I have, would I get more performance going with RDRAM? I am sure I would but by how much and is it worth it or am I better off with SDRAM?</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL, I find myself doing that in RL too Knarlz.  <br />
<br />
I'm in the same boat concerning SOL.  Either I have to buy a new system, or do some major upgrading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For Video card upgrades take a look at the Geforce 3 TI200 models that just came out.  Very powerful, and if you look a the benchmarks not a whole lot less powerful than the standard GF3's.  Prices are really coming down on these and you can get one for under $180.<br />
<br />
It's defintely the card for the dollar prudent people like myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nolani it depends on whether your motherboard supports that memory or not and if it is worth the cost. Right now I would say no. If you have sdram and at least 256mb then that should be fine. Having a fast video card and disk drive system seem to make a huge difference with EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Redtree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">~~ throws 100pp on computer store countertop~~<br />

<br />
Went to call Aseid in RL on nextel and couldn't find the name aseid in list (( sick its just sick))<br />

:D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nolani,  RDRAM is so expensive it's not worth the very minor improvement in performance.  You're much better off spending half of the money it would cost to get RDRAM and get a faster processer and video card.  Then put the rest in your pocket :)<br />
<br />
The company that patented RDRAM is completely screwing people on the costs so thats why even P4 systems now are offering SDRAM memory slots because of the extreme cost that is just not worth it to the average person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">heh, I knew I had typed in pp instead of $ when I wrote it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am glad to hear of the Geforce 3 TI200 , I may give one of those a try. My system is pushing 3 years old now and while it was pretty good then it will be system min for SoL after a vidio upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just wanted to say that you may want to consider having a separate cd-rom drive from dvd/cdrw devices.  I skimmed over your post and I don't think that's the way it's set up.  But, I would have a main cd-rom that is a cd-rom in itself and only a cd-rom because they are MUCH faster.  When you stick any other device with the cd-rom, every time you stick a cd in there it has to switch from totally different modes which slows down everything by a ton.  Just thought I'd mention that.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to say that I do recommend windows 2000.  It is incredibly stable.  And although I have never used Windows XP, I'd recommend it more because its supposed to be Windows 2000 except customized for games, so it should be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">System looks good onlything I would change is the Video Card to one of the GForce3 types:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Windows 2000 and win nt4.0 are more stable -IF- the application was written for that operating system from the ground up.<br />
<br />
EQ was not. It may run but it is not supported by Verent if you have a problem due to the operating system.<br />
<br />
As for winXP, never be the first one on you block to beta test for microsoft ( unless you do those things for fun) Also it is your problem not Verents if you find you need support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Is the burner a DVD burner or a DVD drive+ CD-RW?  I know there are some combo's out there, and some are not too bad speed-wise.<br />
<br />
Other than that, if you are mainly worried about EQ on it, go with a better (GeForce) video card as others have said.  The HD should be fine, but I personally would go with nothing larger than a 40Gig which I have actually found for about the same price as the 20Gig.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I am trying to upgrade from a 400Mhz P2 system with 384M memory with a GeForce card.  Kind of the bottem end for SoL.  For gaming it looks like I should be concerned about Processor speed, amount of memory, Video Card first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I dunno if its an option, but the Radeon's are total junk. I had a 64mb radeon, and a all in wonder radeon. They had some major texturing issues. In eq I got pink squares all over the place, in other games like Quake, the text and crosshairs and other things were badly distorted. Also, they both had the same lockup issues when tryin to use capture or TV. <br />
<br />
Ram prices are pretty much bottomed out now, RDRAM isn't very expensive anymore, about 5 or 10 pp more than DDR. But there isnt much difference in performace and RDRAM has to be in matched pairs now.<br />
<br />
/agree. Lose the P4 and go with an Athlon, theyre cheaper and faster.  The biggest complaint I get at work on P4 systems is that they run so slow.<br />
<br />
Win2k/XP is definitely more stable and all around better than 98 or ME. But, 2k and XP have some issues in EQ with soundblaster live series cards if you use creative drivers. Studders in the ambient sounds and such, but not too annoying, and I think it only happens when you run surround sound.<br />
<br />
Hope thats helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not quite sure where you are looking Nadonius but RDRAM is 2 to 4 times more expensive that SDRAM.<br />
<br />
256 MB SDRAM  $22 to $57 depending on PC1600 to PC2700 speed.<br />
<br />
256 MB RDRAM $84<br />
<br />
And this is the lowest of the low prices on Pricewatch.<br />
<br />
In any case you would have to go Intel P4 for RDRAM, and I wouldn't go that way with the prices and performance of Athlon vs Intel.  There is just no comparison,  and this is coming from a long time Intel fan.  I just can't justify paying twice the cost for a slower system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Grinric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">FYI <br />
<br />
I've been running XP for about a month, and EQ has been running BETTER than when I was running 98 SE.  There are still some bugs with the OS, but what Mickeysoft product doesn't.  I am VERY Impressed so far.  That being said, if you do go to XP, DO NOT buy the home version!  There are many problems and annoyances (this whole verification of CD key thing) but the biggest thing is that XP home will not recognize a windows 2000 network!  Pretty crappy and if you ask me, just plain lasy of the Microsoft to not include backword compatiblity in it's own OSes.<br />
<br />
Just thought you all might like to know =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">If this is a Dell system send me a PM, and I can tell you what's really up with it (Dell tech here heh). This sounds like the 4300 or 8200, but depending on which one it is I might have some better recommendations for you to go with hardware wise (and reliability wise).  As far as OS goes, I have never had a problem running EQ in Windows 2000 or in Windows XP Pro, however I have had multiple problems with it in Me/98.  Now that could be what I do with my computer as I have heard people say ME runs it much better and 2000 screws up with it, but I'd say go with 2000.  Oh, and get the Nvidia, you don't want the ATI cards, they are starting to go down a bit in reliability as well as the NVIDIA cards blow them out of the water. Also, you may want to think about getting seperate dvd and cd-rw drives, one for convenience when trying to copy a cd for someone and the other because, well, they tend to break easier because of the way they have to be built to accomodate two (sometimes three) sets of lasers. Lemme know if its a Dell and I'll get a consensus from the floor what are the best components for the system as far as reliablity and performance and I'll get it back to you. (BTW that goes for anyone that can read this, I'd rather take my time figuring out what is the best setup for you before you buy it then having you bitch me out on the phones afterwards :rolleyes:  )<br />
<br />
<br />
(p.s. Moe, Dell monitors are not made by us, they are either Viewsonic or Sony's, if its described as Trinitron its Sony, if not its Viewsonic)<br />
<br />
someone asked this, don't remember who, the L2 cache on the p4 1.4-2.0 Mhz 256 KB, for the 2.2 Mhz its bumped up to 512 KB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Good to know on the Dell monitor thing.  My company is almost completely Dell in all offices.<br />
<br />
If you do choose to go namebrand, I think you are making a wise decising in going with Dell.  You DO NOT want to go pick something up from Best Buy or Circuit City or wherever.  Service will suck and you will get a piece of crap you have to upgrade within a year like Hammer did (baahaha Sony POS).<br />
Dell tends to have great service both phone and on-site so if you aren't a techie by nature (and with your ATI Video choice orginally I'd say no, hehe), then Dell is a good choice.   Gateway is falling by the wayside.<br />
However if you have a little more cash and want somethinga  bit more stylish with more options to chose from for higher end parts check out www.alienware.com<br />
<br />
You can build a kick ass system in whatever color you want.  Costs a bit more but if style is important, check em out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Falamil Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Have to second Dell for service.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dell is one of only two PC manufacturers I have worked with who not only provide excellent reaction to problems, but proactively send out fixes for problems they uncover. ( The other is IBM, but IBM PC's are expensive, and not as flexible as I would like for configuration of home systems )</div></div><hr />

I currently run an A7A266 MB with a 1.33 T-Bird and it runs great.<br />
Afew things to note about AMD and A7A they run alittle warmer than some other combos but its nothing to worry about. <br />
<br />
The Hard Drive personaly I would go with an IBM Hard drive they are the best I have delt with to this day.<br />
<br />
Vid card Don't go with a GF3 with that MB for some reason they conflict some times. You can get a GF2gts and run great.<br />

Ram go with the DDR Ram its only a few dolars more than Sdram and the improvemnt is worth the extra bucks.<br />

(and to think this is a mid range model /shrug)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Nolani Silvermoonbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">So what does a mid range goes for?  Oh and whose HDD does Dell typically use?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Mid range pc's, ie the one above can go for 1G's to 3G's depending on how you configure them.  Honestly you could make one on your own cheaper than you could buy one, but you're paying for the support and the ease buying it from big pc companies. There are lower end systems that you can get for 699$ or so, but you get what you pay for there. The higher end systems start at 2Gs and very quickly shoot up in price.   Laptops start around 999 and can go 4-5g<br />
<br />
The hard drives we use are one of four (unfortunatley I can't tell which one will be on the system above till its ordered).  For desktops we use Quantum, Western Digital, Maxtor, and IBM.  Most of what we ship out are WD and Maxtor.  I &quot;think&quot; you should be able to specify what type of drive you want brand wise, but as I am in tech support and not sales I'm not too sure how viable that option is. With the laptops however its IBM, Fujitsu, or Hitachi, mostly IBM.<br />
<br />
Again, anyone wants recommendations on DELL systems ( I can't claim to know jack about other systems ) lemme know, gives me something to pass the time with while talking with these idiots, err uhh customers :P .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Hmm Dell. Well my company ADP has been using Dell for the last 5 years. We just switched back to IBM. The good thing about Dell is that they usually work. Very little issues with hardware. BUT when they break or you receive a bad one, I have found Dell's service to be awful. And this is with having a Corporate nation wide contract, and with Dell just up the road from us. So without going into details, we switched, and not due to price.<br />
<br />
Buying a pc from a chain retail store or mail order is certainly up to the comfort level of the buyer. There are many good articles on the internet at PC Magazine and Computer Shopper that can help with that. I had a company pc purchase plan done through Best Buy one year, and CompUSA another year. CompUSA was much better to deal with and service. However the service level really depends on the local Management. Now as for me, I always build my own systems and found a great parts place locally. So I deal with them.<br />
<br />
As to prices, it is a buyers market. Any pc you buy these days will be more than adequate for any game in the next several years. Go with what you can afford. You don't need the wildest fastest chip made. You can save hundreds of dollars going with a chip a few speeds slower that has been on the market for 6 months. I am using an AMD Duron 800 which runs the game quite fast. My motherboard will accept up to a 1.2 Athalon so if I need to go higher in a year or so I can. For EQ get the best Nvidia card you can afford though. :)</div></div><hr />

Although the price difference in Athlon vs. Intel is a good deal different, this Intel system will eat up an Athlon system of even speed because of the bus speeds the chipset technology and some other things.  The motherboard in this system was based of one of the boards in our workstations, ie it flies.<br />

Video card options are limited too unfortunately to three NVIDIA choices, the 32MB Geforce 2 MX, 64 MB G3 Ti200, 64MB G3 Ultra.<br />
Put the 32MB on there as the low ball card, Killer is prolly gonna upgrade to whatever you all suggest as the best, I jsut know all of these cards are very VERY good performers and very reliable.<br />

Only piece of hardware in a Dell system that is proprietary (cept for the case hehe) is the motherboard because its not available publicly and the way they have specific design parameters.  Everything else in the system is fully and easily upgradable.  Just to give an example of how easy it is to upgrade parts in this 4300 for those computer buffs out there....only one of the components that are screwed in is the power supply, the rest are all mounted securely by clips. Cover comes off by a push of a button, hard drive has a pull tab on the IDE cable to disconnect it from the hard drive and has a clip you squeeze to get it out of the rack.  Dell designed the systems like this mainly because of what we (techs) have to do over the phone.  I personally walked a 87 year old lady through replacing her MOTHERBOARD over the phone......</div></div><hr />
