<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just turned 24...for the third time. Unfourtantly, I un-dinged, re-dinged, undinged, then finally dinged again. Can someone please tell me a place that has decent loot and good exp that I can solo hunt at 24 up? I'm kinda stumped right now. I've heard LOIO, and right now my character is camped at a dock going there. I know this should be on the 20-30 forums, but they seem dead, so I'm posting here. Any advice on where to hunt and on how to use my new spells would be great. Thanks in advance. - Exodus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Here are some suggestions, I'm not real keen on Luclin but, here goes. I hunted in LOIO from 21-29, exp wasn't too bad. Warslik Woods giant fort is another place you can hunt until about 28. I hear Paludal Caverns in Luclin is great exp up to 29-30. Not sure about any places in the &quot;old World&quot; as I've spent most of my time in Kunark or Velious. <br />
Lake is a great place to solo or group the choice is yours. Sarnak fort was fun grouping for me at 24, when I got regen and cannibalize. You should group for a little while to gain enough exp, in case you get whacked you won't lose your level. Then solo to max your skills Defense, Offense, Piercing, etc, etc, etc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Paludal Caverns...you can solo shrooms and Fiends..or group at one of the Bandit camps. When ya hit 26 or 27 Go to Echo Caverns and solo Needlites..these should take you to 32 or so<br />
