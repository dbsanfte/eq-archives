<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was bored at work so I started reading about game lore and saw that gnomes could be clerics. I never knew gnomes could be clerics.  Started this discussion with my current guild and the people that responded had never seen a gnome cleric.  My question/quest is to find out if anyone has ever met a gnome cleric in the game (really gonna feel bad if there is one in the guild). Just an oddity that I wanted to find out about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I saw a gnome cleric a few days ago, and commented that I had never seen one before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gnome Clerics are probably the rarest of the clerics, I've only seen a few over my life.<br />
They are out there, but for some reason are not though of as the norm or even a cool alt race for a cleric.  Stats aren't as bad as humans so I wonder why.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ssauron Scalebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My RL Fiance plays a 30th Gnome Cleric named Weezee, although neither of us have been on lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vhela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My sister plays a Gnome Cleric. Her last name is MiniMednbuffer :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Svartmagi is a gnome cleric that used to be a Keeper before joining Vahall, but on the whole, they are rare.<br />
<br />
Another rare one is an Erudite Cleric..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Smallheal is my gnome cleric, he is lev 28. With twinkage, you can get to 200 wis fairly easily. I might play him again at a later date. For now, playing a cleric just isnt fun for me. I need to be hitting stuff to be happy playing EQ. I did like the rareity of being one of the few gnome clerics out there, and a person that like playing a healer. I would seriously recommend a GNOME!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Guaze is a gnome cleric, 30ish. Gah, I can't remember who's alt he is though.<br />

<br />
This is NOT optional. <br />

This is required of ALL gnomes, regardless of class/level/age.<br />

The bigger they are, the harder they fall. :)</div></div><hr />

Also,<br />

The smaller they are, the less mess they make when squished.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Eliyra Darkangel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've met a few gnome clerics throughout my EQ life, but they are quite rare.  I think part of the reason they are so rare is that they have the lowest base WIS of any of the races that can be clerics, at 77.  Even inky clerics, who don't fall into the category of best race to be a cleric, start off with a base WIS of 93.  Of course we all know how easy it is really to up stats with the right armor...but I guess it's just the psychological mindset...why start a gnome cleric with a base WIS of 77 when you can start a high elf cleric with a base WIS of 105 or dorf with 100.  Gnome clerics just have a bad rep...some people think they have a harder time upping their AC/hit points than other races.  Personally I think we should ALL be gnomes...<br />
