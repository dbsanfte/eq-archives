Damn you for posting useful information! Damn you for taking the time out of your day to provide ingrateful schmucks with information that makes their e-peens both inflate and throb with DPS-happiness! And then HOW DARE YOU allow them to go limp, by bringing upon this house of spirits and spells a fiery shame like the rash I got my from my ex-girlfriend that keeps itching, no matter how much of that antiseptic cream the doctor gave me I apply!<br />
OK OK I know posts like this dont belong in the Medicine Cabinet, but come on, there has GOT to be a &quot;Hall of Fame&quot; somewhere for posts like this.</div></div><hr />
