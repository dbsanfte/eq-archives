<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if there's any compelling reason to keep VS faction now with the new home porting pottery crafted items. I used to goto OT all the time to bank, but now I'll just use one of these unlimited gate orbs. Will sure be nice to be able to hunt in Karnors etc. now, soloing there last night was a blast... and hunting for rings in TT was my main reason for losing the VS faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I still like the option of having a free port to Kunark. Eventually I'll probably let it go though. It's becoming a bit of a hassle for me since Howling stones is a very nice exp zone and no one goes there. Also, I still need to hunt in karnors for my canni 2 spell. <br />

Even if you do become kos, you can just root the skeletons that agro, invis yourself and run out.</div></div><hr />

Thats why you bind in the Nexus/Bazaar.  Max wait of 15 mins for a port to any continent.  For Ogres/Trolls they can port quickly to hunt in Cazic/Guk and are a very short run to ECmart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>TweadleDimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bind in the firepot room in TD .<br />
<br />
On this note I have been worried about my turn in spells,so i havent totally ruined my VS faction yet.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it? or can the spells be obtained otherwise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Almost forgot about the trade in spells.. that's the best reason not to mess VS faction I've seen so far. Make sure you get those spells first ;). Whack a port to OT still rocks, but now you could just invis after zoning in if you're high enough to use the hammer the skele's there should be green atleast. Haven't tried out howling stones with any char yet, will be nice to see if it's the exp gold mine everyone seems to make it out to be (can only hope it is :)).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For gating/binding Shaman maybe but for Troll Warriors it's still a must. The best I've seen was my Warrior buddy proccing the hammer on Vox and escaping a poorly run raid during a wipe. That's the truth too, I can give names.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For clerics, their port stones drop them off right at their guild, a few steps from a friendly vendor.<br />
<br />
For shamans, their port stones drop them off at the same godawful place that the potions do cos VI's too lazy to stick in a new spell. Translation: it's a bit of a run for most shamans to get to that 'convenient' vendor for selling. Especially barbarians.<br />
<br />
I'd keep the hammer. :P</div></div><hr />
