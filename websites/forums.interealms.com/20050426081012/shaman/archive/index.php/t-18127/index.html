<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Saruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I thought I would try here first for advice.. I am currently 2 boxing (on one box) my 44 Shaman and 52 Ranger. I tried The first Dulak boat - Stormwave. <br />
<br />
I chose as my pull spot the crates on deck just right of the ramp as you board ship. The first aggroed as invis dropped, then I used the ranger to snare-pull the next 3 one by one. As the last was 50% I got an add from somewhere and both toons dropped like flies.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any advice on good single-pull spots please? Do people camp on board or pull to the jetty? I saw 2 static spawns by the ramp, but the mid-section of the jetty seemed clear. Are there any roamers around on deck or the jetty?<br />
<br />
I will keep trying here till I get tactics nailed down as this seems the ideal place for me atm. Any advice you guys can give before I have any more deaths would be greatly appreciated...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Use the ranger to harmony pull (if you weren't); this alone will get you single pulls.  Beyond that, I would suggest NOT camping the boats at your level.  There are many, many MOBs throughout the zone that you can kill without messing with the shoddy pathing, and potential adds, of the boats.<br />
<br />
I've spent a lot of time in dulak, and the boats are the worst possible place to get experience in the whole zone.  However, thats just my opinion of the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Saruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, thanks for the tips about the boats (and harmony, I forget I have that, not used it since it got nerfed). <br />
<br />
Where else would you suggest as good camp spots where I can fight without having to worry about wandering adds? I did the crates by the large barn when I camped for Stoicism and that seemed ok, if a little tight on the path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On stormwave if you go up the ramp on the boat and not to far onto the boat, that's almost always a safe pull spot.  <br />
<br />
If you get a runner though, it'll go right down the ramp and aggro the stuff on the docks.  <br />
<br />
On the dandolak the safe spot is approximately the same place but there might be a spawn on the crates to your left as you come up the ramp.  You need to time that one so he doesn't pop when you are fighting and surprise ya.<br />
<br />
There's also a safe spot on the lady di boat.  I dont' recall where it is offhand though.  <br />
<br />
On oceancrasher I haven't found a safespot yet. We took a group to that boat with a babysitter to get someone to planar level and my enchanter was kept extremely busy mezzing adds :-)  Of course, she was only about level 50 at the time, so level definitely affected aggro radius.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the top of the ramp, dont go any farther into the boat then the catapults. park it between the catapults if you are still having issues.<br />
<br />
All the pirates run, you have to root or snare all of them when they get low on health.<br />

Lady di is up the ramp and directly to the left by the crates.<br />

<br />
<br />
I have tried multiple occasions to get a safe spot by going up the ramp and going left between the 2 closest mobs and have been unsuccessful. Someone mentioned that on the other side of the boat on the lower deck is a safe spot, but its not very big.<br />
<br />
You can single pull all the boats except windscorn without too much difficulty. Just eyeball it and pull the closest one with a slow. I started doing stormwave at level 49.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kagn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What I did on my mage was simply keep moving. I would pull the one nearest the boarding ramp and kill him. than go up to the back of the boat. <br />
<br />
Method was pull mob x and kill. Move to mob x's spawn point, pull mob y. Move to mob y's spawn point and just start a cycle. On the first boat I could keep the entire boat cleared at lvl 51 on my mage. Not sure how well a Shaman could do the same but, I suspect they would easily reproduce the results. Actually if from what I'm seeing already with my shaman you could easily do it.<br />
<br />
I know mage tower has a wonderful write up about the entire zone. Dulak's Harbor (http://forum.magecompendium.com/tower/viewtopic.php?t=3924) Some of the pictures are gone. But the text is still worth the reading for anyone wanting to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Saruddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks all for the helpful advice. I went back and did the zone entrance solo with the shaman, was quite good for an hour. I'll try again with the ranger duo and see how quickly I get on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fyrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 54 my mage and BST had no problem pulling singles.<br />
<br />
That may be the level to do them at.  I just sat right on the deck as soon as you walk up the plank to the boat.  No wanderers and they always flee down the dock so as long as you keep the fisherman/engineers clear there you will get no adds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was not too much of a fan of the boats, they were almost always camped and the drop rates have been hit by the nerf bat pretty hard. Here were some of my favorite spots. <br />
My first favorite spot was in the armory, I am unsure wether or not that is the &quot;official&quot; name, but that's what I called it is at about -500,500 I start at the very end then pull in a circle from left to right or right to left. There is only one, maybe two gaurds that follow a path back and forth, most of them are far enough apart they can be singled easily togorian mines zone in is close by too.. good safe place to med without worrying too much about trains.<br />
My 2nd favorite place was at about -1500,0 behind the little hut. Two static spawns in front of the hut, a few mobs inside of the hut I believe I would get adds on ocation when I would open the door then I would pull mobs from various other locations. As long as you would snare/root in time no worries really of getting adds. I would get the rust encrusted wrist item  from the ocean crasher mobs by the doc there.<br />
To break the monotany I would camp at about -500,-500 right in front of the hungry shark there is a spot outside to the side by the porch thing I would pull mobs there and as long as they stayed there the patrolling gaurds never cared.<br />
At all three locations there is a small chance of getting a named( I emphasize small), if by some chance you get the named good chance it's not going to be worth much of anything... random gem drops are decent though even with the nerf bat.<br />
If you like them good.. if not sorry. I never saw what the big deal about the boats were.. but oh well I guess.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
I forgot to add this map, I'm sure you knew about it but if not here it is.<br />
