<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Relgen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We were at KC tonight and no VSR or VS on track at all.  :(<br />
My walkthrough dosent say anything about this happening.  How often does VSR spawn and do we have to kill VS first?  Only this and the hole till swifty.  Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It happens most of the time. <br />
<br />
VS is on a long spawn cycle, and after someone takes him out VSR will spawn about 24 hours later. VSR is rarely up for very long, though he's up for much longer now since there aren't as many folks hanging around KC as there used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Calex Silverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Killed VS friday then killed VSR saterday to get my epic piece saw VSR despawn 4 times this last week on the tribunal he stays up for about 3 to 4hrs before despawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">VSR despawning that quickly is new to me.  My necro practically lives in KC (charm-soloing is a blast), and I've seen VSR up for quite a while at a stretch.  VS spawns about once every 7 days or so.  There's the chance that someone may have killed VSR, thinking he was a named mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Myrdale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah i dont think he despawns but i dont know for sure. Our problem was we never had enough folks on when he was up. Only takes 3 good balanced groups to do him. Just hunt there alot and keep checking track. What i finally did was me and another Ranger talked half the zone into helping us kill the guy. Was real fun and had a good turn out and the both of us gat our stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the real VS is a 3 day spawn, but will never despawn once up (but server/zone reset will despawn him).<br />
<br />
VSR will spawn anywhere from 0 to 24 hours after real VS is killed.<br />
<br />
Once VSR is killed/triggered/use(whatever you want to call it), the next VSR will spawn 23 to 25 hours later.<br />
<br />
At the 3 day time mark (give or take a few hours), real VS will spawn, which will cause VSR to despawn if it is up. (real VS takes priority over VSR and his triggered counterparts)<br />
<br />
I have never heard of VSR despawning on his own after just a few hours, but it might have been changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Calex Silverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well friday when killed VS we had raid for VSR after he poped while waiting for everyone to be full of mana he despawned right in front of me while i was about to do my turnins and the real VS spawnd when I got my epic piece Saterday we killed him with 1 grp and myself 7 peaple total the real VS took 3grps plus we had to camp out after first attempt killed him the second time he life tapped me for 1600pts twice in a row and killed me VSR was alot easier.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wrippler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a few arrears that im still unsure about .<br />
#1 In the walkthrough it says that you have a fireglobe ready to hand in to VSR.Does the VSR despawn when this happens?<br />
This triggers vs spirit to spawn ,and you hand in the reserection spell which triggers the lesser VS to spawn.Does the Vs spirit despawn ? Or are the triggered spawns killed ?<br />
Also ,after a vsr turn in that is successful ,does the vsr continue to spawn on the 24 hour cycle or do we have to wait the for the VS to respawn .<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">VSR is non-agro...<br />
give firefly globe to VSR, this will despawn VSR and Spirit of VS will spawn where you did the turn in.<br />
<br />
Spirit of VS is non-agro...<br />
give resurections spell scroll to Spirit of VS, this will despawn Spirit and VS-lite will spawn where you did the turn in.<br />
<br />
VS-lite is agro and will probably agro on the person doing the turn in unless someone agroes him immediately.<br />
<br />
After VSR is eliminated (i.e. despawned), the next VSR will spawn 22 - 25 hours later as long as the real VS has not respawned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My guild killed VS and I went to KC about 8 hours later and VSR was up.  And now I have Swiftwind woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grats, Bene!  :)<br />
<br />
I still have to kill VSR to get Swiftwind again.. I had him on track a few days ago in KC and another guild engaged him before my guild could dispatch a few people to help me.. oh well, not like he won't spawn again.</div></div><hr />
