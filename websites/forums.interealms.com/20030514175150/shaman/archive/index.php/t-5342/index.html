<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>keelowbigbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having read many of the epic walkthroughs, I cannot find anything that says what to do with the Broken Arrow Abe gives you during the test of patience. Maybe I keep missing that part, but I do not see anything mentioned about it after he gives it to you. I have completed the 6 scrolls part of the quest from CoM and no one has requested it yet. <br />
<br />
Thanks for any help,<br />
Keelow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brelkeryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is no use for the broken arrow in the remainder of your epic.<br />
<br />
Just bank it.  :)<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>keelowbigbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you for the reply, but it leaves me with a vouple questions.<br />
<br />
Was there something I was supposed to do with it?  <br />
<br />
If there is no need for it in my epic anymore, why would I need to bank it instead of destroy it?<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
Keelow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just in case. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>keelowbigbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, good point.<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I destroyd mine. Not worth the bank spot to hold i guess. If i eventually need it ill just go get anouther.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Maybe the broken arrow has something to do with Code Alpha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fyful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">whatever it is.  it will have something to do with Odus and the reason that the Hole is the Hole.  Cause if you remember talking to all those retarded NPC's down there, all of them were recalling the EVENT that caused the Hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I use my arrow to play fetch with my monk pet.  He loves it!  And when he's bad I beat him with it.  It's handy, so keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Be nice if you could give arrow to your pet or hold it when casting or SOMETHING and summon truesprit dogdog or some junk and have something bigger :)  Shammie focus item be nice ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I kept my arrow for about a year, finally destroyed it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still have mine, have had it banked for almost 2 years. I keep hoping that VI comes up with something cool to do with it, I/E the rumored epic upgrades or something. How much suck would it be for those that destroyed theirs to have to do that crappy test of patience again lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hate the test of Patience. I had to do it 3 times because the greater spirit wasn't in the right spot. Finally had a druid friend track the damn thing for me.<br />
<br />
I will probably never destroy that damn arrow because I never ever ever want to do that quest again.<br />
<br />
Not done with my epic anyway - I am Neh &amp; Rak close to it though (got tear and ring). I don't want to mess something up that's checking for my &quot;arrowness&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Test of Patience would be so easy at level 65 :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The test was easy at lv 44 when I did it, why keep the arrow when u can go back and do it in 40 mins?</div></div><hr />

Ok, lets look at it this way then.<br />
<br />
Loading... please wait.<br />
<br />
/who<br />
<br />
There are 163 shamen in Euridins Crossing.<br />
<br />
/shout Camp check?<br />
<br />
shaman 1 shouts, 'Test of Patience'<br />
shaman 2 shouts, 'Shaman epic'<br />
shaman 3 shouts, 'Patience test'<br />
shaman 4 shouts, 'Abe'<br />
<br />
etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
Especially with how easy it is for some shaman waiting behind you to flub up the test.  (a shaman killed the first drowned guy on accident while sitting down there with me my first time and it screwed the whole thing)<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to think about how easy the test would be if they added the use of the broken arrow.<br />
<br />
Good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well it *is* the test of patience. I have kept mine, being patient for the time that verant decides to make it useful. hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Konarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A Broken Arrow is a symbolic token of peace.<br />
<br />
I always wondered if giving it and Tear to Rak would allow you to get epic scale without fighting him.<br />
<br />
I didn't have the nerve though when the time came to test this theory so we just Killed Rak like normal.<br />
<br />
Konarg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Judanu Spiritsong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">IMO... the arrow is nothing but a trick to get you to leave the camp.<br />
<br />
When you get the arrow from Abe, and he just sits there, I think is is trying to see if you are patient enough, or if you go skipping off, happy as a clam with a broken arrow that is for all intensive purposes, useless.<br />
<br />
The arrow is a trick to weed out those who are not truly &quot;patient&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When the Spirit depops it mentions the arrow can't remember what exactly he says but he does say something about the arrow which suggests a perpose to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sanctum Keeper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">And because its quite boring to do :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">As I recall, they said we would know what to do with it when the time comes.   That was all.   With epic2 out now, I would try handing the arrow to every NPC in the area as well as our epic.   One of them may get a response.<br />
<br />
<br />
  of  course, no bear, Halfer, or skelle form while you try this, and ditch the horse just in case too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I still think the arrow is a hoax though.</div></div><hr />
