<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Innate enlightenment: Is it worth it? My mana pool is on the shallow side, from some deficient gear admittedly. Is this a worthwhile place to put aa's for the +mana benefeit?<br />
<br />
Here's my Magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=418549<br />
<br />
I'm NOT much of an exp grinder. I'm only on 4-5 hrs a weeks in addition to raiding. Maybe half that time is spent exp'ing.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you would probably gain 300-400 mana from it. Test it using magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh I never really thought about this one but the 5 innate enlightenment will net me 325 mana (6212 -&gt; 6537) according to magelo ... now I have to put off Crit dots yet again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Innate Enlightenment was never high on my list of priorities. I knocked out probably 280 AA before I ended up getting it, and I haven't regretted getting it. Looking back, I'm not sure I would have gotten it any sooner, though. There were other AA I felt like were more important (like ND3, Healing AA, avoidance/mitigation AA, etc. etc.). But still, good AA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm at 370aa &amp; climbing, still don't have IE, still don't care.  I only got Planar Power for the +sta.  Way I look at it, my mana pool gets 1k deeper every 3min.  I don't need more mana, I need my spells to be better.  Tanking, Healing &amp; crit dots are all way way ahead of IE.  No jokes, I'll be getting Advanced Pet Control before IE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got IE fairly early on for a shaman i'd assume. Got it at around 150aa's or so if memory serves but that was when pop was out so we didn't have as many options and I was doing lots of tradeskills and wanted the higher cap for skill ups. The extra mana never hurts but I so rarely find myself going oom that I'd have to say it really doesn't matter. Done with my tradeskills and haven't bothered to get the OoW upgrade to it yet and don't really have any plans for it.<br />
<br />
Do you regularly go from FM to OOM while constantly casting with out a chance to med/cann other than buffing? IE would let you go a little longer with out going oom. If not why bother?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IE would do that, in a way. But Spiritual Channelling would do it much better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i am a few AA from 600... i put 2 levels worth of AA into IE...i wish i could have those AA back so i could put them into something more usefull... IE is a low priority imo, especially with spiritual channeling out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks all. Pretty much confirmed my idea that a 330 wis lvl 70 shaman works just fine.<br />
<br />
As an aside.. yes, I can actually run myself out of mana. Chain pulling in pof, mpg, &amp; rss can be rough sometimes.. &amp; I do mean CHAIN pulling. Of course no self-respecting shaman ever says /g OOM! so I just hold off on the rains for a few rounds &amp; i'm back in the saddle :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">IE is sooooo far down on my list of necessities it's sad how little I want this.<br />
<br />
I just did a log of a 22 minute fight in Qvic today.<br />
I cast 81 heals, 1 group sta, 4 nihil, 2 champions, 1 cripple, 5 heal over time, and 1 malos in that time.<br />
For 10 solid minutes of the fight, I was casting 1 heal/heal over time every 6 seconds.<br />
In total I ended up spending the equivalent of 45198 mana on the heals alone not counting mana preservation.<br />
Spiritual Channelling is da shiznit.<br />
<br />
A 300 point boost to mana pool is nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or you just pop spiritual channeling and start casting MORE rains while medding up =0</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">what taraddar said :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I did it at about 380AAs I think it was.  I was some 50 points over the cap so I figured WTH and besides AAs come so fast these days I dont think it matters.  But yea there are a lot of better ones to get first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Especially w/ OoW stuff. Off the top of my head:<br />
<br />
25 each for LR6-10, ID6-10, buffslots and ft cap. <br />
<br />
18 each for Healing Adept &amp; Mastery, Resplendent Cure, Dot crits.<br />
<br />
15 for Ancestral Aid<br />
<br />
12 Spiritual Channelling<br />
<br />
9 Call of the Wild<br />
<br />
-- that's 208, just from OoW, that are all immensely more useful than IE.  Those are just the high-functioning ones, too.  The OoW stat-cap one would be another 25, better than IE, and the resist cap one.  Crit nukes, crit HoT ticks, and all kinda stuff could make the list, too.</div></div><hr />
