<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe this is the wrong place for this thread, but here it is.  My guild is in desperate need of some clerics so I started one up on my 2nd account.  He's now 23 and damn is it slow going.  Just moved him to Mistmoore ( I always loved that place, its where I grew up in the 20's).<br />
My tactics are:  DS potions, but these get expensive after a while so I use them less and less.  Pull mob, cleric nukes no more than twice using smite (no more than 2 casts to avoid medding as much as possible) and melees down til the mob is &lt;49%, send in pet, rinse, repeat.<br />
Seems like a sound tactic, but the cleric is HORRIBLE at meleeing.  Any suggestions for zones and tactics will be appreciated.  I'm leveling this guy just to have around to facilitate CRs and maybe 2 box when we really need a cleric and can't scare one up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unless there is any item that summons a pet, my suggetsion would be to  pl him with any melee. Find a melee close by grab him say hey you want to be pl'd? Most will say yes. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wuld have to concur on what Bigbad said...You will get way more exp faster with a duo partner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats exactly what I was thinking after I posted, thanks alot for he replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ospri</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did my cleric P'Ling a long time ago, but if I recall correctly their level 34 Atone spell is a hate-wipe; I used to beat mobs to within an inch of their life with one character, toss a couple Atones on it (for those rare occasions that the first wasn't enough), and then nuke once (hopefully) with the cleric.  Dunno if they've changed anything on the way that works, I haven't used that method in forever...toughest part was the early 30s before getting Atone :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cleric is the perfect toon to pwrlvl with a druid if you have access to one. At 23 head to Unrest, wolf form, regen, Nature hp buff, ds, str and head to house. Pull and you will get adds. Use the AE nuke (not sure if that is 24 or higher for first level of AE spell.)<br />
<br />
You can go thru to 34 working Unrest and go thru fast. Melee skills will max as will offense/defense. Casting skills will lag so you will spend some time working those back up in PoK.<br />
<br />
Afterwards head to Sol A, rinse repeat tactic (without wolf form of course, indoor dungeon.) Camp King room for cleric epic drop.<br />
<br />
After this head to Qeynos Catacombs at 36 or so and do the 4 spectre spawn. Can pull single using pacify. This will take you to 42-44 (gets slow 43ish.) Other option is Gunthak beach killing undead from 36-44. Same tactic, pull groups and let ds kill them and you pop a couple AE nukes.<br />
<br />
If you don't have access to a druid, DS potions can substitute though the cost would be lots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are 65 THE best way to powerlevel a cleric to the 50's is the same way a druid would, except you use damage shield potions.  <br />
<br />
Drink potion, aggro as many mobs as you can heal yourself through and let them beat themselves to death.  Before they die and after they are sufficiently pissed at you, take the cleric in the middle of the pack and cast his lowest level PBAoE nuke.  He will get the exp for all kills.  It works like a champ up through 50ish.  GuK worked great for it through the 40's for my cleric.  Beyond Guk it becomes obsolete as the mobs start to hit too hard to pull a big enough number to make it worthwhile.<br />
The potions really are not that expensive (30pp a dose?) and if you actually loot the mobs you will probably break even. At 65 they last a good while. 15 minutes or so.<br />
<br />
Past 55, I am stumped myself as to a PLing method.  I usually just solo and let the cleric watch.  Any suggestions would be great as it is very slow grouped with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am trying to level my 52 cleric to 62 right now and I am stumped as well. I have just been 2 box/grouping with her while I solo stuff, all she has been doing is healing my canns. Been doing this in Katta.. she is getting about 1/2 % exp per kill and I can kill fast.. if someone knows a better way would love to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Find a Druid and save yourself ALOT of time.  1-40 in 16 hours, just don't forget to work your casting skills...it goes by fast :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Try velks post 50, I say that alot I am sure, but my monk plowed through 3-4 lvls pretty quick it slows down pretty noticably at around 56 but still decent, after that if you could get your toon in a tier2 group best exp there post 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep,<br />
<br />
Clerics BIGGEST strength is PBAE ...<br />
<br />
Got my 2nd account Cleric to 39 in 16 hours played by using the following ....<br />
<br />
Shammy DS potion + regen + FT15, pull as many mobs as you can find in Mistrmore with Malosi (low mana cost) .... pull from Front yard, Grave yard and Pit .... let them eat selves on DS, Cleric load up the best 2 PBAEs for level .... Cleric Fire off PBAE1 then PBAE2 .... Shammy Heal Cleric for Aggro .... <br />
<br />
Very fast XP rate ....<br />
<br />
At about Cleric level 40, you can move the same tactics to Karnors Castle or Chardok or HS or Velks or The Hole or SSra temple or Inner Acrylia or well, ya get the picture ...... you are looking for relatively low HP mobs that don't hit ya shammy that hard and are relatively non resistant to magic (cleric PBAE) ...  <br />
<br />
Hehe, 5 of my 16 hours were chain casting heals on self for Alteration skill raises !!!!<br />
<br />
PS. You can get all the way to 65 with this tactic, just gotta pick ya zone and modify tactics accordingly .... DS Cleric and Shammy, have cleric heal shammy, then Shammy heal cleric for aggro switching ... at this level, start pulling with slow ;)<br />
<br />

This was stated above.  Works VERY well in Gunthak on the beach  unreal what you can do with this kind of PL =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I dunno, I have tried the DS method in places that could get him past 60 like the Deep etc, but the problem is not that the mobs kill me or the cleric, but that they have too many hps.  The DS takes so long to kill them that it is often faster to just solo one at a time, especially if they are slowed.  Perhaps I will try again with some of 7ek's tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've done the pl with a druid thing and its awesome. Got my cleric to 30 in 12 hours and spent 3-4 of those buying gear, learning spells etc etc. Sol A is awesome, if ya let one run its almost like having a couple of pullers. I was 4 boxing when i did it and actually had my ranger doing heals on the cleric and getting all the agro and then let the cleric ae em. When I needed a break ranger would snare and kill the runner. Shammy was there to heal ranger when I got hue trains and to buff cleric, and of course I had my druid along to ds and buff as well.</div></div><hr />
