<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was looking at pet suspension, and I have a question.  It says that you can summon a new pet while your old pet is suspended.  And level 2 of it says your pet will save buffs and weapons as well.  If you are xping with dogdog, os perhaps this spell worth it to have a &quot;pocket dog&quot;?<br />
<br />
For example, to start out my xping, I summon an alpha dog, suspended him, then summon another alpha dog.  If something goes haywire and dogdog dies (like I have to, heaven forbid, root the mob or an add, and dogdog has to tank in teh face) so I can instantly pop out dogdog2 the revenge?  Kinda like chain castng pets, but there's only 2 (though maybe you could chain cast pets with this, do they regen when you suspend then?)<br />
<br />
Anyone else see what I'm saying about it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Suspended pets dissapear when you zone (at least with necro pets), that's the only drawback. As long as you don't zone, having a suspended pet around doesn't hurt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's not instant. Suspend Minion has a 4 or 5 second cast time, so if pet dies, you will need at least that long to get the suspended pet out.<br />
<br />
I have level 2, which I use to keep a buffed pet while I invis to other parts of a zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep, thats the biggest use of it imho, being able to invis without poofing a buffed/equiped dogdog =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm wondering, would it help with keeping a pet if you go LD. Does anyone know if it follows the same 1/2hr rule as other summoned items?<br />
