<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really like this AA, don't get me wrong, but it needs a tweak.  Our hybrid clearly has a superior version of this AA, which is nice for them and everybody who groups with them.  No gripes here.<br />
<br />
But in addition to the 400hp/tick and endurance regen on Ancestral Aid right now, I really think it should allow for our melee friends to rain down critical hits.  Not sure what each level of Cleave adds, but if suddenly, the melee in my group start seeing a good portion of their swings become criticals when I pop this, it would not only be handy and practical as a means to finally group heal, but it would also add some measure of additional damage.  It wouldn't have to be overwhelming, but if I raised the dps of my group by a bit with this AA, while at the same time tossing them a small heal over time, that to me, would make it a beefy AA.  And unless you're a vegan, who doesn't like beefy?<br />
<br />
Beastlords regen health and mana, while we regen health and amplify melee dps.  I'd choose criticals over ferocity or strikethrough and the like, simply because it's eyecandy.  Regardless, the melee see their dps increased, but now you get to hear the oohs and ahhs of everybody in the group.  Everybody wins.<br />
<br />
Just a late night idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like it.  Maybe an overhaste component or strikethrough if they can't see fit (or see how) to add crits?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wow, thats a awesome image.<br />
<br />
We click a AA and suddenly everyone int he group glows and the melee start spamig the chat windows with crits. Its perfect, its got the shazam, its fun and would effectivly add DPS to the group which is the thing that the BST hold over us like a albrotross.<br />
<br />
Nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cool idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Now that would be the kind of ability that would be fun to have. <br />
<br />
I could just see the melees now begging shaman to help them go nuts so they can try for all time high dps logs :P<br />
<br />
In any event the ability is great as is but adding something like this would just be so much more fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">as long as they kept the endurance regen aspect of it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ghwerig-AO</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I could care less about the endurance regen component.  I have never once heard any melee complain about a lack of endurance ever.  But that melee crit idea is kind of nifty and would give guilds a reason to have more Shaman around, especially if it was MGBable.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Of course you can't make a single spell not broken and to saticfy everyone. In the moment endurance isn't that important. But who knows what SOE will add &quot;on the fly&quot; for melees to use endurance (like the opening for melees they promised or more discs).<br />
<br />
But I got an other idea with the cleave mod: class unique wards:<br />
<br />
cleric ward could give spell haste (+10%)<br />
druid ward could give DS and FR / CR (+10DS, +50FR /CR)<br />
shaman ward could give a melee mod like cleave (+10% or so)<br />
mage ward could give spell damage mod (+5% flat or 1-10% random)<br />
wizard ward could give spell shielding (+5%)<br />
necro ward could give DoT shielding (+5%)<br />
chanter ward could give over haste (+10%)<br />
<br />
If you want it to extend to hybrids too:<br />
pally ward could give stun resist (+10%) or a hp boost (+200 max. HP)<br />
ranger ward could give attack (+100)<br />
BST ward could give PR / DR (+50 PR / DR)<br />
SK ward could give improved melee damage (+10min / max damage).</div></div><hr />
