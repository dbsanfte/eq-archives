<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">YOu know its kinda funny, but i was just posting in another thread and something struck me. SoE is just a Ebay'd game company.<br />
<br />
Ok bear ( pun intended ) with me...<br />
<br />
What more then anything pisses you off about ebay EQ accounts? Its the fact that some dipshiz is now playing a level 65 toon and has no idea of what to do, doesnt know what his spells are for or what zones are where or anything, all he knows is he bought his way into a sweet lil toon.<br />
<br />
Now, SoE is nothing more then a ebay game company. VI after years of &quot;playing&quot; with EQ got sick and decided they needed a real ife, so they ebayed EQ to the highest bidder which was SoE. So now you have SoE running around not having a clue as to what to do, they dont know what toons need or people want cause they just simply bought into a money maker and thats al they knew or cared about.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not much of a point, just silliness, so dont flame me lol. I just thought the things they had in common was too funny to not point a few out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ROFL, that is true.  Hilarious, and true.<br />
<br />
I wonder if their policy covered Ebay'ed games...maybe we can ban their account.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Funny yes, but it's a stretch to say that VI really knew what they were doing or listened to the players either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VI at least had 'the vision' (mostly brad anyways...) and knew what each classes role was supposed to be.  The recent thread on the SOE boards about the shaman niche demonstrates this is no longer the case</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What's the link for the thread with some official word on the shaman niche?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah hehe. Good analogy.  <br />
<br />
Yesterday I was grouping in BoT and a ranger was A) pulling with snare and wondering why nearby giants were adding B) idea of crowd control was to root adds right on the cleric, then wondered why we didn't move way from them C) said it was impossible to snare adds away, cause he'd have to &quot;jolt them first&quot; /boogle no clue there D) didn't want FA and would click off haste to make room for SoP and SoT.. and of course, we had a pally present..<br />
<br />
In the same way, I'm so confused how SOE thinks that adding 10% more healing to shamans is going to makeup for unslowable mobs.  Or how stat buffs are expected to be useful for elemental geared players... or how 40 second dots are useful for 25 second charm fights... or or or...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Saramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep VI had &quot;The Vision&quot; but at least we knew what &quot;The Vision&quot; was and what it meant to various classes etc.<br />
Sony has &quot;The Schweinerei&quot; which no one especially Sony seems to know what that means for various classes etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It was actually Verant and 989 Studios that developed EQ.  Sony was simply a means by which they were able to get billing sorted out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bring back 989 hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bring back 989 hehehe<br />
<br />
989 still exists, but last I remember, they made sports games for the Playstation/PS2</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep - that's the same 989.  I'd love to hear the story behind why they got out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And for the most part, 989's playstation sports games are crappy compared to the rest of the field (their MLB series is the only one that isn't ultra-craptastic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm not so sure that 989 is utterly and completely out of EQ. After all, look at eqhosts.txt in your directory...<br />
