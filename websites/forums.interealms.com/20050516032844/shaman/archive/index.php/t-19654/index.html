If you log onto Test and open the AA window, here's what you'll find (for Shamans), under the Gates tab:<br />
<br />
Swift Journey: 0/2, 5, requires level 61 and Run3.<br />
Convalescence: 0/2, 3, requires level 61 and Regen3<br />
Lasting Breath: 0/2, 2, requires level 61 and Innate Lung Capacity 3<br />
Packrat: 0/5, 3, requires level 61<br />
Secondary Forte: 0/1, 15, requires level 55 and 6 points in General.<br />
Persistent Casting: 0/3, 3, requires level 55 and 6 points in General.<br />
Pet Affinity: 0/1, 20, requires level 65.<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety: 0/3, 3, requires level 55 and 6 points in General.<br />
Quickened Curing: 0/3, 5, requires level 65 and RC3<br />
Critical Affliction: 0/3, 5, requires level 65.<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery: 0/3, 4, requires level 65 and FoM3.<br />
Advanced Spirit Call (marked as a passive ability): 0/2, 5, requires level 65 and SC3.<br />
Call of the Ancients (30 minute refresh time): 0/5, 3, requires level 65.<br />
<br />
Points of note: Still no sign of Spirit Speed / Enhanced Rabidity / Shield / Consumption or the wolf-enhancing AAs (Rabid Companion and Fury of the Ancients). <br />
Advanced Spirit Call (aka Wolf Pack) is passive, but that's pretty much got to change unless it replaces Spirit Call entirely (and Spirit Call is still listed under PoP Ability).<br />
<br />
All in all, not a particularly exciting list - and as I've mentioned before, I'm still sulking at the loss of Rabid Companion, /mourn  :(</div></div><hr />

So am I reading this right? our Ward will last 5 mins but we wont be able recast for 30 mins so Melee's only get a Endurance Regen 5 mins for ever half hour?<br />

<br />
That's what it looks like, 5 minutes every half hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does the recast decrese with the higher ranks at all?<br />
That I don't know, as I just created a newbie shaman on Test to peek at the AA window. Having said that I'd suspect the recast time would stay the same, based on the fact that Spirit Call, Radiant Cure and Virulent Paralysis all have the same recast time as you advance though the ranks.</div></div><hr />

Recast time is 30 min on call of the ancients.  It was lasting 6 min for me, so not sure exactly if it had to do with AAs for what exactly.  I'm going to test out CotA today if I can just to make sure i was not blown smoke and that it is a hp regen and not a endurance regen.  Note though, is that it cannot stack, so like you said, if more than one person casts it, it will not have twice the power.</div></div><hr />

5 AA cost puts this low priority for me. I bet the rest of my guild will get it, so I'll have to get it so I don't get left behind when the raid moves. Because I get lost.<br />
<br />
<br />

Ridiculous AA for shaman. <br />

15 points for 50 more skill? No.<br />

Interesting. Still aggravating, don't casters get this ability as an archtype for 2 4 6? <br />
<br />
<br />

On my short list of AA to get, thanks to the Rathe Council event.<br />

<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery: 0/3, 4, requires level 65 and FoM3.<br />

<br />
<br />
Advanced Spirit Call (marked as a passive ability): 0/2, 5, requires level 65 and SC3.<br />
<br />
I only spent 1 rank in Spirit Call to begin with. Not very excited about this, push on raids is the devil.<br />
<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients (30 minute refresh time): 0/5, 3, requires level 65.<br />

Very very disappointed. I was looking forward to endurance wards, that would be something unique for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The crit dot aa's should still be 2/4/6 same with the scs. So what if the exp rate is faster all that means is int casters get their scs cheaper and nuke crits cost everyone 2/4/6.<br />

Same effect should be same damned cost.<br />
<br />
And yes the pet buff aa is someones idea of a sick, overpriced joke.</div></div><hr />

To answer one of the other posters, yes, SCS is a 2/4/6 ability for int-casters.  <br />
<br />
This is a very uninteresting selection of AA.  I only banked three points for the expansion (decided to spend 15 on innate enlightenment) and now I'm actually glad I made that choice.  There are a few AAs here that I'll purchase, but when push comes to shove theres nothing here that makes me say &quot;wow, this is fantastic&quot;.  Actually, theres nothing here that makes me say &quot;wow, this is mediocre&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hail,<br />
<br />
Hmm, thanks for posting this.<br />
Swift Journey: Not worth buying soon, but eventually I'll get it.  A convenience purchase really.<br />
<br />
Convalescence: Another eventual purchase once the rest of the good ones are invested.  I'll get it before innate charisma anyway. :p <br />
<br />
Lasting Breath: No.  If I can make it from The Grey zone-in to Ssra on normal (no AA's) lung power, why would I ever want this?  If the final level eliminated the need for an EB item, then this would be worthwhile maybe.<br />
<br />
Secondary Forte: AA price seems rather steep, but I'll get it.<br />
<br />
Persistent Casting: I solo &amp; rampage tank too much not to have this.<br />
<br />
Pet Affinity: Way overpriced...but I'll get it.<br />
<br />
Spell Casting Subtlety: Probably getting this first just so hopefully I can pump out 2 dots early back-back w/o getting smooshed on a mob of any strength.<br />
<br />
Quickened Curing: Worth buying.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction: Definitely getting, probably second.<br />
<br />
Fury of Magic Mastery: Rain nukes make up alot of my DPS lately on Adventures, I'll be getting this (already have FoM3).<br />
<br />
Call of the Ancients (30 minute refresh time): I won't be getting this until I start raiding seriously again unless they change the refresh time.  What a backward's way to promote 5-6 shaman per raid.  :mad: <br />
<br />
At least I have 29 banked already waiting to invest.  :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

How is it compared to BoT ?  Thats where I seem to live at the moment and I really could do with a change of scenary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Trash.  I play for fun, these AA's are not nearly worth the cost and are not all that much fun.<br />
<br />
My DoT's don't run full duration anyway, why am I going to blow INSANE AAs on something that gives likely less of a boost than SCF.<br />
<br />
The Ancient's bit is a blatant crotch shot as is the pet buff bug fix.  Lung capacity and packrat are lame.  What really makes me wanna explode is the nutty cost for even the lamest items on this list.  I'll wait a couple weeks for others to comment on these seemingly pathetic AA's before I waste my cash on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't buy that reasoning 'AA farming got easier, so we raise AA costs' anyway.<br />
<br />
If SoE is afraid of AA mudflation ;) (a legitimate issue atleast for some high-end zones), what about NOT raising ZEMs of new zones to some ridiculous level to begin with?<br />
<br />
If a game designer 'needs' higher xp-rates to lure people into newer zones, there are other problems (****ty design, non-existant loot tables, boring XP-mobs to name a few ...).<br />
<br />
When a player earns AAs faster, he should have 'earned' those AAs in an ideal situation, not given on a silver plate.<br />
<br />
But hey, it is certainly easier to give away some free candy the first few weeks than spending more time and thoughts on basic game design  :rolleyes: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Secondary forte is still really good.  Even assuming it only gives a 3% preservation to Conjuration, that is like gaining a 5% mana preservation item for DoTs.  That is easily worth 15aa.  No, it isn't spell casting mastery, but SCM was insanely good.  This is merely... good.<br />
<br />
Comparing critical affliction to spell casting fury isn't accurate either, until we know what % critical affliction gives.  OK, if it gives 7%, then start bitching, but it might give more.<br />
<br />
As for spell casting subtlety, I guess I just don't get it.  Maybe this is one for the non-Time-geared shamans.  I can't take aggro from Time-geared tanks with time snap or whatever even with 3 DoTs on the mob... and I have the hps to tank whatever, so I don't really care if I get aggro... 20% doesn't seem like a lot anyway.  So this aa is just unexciting to me.<br />
<br />
I'll be taking the aa that give a direct dps increase first, so critical affliction and secondary forte are top on my list.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So am I reading this right? our Ward will last 5 mins but we wont be able recast for 30 mins so Melee's only get a Endurance Regen 5 mins for ever half hour?<br />
<br />
Does the recast decrese with the higher ranks at all?<br />
<br />
Thats not too bad. The only times melee really need endurance regen is during large target fights, since they burn most of their disc groups over a short period of time. Currently they cant do this fully since their endurance pools are too small. Once items are updated to include endurance pool mods, it is possible that most melees will have sufficient endurance to burn all of their discs without draining the end bar, so we will have to see how much use this aa actually is on raids. As things stand it will certainly be usefull, but that might change when they update gear. I would hold off on spending any points on this until that aspect becomes clearer.<br />
<br />
In the long term the aa skill may still be usefull, since the skills originally associated with the opening system are still on test. They have stated that openings will not be implemented but I suspect that they are going to retain the skills, but have them set to proc automatically if toggled on. A lot of these skills are endurance hungry, so if they do implement a system using them, melee are going to need enhanced endurance regen on big fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Channeling is very cool. (Again as an Enchanter it will be my first buy).<br />
<br />
Other than that, I think: a) Shaman got screwed - AGAIN, and b) None of the GoD AA's are that impressive and most suck for the cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Did they remove the pet aa's from the list?  When did this happen?  Has anyone confirmed that the pet proc and crit aa's are no longer part of the expansion?  Would be very disappointing, even if they don't add a lot of dps, it would be nice to get even a bit more out of dogdog.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm already posted that the crit dot % is supposed to be 9% for the final rank.  Look at it this way.  It's a 9% chance for a dot to crit on any tick.  So, each tick of bane will have a 9% chance to dot, making a total potential of 5240 dmg with no focus item or bard song if it cits every chance.  I was kinda disappointed in the low % till I parsed some mobs out and I seemed to get alot of crits that I noticed, although in the long run it was prob around 9%.  I've seen a bunch of over 4300 banes and that really perked my interest alot.  When soloing, this adds up to alot of extra dmg.  Also, you don't know that you are criting, unless you look at the dmg.  You won't get a message like you get when you crit nuke something.<br />
<br />
Well, in a raid setting last night with 14 people in the raid, I earned 50% of an AA in about an 1 1/2 hours.  I was getting about 2% per kill in one of the 6 person groups that I was with, with the mobs lasting a good 30 secs tops.  I don't know how the exp will be once it's live.  Things change<br />
<br />
Tomorrow i will post some parts from my conversation with the developer, without his name attached of course.<br />
<br />
edit:  Thunder, check back on my topic that I posted about two - three weeks ago.  I think it's titled &quot;Poss New Shaman AAs&quot;.On there i stated the new AAs that they added, and Avasheon reminded me that they took out the pet AAs at the same time.</div></div><hr />

shaman pets on raids are total non-factors, and when you do adventures, you buff your group outside due to the time restrictions. i guess in the event that everyone in your group steps into a dispell trap or something it'll save the day. heh.</div></div><hr />

As far as crit nukes.. well sure I guess. Been thinking about getting the extended torment aug (or hold out for the helm for VT) and I also just got a bracer with a 30% mana savings on dots effect. So may as well add a chance to crit dot to that.<br />

Other than that. Will likely look at SCS.. but will wait to see what people who get it think about it as well as Secondary Forte.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>EeyonRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">secondary forte isn't bad, its just really watered down. i'm considering switching back to conjuration once i buy it though, not because my conjuration spells are better, but because they're more mana intensive, and anytime i'm casting strictly alteration i pretty much have way more mana than i know what to do with anyway. <br />
<br />
mana is mana, so if you can save more of it through conjuration, you still end up with more to spend on alteration than you would have had with max skill in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Except for the fizzle factor. Fizzling a conjuration spell isn't likely to get me killed, like fizzling a root or gate or heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">personally i find these aa insulting, there was obviously no effort involved in them , or for that matter alot of other classes. just look at beast they got 2 nukes for godsake!. Things such as critical afflication should have been added to pop, not this expansion.<br />
All i see is SoE trying to grab as much cash as it can with a poorly thought out expansion. I see again no thought for intellegent encounters just nerfs on damage you can do and hicking up damage taken to players. Basically as fast and cheap as they can. As such i will not buy this expansion. Unless a lot changes and not just for shaman. (which if lots poeple dont buy it they will likely do in 3 month or so, least i can hope)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I couldnt agree more, SOE sucks some serious ass, much like every game they have ever touched.</div></div><hr />

And the for the AA list?  They all suck.  I knew there was a reason I made an ALT, and have been enjoying it immensely.</div></div><hr />

Looks to me like SC4 is a rather serious downgrade(!) compared to SC3. Maybe result will differ on longer fights since those procs do so much damage that just a few extra means a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">pretty much reflects all the downgrades we got in god so far, ops i mean upgrades ....<br />
<br />
i do like the proc with them, just shame they arent balance to u/g with sc3.</div></div><hr />
