<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've added a better buff window. Not moveable, although you can stretch it around to put it where to like.<br />
<br />
Using Remelio's mod for T.King Spell Books so it looks better.<br />
<br />
I cleared up a LOT of screen. So much infact that I can now use a second chat window, just for the hell of it lol. :)<br />
<br />
I had replaced the pet window with a location guide a while back. I'm un-sure if I want to change it back to the original pet window, then modify it to make it look better/be more practicle or keep the location guide. :)<br />
<br />
Actually, this brings me to my next update. Kind of a good bad situation if you know what I mean. I went around looking at this nice stuff people made for their mods. I thought, 'wow, I could really use that' and 'that would make my interface look nicer' and so on. Well, I decided to make another folder in this interface folder that would allow for more customization. Well, it doesn't reeeally add more than was before, but I put the mods I liked all into the customize folder. So now all you have to do is look through and if you see something you like, right click on it, copy, go back to the original folder and paste it there, overwriting the previous file. So I could put the location guide as a customizable feature and put in a proper pet window.<br />
<br />
Now for the bad news. Including this customize folder, the whole mod totals out to be 9mb :( BUT, a bit of good news is that's before I put them in winzip so it may be less due to the compression in .zip files. Anyway, I might have to just include them in two different .zip files.<br />
<br />
Next thing, Timers! I saw these awesome timers in a thread here on the boards. ( Click here to see the thread. (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2488) ) They are totally customizable as well, and I have 4 of them for various things. And if you want a different amount of timers, different times on them, colors, whatever go  HERE (http://www.horizonsoutpost.com/eq/timer.asp).<br />
<br />
I'm using the old compass in this UI, just because I rarely look at the compass anymore anyway. But included in the customize folder are some more compass mods.<br />
<br />
I'm still using the Spell Casting Bar I was using in the last screenshot, but I'm going to stick that as a customizable feature and use the spell bar HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2485).<br />
<br />
<br />
ANYWAY, this update is, in my opinion, a much needed, much better version of my old one. Hmmm..That reminds me. What should I call this interface anyway?<br />
<br />
Well, I'm going to attach a screenshot of the new and improved interface.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, before I forget, I am making an interface for 800 x 600 resolution. Click HERE (http://www.eqgui.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2486) to check out the thread on it. The most recent screenshots are at the end of the thread.<br />
<br />
This interface is for 1024 x 768 though.</div></div><hr />
