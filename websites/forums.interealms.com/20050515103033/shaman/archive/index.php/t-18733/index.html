<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild tried Inny hateB style and it was our first try not knowing anything about it, and first encounter with AE rampage. Needless to say 90% was the last I saw. <br />
<br />
What I wanted to know not spoiler info on Inny (but if you must) but really what others have done to combat AE Rampage and found the most effective.<br />
<br />
Is the AE range large? Can CH's reach outside of the range?<br />
<br />
Does Cripple lesson the AE Rampage?<br />
<br />
Do you normally heal the melee with in group Healers or AoE's such as wood and paragon? Or can they also be outside of the Rampage.<br />
<br />
Does AE rampage work on a list or is just an AoE that cares only if your in range?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the wisdom you can share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">key to AE Ramp... dont get hit :)  I know that sounds simplistic, but you just have to get your melee to be at MAX (and I mean absolute max) range while melee'ing.   On any of the mobs we fight that have ae ramp, melee fight at max range.  If they happen to sneak too close, and get wacked, every group has a healer of some sort (druid, shaman, pally, or non comp heal rote cleric), to heal these mistakes.. if it happens regularly, let em die.<br />
<br />
Cripple, by definition, should lower the number of times a mob rampages, but I've seen the return to be minimal.  If your looking for something to do with your mana during the fight, toss a crip, otherwise, I dont worry too much about it myself, personally.<br />
<br />
AE Ramp is no list, just hits everyone within a specific distance of the mob.  Some mobs with ae ramp, also have a single target rampage, so be sure to set up a ramp tank.<br />
<br />
And on MGB heals.  Always a good thing on any mob with aoe dmg, if you can afford it.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps, and Im sure someone that can explain better then me will speak up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">corner it best you can (AOW corner if possible), else just pin it to a wall and try to keep a neutral push. <br />
<br />
You should be able to hit from max melee range and not get AOE ramp'd at all.  There's also plenty of room to heal from out of AE ramp range</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before the fight, decide where you are going to corner the mob.  Have the tank stand in his corner, and give all your clerics ER4 items.  Have the clerics find maximum CH range and stand there.  Once the AE ramp mob is pulled, use paladin stuns and monk dragon punch to position it in the corner and make sure it stays there.  Positioning is the most important part.  Once you have it there, all the melees find maximum melee range and engage from there.  With most mobs, melees can just barely attack and still be out of AE ramp.  Some mobs, like fennin ro, melees have to sit there and shoot/throw things at the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My main is a melee, and my shaman is too low for ae ramp mobs so i have a few tips for them.<br />
<br />
1. Use walk, the distance where you can hit a mob and not get hit is about this big &gt;&lt;, ideally you want them to see the too far message but still hit.<br />
<br />
2. Don't shrink, seems your melee range is a bit larger when not shrunk. If i have a chanter in group i ask for barb illusion when i think about it.<br />
<br />
3. Don't let your rangers use Guardian of the Forest (found this out the hard way, the illusion somehow puts you into ae ramp range)<br />
<br />
4. If they do get low health aggro, run to MT corner and die, ping pong and ae ramp can wipe you fast.<br />
<br />
5. Make sure everyone goes light on the aggro, if you get summoned stand and die, dont suck and train your raid<br />
<br />
Otherwise what everyone else said works great, secondary healers, get the RT order set so your clerics dont get pounded, and push the mob into a corner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>CollectraBB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Always good to cripple.  Beside the visible ( or not ) rampage/flurry decreases, the difference in damage output of mobs is usually significant enough to be worth the 225 mana.  Also it will slightly increase the dps of your raid meeleewise.<br />
