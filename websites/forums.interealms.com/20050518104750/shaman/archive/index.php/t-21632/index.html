<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, does anybody have the stats or any information on it?  Second, does anybody think Sony has started down the slippery slope of selling in game items for out of game cash?<br />
<br />
I mean if PC Gamer reports that their May issue sales spiked and they can trace said spike to the &quot;advertising&quot; placed by Sony....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it probably is 10ac 5dex 3cha +25 endurance and is all/all and has a crappy yet unique graphic. who cares?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heck I'm still angry about not getting a satchel of abu' kar!  Why download when you can run to the store and get a 25 percent weight reduction that can go up to 50 percent, dang, that's almost game breaking!<br />
<br />
Well maybe not, but still.  The worst instance of something like this was probably over in Anarchy Online where owners of the special edition got in-game sunglasses that could be obtained through no other means.  That was an item that was actually cool, I had so many fashions that just BEGGED for sunglasses, but nope, didn't shell out an extra 20 bucks, so...</div></div><hr />

What does concern me is that I also heard that they were giving away EQ2 Beta testing spots for some readers ?.<br />
Is this true?.<br />
If so i really think this stinks.From what ive heard on the appi form for Beta it asks many question about what you play,how often etc etc.So *** is the point of all this if youre then going to give away Beta testing places in a magazine.<br />

PS<br />
Must be in an anti SoE mood today as i wont be playing EQ2 anyway but just felt like a whine.</div></div><hr />

Faction modifier?<br />
<br />
New expansion?<br />
<br />
Hmmmm.....I smell a bucketload of faction work coming up with the new expansion....unless of course you buy the magazine :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Anyone have a pic of the shield? People have been saying it has a really cool graphic was just wondering what it was.</div></div><hr />

Is this true?.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's true.  If I read it correctly, they are giving away 10,000 spots to PC Gamer readers/subscribers.<br />
<br />

Edit: Fixed the quote.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">is this item already in game?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I saw the EXACT same shield (of da bashers) for sale off an adventure merchant at BB camp two days ago... I was like what the heck is this???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just got one tonight for my rogue alt at the SRO camp.  Graphic does look kinda cool and it was an upgrade for her back slot.  Cost 6AP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The best item I got on a gm event was a 100% reduction bag.<br />
Thats something that you would never have to upgrade and I still use it.<br />
I don't see whats good about this shield if like someone is saying you can buy it for 6 points at a LDoN camp.</div></div><hr />
