<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi folks.  I'm lvl 35 now, and having a blast.<br />
<br />
I have an issue and some questions regarding that issue.  The issue is: I'm getting resisted a ton.  I get resisted much more than I think I should be.  I've now become somewhat obsessed about this, and I'm trying to find ways to reduce this, because there's nothing more frustrating than knowing that you need to land a certain spell to have a chance in a certain situation, and the damn spell gets resisted (which happens more times that not).<br />
<br />
So I have two ideas in mind, and they deal with: <br />
<br />
1) Charisma, and <br />
2) some sort of chart that lists what certain spells save versus.  <br />
<br />
I've seen a few posts about the affects of Charisma on your chances of landing a spell, and no one seems to have a definitive answer for this.  Some people swear by this, and others by that, while others disregard the relativeness of charisma on this subject, but I just want to get some answers :)  Does Charisma affect anything regarding resists?  The higher the charisma, the less resists?  Being a troll, even my buffed charisma is barely 80.  I've tried tests, and don't notice a huge difference, but then again I dont' think i'm crossing any charisma thresholds to consider it a valid test.  I kinda think personally that it's irrelevant, but I've been wrong before :)<br />
<br />
What do our most common spells SV against?  When I cast Slow or Malisement or a DoT or whatever, what are these testing against to determine if they land or not?  Is it SV Magic?  Disease?  etc...  This information would be really helpful.  For instance, if a lot of our common spell-lines test against a creature's disease resist value, then it would be worthwhile to use the Insidious xxxx line of spells right off the bat, maybe even to pull with.  (I solo frequently)<br />
<br />
Is that why they give us Insidious xxxx?  as a primer spell to help us land some of our more highly-resisted spells and help us land them more often?  Why did they have the Malise-series lower all resists but disease, and then give us a separate spell to lower disease resist only?  There's gotta be something there.... a reason for that.<br />
<br />
I have to say... the spell that gets resisted the most is Malisement... the spell that is supposed to LOWER resists.  Kinda ironic.  Slow lands often, but still causes me probs.  My DoTs get resisted almost as much as my Malisement spell does.<br />
<br />
Any info is greatly appreciation. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Slows are magic-based, so the save is versus magic. It adds disease counters so that you can dispell it with abolish disease rather than having to strip buffs off with cancel magic or one of it's upgrades (annul/nullify magic). I too find it easier to land slows rather than malosi's but turgur's has a lower resist check I believe so that's normal. If you're soloing and using your disease dots, by all means, use insidious decay when you get it. It does help. Keep in mind though, that insidious decay only helps with the disease dots. Malisment/maloXXX are needed to lower poison resists, as well as cold/fire/magic. You're gonna get resists, regardless of debuffing but debuffing does minimize the resists. Some mob have higher resists than others. If your dots are being resisted alot, try the cold-based nukes. Experiment and see which seems to land more often. Good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Check out http://lucy.fnord.net - you can look up any spell and see what Save it uses (under &quot;Resist&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Generally, slows save against Magic (except PoI which saves against disease), DoTs dave against poison or disease (depending on what kind of DoT it is), general debuffs save against magic (Malx series, Cripple series, Root, Blind, etc.)<br />
<br />
On the CHA thing, I don't think anyone has shown definitively that it affects resists.  This, combined with the lack of overwhelming anecdotal evidence leads to the general impression that CHA doesn't affect resists (except when charming- not exactly our specialty.)<br />
<br />
One other piece of information that has helped me.  Spells resist more when you first get them.  For me, Togors (level 39 slow) is much easier to stick than Turgurs (my level 52 slow).  It often doesn't pay to use your most current versions of spells when they have small incremental increases in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
