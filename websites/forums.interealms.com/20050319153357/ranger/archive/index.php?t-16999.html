Was printed on 2 sides using a regualr printer. Had all kinds of good info, fletching, epic, spells equipment etc.<br />
<br />
Most likely way out of date but was real good and small. If anyone knows what I am babbling about and has the link I would rgeatly appreaciate it.<br />

I suppose I could convert it to an Adobe PDF if that would be preferred.  The Word doc is 972kb.  Let me know if you are interested.  <br />
<br />
I do not know where the original link is anymore.  I got &quot;The Ranger Reference&quot; pamphlet as a newbie about 18 months ago, and it was very useful.</div></div><hr />

www.deadzed.com/eq<br />
<br />
I will post it here as soon as i get it ziped into a format that will fit here.<br />
<br />
The format i have is pre lucan and PoP so will not be all that accurate as far as spells and equip, but is very helpfull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct about the Web link.  That is what is printed on the back of the pamphlet.  But the Web site is dead now.  And the zip file on the page is unaccessible.<br />
<br />
I downloaded the file 'ranger.zip' that you posted, but it can not be unzipped.  Maybe it is corrupted?<br />
<br />
I will zip up my Word document and post it now.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bschenk</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here it is, The Ranger's Reference Word document, in zip format.<br />
<br />
It is somewhat old and dated, but most of the info is useful, especially for newbies.  If anyone revies or updates the file, please post it back to this thread.<br />
<br />
And if there is anytrouble in opening the zip or Word document, just let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now that I'm at work&quot; ;) &quot; I was able to put it into a .pdf format.<br />
Please download it, I think you will like this revised version.<br />
<br />
Ranger at you service.....<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. I tried the first .zip I posted and had no trouble extracting it using WinZip. It is a better version in word and with printing instructons.</div></div><hr />

I have updated the spell portion of the booklet to be more current here is that portion.</div></div><hr />
