<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe some of you know about this already but I had to get this info from an SK board. This is the easiest cash in the game. IGs are always camped so this is a nice alternative when you need funds for KEI, alchemy, etc.<br />
<br />
The place: The city of Felwithe<br />
Target: guards<br />
<br />
Mostly light blue and green to me at 59. Every one of them drops a two-handed sword which sells for 20pp with max CHA and also 1-5pp of cash plus gems. They can sometimes be surprisingly resistant, might take 2-3 malosinis sometimes before I can slow but most just take 1 malosini. Even after a malosini root either gets resisited or doesn't last long so wait for pet to build up enough aggro before dotting. <br />
<br />
They heal themselves a lot so dot heavily  and it helps to enable alpha pet. With merchants nearby I had no problems finding an endless supply of rusties for puppy. Pull guards right to the zone edge so you are not in range of another, real pain to have two paladins healing each other.<br />
<br />
Downside: You lose faction with Emerald Warriors, Merchants of Felwithe and Merchants of Kelethin. Emerald Warrior faction can be fixed by killing orcs in gfay. The other two factions I won't lose any sleep over.<br />
<br />
Cheers and enjoy the loot off those rich high-elves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">These mobs are not easy, if you get a resitant one he can bring you down to 60% health before you get it slowed.<br />
<br />
Id say min ac needed is 950+,  at 55 some of them tookme 8 mins to kill, as they got there LOH off, then still healed up after me getting them back to 30% health.<br />
<br />
Yeah if you get an add, and both are resitant.....it wastes a good pet(<br />
<br />
This is not better money than farming HHK guards for fs swrds, the figahts take far too long  BUT its 300% more fun!<br />
<br />
You can get pesterd by lowbies tho, but at least you get to watch some of them talk ing to dogdog!<br />
<br />
I went from ally to dubious here with my ogre shammy~went to cb at lvl 8 with my ogre ~<br />
<br />
Id like to find a similar spot in neriak to even it all out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that VI should realize that starting players who don't have strong guild ties or uber characters to twink with don't have any opporitunities to make money until the 60's. There need to be a few more place which have mobs that drop reasonable amounts of platinum, like hill giants.</div></div><hr />

I think if there was a place like this, the 60's would be there farming, like with the HG's.</div></div><hr />

At 59 these guys are cake. I can clear the 5 at bridge and the 2 roamers past it and have time to rest up so try again at a later level  :) I'd estimate that 70% I land malosini on first attempt followed by slow. After that i just let puppy devour a bub of HP out of them then quickly land BoN and ebolt in succession, I don't even bother with root anymore. 2500pts of dots eating at them they can't heal fast enough. Once in a while I will have to cast another BoN but for the most part just one BoN and one ebolt will do it along with alpha pet.<br />
<br />
The other 30% are defintely a pain in the ass. I've even had greens resist 5-6 malosinis in a row. Not a problem since dog keeps aggro while I'm attempting to malox and slow. The only close calls I've had are the resistant dual-wielding pallies...yes dual wield, gotta love that NPC cheat. They chew up puppy real fast so if they resist you have to sneak in some heals too.<br />
<br />
In some ways I'm glad this camp isn't too easy else every low 50th lvl druid/wizzy/shaman/mage would be here just like at IGs. If it requires being close to 60 and a way to lower resists then good, that's less competition for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried these guards yesterday. The two a the frontend of the bridge conned light blue. Resisted Malosini 3 times, and resisted root twice and Bane twice after Malosini had stuck. Bane landed twice, Epic landed twice and the guard still had 50% hp. Are these guards nerfed or am I just plain unlucky? Im level 58 btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Racknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Alpha Dog, add regen + haste + dex<br />
Pull with slow<br />
Sick Dog<br />
Let Dog Tank (You heard me)<br />
BoN at 80 percent<br />
Ice Strike at 35<br />
<br />
Dead, hardly any healing, quick and mana efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">rack...the point was...that some guards are very hard to land slow on.  can take 4ish tries.   or even 4x malosisni<br />
<br />
some of the guards are just a severe pain.  Others do down without a murmur.<br />
<br />
keeps it interesting tho !</div></div><hr />
