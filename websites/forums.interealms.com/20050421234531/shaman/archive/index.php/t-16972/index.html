<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok. I'm 57 now. That 56 stretch was killer. I see what a hell level is really like now. Ok, I made it to 57. I'm looking for a place I can solo as quickly as possible. I really dont care about cash. I just want fast xp. A friend of mine is willing to bend the rules of his guild, and I can enter it when I hit 60, so my goal is to reach 60 as fast as humanly possible. Grouping is not a problem, and when I can I group. Before everyone says LDoN groups are the best!... I know they are the best xp I have had yet. I work on call for an ambulance company, and when I get a page for a call, I have to gate, log, and go. I do not want to tarnish my reputation, and warn groups ahead of time of my status before we get started, and frequently get passed up becuase of it. So that said, when I can I group, but it's not always an option. <br />
<br />
Now I am looking for other options. I've toyed around a bit, but haven't found my &quot;niche&quot; yet. I made the mistake of zoning into Fear, and it took 3 hours with 2 groups of 65s to get me out. I am now lax on exploring a whole lot. I'm looking for the fastest possible experience for a solo luminary. I have a JBB, a drogmor, and most of my spells. The ones I am missing wouldn't make any difference (EB, Remove (and Greater) Curse. Canni2). Every where I've tried has been a let down. I'm looking for a place that preferrably (not a must) is less used, fast xp for solo. Coin is not an issue, when I hit 60, I'll have all the coin I need. I believe I am well equipped for my level and resources. I'm posting my magelo below. Hopefully someone out there is or has been in a similar situation where grouping is not always an option, and can help me out. Again, when I can, I group. I dont care about coin, I can get plenty later. I just want 60.<br />
<br />
If anyone wants to know which flags/keys I have, they are also in my magelo, as is the swap out gear I keep on me. Just check the inventory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Best solo you're probably going to get at 57 is going to be the guards out in Katta, especially with JBB and drogmor.  Pull with slow, sick muttmutt (dualwielding validus custodus weapons, of course!) and JBB until about 20%.  Root.  Pull next.<br />
It's mind-numbing, but in my experience, was almost as fast as LDoN exp at 58.</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoD is great, the only problem is that its one of the more crowded tier 1 planes. I've been going there while I'm lfg to kill rats and goos. If I could get a decent spot without getting interrupted from other people taking rats and goos from me I would imagine that 2 blue and hour would be easily doable. I did 1.5 blue in an hour and change the other night while competing with others for mobs and about 20min of no fighting. I have yet to try the fly camp though.</div></div><hr />

I would have to agree with this. I knew about Katta but tried it once at like lvl51 or 52 and it didn't go well so I was holding off on going back until Tigran said it in reply to one of my posts. I also have to really agree about the mind-numbing part. Have some music, food, movie, etc... ready. Good steady exp, ok loot and an empty zone.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and have an ultravision spell ready.</div></div><hr />

What about faction?  To a 50+ player is katta a dead zone?  Is there anything that we might want from there at some point?  I have killed there before but I dont want to wreak any faction .. there is notrhing I hate more than faction farming =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kill Nathyn's guards instead of the regular ones if you are worried about faction; they give you good faction with Katta. Zone in from TM and hang your first left, then another, then another. You will see two sonic wolf guards and some Katta guards, just stay in that little courtyard. Nice quiet killing usually and good exp, lived here myself from 58 to 60 with a few AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">PoD is ok, it is not as crowded as PoJ most of the time, you get no loot. Be carefull though if a rat resist slow a few times your hp drop fast. I use sense animals to find them, or flies too alot easier way less hp's hit about half as hard too. You can pull about 4 or so before you get to the ones that will add, then I grab a rat. I do this with my 2boxing monk.. but I know I could take flies easy.. and even rats they just have a lot of hp's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, numerous hours, and I'm at 52%. I got a chance to do an adventure, woohoo.. 12%! The other 40 was split, The Grey:Sun Revenants (FINALLY got that shard), Nadox:Elementals (DB btw to 57), and Dulak:Rear Luggald Caves... and at the rate I'm going I MIGHT hit 58 by next week. I'm sick of this. I want to get my Veracity earring eventually, so going to go kill a guard, then test how hard it's going to be to fix. I remember some mobs I used to kill in my 30's that gave + faction to katta. If they fix all factions lowered by guards, then off to the guards I go. (After going and renting a few movies, and getting more cigs.) Will reply later with how it goes.<br />
<br />
Btw my exp at 57...<br />
The Grey:2 Sun Revenants=1% VERY hard fights! NOT worth the xp, but gets you a lucid shard, and I also got a dew clover *beams a smile*<br />
<br />
Nadox: 3 Elementals=1% Not NEARLY enough to kill, though the named corpse spawn was 2% all by itself, the 2 times it spawned =) Did make a total of 500p here, for those that care.<br />
<br />
Dulak: The caves just past the soulstripper camp became db... 4-5 various luggalds=1%... in the very back, I was getting 1% every other kill, but got tired of getting feared, charmed, and @#$%^&amp;* complete healing mobs. 150 magic resist btw. Too many times, the luggalds would &quot;spring from the walls&quot; in packs of 3 or 4. As per loot, I did spend 1/2 an hour and got lucky enough to get my soulstripper, and he respawned after, so a druid in my guild got a soulstripper. Made 700p in loots for those looking for loots, fighting all the way in and back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kalander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Velks spiders should still be dk blue at that level.  Not too busy in there these days.  I was soloing them in my early/mid 50s.  Not sure about the xp rate though I dont really remember.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you're worried about your Katta factions, you can kill the guards near Nathyn's place.  Just watch out for the sonic wolves.  You'll probably get sets of two until 58.  No biggie :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">nathyns guards are single pulls at lvl 55.  katta bank guards however, are not at 55, but they're rediculously easy.<br />
<br />
on another note, dulak boat mobs are pretty much similar.  the question becomes one of loot, faction, and which mobs will keep you awake longer when trying to grind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">58.26 now.<br />
Katta bank and Nathyn's guards went 75% lb. The db are obviously about to go lb, as they also give almost nonexistant xp. <br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns=4 kills per 1%, Fll medding between fights after fighting casters. but go 2 or 3 melees before medding. High drop rate of acrylia, go figure.<br />
<br />
Griegs End=Attempted and had a fun CR. Was hoping it was soloable again, now that they fixed it so it isn't &quot;unbelievably numerous&quot;. Tried a few ways to go about it here, just not gonna happen yet.<br />
<br />
PoN, PoV, PoS, PoI. PoD..root rotting, and running for my life as needed.. other than PoI loot doesn't seem to exist much. Around 10=1% in PoI and PoN. PoS and PoV 3=1%, full medding and winning fights by the skin of my teeth. After 3 CR's from not quite making it to zone, I hope this isn't the only viable solo optioin. PoD, PoI both heavy trafficed. <br />
<br />
BoT.. 2 CR's and I give up for now...<br />
<br />
Karnor's Castle (Deep) 6=1% and have to run alot becuase things tend to add through walls at bad times. Horrid, horrid pathing.<br />
<br />
Velks Spiders 12=1% Wow is it bad here. ALMOST immune to cold. Renders jbb useless. Alot of hp for little reward. The only good thing is the crystalline spiders can drop thread. Very contested zone, with alot of people KSing and camp jumping.<br />
<br />
Kael Drakkal 6=1% INSANE hp, matching damage output. Good learning experience, for later fights. Might head back there, if I can deal with the KSers.<br />
<br />
JPF went lb...<br />
<br />
Maidens Eye 6=1% and fights are tough. Heavily contested zone, always packed, everyting camped.<br />
<br />
I should be farther along on my xp, but alas a few deaths were unrezzable. =( Off to give charisis, sebilis, and chardok a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Drylar, try the guards at the Twilight Sea zone in Katta.  6 static, 2 roamers.  Took me all the way to 60 :)<br />
Yeah, it's a snooze-fest, but it's a pretty consistant flow of exp.  LDoN with a good group will always be better, but don't always have time for that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">you got 12 % in an ldon group...just do that from now till bot and pov are easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Keyline Wintermystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Solo spot i found that was nice and quiet for exp was ARuins next to ME.<br />
<br />
Not sure about exp, but was nice and most of the time could exchange buffs with others hunting zone.<br />
<br />
Might be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">try the shrine in nadox, fast kills (relatively) and nadox is usually deserted anyway.  Exp up to 60--used to turn lb at 61 before the broadening of the level range for dk blue/lt blue.<br />
<br />
Torgiran mines (from dulak) will be DB til 60 also, and the first type of slaves you run into are pretty low hp.  The trolls are about double what the slaves have though, and tend to resist more.  Single pulls starting at 58..so you're golden.<br />
<br />
Dont bother soloing OR GROUPING tier1 zones if you can avoid it, the exp is and always will be terrible for the most part.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Drylar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Update again, and thank you all for all the advice. I headed down to Chardock, and left after a short time. What wasn't lb was multiple pulls and just wasn't worth it solo. If there is a spot, I didn't find it.<br />
<br />
However... I've found me new home! Charisis. First attempt sent me gating, as I was totally unprepared for the amount of mobs at zone in. Luckily, first impressions were wrong. They had been trained there on accident. I've dinged 59, and am now 59.4. The xp here is awesome compared to what I was making in LDoN. The north is 100% soloable (ala self buffs only), west wing takes kei to keep up, and south add a virtue. I can't yet touch the east wing. I've caught enough pick up groups that I have my hand of glory, so can now open all doors and travel unrestricted. I've also picked up a 24% haste belt for kicks. =) Sold a few already, and a few other drops I've collected. I'm on my 8th cudgel, and took a group to try the final fight only to have it turn into a bloodbath followed by nasty nasty CR's... All in all, I rate this zone A+ for shaman. Recommend HP buffs, resist magic, and epuration if you have them. Keep resists up, as there are ALOT of casters. As per XP, north is 2kills=1% (which is simple to do without kei, with kei and virtue I am a lawnmower =) as per west, I guess it works about out to 1.5=1 (or 3=2) and south I'm actually getting very very close to 1=1. Quick summary of the key to enter charisis... go to kaesora and kill xalgoz in the library. Loot a fang and if no other shamans need it, the necklace (for 8th cudgel =). Go to LOIO and kill Chancellor of Di'Zok for a jade chokdai prod (or about 300p in the bazaar nowadays). Turn in is a frog in SONH, D-something. Indiff to all, kinda near oowump (within sight of him, so be careful getting there, if you are KOS). Key is soulbound on entrance, and well well worth the minimal effort to get. A few other notes, I find necros are your best friends in Charisis, as it's primarily undead. About the only thing you can do for a necro is slap regen on them to help out there duration-canni-type-spell. Not a whole lot they can do for you, however... I've duo'd quite a bit there with a few necros that go down there, and let me tell you, your slow + jbb/alpha pet + tank abilities with their undead toys will add up to some fun. You can slow and heal, and SHOULD have some decent HP's (if you dont, and just concentrate on wis... please delete yourself and make a druid...) Once things here are slowed, regen + hp + armor=tank. Stoic helps that much more. When I get around to writing my own guide to leveling, this is going in there.. and I'd recommend north wing at 50 in a group, or about 56 solo. If you are a kei and virtue junkie, probably sooner. I tend to avoid them if I can. With the new canni4, I only take 4 mins to go from 0m to full mana/health. Sitting with kei takes me about 6.<br />
<br />
After all my pessimisim (sp?) about other zones, I'm glad I found one that's fun, entertaining, and &quot;worth it&quot;. Since it is quite possible to overpull and need to gate, it makes it a HELLUVA lot more fun than boring static spawn camps, but the xp-to-risk factor is high enough I'm gonna keep coming back time after time foir a while now.<br />
<br />
Edit... forgot to mention. As per how long this is good for, a few 65 buddies now live here too. They do the east wing, and get 1% aa per kill and routinely perform genocide. It's a shaman/ranger duo, I've hung out with them a bit, and we move fast.. I basically am just another DoT for them, and play healer on large pulls, but it's quite fun in this zone.<br />
<br />
Btw, I did make a trip to the hole, and managed to kill me a good named that was trained to zoneline. DO NOT BOTHER with this zone. Not sure how it is farther in, but omg the entrance was rough. I hung around for a bit, then helped out a few people with CR's... I hate it and wont go back... not worth it for me.</div></div><hr />

Yep, you're Keyed.  Key is soulbound, so once you have entered you don't need a key ever again.  Thats because if you died, you'd have to redo the quest just to CR by yourself.  <br />
<br />
To be sure, type /key.  It'll list all the &quot;keys&quot; on your soulbound list.  It'll say Charasis or Howling Stones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The spiders are blue till 60, but it's not what I would call &quot;The fastest xp possible&quot;.<br />
<br />
In fact, i would venture to say that, unless you have an extremely fast killing &quot;Top Shelf&quot; group, Velks is about the slowest xp in the game.<br />
<br />
They have nerfed xp in Velks so many times, I'm surprised your xp bar doesn't go backwards. :mad:<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Charsis is VERY good at that level, just watch out for multiple harm touches. :eek:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you.  As a 49 shaman your informative zone by zone comparisons are priceless.  <br />
<br />
I mostly solo with my shaman, but on days my gf works or goes to school (rare) I two-box with a 60 warrior.  So I am getting funny feelings about east wing.  =).<br />
<br />
One drop I think is definitely noteworthy in HS is the Fingerbone Hoop (earring, think something like ac5 str5 sta5 int5, cha -10, some saves, and worn see invis), either (on quellious) sells for a very pretty penny or is a good upgrade to the shammy who is conscious of his/her hp and melee skills.  <br />
<br />
I first found this zone with my paladin (my main) and it was love at first site.  Besides the occasional goo or golem, pure undead it seems.  One note of mention, if you see a carpet, avoid it at all costs.  Probably about oh 50% of them at least? is a trap and you fall down to basically a swarm of mobs.  Be sure to mention that in your guide. =).  It only take s a person one time to fall to NEVER do it again.  Kinda like when you first touch a a hot stove....<br />
