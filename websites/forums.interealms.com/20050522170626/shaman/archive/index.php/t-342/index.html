The Thurgadin gate potion (no drop), used to save Tanik in the Prayer Shawl Quest, can also be used by any level character currently.<br />
<br />
THERE IS a note on the item description that lists &quot;Recommended level: 60&quot; or something like that, but it is just an added piece of information, not an actual restriction for use right now.  <br />
<br />
It may get changed later, but right now anyone can still use it after making it.  Makes a nice getaway to have if you don't have gate memmed and things get too hot for you.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's an even nicer getaway for melee types without gate.  Doubly so now that the Cazic gate potions are dumping you in the heart of a 55+ zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*OLD* (pre-CT upgrade) cazik potions drop you at the pyramid in the maze.<br />
<br />
*NEW* (post-CT upgrade) are reported to drop you either by the zone line, or in the Feerot. This has been posted on the safehouse, although I have not verified the new potions.<br />
<br />
There is no way to differentiate the potions. ID / name / look ... its all the same. I'm going to head there very soon to get a new one, to at least have a chance to get out alive  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail All,<br />
<br />
There is no level restriction on the GD Gate, however you do have to have the required Trade Skill level though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jowjo,<br />
<br />
Thanks for mentioning that!  I have one of the OLD CT gate potions on an alt...where it will now probably stay.  Definitely don't want to get ported to the pyramid now when low on mana / health in an escape situation! :D<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />
