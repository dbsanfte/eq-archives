<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a lvl 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
I dual-box a bard, who just hit 45.<br />
<br />
I do get exp at 45 when both are grouped together, verified it.<br />
<br />
However, i am wondering how the exp is shared between us:<br />
First, when i slaughter greens with dogdog, does bard gets 100% of the exp?<br />
Do the difference in lvl have a word on the exp sharing?<br />
<br />
Because, i have been killing light blues, greens and blues to the shaman, and exp isn't as great as i expected.<br />
<br />
Any insight appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">XP is still split and your shaman is getting most of it.  I don't know what the percentage is, but it will still be significant. I've done this with a monk where I've put a caster on autofollow and just slaughtered greens as fast as possible and leveling reasonably quickly for little effort. When you hit 46 you will probably get the same xp or better in PoN or PoD in a full group though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, to be blunt, grouping &gt; Pling, for a bard at least.<br />
Bard dps is so sucky, i thought i could make it up with doggy, looks like i was sadly mistaken :)<br />
<br />
But there is still an unanswered question: as long as i kill greenies, i still steal some exp?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Easy fast way to 2 box and gain xp is this Group with bard, pull mob with shaman, root dot and rot, then zone. Bard gets all the xp. Get the bard to 55 and you are all set. At 55 I would Kite stalkers in PoN with Bardy and heal/slow with shaman. I did that with a Cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">XP is being stolen regardless of mob con color even though your Shaman never actually sees it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mighty fine feline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am confused, does the Shaman get the greater amount of xp because he is so much higher or because of his class?  I remember being  told about this a long time ago, so guild members that were higher would not group with the younger ones, so that they would not &quot;steal&quot; xp from the younger ones.  One of my alts is a high 50's ranger that almost always groups with younger players (45-55).  The younger players will say that they got anywhere from 2%-5% per kill if the mobs were DB to me and white-yellow or red to them.  But my xp gain was neglible.  Is the crappy xp for the ranger based on the level of  the mob or her crappy xp gain abilities in general? The same is true in LDoN, she is usually the oldest in the group and gets the least amount of xp compared to the other players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's my understanding that xp is distributed based on level in groups...such that higher level folks get a larger portion of the xp, which makes sense since they should be more effective and require more xp to level.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
You could always *gasp* group with people and actually play the game instead of PLing.  I don't know, call me insane, but I actually play EQ and have fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually the best thing to do is get another toon to within xp range of the bard.. then have the bard run into the hopper caves invis run out ae 20 hoppers get uber xp and pl the other toon :)  just have to run in circles for a long time :)</div></div><hr />

Zhahz mate, i have a 58 monk, a 56 wizard, and a 55 shaman (retired since 2000, don't scream) on the same account as my main 65 shaman. I think i have been playing &quot;normally&quot; more than enough for most of the 3 years ive been playing. You can understand that i had my share of slow lvling at low lvls in the past.<br />
<br />
The fact is lvl 1 to 60 game doesn't interests me anymore at all (does it interest anyone?), i have seen it many times, and i'd rather skip it as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Someone suggested dotting to death and zoning... but it doesnt weild any efficiency.<br />
<br />
So yes, i guess grouping is what i am destined too, again, but i'd rather avoid it. Looks like VI designed the system wisely to avoid me, or any other pet class, destroying lower guk to the benefit of alts :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My experience is the higher the con of the mob to the highest person, the more exp is had by the lower level.  A zone you could try is nurga solo with the shaman and have the bard doing mana song or hp song or both ( i really dont know bard songs).  Mobs have relatively low hp and come single and you can get a little cash selling some of the nicer named's drops.<br />
<br />
Bard charm wipes the aggro list also...so if you have shaman out of group with bard and then get a mob down low, charm with bard, and then break charm/kill..should be relatively efficient.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could just play the bard solo and swarm kite and probably level faster than powerleveling.  Just keep the shaman nearby for heals and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you want to PL a bard, you're going about it the wrong way. <br />
<br />
All you need to do is: <br />
<br />
1) Get him an earring of the solstice (ft 1).<br />
2) Get him boots of flowing slime (ft3) or some other ft2+ item (not easy)<br />
3) Learn to swarm kite using charm. <br />
4) Buff him up and get the shaman the heck out of the way. <br />
<br />
Bard solo'ing is stupidly fast and broken due to swarm kiting - IF the bard has some mana regeneration. Basically nothing increases a bard's mana regen except mental clarity AA or flowing thought items. And charm takes 20 (?) mana  a pop at that level. Normally you're getting back 1 mana /tick, or 10 mana per minute. This isn't nearly enough for continuous charm kiting. The L 39 charm takes 60 mana, and lasts at most one minute. Due to mobs dying or charm breaking, you need more than 60 mana/minute for continuous charming. <br />
<br />
With a few points of FT, you can nearly continuously swarm kite and make phenomenal experience solo. I have little doubt that you can level much faster this way than with a shaman PL'ing you in the 40's and 50's. The drawback is that you'll need to work melee skills separately. <br />
<br />
A normal untwinked bard can't do this all that fast, as the price of boots of flowing slime or other tradable high-FT item (there are very few a bard can use) is beyond them. But if you can afford to twink the bard, or loan him something off your shaman, he can solo for exp very fast without further aid. Even with only FT4, you can go almost continuously, if you swarm kite a pack down and then kill the last one with good old-fashioned fear/snare/melee or chant kiting. <br />
<br />
Bard swarm kiting exp is one of the broken things in the game, and is the reason that the bard PoP charm spell sucks so badly (very low level of mobs charmable).  At L 65 a bard can charm nothing in zones worth good exp, but up until L 60ish a bard can make obscene solo exp if he knows how. I personally wish they'd find a way to break swarm kiting and up the level a high level bard can charm, but that's not likely. Until they do... enjoy. ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I guess I just see things differently.  I don't see anything amazingly different about the game at 60+ compared to 1-59.  Content scales with level but it's all about the same.  You might raid more at the highest levels but you could do raids of sorts at lower levels if you wanted to organize it.<br />
<br />
You might do some LDoN with your bard...at least til he hits 50.  You can gain a level every 2-3 adventures easily.  At 50+ LDoN experience slows down unless you do high diff.  I can get 20% of a level per adventure on high diff...but I only do high diff rarely with a particular crowd of friends.  At your bard's level this would probably be faster than PLing via shaman+pet.<br />
<br />
I'm in my 2nd EQ life - my 1st was from release thru just before Kunark - it took me around a year to get my wizard to 50 at that time - and I spent a LOT of time in Lower Guk.  Lately I've been very tempted to revisit LGuk with my shaman and do some romping for nostalgic reasons.  It'd be a sharp contrast to have LGuk to myself...since back in the day it was a permanently overcamped madhouse.<br />
<br />
As a side note, you'll have to forgive me as I'm not a big fan of powerleveling in general.  I'm happy to see that the EQ2 devs are looking prevent it in that game - and they see it as an exploit and design flaw in EQ.  PLing is in essence abusing gameplay for unfair gains...ie, cheating.  I've seen many reasons given for PLing...but it still boils down to the same thing.  Obviously many people disagree with this and are very fond of the PLing concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My main is a bard and the best advice I seen here is to either learn to swarm kite (fast xp from 45 to 60! - good guides on www.eqdiva.com) OR go solo with your shaman and set the bard up as a mana battery.  If the bard's melee skills or defense are not maxxed, you should have him duel your pet to get them up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">At L 65 a bard can charm nothing in zones worth good exp, but up until L 60ish a bard can make obscene solo exp if he knows how.

<br />
Here is what you do:<br />
<br />
1)  Pull every mob in zone.<br />
2)  Get them in a cluster<br />
3)  Run in a circle<br />
4)  Sing AE dots<br />
<br />
It takes a long time to work down their HP, but when you are killing 60 mobs at once it is worth it.  My friend alternates between killing all of field1 in fire, and all of the mephit village.  Takes about 25 minutes per kite and he gets 2.5-3aa.  He maxed his AA within a month of creating his character.  I'd say that is pretty obscene exp, and you don't even need to be 65.  You just need selos, an ae dot, and some manual dexterity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not many know about the Level PLing. At 45/46 you can group with a level 65. Level 65 will NOT steal xp as long as mobs are green to level 65 and blue/yellow to level 45)<br />
<br />
Have tested this by having 3 level 65 in a group killing greens with a level 45 in the group. Level 45 was getting all the xp. No change when he killed them himself.<br />
<br />
LEVEL PLing WORKS !! (as long as it is within group limits</div></div><hr />
