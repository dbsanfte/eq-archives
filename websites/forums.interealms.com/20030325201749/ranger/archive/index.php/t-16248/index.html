<br />
*edit* Or you can do the quest in PoStorms by giving peices dropped by Diaku raiders to the gnome across from Askr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Elessar Elfstone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you have any more information on this alternate quest into Drunder?<br />
<br />
Some people in my guild missed our first 2 Behemoth kills and they wont stop whinning about it, and its getting on my nerves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Basically Elessar, the Diaku Raiders (4) spawn one time a day, only drop a piece 50 or so % of the time (or so I hear).  They are soloable as they do not summon.  Im guessing every 'piece' that one turns in is identical, but not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ilaas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You need 4 different pieces from the Daiku raiders.<br />
Upper left corner, Upper right corner, lower right corner, lower left corner.  You need to cast identify on them to find out which section is which.<br />
<br />
The quest can be MQed.  Thats how I was flagged for PoT.</div></div><hr />

Very buggy!!  We would have had it in the bag if the gnome didn't decide at one point to just run back to his spawn point and poof. We never got to the dragon :( We'll be trying again soon.</div></div><hr />

That's for gaining entrance to the factory though, not &quot;really&quot; related to PoTac other then the fact you need one person with Xannamech flag to open door to factory.<br />
<br />
Worked fine btw the times I've done it, just keep clearing ahead of him, dont go through doors, and keep someone in the back to mez him.</div></div><hr />
