<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moonhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was grouped with a 65 Shaman who kept Ferine Avatar on the group at all times. We had no bard in the group, yet when I tried to use Guardian of the Forest, it wouldn't take hold. I checked the stacking on Lucy's and there is no difference in the stacking information between Avatar and Ferine Avatar. When Proccing my Primal, I have always been able to engage GoTF with no problem.<br />
<br />
Is this really an issue or did I miss something else?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the only thing I know of that it won't stack with is bard warsongs, did you have a bard in your group at the time? if no were you full buffs? i've had a few times where i've used it but was full from either a dot or a heal over time spell that filled my last free buff slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaggezin Bloodsteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I 2box my shaman all the time and ferine myself, never had a prob with gotf stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dimstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sure you weren't full buffs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moonhawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll check it again. I'm pretty sure I wasn't full buffs. I must have had something that didn't stack. Just can't think what it might have been. If I come across it again I'll let you all know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">From my experience it stacks with everybuff. Only time it won't work is: - <br />
a) Full Buff<br />
b) On a horse</div></div><hr />
