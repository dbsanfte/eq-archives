He's completely dismissed anything we have to say no matter how many facts we back it up with.  Unless somebody further up the line is jerking his chain (in which case we'd get as ****ty an upgrade as he can possibly get away with), then don't expect anything.<br />

It's pretty clear he's got some kind of axe to grind.<br />

over our frustration has just sent me over the top--forget I posted this, forget any changes, forget EQ. Go visit some places you used to like before your last days run out on your end billing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Easy there fellas ... don't crucify Brenlo because he's got a sense of humor.  Crucify him because SOE isn't providing data or a sense of vision for what shaman are supposed to be.<br />
<br />
Frankly, what he posted on that SOE board was the truth ... he's our community relations manager, that's his job ... so we may as well figure out how to work *with* him to address our issues instead of trying to find a way to have him replaced.  If he wants to laugh and chuckle, that's cool, and IMO it just shows he's taking things in stride.  I'd much rather see the issues addressed than see anyone fired for doing their job.  We have to realize that from SOE's standpoint, they've got lots of classes they all have to integrate and there's a lot of underlying management and class politics associated with any given class change, especially fundamental core changes like what shaman need at this point.<br />
<br />
I think SOE needs to cough up some data to support their argument though, and tell us as players where they're coming from and why, or how can we possibly hope to come up with some &quot;compelling counter-argument&quot; when we don't even know what we're countering other than opinion.<br />
<br />
Opinion is VERY tough to argue.<br />
<br />
For the record - here's what Brenlo posted on page 4 in response to someone saying they didn't think Brenlo represented us very well ...<br />
-- Brenlo<br />
Sorry you feel that way, but as far as communication to the Dev team, you are stuck with me.  MUAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA<br />
<br />
I'm not gonna read anything bad into that except he's just trying to lighten the mood a little ... which as a PR guy - that's his job.</div></div><hr />

but you missed what he did edit ...<br />
<br />
wich was him ridiculing us, and saying how if we didn't be quiet and do what we were told, he would close all the threads and start banning people, (wich he did to a point)<br />
<br />
chutoi's post about ryan and how he wasn't listening and was &quot;i'll equipped for the job&quot; was edited by brenlo, then a few other people who defended chutoi got banned / posts edited.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ryan needs to go.  He either <br />
1) Hasn't a clue about shaman desirability or<br />
2) Flatly doesn't give a damn if shamans are the least desirable class (and they are) for GoD groups.  <br />
<br />
I'm leaning towards number 2 for an explanation. This guy is no good, let's get him fired.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have a couple of items to address.  They are just pet peeves and I am addressing them here rather than than eq.forums because I feel Brenlo is a tad heavy-handed in editing and deleting posts.<br />
<br />
Did I actually read the following excerpt correctly?  Brenlo said ...<br />
<br />
...&quot;So many of you think that class balance is just a magic wand wave away.  It's not.  We have to attempt to maintain each classes uniqueness while moving the class forward.&quot;<br />
<br />
Forgive the analogy, but I am not going to projectile vomit all the same ole-same ole shaman frustrations.  I know them, you know them, we all seem to know them ... but Ryan.<br />
<br />
BUT, in the last year and a half, when did I get advanced forward?  What the hail content did I miss?  And someone define a shaman's uniqueness for me please.  I seem to have forgotten what the word means.<br />
<br />
Secondly, would someone with more guts than I school Brenlo in the fact that he is Kummunity Relations Personnel ....  he isn't customer relations, he isn't public relations ... those are people you can personnally reach out and touch.  He is virtual Kummunity Relations Personnel.  (fyi - that is the way I learned to spell it, there are various others, but for this post I will stick to what I know).<br />
<br />
And as an aside, on a personal level, I feel Brenlo's sense of humor is very ill-timed.  It is hard to defuse a situation by laughing at it.  Maybe if he took us more seriously, we would afford him the same courtesy.<br />

do you even play a shaman ? im not saying that to start trouble or single you out, im being curious.<br />
<br />
do you play one of the other 3 broken classes? monk ? shadow knight ? berserker ?</div></div><hr />

I'll just ignore this comment since you would be singing a completely different tune if just about anyone else in your daily life showed as much incompetence.<br />
<br />
-If your child's school teacher couldent grasp the concept of addition and tried to tell your son how wrong he was when its obvious who is wrong. <br />
<br />
-If you were shortchanged everyday at the gas-station by an attendant that doesnt believe you should get as much change as you think you are entitled to.<br />
<br />
-You were given a Greyhound ticket by the travel agent rather than the airliner you paid for and were still expected to make it to Hawaii.<br />
<br />
Where I work, If you cant do your job, you get fired. Sorry for ya...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok Kurth, so I make a statement that it's wrong to try and get someone fired and you ask me if I play a shaman. Because, clearly, if I do play a shaman I must want to get Ry(t)an fired? Man, that makes sense.<br />
<br />
I play an elemental shaman and I didn't purchase him. I picked his starting stats incorrectly and the world still turned. I attended every single encounter in person to get my elemental flags, and I even did every SolRo mini (not a major achievement but I wonder how many people actually did them all). I have done each kill multiple times. I have since attended the killing of every single elemental raid/ring/pop/blah that there is with the exception of Coirnav, and the Rathe. I have tried Xegony but haven't won yet. I only have 160aa but that is my fault for raiding all the time I guess. I have some good equipment and some so so equipment. I've done my VT key and been on VT clears. Does that mean I play a Shaman? Am I allowed to post here now?<br />
<br />
The other 3 broken classes........ hrm... well, no I don't play on of those three. I do have a 52 ranger and a level 10 necro. Should I come back when I have played one of the others? Riiiiiight.<br />
<br />
A few months ago I was questioning some of the long term time Shaman about why they felt marginalized. Now I get to be that person! I have gone from constantly changing buffs in and out to seeing most of the guild max out on stamina, not need primal essence, not ask for agi, or diaku. I see the issues first hand. I even got the chance to go on a vexd run and be a chanters Malos bitch. What fun.<br />
<br />
Ok, so I play a Shaman, was there any other question?<br />
<br />
<br />

Great life lesson examples Monjay, but I thought you were ignoring the comment? Interesting.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't, and won't be singing a different tune in real life. I am astounded at the ferocity of the attacks you guys are making against &quot;The spell guy&quot;. It's almost painful to think that you might act like this in your daily lives. Ry(t)an is an employee of SoE and we are not his managers. If someone messes up then I highlight it to them, and consider escalating it to their management if I feel that I was either not taken seriously, or that it won't change. I do not march in screaming and shouting to fire someone because I don't like them, or don't like what they told me.<br />
<br />
What do I know? I have worked in the IT industry for some of the largest financial institutions on the planet for over a decade, so my experience in how people handle communications issues, and differences of opinion is surely way below anyone elses.<br />
<br />
For the record, my opinion is not that the SoE spell guy is incompetent. I see people here calling for his head, and calling him a liar, and all the rest of the angry threatening posts that have no real meaning and I wonder why on earth Brenlo even allows his people to come here. I act differently in game than I would in my daily business and get angry and over react to stuff all the time. I guess I do it because it's anonymous and why do I want to play myself in a video game? I want to be something/someone different. However, I don't want to subject anyone to the kinds of crap I see some people posting on here. The way Kurth went after Gloriana should have been enough to have him banned from here. <br />
<br />
I want to see changes made, but not at the expense of someone getting fired, or having to read such utter anonymous hatred. So, Monjay, don't be sorry for me as there really isn't anything to be sorry about. Just let me go back to my comment, which is really all I should have had to say:<br />
<br />
stop talking about getting people fired. It's wrong, and inappropriate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Give him a new job with less responsibility then. Make him a quest designer. There are lots of old succesful quests that he can copy.<br />
<br />
If there's one thing no one can dispute, it's the fact that Rytan has been very conservative. Slapping 10% on everyone's healing or damage spell is as safe as it gets, but it also suggests that the status quo is actually &quot;fine&quot;, which, for Shamans, it definitely is not.<br />
<br />
Rytan isn't willing to make significant changes for anybody, but that's what is required in order to get Shamans back on track. I can see why Rytan doesn't care. <br />
<br />
Brenlo, or whoever his boss is, seems to be happy with how he's doing his job and that's really all that matters to him.</div></div><hr />
