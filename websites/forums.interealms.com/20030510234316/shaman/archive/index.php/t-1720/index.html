<br />
Why would a Kunark mob turn you into a mob that doesn't exist in Kunark?  Mana Dot and -40 int/wis?  Kraggy Krup was rough..but this would be extrremely difficult..and people would fight him just for fun to be orcs!<br />
<br />
This is a hoax.</div></div><hr />

Have you read the lore behind Thuuga at all?<br />
<br />
&quot;Venril establishes himself in the Dreadlands and begins to rebuild the shattered ruins of the Karnor. His minions raid caravans for weapons and supplies, and he begins to build expeditionary forces. He magically perverts some of the mortals to make a legion of lycanthropes, led by Thuuga, a wizard Iksar serpent changer. &quot;<br />
<br />
So it would seem it would be within his power to change someones form, makes more sense that he has an ability like this than being just a pure melee mob. As it was the encounter was too easy in my opinion, this just adds a bit of fun to it.<br />
<br />
This is not a hoax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds reasonable..but an Orc Centurion?  That part made no sense.<br />
<br />
Also when you characterize an encounter as 'easy' for you and a friend..couldja mention..just in passing..that you're a 60 shaman? It kinda puts things into perspective for those of us who are in the low 50's (no epic yet) and need to put a group together..:)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the update..can't wait to whack this guy now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont know if it changes you into an orc centurion....all spells in the spdat uses orc centurion for the 'spell cast on someone' part.<br />
As i mentioned, i resisted it every time, i have no clue what 'Changing Appearance Into A 137' will actually do to you.<br />
<br />
Good luck with with him and on the rest of the quest :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glad I already did him and Kraggy before this change........that's my story and I'm sticking to it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cikkiwhitebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did Thuuga a few days ago, and early in the fight the MA turned into a goblin.  It made for an amusing fight -- just a fun watch.  :)<br />
<br />
The orc centurion bit is just the spdat thing Skek was talking about.  <br />
<br />
And it's not a hard fight if you can get a slow to stick.  Without slow, it just hits too hard and fast.  Our MA was a 52 sk.  We had also a 44 druid, 55 necro and myself, 59 shaman.  <br />
<br />
And Skek, thank you SO MUCH For your help with my cudgel.  I'm so glad I went to Droga that day.  Thank you for your kindness and generosity.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arsenak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe it does turn you into a goblin, as, many people on our server think its cute to drag their dead &quot;goblin form&quot; bodies and stack them up at the DL zone inside FM... hehe...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I couldn't stick slow -- died the first time I tried him. The second time I let the MA (a level 51 monk) build aggro and then I stuck insidious decay and plague of insects on him instead. Didn't want to risk aggro from trying to stick slow too much. I was alternating Malosi and slow -- couldn't get them to stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was running around last night trying to get HQ brute hides for my friend and came across him. Conned amiable to me, but he agro'd my friend's druid. So I casted slow a couple times and stuck it to get it off the druid and ran him to the zone and zoned out. I'm 55 and it wasn't too hard to stick slow on him.</div></div><hr />
