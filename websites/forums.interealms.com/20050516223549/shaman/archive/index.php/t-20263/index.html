<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There was a very similar thread posted not long ago, but I didn't want to hijack it, so I started a new one.<br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does any other shaman out there notice that mobs dispell us more than any other class?<br />
It's a standing joke between me and my RL buddies, but we can be fighting down in sebilis(we go back for fun every now and then) and we can be fighting a couple casters.. if any caster decides to dispell, it always goes after me. I have seen my friends get dispelled maybe 5 times in total after maybe 300 trips to OS.. and I have been dispelled too many times to count.<br />
<br />
So, has anyone noticed that shaman get dispelled more than other people, or is it just that mobs like to dispell me?<br />
<br />
BTW, people I group with are warrior, necro, mage, druid and cleric.<br />
<br />
I also play my rogue and chanter sometimes in sebillis also, and almost never get dispelled using those characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've not noticed that I'm dispelled more than anyone else in my party.<br />
<br />
Maybe the mobs ARE out to get just you Einnod (just kidding with ya).<br />
<br />
Now I am sure that my invis pops before anyone else’s.  Funny thing is the necro I was partnering with yesterday told me that he was sure his invis was the worst in the game. I didn't believe him till his popped in-between camps in Droga.  After the unexpected fight I had to concede his point.<br />
<br />
edited-I'm never satisfied with only one way to spell a wurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You should tell your necro buddy to get that shadow skin invis spell, I am pretty sure it's fixed duration ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Long time ago I tested this and found out that mobs dispell the player with the most buffs. This was during Kunark and may have changed, but back then I tested this thoroughly with 4 toons clicking off buffs in front of a rooted jin frog.<br />
Which class does usually have the most buffs on themselves? You guessed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What Giac posted seems to make sense... All I know is that whenever I'm in Hate duo or with a group, without fail, every mob that has the ability to dispell will dispell me. It drives me insane...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Interesting, I would have thought that they would be after folks with agro, but I can see the game mechanics going after those with more buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well, that is very interesting, Giak, I will have to test that. I do keep myself fully buffed all the time, and I know the other classes I play with don't care either way.</div></div><hr />
