<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I know this belongs in the tech support forum, which is why I posted it there:<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24326<br />
But since I for one don't read that forum often (just because it isn't too active), and I figure the same is true for a lot of others, I thought I'd just ask that if you have ever used EQ on Linux, especially if you have compiled WINE yourself on Linux, please help me out in the above thread.  I think this is a legitimate use of this forum, but if I'm not supposed to be advertising my posts in other forums, please feel free to move/delete this thread oh mighty moderators ;)  I wouldn't normally bother with this, but I'm an addict and I'm hurting for my fix of EverCrack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh, one other reason for posting here was that the tech forum is traditionally where people go for help on problems with running EQ in Windows.  Therefore, while the majority of the people that frequent it know Windows like the back of their hand, I needed Linux experts and so I thought I might try here.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Did you read any of the posts in that search Ungkor? Was almost zero useful information in it.<br />
<br />
Get Cedega from TransGaming (http://www.transgaming.com/). Then check their EverQuest (http://www.transgaming.com/gamepage.php?gameid=10) page for information on getting it to work. That's probably the easiest way to get EQ running in Linux.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Phive</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get Cedega from TransGaming (http://www.transgaming.com/). <br />
<br />
I'm rather broke though, so I plan to download the source code for WINE, compile it, and use it to run EQ <br />
<br />
Did you read his post?  :confused: <br />
<br />
<br />
For the Gentoo distro, but it may help a bit. Click a'me (http://gentoo-wiki.com/HOWTO_WineX_CVS)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tubkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Honestly getting EQ to run under linux is WAY easier than it was a few years ago..<br />
<br />
If you go with Cedega (recomended as perfomance in vanilla wine is ..lackluster)  just save yourself the hassles and let the patcher download all of it. I have found that even though you load the expansion fom disk the patcher still goes and downloads so much that its hardly worth spending the time poping the cds in and out (providing you have a decent connection that is)<br />
<br />
<br />
If you use the Gui frontend for Cedega, Point2Play, and want to get around the patcher just put the following in your ~/.point2play/EQ/games.ini file.  It will give you 2 icons one runs the patcher and the other does not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm going to assume you are using lilo as a boot loader.  If you want to fix your problem you can always do the following.<br />
<br />
su -<br />
/sbin/fdisk -l /dev/hda   (That's lower case L for list)<br />
<br />
Find the drive with the ntfs/win95, FAT32 partition<br />
(note that partition)<br />
<br />
vi /etc/lilo.conf<br />
<br />
add the following entry to the end of the lilo.conf file.<br />
<br />
other=/dev/hdaX  (where x = the drive you found doing fdisk -l)<br />
           optional<br />
           label=Windows<br />
<br />
save your file, then run lilo.<br />
<br />
This is going from Mandrake 9.x though so may vary, I'm pretty sure it's the same. <br />
<br />
If you are using grub or even menu.lst (I think menu.lst is Suse only though /shrug) post here and I can try to help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow, once again Crucible=awesome.  With all the suggestions provided here and in the tech forum thread, I got way more infor than I'd expected, and lots of ideas to work with tonight while listening to the candidates flame each other.  My current plan is to try Angryor's fix for my Windows drive, then try the Gentoo Howto (I swear, the more I learn about Gentoo the more I wish I'd gone with it instead of Mandrake), and if none of that works I may just have to break down and pay for this Cedega thing everyone recommends.  Thanks so much everyone for helping, I'll be sure to report back on how it goes.</div></div><hr />

Toktuk Wartalon:  Nope, but I'm guessing someone asking questions about linux and eq hadn't either:)  <br />
<br />

edit: Looked at the posts:<br />
your suggestions about Transgaming were talked about in that search thread I listed above.</div></div><hr />
