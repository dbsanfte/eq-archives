<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know its been asked a million times but HELP I is broke =(<br />
sitting at lv 58 with non of my 59 spells and missing a few of my 58 spells =( .<br />
I hate lvling without haveing my new spells (done it before)<br />
and as i am looking down the road all i am eeing post 58 is more spells for even more money that i cannot currentlu afford<br />
I have tried to use the search function to get some help but no luck =(<br />
if anyone on emarr has some advice it would help a ton, i've just about given up playing on my shaman in the last few weeks due to the fact of  lack of funds and spell costs looking worse and worse=(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go and level in the large gnoll cave in JPF.  You can do it solo, and usually get about 200 pp in cash drops, + 100 pp in bazaar loot, equal to &quot;pure cash camps&quot; like ice giants. With  the change in exp range nothing should go lb till 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, try hunting in the new LOY zones, good solo area for your level, good loot drops, gems, and decent plat (5-15p per drop)<br />
<br />
or if ya just wanna FARM plat, then try the hill giants in Rathe mountains, you should be able to slice-n-dice your way thru them with a alpha fido. or the ice giants in everfrost (horse or being bound at bank is preferable, since the money is mostly gold, but it adds up quick and encumbers ya)</div></div><hr />

no offense, but bad idea imo doing jpf....the xp at 58 is probably terrible, at 53 it was ok, at 54 it was rediculously slow, like 1 yellow every 2-3 hours. Can only imagine how slow at 58. It is however mind numbingly easy xp, keep making lefts till you drop down. At 54 I was able to clear the first 6-7 spawns before repop. Like I said though, even with almost no down time between kills, xp was still really slow.<br />
<br />
Lot of folks say seb is great for cash, and decent xp I'd guess at 58. I have only been there a couple times though, and I never solod so I'm not sure really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">sorry forgot to add that i have tried the Hgs in rath but usually on emarr there are to many DrOOds there to get many of them the icegiants are camped 99.9% of the time in my play time (usually about 6:30-12pm est) and the sea furreys are even worse (except in that case its usually my dad camping them :rolleyes: )<br />
been there done that in dulak and sence the nerf stick beat the hell out of the zone the cash is much harder to come by and the gem drops are almost gone also  :( <br />
tried OS lastnight and died several time just trying to get around the corner not sure if i am just haveing a bad few weeks or what but its seems that eveytime i go and try and make some cash evey mob and its brother comes by to beat the heck out of me  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you just want cash, farm some of the more in demand tradeskill items: Velium, Hides, Silks, Dye components (for Ribbons), Acrylia, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My advice is to never, ever waste time going specifically after plat.<br />
<br />
In Tier 1, try to form groups for Consorts in PoN (silks sell for 250-300pp), Mephits in PoN (lots of gems), or castle in PoD (lots of gems).<br />
<br />
Keep leveling and get your 61/62 spells for free as you gain experience. After that, get into BoT/HoH groups and win some spectrals (most people don't even roll anymore) as well as loot you can sell for cash, such as windblades and ornate. Do whatever you can to get flagged for Tactics as the loot there is insane and spectral/rune drop rate is better than BoT.<br />
<br />
PoP spells will supplant most of the 50-60 spells so I wouldn't recommend spending much time or money on acquiring them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nec jail in sebilis is decent exp, and you might be able to solo it at 58 (once broken, it's easy, just that first time is tough), and you can easily make 1500p/hour.<br />
<br />
New droga mobs aren't bad exp, though a ton of hp, but each drop 15-20p cash.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, you're right about the point where you just have to change your philosophy.  You aren't going to have all your spells when you doing probably the rest of the way to 65, just accept it and pick them up as you can, aiming for the vital ones first.  It's just the way things go~</div></div><hr />

 :mad:<br />
<br />
Nerf stick in Dulak?  Really?  huh.  I was there 2 nights ago on my server (Rodcet) for about 3 hours.  at 100% AA I made about 40%.  I left with 414 plat and assotrted other coin, 2BD's 3 diamonds and 8 other gems of various quality.  I had another 100 or so plat in weapons and about 12 research pages for a few classes.  <br />
<br />
Now granted, I was on Oceancrasher (second to last) boat and the exp wasnt stellar, but I was able to keep the boat and dock clear and grab some greens/lt blues from the shore areas.  I was 58.  No epic, pretty standard gear.  Slow, cripple, then Bane and jbb if I wanted to get mana or tank IN TEH FACE with alpha behind mob.<br />
<br />
what was the nerf again?</div></div><hr />

At level 65 w/ my current gear and spells I have no problem soloing the NG camp in Seb. I bought 2 major spells like Focus of 7th for 45k and Quiescence for 35k and this was camping the NG. To me it's one of the best cash spots. Right now I'm working on getting plat for Blood of Saryrn.</div></div><hr />
