<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had just started up EQ about a month ago, on the advice of a friend, and I love it.  I picked a Shaman because they seemed versitile, and went Barbarian because my friend was a goodie-two-shoes High Elf, so I figured it best if we could work together more easily.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have made level 20 just before downtime today.  I have been looking at some Shaman guides and message boards, and I have some questions.  I tend to plan ahead and am looking at what I hope to obtain as far as equipment goes.<br />
<br />
I hear WIS gear is only most effective up to 200 WIS, after that you want +MANA items, is this so?  <br />
<br />
A lot of people preach the effectiveness of +HP and +AC equipment for Cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
I am thinking of something along these lines, eventually.  WIS in the 200 - low 200 range, with +MANA items to have a decent mana pool.  Then go for +HP and +AC equipment to stay alive and make use of Cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Does this sound like a good idea?  <br />
<br />
What I want is a mana pool good enough so I dont run out of mana into every normal battle.  I want good HP and AC to stay alive through that battle.  I would like enough HP so I can use Regen+Cannibalize to get back my mana quicker.<br />
<br />
What should I look for to achieve this?<br />
<br />
Thanks to you all in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What class is your goody two shoes friend?  Paladin?  If so, then he'll be tanking and you'll be healing him so more wis and mana would be good.  If he's an int caster, then you'll be doing the tanking so you'll want hp and ac!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am personally happy with a wisdom aroud 165-175.  Getting KEI before each gamming session (a 20pp donation each time) will add a ton of manna (1000 (?)) and about 20 wis. After that, go for AC and HP. You will get better items with wisdom automatically attached to it as you progress in levels.  If you a tweek, those rules dont apply so much, but it doesnt sound as though you are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For the effectiveness of wis - after 200 wis, you get less mana per point of wisdom, but you still get some, it's a soft cap.<br />
<br />
If you're *just* going for mana pool, you'd look at +mana and +wis items, and try to get a balance to give the biggest mana pool. Magelo helps for this.<br />
<br />
However, a shaman is not a druid. For a shaman, of course, HP is good for cannibalization, and you can convert HP to mana, but then, if you have a big mana pool, that might not bother you so much.<br />
<br />
But, the biggest consideration to my mind, the one thing you need as a shaman, is to be able to withstand a beating from the mob you just slowed or tried to slow, and got a resist from. If you get beaten to a bloody pulp at the first resist, and die before you have a chance to slow again, you need to work on HP and AC some more. I know I did. :)<br />
<br />
Up to your mid 40s, it's not so important, work on wis and mana if that's easier. But if you intend to play into your 50s, bear in mind that a shaman doing his job as slower *will* be tanking from time to time, and you'll need to work on your HP to improve your survivability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would recommend holding off on new equipment until you are 24th level.  Canni/regen is one of the three biggest changes in a shaman's life (pet and stoicism/torpor are the others).  Once you see how those spells affect your play then you can make far more informed decisions about equipment.  <br />
<br />
24 is not that far away and it will give you time to save a little more money and be able to buy even better equipment.<br />
<br />
I made long term decisions with my equipment since this is my second shaman.  The game is pretty easy up into the 40s and equipment will have less of an importance.  A decision to buy equipment that will be useful at 50th and beyond will not hurt you much now and will save you a ton of money replacing outdated equipment.</div></div><hr />
