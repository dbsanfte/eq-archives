<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, the past few days a ranger friend and I duo'd in the Causeway, me 69 shammy elemental and 68 ranger elemental.  Was cakewalk until today when it took all my mana to keep him afloat and providing no DPS vs mainly Q yesterday and chaining nukes.<br />
<br />
So what gives? Anyone else experiencing this? Stealth nerfage? And this is on trash mobs.  We had to resort to root rotting and archery.  Now I know that mitigation was put back in, but it seemed way more difficult than just going from 75% to 50% slow.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was a glitch, or from what I understand anyway, we were givin (unintentionally) a short time of nostalgia, good luck finding any real answer besides the common -***-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i had the same thing.  earlier in the week i was able to have nice, steady, somewhat slow pulls grinding out some 66 exp with my warrior (65) and shaman (66).<br />
<br />
i went from being able to hold a camp of 7 per 20 min respawn (go go warrior DPS!) to having to take extened canni breaks just to manage a somewhat safe 3 spawn.<br />
<br />
mobs went from fully slowable and doubling for 620-ish to partially slowable and quadding.  it was much more than just a slow nerf, the mobs were kicked up a fair bit as well.<br />
<br />
edit:  for perspective, this is against the lvl 65 elite dragorn mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup, same observation here.  Even yard trash in NC is now mostly slowable and worse quad.  And if slow bounces, your tank gets the tar kicked out of him until you can slow.  I'm definitely not going to slow/heal now, too much risk if the slow bounces, too much mana to malos, slow, and cast several Q's every pull.  Back to the trinity.  :(</div></div><hr />
