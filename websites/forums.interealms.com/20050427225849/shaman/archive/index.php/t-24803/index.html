<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pleh1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm an old shaman, sold my account and have come back to eq and as such am leveling a new shaman.  I thought I'd give some info on the path I took to get to where i'm at and what my plan is from here.<br />
<br />
Lvl 1 - 10 - Field of Bone.  Sure you can do alot of other places but hey its a great place, book is near when you need to sell/rebuff and almost always lower lvl people here to group with.  If your being powerleveled still a great zone, if you need to solo or group un-powerleveled then as I mentioned its still great.<br />
<br />
Lvl 11 - 13  Kurns Tower.  I did this for a few levels.  Mob's dont agro unless ur ontop of them, no trains really, good, fast exp.  Often groups are available here.  Again both a great zone if your being plvled or not.<br />
<br />
Lvl 14 - 22 PC (parnal Caverns? sp?).  The exp in this zone is just insane.  Grouped up at one of the bandit camps the exp flies with a great group.  if your being powerlvled beware you can EASILY out distance your skills you need (casting) because the exp is just that great...  With one or two good pulls you can ding some of the early (14/15) lvls with a solo bandit camp clear out (DS shield).  In a group the exp is still great but starts to taper off at 22nd.<br />
<br />
Lvl 23- 34 (so far).  I love sol A.  I've hunted it for every character I've played since shrink was implimented (couldnt on my first ogre warrior cuz i got stuck to often).  Mobs arent that hard, yes they run, yes they bring friends but with spells like Temp and hp gear being so cheap its still a decent zone solo or grouped even when your not powerlvled.  IF your being plvled by a druid this zone REALLY shines.  Have the druid pull mobs while you med, bring 4-5 mobs (you can bring more if you want) and cast your ae disease spell (Incid somethin?).  It only hits up to 4 mobs i think and once you damage them the druid's ds does the rest.  My druid does 53 points of DS every hit... Cast as you need, conserve mana if u gota, only takes one hit... tank if u want too for those MUCH needed defence points.  Keep moving deeper in.  Up to about 30th or so i pull the bar area, camp there and end up pullin all the mobs to the throne room by the time the bar repops... Some 'ok' gear u can tribute or even sell for a few pp, plus TONS of finesteel.  Made probably 1k plat off the FS and other stuff (8 backpacks) from 22nd to 30th.  After 30th, go kill gnomes... sure you might care about your faction but as other posts have stated there is NO better exp location at this level then here.  Again solo, grouped, plvled or not it just rocks.  Get a partner (melee prefered) and go to town. Keep pulls small, use your slow and you'll lvl fast.  Plvled i bring 4 or 5 again, dis dot and tank as desired for Defense gains.<br />
<br />
34-40.  Currently still plannin on stayin in Sol A till exp really slows down.  If you can get a group going and get into a City of Mist one then do as thats the next hostspot in my opinion.  But exp is still good, Dog Dog will help you tear down these gnomes.<br />
<br />
40-50  Going to do CoM.  I've plvled a zerker here and my guild kept going how do you do it... 2 lvls a day easy, sometimes 1 lvl per hour (i only play a few hours at a time).  Druid buffs with thorns and now i'm taking (def really helps) working offensive skills and usin dog dog.  Not alot of heals needed but might be needed depending on gear/ac.<br />
<br />
Few other thoughts on lvling depending on who or what you might have to help you level.<br />
<br />
30-40 - Mistmoore.  Their revampin the zone soon so this might not be great later on but if you have at least 1 Wizard near your level and a high lvl healer (druid helps with ds) you can mass pull mobs to the crypt (in room underneath coffin in graveyard) and AE kill them.  Heal the wizz as needed, cast your ae spells, and have the druid keep the two of you healed up.  Ride your horses to always be medding.  If you get a good ae group going you'll go from 30th to 40th in 4 hours of playing if no other people in zone faction hunting.  I've done this method twice with a few friends who had wizards at this level and it almost makes you want ot make a wizard and two box with them if someone is willing to pull the zone and heal you two.<br />
<br />
40th - get with a 60th lvl person and have them kill greens (colored to you). You'll rake in exp fast, fast fast.  Sure your def skills will suck but its up to you waht you want.  <br />
<br />
44th+ get with a 65th person and have them quad pull if they can... again huge and fast exp... skills are up to you but your choice.<br />
<br />
Thought i'd share some of my thoughts and opinions of what one might want to do at these levels.</div></div><hr />
