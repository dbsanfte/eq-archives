If so, you might want to troll around some threads and click on some magelo profiles of people around your level, that should give you some idea.    Even with the release of SoL, there really isn't too much of an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Epiphany EQ</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 03:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The primary role of a ranger is to kill stuff if that's what you are asking.  Your damage potential should be at least as good or better than a comparably equipped warrior.  With the addition of Trueshot, a good bow, decent arrows, and some AA skills, archery allows you to out-damage rogues.  This is what you should be doing on raids.<br />
<br />
Depending on your situation, you may be called upon to act as a backup tank.  With good equipment, you can go toe-to-toe with some nasty stuff if you really have to.  You are no warrior, so don't think you are a tank, but in a pinch you'll do.  In some situations, you'll be called upon to Weapon Shield, buying the group 20 seconds of breathing room.<br />
<br />
Finally, you provide some buffing and utility spells, and I find that downtime healing helps the real healers med up faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also heard they did some zone changes as well. Heard CT is a nasty place now.... time to explore again. ;)</div></div><hr />
