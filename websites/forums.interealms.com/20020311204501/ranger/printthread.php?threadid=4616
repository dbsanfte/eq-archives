<p>Murphy's Laws of Everquest <br />
<br />
Everything is camped. <br />
Your corpse will always end up halfway inside a mountain, nowhere in sight of the roads, or under a tree. <br />
The skelton in front of you is there to distract you from the kodiak approaching behind you. <br />
If your attack is going really well, you are in an ambush. <br />
If the MOBs are within range, so are you. <br />
The tougher MOBs invariably attack on two occasions--when they're ready and when you're not. <br />
One MOB is never enough, but two can be entirely too many. <br />
The MOB is not retreating; it's just going to get its friends. <br />
The MOBs you never encounter when armed and buffed always appear during your corpse run. <br />
The MOB you've been camping for hours always spawns 18 seconds after you leave. <br />
Teamwork is essential; it gives the MOBs other people to attack. <br />
Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last, and don't ever volunteer to do anything. <br />
For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. <br />
The greatest danger to your group is a Paladin with a map and a plan. <br />
When the going gets tough, the tank goes linkdead. <br />
A group without healers or bandages is not a group for long. <br />
Your buffs will fade when you need them the most. <br />
Whenever you have plenty of mana, you never miss. <br />
Whenever you are low on mana, every spell fizzles. <br />
When in doubt, gate. <br />
There is not a single bathroom in all of Norrath. <br />
The Armor Class of a piece of armor is inversely proportional as to how good it looks on you. <br />
The item that you want the most drops the rarest. <br />
The item that you want the most is out of your price range. <br />
The item that you want the most was sold at an auction while you were offline. <br />
The item that you want the most was picked up by some moron who didn't know the definition of "No Drop". <br />
The item you'll need tomorrow is No Rent. <br />
The item you accidentally drop will be the most valuable/powerful/important item you carry. <br />
If you can afford it, it's not for sale. <br />
If you want two of them, it's a Lore item. <br />
If you want to sell it, it's a No Drop item. <br />
The High Quality Bear Skin drops every 28 days, the same schedule as PMS. Coincidence? <br />
Even greens kill. <br />
Backstab means never having to say you're sorry. <br />
A bow without arrows seems awfully heavy all of a sudden. <br />
Merchants are perfectly capable of kicking tail and taking names. <br />
Trains have the right of way. <br />
If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid. <br />
The guards are never there when you need them. <br />
Misuse of a combine button in a hurry = highly colorful language. <br />
The time it takes to upload the newest patch is directly proportional to your eagerness to log on. <br />
No two people have ever agreed on a single, precise definition of a twink. <br />
Never forget that your newbie weapon was crafted by the lowest bidder. <br />
A roleplayer drinks to increase his alcohol tolerance; an idiot does it in the Kelethin treetops. <br />
Having a tenth of a bubble of health left is Nature's way of telling you to slow down. <br />
Gnome wizards are proof positive that size does not matter. <br />
The greatest mystery in Norrath is how NPCs figure out what religion you are just by looking at you. <br />
Every shaman on Norrath at one point in his or her life has done the pig joke when someone asked for a SOW. <br />
Only twelve people in all of Norrath are truly happy with their last names. <br />
The last bubble takes forever to fill. <br />
It is somehow discouraging to realize that Qeynos is "SonyEQ" spelled backwards. <br />
<br />
<br />
For every roleplayer there are three phat lewters, one powergamer, two munchkins, six loonies, and one self-described casual gamer. (This rule sums up society in norrath very nicely) <br />
<br />
Casual gamers want to be roleplayers, loonies want to be munchkins, phat lewters want to be powergamers, and powergamers want to be cazic thule. Role players however, want to make 6th level before next thursday, and wouldeth reallyeth appreciateth a soweth. <br />
<br />
Casters don't, tanks can't, healer's won't. Death is the only certainty in norrath  <img src="http://eqforge.com/forums/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />

<p>Sorry, Coryn, but I cornered the Murphy market tonight.<br />
<br />
Best group I've had in several weeks.  It's raining outside.  No, lightening didn't strike.  It's raining a lot outside.  No, the power didn't go out.  I'm having a great time, experience is going well.  Suddenly my monitor looks like the brightness is turned way up, then the image filters down.  No, my monitor didn't blow up.  I turn the monitor off and realize it's wet.  No I didn't spill anything on it.  I tell my group I'm having problems IRL and am gonna log and poweroff my system.  <br />
<br />
Needless to day I won't be playing EQ for a bit because (yep, you guessed it) <b>the ceiling in my office is now the floor of my office and my desk (and computer) are in that soggy mess somewhere</b>.<br />
<br />
Oh, look...rain is forcast for tomorrow...<br />

<br />
That outta the way, hehe that was pretty funny. The one I notice the most is that 99.9% of the time a buff will wear off during the pull or the first kick (your mileage may vary).<br />
<br />
Snare will stick 99/100 times until the 100th time when you need to make a fast getaway  <img src="http://eqforge.com/forums/frown.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
That one extra MOB you don't need will carelessly wander right in the path of your bow on a pull, ouch.<br />
<br />
Merchants like every letter of the alphabet spoken to them but "A" for some reason, think back to newbie days.<br />
<br />
That one small meaningless item (to all classes but yours) will be looted and destroyed before you can even say "STOP" (like those rings off tidal lords for ivy)<br />
<br />
The one person in your guild that has been in the dungeon you're in and needs to guide, will have a bad connection.<br />
<br />
There will always be 1 person in every pickup group (usually a caster - heheh) that thinks we can go in a little farther or a new dungeon "cause we rock" (ie death by peer pressure)<br />
<br />
The druid/shaman in your group who gripes about having to SoW everyone and that it's a mana drain when things are going good anyway, will be the same druid/shaman who will SoW every Tom, **** , and Harry as they walk by for free.<br />
<br />
Every day you will meet at least 1 person who must have like 12 characters and must be confused about which one they're playing. You know the magician pulls, the cleric tanks, and so forth (oh and YOU die).<br />
<br />
At least once a week there will be 1 idiot selling what you just gotta have and 1 of 3 things will happen.<br />
  1. He/She can't wait for you to go to the bank (Gee I'm in Lower Guk and don't carry around 10kpp)<br />
  2. He/She will decide after you agree on a price after 20 minutes of haggling that NM i'm gonna keep it (or similar I didn't know it was worth that much so I'm just gonna keep it)<br />
  3. You're 9pp short of the 10Kpp price (you actually have it on you this time) and he/she can't come down 9pp.<br />
<br />
Ahhh anyway you get the idea.... We've all been there. WHO knows that could have been you on the other end of the tell from me  <img src="http://eqforge.com/forums/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>One of the most important Laws<br />
All battle plans are good untill the 1st shot is fired/spell is cast/swords are clashed. Then it all goes to hell!<br />
 Coryn I must ask. Do you have a military background? Cause i've been in many of these situations you've listed.<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>

<p>I married a ranger, and i know where im going more than she does, so as to that comment on Paladins with a map and a plan, just cuz you have track, doesnt mean you have a good sense of direction P<br />
<br />
but i agree with the rest )</p>

<p>You WILL go LD at exactly the wrong time. For example:<br />
You're camping a rare spawn.<br />
He spawns.<br />
You go Linkdead.<br />
You come back and find the camp is taken, the mob killed, and the corpse looted.<br />
<br />
I go LD at the worst times. Usually when I'm just running around somewhere I'm perfectly fine, but then when I'm leading a raid party I'll go LD all night. <br />
<br />
The other night I was trying to make Trueshots for guildmate Rangers. I bought the Kiola nuts in OOT, and perhaps bought too many, because the boat left just before I got out of the shop. I levitated across the ocean and tracked the siren island, as my SoW goes faster than the boat, so I figured I could drop onto the boat as it passed between the islands. It passes by and I land on the deck safely. A couple minutes pass, and I figure I should be zoning within a matter of seconds. Instead I go LD, and when I come back I'm waiting back on the siren islands, waiting for the boat to go all the way to freeport and come back again. Doh...<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">__________________<br>
