<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I have finally settle on making a warrior for my duo partner with my shaman. I have collected a few pieces of armor and a couple of decent weapons for him. My question comes in is what race? I am a barb shaman and I would like to be able to power level him a little bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thoughts???<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi spoon , <br />
<br />
          I dont think it terms of pairing them up its going to matter alot what you choose. I would think your going to have to decide just like if you were making a warrior that was going to be single played. More so since your shammy is of good race. I have a iksar shaman i duo with my vah shir warrior and i never seem to have problems getting suppies or banking at least one of them. Also Pl'ing the warrior there are enough places to PL where i also think your choice wont matter alot. <br />
<br />
      In terms of playing them together now a race where you can get their hps up a bit easier might help since with a mob slowed hitting them you wont have to heal all that much and can spend mana other ways. Maybe a big race that has the abliity to slam in case your facing caster mobs duo'ed for interrupts might help a bit. I do know i miss the ablilty to FD pull to split mobs or the ability like an SK to snare runners why i also suggest a race with a bit higher stamina for more hps cuz sometimes you have to go with the root route to keep the mob from running. But all said and done equipment can fix some of that so really can be just what you want to play and still works out well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ogres make the best warriors.  Massive STA and unstunnable from front.  end of story.<br />
<br />
(before you all start flaming about how L33T your gnome warrior is remember this is a shaman board :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suggest a Barbarian only because you are already one with your shaman, by having the same races you will have the same factions with everything and some nice roleplay potential.<br />
<br />
My second choice would be an Ogre and my third choice would be a Troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I made a kitty warrior a few weeks back and have been PLing him with my barb shaman.  Seems to work well - I just thought a kitty might be fun to play.  Infravision is nice, as are innate safe-fall and sneak on occasion.  I've been hunting in CoM lately, and now that he's hit 40, his Kunzar Ku'juch makes him a snarer, too. :)<br />
<br />
I think it basically comes down to playing what you think would be fun.  In the end, they're all pretty darn similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Troll for a warrior. I have a level 60 Troll warrior and I would not play anything else for a warrior. Maybe an Ogger but compared to a cute Trollie dey is UGLY :) Seriously in the end game almost nothing beats a Troll and you will end up the main tank on a lot of raids if only for the fact that a troll or ogger can be seen so easily in a raid situation as apposed to a barbarian.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lumppy - just curious about this:<br />
<br />
Seriously in the end game almost nothing beats a Troll<br />
<br />
I've always heard that in the end game the Troll's biggest ability (regen) is insignifigant.  A high level Warrior (regardless of race) is toast without a healer anyways, so what is an extra 6 hps per tick when you are on the receiving end of a CH chain?  And if you are sitting to regen 4K hps you're insane :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If this warrior is going to be tanking the big end velious/luclin mobs, ogre is best.<br />
<br />
If this warrior is going to be hanging out in sebilis, charasis, velketor's, fungus grove, etc., troll is best, followed very closely by iksar (troll is much better from 1-55, due to armor selections (becomes a non issue later on) + slam vs kick (difference negated at 55)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">snapdragn I did not mean to imply that a human or barbarian warrior can not main tank. From the limited experience I have in playing for almost 2 years now I see a lot of warriors reach level 60 as humans or barbarians and they complain that they will never be as tough as they thought they could be. This does not mean that those characters can not be ULTRA tough. But I would put my PP on a Troll warrior with exactly the same gear as a human or barbarian any day. On the two servers I have played on it ALMOST always seems to be the Trolls that are considered the top warriors on the servers.<br />
<br />
I don't want to call down any race. But the question was asked &quot;what race should i be??&quot; The post is just my experience and opinion, and we all know what opinions are like because we all have one:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Halfling of course. :) Meina gets asked for ports, and confused for a rogue becuase she uses a 1hp mainhand.  Other than that, she's the pet I never had.  Be prepared for an expensive twinking project.  Warriors are probably the most expensive class to equip, but a hell of a good time to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lumppy:  Not challenging your opinion, and obviously with a 60 warrior on your char select screen I know you know what you are talking about. (did that make sense? :) )<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if I was overlooking some hidden aspect of trolls...both of the Main Tanks in my guild are Trolls, and are fantastic players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am curious Gathu are you saying that for tanking high mobs the Orge is better but for exp grind the troll would be better ?<br />
<br />
Why is are Orges better at high end tanking and Trolls are better at high end exp grind ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ogre's are better in the high end game due to the fact they can not be stunned from the front.<br />
<br />
When the main tank gets stunned they stop attacking and taunting, which can result in losing control of the mob and causing deaths, most likely your debuffers and healers will be first in line for death since they are next up on the agro list.<br />
<br />
Also as you get higher in level Regain becomes less usefull for a Warrior as they have lots of HP and most group with a healer at that level, some wont group unless they have a cleric = Complete Heal = Regain Useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Main tanking is a lot more than just having the HP and AC to stand in and take a lot of punishment. In early levels when forming single groups a lot of different characters can tank, I used to do a lot of tanking with my ranger up until level 45 i think it was. However as the mobs start to hit for more then the tanking roll in a group changes. The warrior starts to come into his own as a main tank and an SK also does a great job here. This is fine for groups but lets change to the subject of raids. It a raid situation one of the main tanks jobs is to target mobs and to get and maintain agro. The tank in a grind group learns how to do this but still does not have the experience of standing in front of a high level killer mob. In a raid situation using a Troll or Ogger for a main tank has definite advantages besides being able to take a hit. The biggest one is the visual advantage. Players can SEE them better. So if you have 5 mobs attacking at the same time and the big ugly troll or ogger is standing off to the side hitting one, the rest of the raid just has an easier time of locating the main tank and getting in the area of the proper mob. <br />
<br />
Having stated that here is the next big thing to be a successful main tank. Being able to relax and have the confidence of the people you are raiding with. When I first started tanking ubber mobs I would sit at my computer and just shake with extra adrenaline pumping through my body:) I almost always died. After a number of encounters with these mobs I was able to relax more and I started to live through a few of them. As I relaxed more and lived through more my guild mates started to relax and get confidence in me as a tank and it snowballed from there. The fact was I got more opportunities to tank large mobs just because I was a Troll and could be spotted easily in a raid situation, because of these opportunities I learned how to relax and my guild built up confidence in me. Now put a character with the same HP and AC as me in the same situation with the same people and I guarantee they will die a lot more often. Why?? confidence and experience. It has very little to do with the extra little bit of regen, or the slam or my cute face :) How many times have you been on a raid only to wipe a couple of times, then the main tank of the guild logs on and everyone goes ah great &quot;so and so is here we will get this mob next time&quot; and sure enough the mob goes down. Confidence in the main tank:)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Question:  Will a troll and ogre warrior with the same STA and the same level have the same number of hitpoints, or will the ogre have more?  I know that ogres typically have more hitpoints, but im not sure if this is because ogres have a higher STA or because they just get more HP's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I never understood these long posts on Main Assisting.<br />
<br />
Find a target, hit &lt;A&gt;, hit TAUNT, hit KICK,  hit KICK,  Hit TAUNT, hit KICK, move forward a bit, hit KICK, hit TAUNT...<br />
<br />
Where in the world does all of this &quot;trust your healers&quot; talk come in?  If you dont get a heal, are you going to quit tanking?<br />
<br />
Aside from picking which mob to tank first, and some positioning, I never understood this whole phenom with MAing..<br />
<br />
But I am only 46...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Spoon, what level are you?  If you are fairly high up and are going to powerlevel  the warrior a while, I would go halfling for the 5% xp bonus.  I would especially stay away from races with xp penalties (troll/iks 20%, ogre 15%, barby 5%).  Racial abilities will do nothing to increase levelling speed if you are being pl'ed, and levels &gt; all.  Then again, I am lazy and find PLing boring, so your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />

Barbarian shaman and warrior make a nice pair.<br />
<br />
My friend switched his main from a 58 wizard to a barbarian warrior, who we started working on right after Christmas.  He dinged 60 last week and he does a fine job tanking.<br />
<br />
Go check out the Steel Warrior boards, they will tell you that race doesn't matter in terms of endgame MT.   <br />
<br />
http://www.steelwarrior.org/<br />
<br />
They have an Excellent little FAQ outlining all the race choices, pro/cons, where to put your starting stats, general warrior stuff.<br />
<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=1406.topic<br />
<br />
Check it out.<br />
<br />
That being said, if I was going to PL my own warrior.. hmm.<br />
My choices would probably be, Barbarians (I'm biased), Halfling (shorties are great!), Ogre/Iksar.<br />
<br />
Ogre - nice starting STA.  Unstunnable from the front.  <br />
Iksar - regen and AC bonus, look chubby in new models<br />
Troll - regen, are green.<br />
Barbarian - best looking, no faction issues, decent stats<br />
Vah Shir - safefall and sneak, eat a lot, shed.<br />
Human - um, reasonable overall stats, have mullets.<br />
Half Elf - have stick legs in new models.<br />
Woof Elf - um, they can sneak I think, also have stick legs.<br />
Dark Elf - rare, I never see DE warriors.<br />
Halfling - 5% exp bonus, halflings=cool.<br />
Gnome - look good in velious helms<br />
Dwarf - smell funny, have bottle opener on helm.<br />
<br />
if I missed any, they obviously aren't important  ;)<br />
<br />
Oh and by the way - to the fellow that said Troll get to be MT because they are large...  You have a spell called grow, that you could cast on small warriors too.  ;)<br />
<br />
Personally I find large sized warriors/sks to be a pain in the ass, always in the way!   I was so glad when my warrior friend got a cobalt bracer.   <br />
<br />
In terms of grouping with a warrior in a duo(at 60) - I prefer monks and rangers over a warrior.   That being said, warriors can take a great deal of punishment while putting out a good amount of damage.   They also have a wide variety of utility weapons at their disposal including snare, slow, lifetap, etc.   Snare whip = good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Okay, from the basic of what you're asking, i'll tell you my opinion.<br />
<br />
You want someone to duo with your shaman.  Therefore, until level 60, you're going to be relying an awful lot on regen + bind wound to heal and save mana in your duo (at least if you want to be efficient).  You're not going to be complete healing this tank, as the spell doesn't exist in your lineup.  Therefore, you're going to be healing the damage you're taking...so HP is irrelevent, and AC and regen become the biggest factors in reducing downtime.<br />
<br />
Also, I am aware of a spot where I can (and did) duo for my velious armor at 55, but I've also killed a ton of casters in my day.  If i had to do it all over again, I'd go, in this order :<br />
<br />
Troll<br />
Iksar<br />
Barb (for faction)<br />
Ogre<br />
<br />
Remember, the Max HP on your warrior means jack **** if you can't heal him in one shot.  his regen and his AC is ALL that is important in a shaman/war duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I am currently 47 and I will more then likely pl him into his 30's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Some general comments.<br />
<br />
Main tank and Main assist are 2 very different things. Main tank is the tank that stands there infront of the really big mob and takes the beating with the CH chain keeping him alive. It's his reponsibilty to keep the thing aggroed, in the right location and pointing the right way.<br />
<br />
The Main assist is most of what you desribed. Picking the one mob out of five that the raid should be killing. It can be done by anyone just hitting f8 and everyone else assisting them. It doesn't have to be a tank even. Ideally it's someone who pays attention well and reacts well and is fairly knowledgable about game dynamics to make inteligent choise about targets such as taking the unmesable mob first or the one that ae dispells last etc.<br />
<br />
For MT an ogre might have a slight racial advantage due to thier immunity to stun from the front. Otherwise any tank given the same stats will do just as well.<br />
<br />
For the hps quest race isn't a factor in your hps other than that it effects your starting stats, namely sta. If 2 warriors have the same sta they will have the same hps no matter if they are an iksar or ogre.</div></div><hr />
