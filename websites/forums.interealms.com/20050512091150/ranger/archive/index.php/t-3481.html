<br />
I picked up a Yellow Whip a few weeks ago in a DL group. All the other group members said it was for a Ranger quest so gave it to me. However i have not been able to find anything about it telling what it is used for. Its got pretty crappy stats (can't remember them atm) so is just taking up bank space. Was just wondering if anyone has any info on it or can pont me in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

     Well, after a bit of a break i am thinking of makeing a comeback and know i still have this item in my bank. Has anyone heard what this whip does or what it is used for yet? I have tried to look it up on a few sites but have only found info on the whip, not its use. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

Now if only I could figure out how to show them all off.</div></div><hr />
