Kinda of like a rip in time or I guess you coiuld call it time travel. What do you guys think? Childlish?</div></div><hr />

No way. The engines and game play system arn't even the same. You have races in EQ2 that are not in EQ1, a skill system that doesn't exist in the first, items and possible item effects that arn't supported by the current EQ engine. Plus about 100 other things that don't line up. The only way the two would be compatable is if EQ2 was exactly the same as EQ1.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah, until they remove the flagging requirement for it  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rofl, what happens, you zone into EQ2 and a popup window appears for your credit card info?  Sony is such an amazingly greedy corporation, I'm amazed they don't charge us to browse their website.  This is an outlandish idea at best.</div></div><hr />
