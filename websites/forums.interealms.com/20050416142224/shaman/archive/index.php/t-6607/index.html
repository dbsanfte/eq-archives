<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this is really starting to drive me bananas. My work email gets spammed with about 50+ email messages thoughout the course of the day and night, everything from colon cleansers to morgage refinancing. Opting out doesnt work, they just pass me along to another spam service. I'm starting to lose important messages in all the crap I delete everyday. How in the hell can I stop this?<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting a new kind of spam. It appears that some University Diploma a-holes are using windows messenger to spam me - both at home and at work. When I say &quot;messenger&quot; I believe its the error reporting service that 2k/NT uses. I thought you could turn that off, I switched the service to manual, but I can't seem to stop it. Its always on. Am I barking up the wrong tree?<br />
<br />
Either way its driving me insane....and that messager popup boots my trader bot outta eq on my home machine....another nice way to harrass someone if you know they are playing eq and got an ip addy for em I guess..<br />
<br />
<br />
HRELP!!! :(</div></div><hr />

may help you get info on fighting spammers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Start investigating your email clients spam filtering options, if you're using Outlook you can get in and edit the text files it uses to identify spam mails, I have no idea if MS offer updates to this file, I've never found one so I made a point of updating it myself. I also found a nice free add on that lets you easily add spammers to a filter via a menu called JunkURL. I manage to filter out about 80% of spam to a different folder just by updating these now and again. <br />
<br />
I've given up trying to report them or remove my address, as you say it doesnt get you anywhere.<br />
<br />
No clue on the messenger front, how annoying :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kelgrael Snowstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Some options to help block the pop up messenger messages: <br />
<br />
1 - Disable messenger in windows - but this could cause printing problems for you particularly if your using a network based printer <br />
<br />
2 - If your using an internet router to allow you to run multiple systems off of a singe cable/dsl connection you can also go into your router setup and block the following ports: <br />
<br />
TCP 135 - 139, 5000. <br />
UDP 135 - 139. <br />
<br />
Not only will that fix your problem with messenger but it will also close a lot of other potential problems, unless of course you were deliberately sharing your machine's files over the internet. <br />
<br />
3 - Try add on packages such as Zone Alarm(pc based firewall) and Ad-Aware(scans your system and removes unwanted add type applications installed with 3rd party software) <br />
<br />
If your using Kazaa - download and install Kazaa-lite (www.kazaalite.com) instead...the full version of Kazaa has add based spyware built in to it - but you should also get the Ad-Aware packeage when you do it - just uninstalling Kazaa and installing Kazaa-Lite will NOT get rid of the already installed add spyware. <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kazaa - heh I wont touch that program with a 100foot piece of 10baseT cable. ( ha ha nerd humor ;) ) <br />
<br />
As far as disabling the messenger service - I tried. All it would let me do is change it to manual instead of automatic, wouldnt give me the option to stop it. (win2k prof)<br />
<br />
I have another spare machine I have been meaning to setup to do NAT for me so I can stop paying for IP addys - I guess i'll put my virus scanner and install a firewall on that box - I hate bogging my gaming machines down with those type programs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Or you could purchase one of the smart switches that offer all of this in one applicance ... and the cost is dropping on them now to like 50-70 bucks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been using this program ... I Hate Spam (http://www.sunbelt-software.com/product.cfm?id=930) ... It seems to work although I have to always scrub the mail after I am done getting it which is kind of annoying... it scans the e-mail when it comes in then, I have to manually scan it... which it then gets rid of all the spam.  It seems to work.  I have been using it for about 3 months...  If I remember right they have a 30 day demo of it somewhere on the site.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i use mail washer for my spam filtering needs. it uses 3 major spam filtering services and bounces back the spam you do get. my spam has decreased significantly tho i do still get a ton of spam about boobs and penis size. www.mailwasher.net.<br />
<br />
for popups i use panicware's popup stopper. it's great. i've never had a problem with it.<br />
<br />
i honestly get 99% of my spam from when i was stupid enough to give ezboards my email address. they are total bastards!</div></div><hr />
