<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made 34 this weekend, scored a 28 point something dps mace, coupled with my off hand 20 somethign dps mace, it is sick the damage I do. In pvp, any melee within my level gets smashed, and smashed badly, the only trouble I have had is with a lucky mage/priest who keeps me feared or ice slowed.<br />
<br />
Can't find daggers even remotely comparable in damage.<br />
<br />
Get stun with mace skills very soon too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Best daggers I've seen (and I quest and hunt a lot) is from Blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
And yes, Rogues do insane damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Faern,<br />
<br />
my smithing is at 225/225 now, think I need to level to open up new skill quest? Best dagger I can make is still only 18.7 dps with a skill req of 31. At this point I am pretty bummed about the usefullness of smithed weapons, the only people in my guild using smithed weapons are lower levels who haven't been to the auction house yet.<br />
<br />
Still love tradeskills though, I am hoping the super high level stuff is useful. I get killed all the time &quot;skunking&quot;, I see an ore node and I get wood and charge for it, and care not at all about death :)<br />
<br />
Still love this game, even after two weeks. How is the pally coming? Know not much about them but they are a huge pain in the ass to kill and are rarely alone :)<br />
<br />
My eyes twitch all the time now from lack of sleep and coffee, eventually I will slip into a sleep coma I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye, my brother loves his rogue. Got a nice dagger drop,  I think it's the Flesh Ripper. Not real sure of the stats. At  24ish he is doing ambush crits for around 300+.  Gave a nice Mace to another buddy that dropped from some Huge Black Panther, think it was 33-69 or some insane thing. This game is just too damn fun!</div></div><hr />

From what I understand you need to talk to the Artisan or one up from Artisan Blacksmith and have him train you.  I know the Artisan Blacksmith is in IF (Alliance), not sure Horde.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Made 35, nothing yet the artisan trainer is in Origrimmar and has nothing to say. Grrrr.<br />

Mounted Paladin kicked my ass last night, ha, was funny. Have yet to see a raptor mount, can't wait.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Raptor mounts are sweet Mill - come in like 4 colors!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only mounts I have seen so far are them things that Humans ride on, horses I think? Usually followed by a beatdown, but lately, a few people have actually stopped, done a silly emote and then left me alone, kind of refreshing. Made 36 last night, I have 9 gold, gonna be ugly I think trying to save 100.<br />
<br />
It is probably perception, but I think that server listing of high level people must be out of date, I rarely, rarely see horde mounted, but see Alliance all day long.<br />

<br />
I know I've seen a book you have to purchase in Booty Bay for fishing to get it over 225.  I've heard that the similar thing for leatherworking to get over 225 is a drop off a mob.  So I imagine for Blacksmithing there may be a similar mechanism.<br />
<br />
I am only level 26, with Smithing at around 167 and I just made a 2-hand hammer that beats the crap out of any drop I've seen so far.  So at least at my level, smithing is paying off for sure.  The pattern was purchased somewhere around Desolace I believe.  Many of the better crafted weapons/armor may be sold as patterns in higher level areas (always check the vendors!) or as drops and they are not always all learnable from the trainers.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Macheras,<br />
<br />
talked to Brikk in booty bay, no quest, nothing, he just trained me in artisan smithing, weird.<br />
<br />
Ahh that damned two handed hammer plan(solid iron warhammer?), never thought to buy it because I was not impressed, but you need to make two of them to finish up some barbaric recipe quests, it is a limited supply item and I can never find it on the guy, kicking myself now. Only costs like 27 silver now too, ha. I keep checking and hoping though.<br />
<br />
At 225 skill I was pointed towards a weaponsmith and an armorsmith in origrimmar that train blue unique weapons/armor starting at 235 skill, but honestly I am still not impressed, and I imagine the reagents needed are crazy, but heh, we will see. Our shamans are approaching 40 and I can now make plate for our idiot warrior hehe.<br />
<br />
I still love this game and sleep maybe 5 hours a night, ha.<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, solid iron warhammer or maybe sledge, can't remember exact name.  It is really good at my level, replaced the demolition hammer I got from Taurajo quest a couple levels ago.  It's actually the best weapon I currently own, besides the blue con weapon 1h sword I got from the WC quest.  I would guess a 2h hammer wouldn't be very good for a rogue ;).<br />
<br />
I'll be curious where you end up finding the smith trainer at that skill level since I will be there soon enough.  Being a warrior, I am pretty much using a couple pieces of armor or a weapon or two I've made at all times.  Some dropped green con items are similar, but many are not that much better for me it seems.  I'm wearing green iron legs I crafted, already made the green iron shoulders for when I hit 27 and I'm looking forward to the helm I can make soon.  Still looking for iridescent pearls to make my 230 AC breastplate grrrr... only ones in AH go for over a gold and I don't want to spend the money lol.<br />
<br />
BTW, anyone know where iridescent pearls drop?  Giant clams in Wetlands was what I had heard.<br />
<br />
I too get 5 hours of sleep.  It will be 10pm and I'll say I'm going to finish one more quest, next thing I know it's 1 am and up for work in a few hours lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Had to buy them as well, a level 31 chest you can make though the green iron hauberk is pretty sweet, and not too tough on materials.<br />
<br />
Trainer for 225 and up is a goblin named Brikk(think that is spelling) in booty bay.<br />
<br />
Going to have to run the vale a few nights this week to replenish my mithril, and try to get some water breathing pots or something.<br />

<br />
5 hours of sleep? Slackers, the lot of you! :)<br />
<br />
The nice thing about getting a little older is that you (well, some people at least) can get by on fewer hours of sleep. I don't think I could have survived on a few hours of sleeps 20 years ago, much less do productive work. It still makes my head hurt, though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Made 36 last night, I have 9 gold, gonna be ugly I think trying to save 100.<br />
<br />
100 gold for a mount? The Kodo trainer in Mulgrove told me the other night that he would be willing to teach me to ride one for just 20 gold, once I reach 40, of course. Does it mean that different races have different mount costs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Does it mean that different races have different mount costs<br />
<br />
Different speeds.<br />
<br />
Oh and Paladins AND Warlocks get a mount at level 40.  Warlock mount is a earth / fire horse elemental thing with flame around the hooves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The 20 gold is for the riding skill I believe.  It costs another 100 to buy the actual mount.  Only pallies get free ones I think.  120 gold total. As a hunter, I will probably stick with aspect of the cheetah for quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ah, I see, thanks!<br />
<br />
Frankly, after having to farm dozens and dozens (hundreds?) of thousands of pp in EQ over the years, I am not particularly concerned about doing a little farming in WoW if I have to :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Playing WoW overnight apparently affects spelling...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The Kodo Mounts in Mulgore only cost 80 Gold.  20 More gold for the training = 100 gold total (like Mill said).  Higher costs are for:<br />
1. Different race mounts (i.e. undead wanting to ride a Raptor) - requires High faction too.<br />
2. Faster Mounts (like Faern said).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Before I bought spells at 42, I had 29 gold.  And I don't play the auction game.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't sweat it.</div></div><hr />
