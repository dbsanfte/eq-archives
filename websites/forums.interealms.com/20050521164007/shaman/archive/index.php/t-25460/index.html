<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kreft78</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would like to know if anyone soloed him yet and did was it successful i have 8100 hp and 7k mana 1600 ac with 311 aa'a would i be able to do it or would it eat me alive hehe. Never really been to water except on raids so dont know much about the zone till i read the forum they gave me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I doubt you could do it.  I buff a bit higher than you do, and I wouldn't even think of trying to solo the shark named. They hit hard, fairly fast, and to even pull them, you need to be able to split the trash sharks out of the room.<br />
<br />
Grab a monk/sk/bard, a cleric, and a tank (if you didnt use a SK), and go fetch it that way. alot easier.</div></div><hr />
