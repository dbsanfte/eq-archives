<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am just curious as to why there are so few Iksar Shaman with the Spear of Fate.  On Drinal there are only 2, which is the server I play on.  Are the other servers the same as Drinal or is it just the newer servers?  I am stuck on the Hole quest until I can find a guild to join or get a group together using Ugod or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A lot of them get to 45, figure out what a JBB is, and either recreate their shaman or give up and play a different character entirely because they just wasted so long playing a shaman that can't use what is arguably one of the most useful items in the Big Bag O Fun for shamans.<br />
<br />
That, or they are slacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rykar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">JBB is for wussies who are lazy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You're right Aselus, I should just give up on my Troll because he's Level 56 and doesn't have a JBB, nor do I plan on ever getting one. Basically, my Troll is an Iksar without the AC bonus (same regen, same XP penalty, almost the same cruddy faction). But then again, I almost never cast any offensive spells, so maybe I don't need a JBB.<br />
<br />
I'm so confused!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think it is the JBB issue that keeps there from being many high level Iksar shaman around. <br />
<br />
Because there aren't as many high level iksar shaman around there isn't going to be many with the epic.<br />
<br />
Also, an Iksar shaman is much more likely to be an Alt than the other races. Alts are (generally speaking) less likely than main characters to get epics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">from my experience as an iksar and both a troll shaman, i can say teh reason i quit the iksar was cuz he felt like a wet paper bag durability wise.  I think that and a mixture of iksar shaman bein alts more oftn than not contribute to hardly any SoF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are no high level Iksar shamans because every single of them is persecuted and has level 5 Schizofrenia (sp?) and level 7 Paranoia.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only two on the entire server?  That's hard to believe.  But the comment about re-rolling after finding out what the JBB was all about had me laughing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hey, I stuck it out with my Iksar to 54 and got my SoF :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've seen plenty of Iksar Shaman with SoF on Tholuxe Paels, and its the youngest server.  If I remember correctly when Epics were introduced everyone on TP was level 1.  <br />
<br />
Iksar with SoF aren't rare barbarians with it are just overly common ;)  Everyone loves how dead sexy those barbs look ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got my spear of fate.  I can only think of maybe 3 other iksar shaman on my server with them also, but I'm sure there are more, just havn't seen em before.<br />
<br />
Mainly it's because Iksar shaman are rare. Less of them = less epics.  <br />
<br />
Funny thing is there are less Ogre shaman on my server than there are iksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm one of three or four Iks Shammies on Tarew (that I've seen) with the epic. Not nearly as common as every other race (Barbs especially), but they're out there.<br />
<br />
If you want to talk rare, how about a 50+ Rogue without an epic? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started in EQ in the first day of beta phase 3, and remained with the char I played then - barbarian shaman. I didn't like trolls or ogres, because I am not &quot;evil&quot;. I aint good either, I simply have the moments of... &quot;benevolence&quot;, other then that, I don't like people around me. And back then, there wasn't any iksars anywhere to be found. They just didn't exist. People at times mused (after the trips to &quot;old&quot; CT temple), that a lizard race would be neat to play, but all figured that these lizards would look like the green ones in Feerot.<br />
<br />
When they added the Kunark with the iksar, I saw again no reason to play it. I was comfortable with my current char, not to mention he already had quite some levels under his belt.. Iksars also were made as an &quot;evil&quot; race, and it didn't fit my &quot;view&quot; again. And NEVER did I consider the JBB being any serious reason for creating, or not creating, some race/class combo. Those who made their chars based on races who can use JBB ONLY, are sad cases. I did try out the iksar shaman for a little time, but I did't feel like going through it all again.<br />
<br />
And no, I don't have JBB..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">JBB ? That is some fine **** you smoking. I love playing an Iksar Shaman, and would never re-roll for a piece of gear. Are you suggesting that our class is in any way defined by the JBB? Heaven forbid :) To be fair though I think the JBB is a contributing factor in there not being many Iksar Shamn, that and the faction perhaps.<br />
<br />
Not got my SoF yet, but am damn close. Just need the Tear from Fear and I am set. Only know of 2 other Iksar Shaman on the Seventh with their epics but there may be more :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I dont have a Funghi :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Dunno what yu talkin bout.  I see a gaggle of Leezards runnin everywhere with SoF's.  I think it might have something to do with server demographics.  On my server Barbs&gt;Trolls&gt;Iksar&gt;Vah Shir&gt;Ogres, so naturally I see more Barbs with SoF than anyone else.<br />
<br />
Trolls seem to be the new twink race-to-be for the shaman class and will prolly have barbs outnumbered before too long.  Too many people reading snare necklace/JBB articles IMO :p  <br />
<br />
I can't walk 2 paces in the swamp anymore without kicking a little green shaman and the buggers keep getting into my cave like a bunch of squatters.  Strangest thing is when they run into battle they don't scream &quot;FER GROBB!!!&quot; or &quot;JOO GONNA DIE!!!&quot; anymore.  Heard a couple the other day going after a froglok to cries of &quot;Tunare protect us!!&quot; and chatting afterward about the lack of fashionable footwear in Grobb.<br />
<br />
Notice how nobody plays ogres anymore?</div></div><hr />

Just not very many 50+ iksar shaman period....<br />

Think there are 5 lizards with epics on my server including myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not many iksar shamans with epics -&gt; not many iksar shamans -&gt; iksar shamans are more challenging to play -&gt; iksar shamans are more powerful in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Level 52, Iksar, shaman, epic wielder<br />
<br />
I can tell you that I have really begun to notice the exp penalty that Iksar have.  Comparing normal exp to 100% AA exp is amazing.  Normal exp seems to be moving about half as fast as AA exp.  :/<br />
<br />
I've seen 2 or 3 Iksar Shaman on Karana that have their epics, and seen a couple more that did not even bother doing their epic because of greater loot from NToV or other uber places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Err Zatriz, I think everyone's xp goes that slow after level 51 :)<br />
<br />
You have a point that AA doesn't get penalised, but remember 1 AA point is roughly equivalent to level 51, and level 52 probably takes about twice as much xp as 51 anyway ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Bah I remember the days when the best a handbag could hope for was Jarsath and Seb Scale, and darn happy we were to get that much...<br />
<br />
Woah, sorry, got all bleary eyed there. <br />
<br />
Perhaps it's because until Velious was released (when they put in Hate armour and we found out we could wear the quest stuff) Iksar really were horribly disadvantaged in their choice of gear. <br />
<br />
It's only now that we're starting to see those folks who started Iksar shaman after Velious getting to epic levels along with those of us who were insane enough to level up despite having little to look forward to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">On Xev high level iksar (55+) who aren't monks are very very rare.<br />
Off the top of my head I can think of 2 55+ iksar necros, 1 BL, 2 sk's, 5 warriors at most and about 6 or so other shaman not including myself. <br />
<br />
I think all the shaman have SoF's. <br />
<br />
Iksars who opt a path not of a monk are generally rare across the board. I don't know why that is, the xp penalty really really stinks at higher levels, faction sux and we do get less of a choice in mid-game armors, or maybe because they are just so unique that might scare people off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There just aren't many Iksar Shaman *shrug* I don't know why really, they're fun and have cute tails :) <br />
<br />
Iksar are pretty rare 55+ once you leave the monk realm. I didn't really notice it, honestly, since most of my friends play lizards. But when one of the said he was camping in Velks so he could be the first level 60 Iksar Necro on Xev I started to take a look around and it was kind of surprising. When doing a /who all Iks Sha 50 60 turns up maybe 3 people and one of them is a pl'd twink it makes you wonder why so many people avoided the lizards, particularly the melee classes. <br />
<br />
Not that I'm complaining :) I like being &quot;rare&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There are quite a few on the Rathe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I got my epic last summer at 53 but was the second Iksar shaman on TT to get it. I think there is 4 or 5 Iksar shamans on TT with epic now so uncommon over all but when comparing 55+ iksar shaman without epics vs those Iksars having their epics its like 2 to 1 (roughly), not so bad then. On the JBB thing (once again) I never had it, never cared to have it. Mindlessly clicking a bracer for hours on end isnt my cup of tea, I would rather get some friends and do some fun stuff then spending my time soloing. Thats what makes EQ so fun, it fits all types of play styles. <br />
The do it all over question and what would i have done different? I would still choose Iksar first, If I could change something, I would have joined Valon a long time ago! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes no JBB was a big blow to most 50+ iksar shamans... Long ago I completely quit my shaman and even changed servers when I was sitting at 53 and relized no Jbone, no planer, hell no totamic !  ...had a froggy BP and some Jarcrap, and didnt see ANY upgrade in the future....   hell I was one fo the highest iksars on my server back then, top 5 or 10...     velious changed all that and I came back..<br />
<br />
Anyways yes I have my epic and have seen at least 10 others with it on Tribunal.  Its easy as far as I can see it.... when Epics were introduced there were hundreds of barb shamans alrdy.. many 50's and such... so they had a big jump... I mean how many cats you seen with epics yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Theres a good few on Cazic-Thule server.<br />
<br />
&lt;-- First Iksar Shm with SoF on CT :D  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Seems to me every 53+ Iksar on Tribunal has their epic, and by contrast I've seen quite few of barbs without them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Most have an Iksar as an alt character so, their are going to be less SoF's out there for Iksar's. I personally have only SEEN one Iksar Shaman on Innoruuk with the SoF. (which was a female, very rare) I'm sure there is more than one leezard with the SoF but I've never seen them.<br />
As a test I always do a /who shaman in every zone I'm in, it's been rare where I have been the only Shaman especially Iksar in the whole zone. I don't even see alot of Iksar Shaman in my beloved home of Cabilis. So go figure.<br />
I think the exp penalty and the fact we can't use a JBB turns most off to being an Iksar. <br />
<br />
Iksar is my main BTW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">pretty sure there may only be 6 or 7 iks shaman on A'ro who have epic , including me. <br />
<br />
just outta curiousity on your server do a /who all shaman and count the 55+ ones ... then do a poll to see who has epic and who does not. <br />
A'ro is flooded with barbies, overall you will find there are more barb shaman on each server. Granted most/some started them before Kunark was released.  Yet Still the numbers are staggering. I say we unite troll/ogre/iks/vah/  to have a Barbecue so to speak and slay as many of this plague(barb shaman) as we can =-P.<br />
<br />
Actually all shaman should unite instead of fighting about race/jbb/who is better, whatnot.  We should all reach for common goals, beit  better damage spells, better drops of spells, longer duration on rabid bear. i could go on and on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">(looks at Xeryus)<br />
(steps back and looks again)<br />
<br />
howdy ole friend. Well i would of joined ya on the list of CT iksar shaman but alas i moved to A'ro hehe. Good to see your name again =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Jbb is a pretty gimp reason not to play an iksar IMO. Its really starting to be more of a hinderence then a help at 57, and I used it rarely even before then.<br />
<br />
Were I to make an iksar, I would raise wisdom to oh.. 95 or so(whats that.. 5 pts added to it total) and pump the hell out of stamina.. voila.. no more fragile feeling ikky shammy. Jbb is a crutch, useful if all you do is solo 24/7, but pretty much useless while grouping(like I can spend 8 seconds standing around to do a drop in the buckets damage.. got more important things to do), same with raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hey Broodling!! Hows life on old A`Ro?<br />
<br />
it to is nice to see your name on here. keep in touch ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I think another factor is that younger scaled mystics will often assume they'll have faction trouble doing their epics and so don't even bother. I routinely get asked questions by younger shamans on Terris and this comes up a lot. I also tend to agree that a majority of the iksar shamans you see are alts. Tenoq is my first and favorite character (started june 2000), but for the longest time I hardly saw any other leezards around the same level as me. Caster alts are a pain to PL so it stands to reason that I would be leveling faster than the other iksar shamans on the server. Spears are still rather rare. Even a good year after the first iksar got his epic on Terris you still get tells to the effect of &quot;Wow! never seen spear of fate on a lizard before.&quot; <br />
<br />
But basically I think it's sheer volume or lack thereof that keeps you from seeing a great deal of iksar shamans with epics. Other races have a year head start in shamanry, and shamans aren't one of those classes that stand out to new players to begin with. You see fewer shamans than, say, warriors, and far fewer iksar than barbarians or ogres. We're the few, the proud, the scaley.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I see less motivation for my guild to do epic fights, especially with epics that have minor impact on raiding.<br />

Cleric epic, sure. Shaman epic eh... maybe if the mages are bored.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Grippa, I am beginning to think that AA exp is not subject to race based exp penalties.  I got my first AA point while I was 51.  My AA exp went MUCH faster than my normal exp.  Could just be me and my perceptions though.<br />
<br />
52 is kicking my butt though.  I am tired of grinding, so I only have 2 yellows into 52 so far.  Got a yellow of AA exp (2nd point) too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>txMaddog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Most people see the KOS faction and think....'Gee I don't want to spend hours getting faction up so I'll play something else'.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly faction has not been much of a problem for me as an Iksar Shaman.  Yes it's a bit difficult to get some places but not impossible especially with the Nexus now being active.<br />
<br />
Don't have my Spear of Fate yet, soon though, as I have my Child's Tear in the bank and hope to do the Hole this month.<br />
<br />
As someone already said 'The few, the proud, the Scaley!' :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zorarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I always found the iksar faction to be perfect, KoS to nearly all. I dont recall it ever being a problem for the epic, except mildly for the Freeport portion.<br />

1-60, I am not sure where faction comes into play outside of Velious.<br />
