<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just playing around with Focus gear - I got off into the corner in SD doing light to some Dark blues.    One Light Blue Shaman cast 4 Frost's on me for full damage with my SvC at 94.   That may have been bad luck but pet was getting hit each pull with Togur's then Dot ... then NPC would turn to cast on me leaving pet alone.   Another cast Scourge which I resisted so it tried to Malisement me ... Then switched to Venom of Snake - resisted - malisement again.    <br />
<br />
So it appears that Mob's are doing something differant.    Is anyone else seeing things react differantly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just as long as they don't teach healers to cast cure disease and remove our slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sort of sucks that they're not doing stupid stuff now, but I am sort of glad that the casters are presenting more of a challenge.  Used to be, shaman mobs were just a nuisance rather than a threat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm.  Maybe wizard mobs might realize after 5 resisted forces shocks in a row that that might not be the best spell for the occasion.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">From patch message:<br />
<br />
&quot;- NPC casters should be a little smarter now.  They will choose their spells a little more carefully.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">smarter? maybe. I tanked a goblin wizzy in SolA today, who just gave up nuking after 5 resists... so he quickly changed class and is still hitting like a monk on steroids.<br />
<br />
It's a bit disturbing though to have frogs in Sebilis cast Ice Comet :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
and Garrison's Superior Sundering does *NOT* belong into the spellbook of Velious &quot;Yard Trash&quot; mobs, please :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While camping the pained soul, the spectral keepers kept trying to use bonds of force on me.<br />
<br />
Heck, shaman/necro mobs using non-disease DoTs is a pretty large change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was reading a post on the necro.eqclasses.com boards earlier that reported Phinny and other mobs lobbing ice comets.  Mobs buffing themselves with see invis &amp; other sorts of nasty changes in their behavior.  One of the posters made an interesting point that if they're going to improve a caster mobs offensive casting performance, they might need to scale back their melee damage.  Was interesting food for thought at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I wanna be a NPC caster!  Those fookers got it ALL baby!  Best of caster and melee worlds!  <br />
<br />
I soloed a Molktor in SG today... Fooker went OOM nuking me.  I resisted much of it, but still got nailed for considerable damage with 158 MR.  I thought cleric nukes were supposed to be highly resistable?  /boggle.<br />
Anyway it was just as well since I have Torpor and I dont have stuns.  He didn't have enuf mana to CH, and I nuked him dead with blast of poison before he could Gate.  Dam mobs ALWAYS have mana for Gate, I swear they save it up just in case.  Then again Gate is a 70 mana spell, not exactly Boardwalk in terms of cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">They need to Halve the melee damage output of all priest and INT caster modeled mobs if they are going to keep this change.  It's friggin nuts.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I like fighting a semi intelligent mob, but a shaman that Malosi's now, then slows you, then DOT's poison AND disease, roots you and then melees you like a normal warrior mob is WAY overpowered.<br />
<br />
They also don't bother casting any spell that is already on you, and will debuff everyone on the aggro list if they can.  The change is fine, but they need to address a couple of issues they have kept in the game because PC's were smarter than NPC's.  No more damned SOW indoors, and no more Caster NPC's hitting for full warrior damage for that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i have alwas thought it wrong the a wizzard class NPC could still hit me for 200 hp :(. and now thay IC me for a hella lot to. if there gona make them smarter them dont let them hit so hard i mean classes that debuff like shamens do and hit like a war is just scarry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tonight as we cleared a bit to do the Cursed in Ssra, seemed like every other mob that I slowed cast Funeral Pyre on me.  Man, that dot's a biatch!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The froggy wizzies in seb are atng ice comet now when you pull em, hehe our monk in the grup got hit for 1100 every timehe pulled one :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yeah, I ate funeral pyre and ice spear in ssra. Mean spells for mobs.</div></div><hr />
