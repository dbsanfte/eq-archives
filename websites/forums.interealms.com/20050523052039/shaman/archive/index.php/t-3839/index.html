<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i'm sure most people have heard, there's a new feature with the chat system with the patch last week:<br />
<br />
Cross Server Chat Channels<br />
<br />
included is cross server tells.  the monkly business folks have a channel, serverwide.monklybusiness and there's other class sites/boards that have started cross server channels.<br />
<br />
any interest in doing this for the crucible?  serverwide.crucible or serverwide.shamanscrucible perhaps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">See you there.  Make it a poll :)</div></div><hr />

There were over 30 people on last night.<br />
<br />
;join serverwide.crucible : crucible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't like &quot;crucible:crucible&quot; as a channel name for one simple reason: It's impossible to guess if you don't visit this site on a regular basis. <br />
<br />
It should be shaman:shaman. The people that would MOST benefit from a persistant online serverwide shaman community don't even KNOW about the Shaman's crucible.<br />
<br />
I'll be autojoining shaman:shaman and encouraging other shaman on my server to join it too. The crucible name, while nice and all, just violates the KISS principle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I could be wrong, but isn't there a limit to the number of people that can be in a chat channel (100 or so). If so, won't this defeat the purpose of having a chat channel like this setup. Of course, I'm assuming that the purpose is to have the entire shaman community plugged into this community channel.<br />
<br />
Of course, I could be wrong :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The people that would MOST benefit from a persistant online serverwide shaman community don't even KNOW about the Shaman's crucible.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think the channel is set up to be some sort of massive AOL-like help channel, where we can educate (ie. lecture) fellow shamans on AC/HP over Wisdom, why Trolls are the best race for our class and how the Iksar need/don't need the JBB.<br />
<br />
I'd rather see crucible regulars (including the few posters we have that are NOT shamans).  I'll stick to crucible:crucible, and instead of telling random_shaman01 to join the chat channel, I'll refer them to this website/forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">100 isnt the limit to the amount of people in a channel as our buysell regularly has over 100 in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I'd be happier in a channel with people who read these boards, instead of some schmuck Warrior who happened to guess the channel name and password.<br />
<br />
But maybe that's just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree Chikarsis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see this as a chance to catch up easily with old Shammy friends such as Griz, 7K, Zeona, Cronun, Toramin, One Pony, etc....  on my server and to meet new friends on other servers.  Sounds like a great idea!<br />
<br />
And as far as JBB goes, Sebilis was stolen from the Scaleybutts.  I haven't heard anything about Jaundiced Bones being scaleybutt bones, so even on a RP level, they should be able to wear them.  I disagree that the ability to regrow your tail after I pull it off to make Iksar Tail Gumbo is such a big advantage that you shouldn't have JBB.  /petition the crap out of Verant on this, as JBB truely is one of out core items, and all Shammy races should be OK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">/wave, Crucibles in my autojoin now, try and chat when I can but I'm far too blonde to muti task too heavily.<br />
<br />
Someone needs to screenshot any fun comments and post them up here :)<br />
<br />
Oh and anyone continuing the JBB debate here gets pelted with fishing grubs, k?</div></div><hr />

Don't be delusional. A warrior is never going to feverishly try to haxxor in to the Shaman channel to spam &quot;warriurz rulz j00&quot; over and over. Far-fetched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Roxim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Getting ideas and stuff from other shamans != on my server is awesome~ See joo all there</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah just like people spamming global Bazaar and/or waiting to get mod of global bizaar or waiting for server startup to get creator rights in order to make or change password or something simillar... far fetched... yeah right.  Ive been in bazaar when that happened.  so if we rub someone raw i can see this happening pretty easily.  They can get away with it because it is a &quot;private channel.&quot;<br />

I got slapped by Arriana yesterday afternoon... heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And nobody(couple of them, actually) from Sullon Zek would log into the Veeshan Auction channel and spam 'JIHAD ON YUO!!!1'  again and again.<br />
<br />
oops...that happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">tried joining late last night with /join serverwide.crucible:crucible and got invalid password for channel, tried with shaman, shamans as passwords as well and no dice tried it with the ; instead of the / as well...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">{blah}<br />
<br />
i used ;join also</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thorgryn, the command I use is<br />
<br />
;join serverwide.crucible : crucible<br />
<br />
I don't know if the ; or the spaces around the : do the trick or what</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it may be that somebody had changed or removed the password for a brief while.  Dunno why, just that it happens at times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think the auction channel is far different from a shaman channel. People go into the auction channels and spam them because they know there's a large group of people in there to annoy that they'll never meet. PvP folks target blue servers, cause most of them are a bunch of immature kids, and a lot of people target Stormhammer cause they're just jealous =) Nobody has anything against shaman, except for druids that got to lvl 54 before realizing they should have made a shaman. Infact, I think what we'd have to worry about is people coming in and saying &quot;Dude! You guys rock! I was fighting a mob and some shaman just came up and slowed him, and it was so cool! I was like barely getting hurt at all! Then he gave me focus, I'm the most uber warrior in my guild now!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hmm, Hroth, I don't tend to remember anything past about 20 minutes ago...what did I say?<br />
<br />
And as for the name of the channel, the wizards are all on serverwide.graffe, and none of them are having any trouble with it. crucible:crucible works for me.</div></div><hr />
