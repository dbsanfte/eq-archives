<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wrath of the Slavemaster sounds a lil like that snake i cant think of off hand. Glyphed ?  Sorry i blocked Ssra from my active memory. But it Sounds like that. I would assume its a NPC spell if so, but would be very fun if it wasnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If I FD, does my pet suicide?  If so, this would be a wicked pvp spell.  Heck, if you could land it, it's a wicked pvp spell anyway.<br />
<br />
If this is a mob spell (which is most likely is) then it's gonna take some pretty clever tactics to take down this mob.  If your MT gets FDed and looses all agro, your in quite a bit of trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aoe FD would rock.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to disappoint you but i think that's a berserker throwing hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Pheather</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AE FD is in SSra, Glyphed?? but part of that cycle.<br />
<br />
Haste v3 I am guessing that v3 stuff maybe to include the new pet AA buff skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aren't there spiders in PoP that proc a FD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i think all beserker summon are axes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">AE FD is already in game in SSRA.  I thought it was a cool idea, but it must be a real pain to deal with.<br />
<br />
Yes there area also spiders that cause you to FD in PoN.  Can't think of anymore off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Vallon Zek (the PoTime version) has a 30 second long stun with FD that he casts every 24 seconds.<br />
<br />
Plays hell with any kind of MT rotation until you figure out what you're doing!  There's a reason that Tallon and Vallon Zek are the two mobs that block everyone in PoTime!  Kinda funny that these two mini-gods are a lot tougher than Quarm!<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Giants in plane of storms I think proc FD too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes, PoS giants proc FD.  Have been confused by that before :-)<br />
<br />
Also have used it when we were wiping, just STAY DOWN! hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">PoS giants have saved me so many times from dying.<br />
<br />
Much &lt;3 to them! :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If I FD, does my pet suicide?  If so, this would be a wicked pvp spell.  Heck, if you could land it, it's a wicked pvp spell anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
Ocean giants in PoS allready proc an FD on their target, so most raiders are allready familiar with the particular challenges posed by this sort effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The &quot;beastlord double attack AA&quot; is Ferocity III. While beastlords get a spell called &quot;Ferocity&quot;, remember that melee also get an aa ability called Ferocity, which increases the chance of executing a double attack. The ferocity aa has 3 ranks. If Ferocity III is an aa ability (it could be a new item focus for example), it may just be conversion of the existing aa skill into the spell casting system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">no, you dont' loose your pet immediatly.<br />
<br />
only if you stay FD for 2 minutes or more.<br />
<br />
all the classes are listed as getting this at level 127, which means it's going to be a mob only spell<br />
<br />
500 HP DD, 100 Mana DD, 20% snare means your not getting far from it, and the FD will stop you for a second if your not used to it (just hit stand key). unresistable...expect to see it on a mob.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Haven't you heard?  They're raising the level cap to 130... exactly 2x the current cap. :D</div></div><hr />
