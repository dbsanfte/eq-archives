<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you need to break the spawn when king is up you need to single pull king to the front, or you can bind behind the throne, train the king to the portal there then gate back in and try to single pull him there. It's possible to single pull him at 55, I have done it. Once you get him single you are in for a hard battle. I suggest buffing up ac and hp, and regen at the end. When you fight don't use dots. Just epic, JBB and heal yourself. King won't run since there are frogs nearby you(Even tho they don't attack you :).<br />

I have done this camp many times for xp. Got a couple of newbie trolls to hold all the crowns I get. It fetch 1k normally. This camp is one of the most fun camps solo. And good xp too.</div></div><hr />

The roamer is a easy kill at the front.</div></div><hr />
