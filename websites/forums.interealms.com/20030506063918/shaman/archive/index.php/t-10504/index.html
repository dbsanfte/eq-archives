<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well, as you may of noticed by the title, i have none of the toys, and the only money i have is about 2.5k, and i suck at saving money, anyway, where should i go to solo? as im tired of grouping atm.<br />
<br />
I have most of my spells, and I am close to finishing epic, I have just got lord ghiosk, the hole and the final fight to complete, and my guild should be able to do that easily, its just that i live in europe and its a US guild, so everyones on a diff. timeline to me :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ScRuBbA</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">what other gear do you have right now? theres probably still places to solo, but grouping in PoD and PoN will get you exp faster than anywhere else unless you get all the toys and go katta soloing, which is about the same exp as decent PoD/PoN groups, but require much more work, so grouping would probably be best for you, unless your other gear besides toy slots are amazing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try chardok zone in or zone out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only other thing i have which is any help is ikky BP</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sell the iksar regen bp, with that and your 2500 buy the cheapest horse.  You will have a ton more mana right away, for outside.  <br />
<br />
Then go to Jaggedpine, enter the gnoll caves and stay right until you fall into a pit.  solo here for decent exp and 500 pp or so in a few hour session.<br />
<br />
Finish your epic!  With epic and horse you can kill nonstop Gnolls, just let your pet tank.</div></div><hr />
