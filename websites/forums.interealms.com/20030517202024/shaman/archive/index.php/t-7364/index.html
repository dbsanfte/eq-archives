<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
I have recently started a shaman, and wanted to know if the Winters Roar effect on the JBB would be enhanced by the Improved Damage focus effect?  <br />
<br />
I had used Azure Sleeves for the ID1, and am considering buying Wurm Scale Cloak for ID2, and I am hoping ID2 would be enough to give a 20percent bonus to JBB.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Focus item effects on clickys was nerfed shortly after summoned focus items came out.  I doubt SOE would let an item loose again that buffs the JBB up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Domines</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The Focus effects do seem to work on procs however, the proc on my REIF hits for up to 94 now due to the focus effect on the Mamooth hide cloak, not much but better then a poke in the eye with a sharp stick and a reason I haven't been bothered to upgrade that slot just yet.</div></div><hr />
