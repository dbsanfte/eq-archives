<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please mosey over to this thread and take a peek at the current work-in-progress of our proposal (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19068). <br />
<br />
As a result of the poll (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19072) , I have narrowed our focus to the top 5 issues. (I know there are a lot of people passionate about dots and melee and other shaman issues, but we have to stay focused!).<br />
<br />
Two areas are in need of a little love:<br />
<br />
Suggestions for improving nukes<br />
Suggestions for improving buffs<br />
<br />
I would like to finish the proposal no later than Wednesday!! We're running out of time before the launch of GoD to have our issues heard.<br />
<br />
Thanks again to everyone who voted in the poll or who provided feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kyrial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nuke suggestion:<br />
<br />
Velium Strike, level 64, casting time 7.8, 925 dmg. 300mana.<br />
Compare to cleric nuke, level 62, casting time 6.5, 1100dmg. 365 mana.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see Velium Strike changed to casting time 6.5 seconds, no other change needed.<br />
<br />
Alternative, a new poison nuke. Suggestion:<br />
Poison based nuke, level 65, casting time 6.0, 1200dmg. 400mana.<br />
This would be a clear upgrade, maybe too much?  <br />
But look at this enchanter spell:<br />
Insanity, level 64, casting time 6.0, 1100dmg. 300mana.<br />
<br />
We'd get slightly more damage than enchanter for more mana.<br />
<br />
This would put us at least where we should be.  A cleric should NOT be outnuking a shaman, they have undead nukes that can do that quite well!  Not so sure on enchanter position, but to be equivalent to enchanter does not sound that overpowering...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">STAT BUFFS<br />
<br />
Shamans cast 2 kinds of buffs that are relevant:<br />
<br />
1.  Offensive buffs that increase ATK, STR, DEX, HASTE<br />
<br />
2.  Defensive buffs that increase AC, HP, STA, AGI, RESISTS<br />
<br />
Right now, our standard buff is Focus that is part offense buff and part defense.  At high levels, most players only want ATK, HASTE, and HP, since all other stats are close to being maxed.<br />
<br />
So my suggestion would be to develop a couple of new spells one for offense and one for defense.  Each spell should have individual and group versions.<br />
<br />
1.  New offense spell - Have it buff ATK, STR, and DEX.  It should have a long duration, and stack with other class buffs, but not the Focus, STR, DEX, or Avatar lines.<br />
<br />
2.  New defensive spell - Have it buff HP, STA, and AGI. It should have a long duration.  It should stack with other class HP type buffs, but not with our STA, AGI, and HP buffs.<br />
<br />
I would also advise against any upgrades to the Avatar line, especially at the group level, unless the duration was long (over an hour)<br />
<br />
HASTE buffs<br />
<br />
Currently, our HASTE buff line is very weak. Since enchanters get a slow that is only 5% less than ours, I suggest that we get a new HASTE buff in single and group forms that is 5% less than the analogous enchanter HASTE buff.<br />
<br />
IMPROVING NUKES<br />
<br />
We need more diversity in the kinds of nukes we get.  Currently we have only poison and cold based nukes.   Here are some suggestions:<br />
<br />
1.  A new higher damage POISON nuke is needed, something along the lines of 1000-1200 damage for 300-400 mana.<br />
<br />
2.  A DISEASE based nuke line would really be distinctive, and add something unique to the shaman's ability to do damage.  Disease is interesting because it has its own debuff (Malicious Decay line) which only shamans have.  Make the top of the line spell do damage around 1000 with a mana cost of aroiund 400 or so.<br />
<br />
3.  An upgrade to our FIRE based nuke line, introduced at level 1 but then abandoned, would be nice.  This could be as simple as adding shamans to the fire based nuke line of druids, or instituting a similar line of nukes that did slightly less damage for more mana, capped with a spell that does around 1100 damage for around 450 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok in nukes spear of torment would be nice to be improved to 900 ish dd so its not such a lame useless upgrade from blast  of venom. Ideally an implementation of an equivalent spell haste like qb3 for detrimental spells would fix a lot of things.<br />
<br />
In terms of buffs,<br />
A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kind of thinking in circles ... but I came to an odd conclusion.<br />
<br />
Endurance buffs are kind of a given that they will be introduced.  Shamans may be master melee buffers but there is a stat we have yet to touch.  How about buffs that reduce the melee skills reuse timers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree, Fibonacci, endurance seems a logical buff for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">or they could just rechange acumen to being shorter duration and end regened instead of sta,  seems like the easy out for soe,  or maybe make acumen see invis/uv/end/ and g.o.d. forbid Eb<br />
<br />
perhpas make acumen the &quot;lvl 1&quot; version of this line, w/ an upgrade at 64/65 ish ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Real quick addition to your post on &quot;all others get higher dd than us&quot; post.  Neurotoxin or what ever the necro one is, hits for over 1k and is more efficient i do believe... their mana regen is through the roof, they get to life tap hp back at more efficiency than we can dot.  If they are the &quot;kings of dots&quot; why do they have such high DD?  If they arent meant to heal... why do they get the group heals they have and such.  I would almost agree that shaman can do &quot;a little bit of everything&quot;  but why are the Kings of DoTs doing more nuking than us?  While also healing themselves better than Q... <br />
<br />
Anyway my real point that I got side tracked from was even though you said &quot;all others get higher dd&quot; you listed the classes and you left out necros :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">just as an extra thing, necro ornate/ele gloves ( i belive gloves) have a similar mana pres effect on our poison nuke for neurotoxin....diffrence, theyre nuke is good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We need more +sta/str/cha/dex/agi buffs like we need rectal cancer.  More +attack and +endurance buffs THAT STACK WITH EVERYTHING would not be all bad, but Ceno hit the frikkin nail on the head:<br />
<br />
http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19083</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wonder if it'd be possible for them to make our buffs able to move past their maximum. Now correct me if I'm wrong but the max melee can get is 305 with AA. Make 355 the Maximum but the only way to move past your cap would be through buffs. Items can only take you as far as 305.<br />
<br />
So is someone with 305 Stamina was buffed with Boar they'd hit 355. Same would hold true for people at level 60 with 255. They could reach 305 with our buffs. And at 65 with 280 you'd hit 340. <br />
<br />
It'd make our buffing abilities desired regardless of how high someones stats are pre-buffed. And if melee stats effect the endurance pool they may even become more desirable as time goes on and some more melee abilites come out.<br />
<br />
Though with something like this we'd need a new line of spells. The ones Gardeltron suggested above would be great. Two buffs slots would hit all abilities including attack. If nothing at least the strength and dex portions on our Focus line would be more useful and so would the boosts on Avatar, though it'd be nice to have a longer lasting buff in the avatar line. Much better than Primal essence yet not as powerful as FA would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Best idea for buffs that I can think up--<br />
<br />
Strikethrough<br />
Avoidance<br />
Shielding<br />
Combat effects<br />
Stun Resist<br />
Accuracy, etc<br />
<br />
The same sorts of melee effects you see on Time/LDoN armor and augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/endorse Gardeltron's post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">We need end game buffs.<br />
<br />
Make buffing worthwhile. BUffs that add to combat effectiveless. STR, DEX, AGI are largely useless, and capped anyways. Give us buffs that add to chances of double attack/dual wield/ etc going off. <br />
<br />
Imagine this: Diety based theme (NOT diety restricted on casting though). Put stacking conflicts so only one aura can be up at once to prevent balance issues. Differing classes would probably have ones they prefer. I dont mind the hassle of having to buff 3 different spells, provided they last long, have fast cast/recast, and actually meaningfully increase the players capabilities (in the same fashion that VoQ increase caster abilities, and 1000+ hp buffs increase EVERYONE's power).<br />
<br />
Facepaint of Zek - adds to % of double attacks, dual wields, flurries, punishing blade etc going off. Increases Strikethrough.<br />
<br />
Stalward ward of the Tribunal - Increases parry/block %, ups Stun Resistance, larger increase of hit points than our usual HP buff.<br />
<br />
Rancor of Innoruuk - Increase taunt %, add % increasing hate mod (suck it up sk's!) to procs/effects (like furious bash), increase Combat effects.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Khati Sha - increase Dodge, Avoidance %, Overhaste of 5% or something.<br />
<br />
Frogs dont get one because they suck. I'm at a loss for Cazic.<br />
<br />
Or just forget the themes, and add buffs that combine them in different packages.<br />
<br />
Regardless, Id like buffing to be useful, since people bitch for it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Very nice guys, I'm pretty swamped at work today, but I'll take another pass through with your suggestions when I get home. After I make the updates, I'd like everyone to really help me hone/perfect the proposal so it's ready for submission on Wednsday.<br />
<br />
As a note, I love the buffing suggestions :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think a disease based nuke is an excellent idea.  I do believe it would be unique to our class.  I also think a fire based nuke would be relevant, given we started with Burst of Flame and never saw an upgrade.  There are zones where poison based dps is useless because the mobs resists are too high or they are immune.  Veksar comes to mind.  Perhaps an AoE fire nuke (instead of a rain spell)?<br />
<br />
Deffinately a line of buffs related to the new abilites coming out would give us a niche again.  I also think the suggestion for allowing our stat buffs to raise the cap is reasonable.  Perhaps shaman should be the ones with the best haste buff instead of enchanters?  After all haste is really a combat buff which is generally our area of expertise.<br />
<br />
I also like the diety relevant buff idea.  Cazic is the lord of Fear.  Perhaps the cazic buff causes the target to enrage or berserk for a short duration.  Enrage scares me.<br />
<br />
Any chance you could ask for Grobb to be returned to the trolls while your at it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">never more a stat buff ! never !<br />
Look an old henora (not so old ,like 3 week ,a month) for good sugestion about buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Under Buffing, might want to mention that gear (upper end with large stat bonuses) is another reason stat buffs (str, dex, etc.) have become less desirable.<br />
<br />
We also still don't know how significant stats are and to what degree (soft/hard caps of effectivness).  We all have theories and charts and myths, but still no common ground.  Would be nice for SOE to just come up front and say in great detail what use each stat brings, besides the generic jargon they've said in the past.<br />
<br />
And if there are soft/hard caps resulting in no significant differences at a certain point, then we need a serious look and overhaul of our buffs.  Such as what Ceno has suggested on another thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">SKs get &quot;spear of disease&quot;, &quot;spear of pain&quot;, and &quot;spear of decay&quot;, All disease nukes, so a disease nuke would not be unique to us.  And I certainly don't have the spell gems to keep a nuke with a 45 second recast memmed, so I'd be just as happy not to be sharing those in their current form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Unoeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SK's don't have an unresistable disease debuffer to go with their disease nuke do they?  And certainly a 45 sec cast timer is right out.  I agree, I'd not like to share the SK spell line.  I didn't realize it was disease based.<br />
<br />
Although stat buffs are non-essential at the high end, I don't know anyone that complains about getting a few extra hps from a stam. buff.  I believe the point was if the only way to go beyond the current stat cap was with our stat buff line, then perhaps stat buffs would become useful at the high end again. /shrug<br />
<br />
Perhaps a nuke which converts hps to dmg might be in line with shaman type canni. theme?  Maybe its a type of dot instead?  Channel hps to dmg to a target on a 1-to-1 basis at 500 a tic.  The effect ends when the shaman breaks line of sight, clicks off the icon on his own buff list, or runs outta hps and dies.  We could offset this with Torpor or Q, or a cleric could back us up.  Maybe that's too much.  /shrug<br />
<br />
I still want Grobb back though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">While its probably too large a change to the underlying combat engine, theres a change to make stats meaningful I'd like to see.  Have the stat buffs add directly to skills.  For example, buffing agility could add points directly to the dodge skill.  Strength buffs could add to damage bonus, etc.  Make this so that only buffing adds, equipment and innate stats work as they do now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi Gloriana,<br />
<br />
Thanks much for hosting this thread.  I almost always agree with you 100% for the past few years on all issues, btw.  Anyway, my 2c is to keep the cold and poison line nukes, one fast, one slow - just pump up the damage on them up 50% or so.  I like having a strategic choice of nukes.  For that matter a better rain would be nice also - again a strategic choice.<br />
<br />
Buffing is a tough one since the stats don't mean too much in the end game.  Frankly I would be happy with a extended duration FA AA skill.  I think the odds are slight that Sony will re-tool the buffing system, so I suggest just biting the bullet and not fighting that battle.<br />
<br />
As an aside - I suggest a canny of 50% more than canny4....Sony's suggested amount is not enough in my opinion.  And my goodness, drop the worthless disease dot.<br />
<br />
I believe that these suggestions would not be overpowered and would address what I think are the most pressing Shaman issues, quick damage and the tedious repetition of canny and FA.  I also think that a slightly beefed up Q is fine for healing improvements although I think it should be 400/tick.  Again, I come back to strategic decisions which is what makes the shaman class fun and unique.  I see no need to be a mini cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Focus of the Seventh:<br />
600hp (I mean come on, Group Nine is LESS mana for MORE HP, + Mana Regen)<br />
Remove Str/Dex<br />
Add Avoidance 15<br />
Stun Resist 10<br />
Shielding 5<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar:<br />
+160ATK (only fair that it's higher than Fero)<br />
Remove other Stats<br />
+15 Strikethrough<br />
+25 Combat Effects<br />
+15 Accuracy<br />
<br />
Acumen (and Group Acumen):<br />
Ultravision<br />
Water Breathing<br />
See Invisible<br />
Add reasonable Stamina Regeneration, similar to where Clarity II is for Mana regeneration. Nothing over the top)<br />
Increase mana to somewhere around 300 for single target, and 1k for the group version, but increase duration to 1 hour and 20 minutes bringing it in line with our other buffs.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li:<br />
This needs an upgrade. Increase duration and the movement rate to equal Flight of Eagles, Increase the ammount of ATK it gives from 15 to 40, and make the mana somewhere around 450 to account for these changes and the duration boost.<br />
<br />
Spear of Torment:<br />
Increase mana cost by 50, and make the damage 1150. Make this spell level 64, and make Velium Strike be level 61. <br />
<br />
Velium Strike:<br />
6.0 sec base cast time and increase the damage to 1000.<br />
<br />
Talisman/Strength of the Daiku and Primal Essence:<br />
 Make an NPC who you can hail to remove these spells for your spellbook and give you one alternate advancement point for each. Change existing copies of the spell to no class.<br />
<br />
Talisman of the Tribunal:<br />
Increase PR/DR to levels equal to FR/CR on Protection of Seasons (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3444&amp;source=Live). Decrease mana from 500 to 450 to equal PoS, increase duration to 2.5 hours to equal PoS. Remove Recast time to make it Equal to PoS. Or keep it the way it is and have it remove 2 poison and 2 disease counters per tick =b<br />
<br />
Malosinia:<br />
Malosini was 200 mana, Malosinia is 300. The only advantage of Sinia is it decreases resists by a further 10. This is downright retarded. I know this thread is about buffs/nukes, but this spell needs to be made 225 mana or something.<br />
<br />
Talisman of Alacrity:<br />
Increase Mana Cost by 250<br />
Change haste from 50% to 60%.<br />
<br />
And last but certainly not least...<br />
<br />
Voice of the Berserker:<br />
Change plague of Daluda to an upgrade for this spell. Remove the str/dex/agi. Instead of having it grey out spells, change the effect to a silence (but let procs work while under the effect). You can remove it by clicking it off. By keeping this spell up, you gain 150 double attack, 100 riposte, 125 dodge, BASH of 200, a damage bonus of 10 (a bit less than real melees), 50ac, and add some sort of a damage/stun proc. We won't be able to canni while this is going, so I really don't see why this isn't justifiable :p The idea is we go ape**** and are capable of doing bard level melee DPS, at the expense of spellcasting. Seriously, what in the hell is wrong with that?<br />
<br />
Or... Make Rabid Bear the above with &quot;Improved Rabidity&quot;... hell, make it require hastened rabidity 3 before you can get it, or something. and reduce the recast so we can use it at will.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and fix the bear lip! :D</div></div><hr />

Hey Purdydog, thanks for the kind comments. I want to point out that I contributed VERY little content to the Proposal thread. It was written by a huge number of Crucible posters, and I'd like to thank them for their input.<br />
<br />
It's highly probable we might not get anything we asked for. It's kinda late in the GoD development cycle, anyway. I think the important thing is to get our issues out there, get them read. There's always expansions down the line where the developers might have more of an opportunity to address our concerns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">DO NOT DO ANOTHER POISON NUKE!!!<br />

Don't hold your breath on Sony making one for us.  For god's sake, stick with cold nukes--at least they have cold focuses.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Healing Suggestions:<br />
<br />
* Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option).<br />
* Some sort of upgrade to or improvement of Quiescence.<br />
* Some sort of faster and more efficient quick single-target heal.<br />
<br />
We need a BIGGER quick single-target heal.  <br />
<br />
All of the suggestions noted above are good, but our ability to support a group will depend on the size of our heal, not just speed/mana-efficiency.<br />
<br />
Size of single-target heal also adds to our survivability - slow the mob, its slowed but now you're tanking, you already have q-style effect going.  Switch to self and start healing.  More heal = more ability to tank (in a group/raid situation where someone else is doing dps).<br />

That has to be the most original thing I've heard yet, and one I'd be completely for.  You could make it so that each race recieved a different aura, and the aura itself could be made as a passive aa ability that you purchased.  I would pay 20 aa if I knew that me being an Inny worshipping troll shaman meant that the tanks in my group swung faster, had more hp, or had more hate, etc.  The race you'd pick would matter once again.  I love it.<br />
<br />
Also thought Grizlor's suggestions for changes on Fo7, FA, Acumen, Bih'li, Talisman of Alacrity, Spear of torment, and Velium Strike were all very good.  Especially liked how it made Fo7 a defensive buff, and made FA a strictly offensive buff while addressing the main issues with each.</div></div><hr />

we get our first pet at level 34, compared to other &quot;pet classes&quot; who get theirs at levels 1, 4, or (see our hybrid) 9.<br />
<br />
our pets are always lower level, have lower hitpoints, and hit for less damage than any other &quot;pet class&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
i haven't made a pet in six months; i could care less if shaman never saw another pet spell. regardless of what eye candy AA's we receive, our pets will never be a substantial source of tankage or dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
i would like to see the Hastened Cure AA given to shaman rather than druids. shaman have traditionally been the kings/queens of curing. druids are already both more versatile and necessary on raids than shaman:<br />
<br />
druids -- needed buff, 2nd best healing, 3rd (ish) best nuking, MGB'able heal over time.<br />
<br />
shaman -- best (by a slim margin) slow, 4th best spot heal, crap dps with inhibitively high agro, a buff that our HYBRID can surpass<br />
<br />
<br />
hi, shaman need the quick RC bone more than druids do.<br />
<br />
<br />
quick radiant cure, no crap pet AA's (another spirit call? W T F'ing F?!), an endurance buff that matters, group FA, perhaps a buff that increases proc frequency or potency, detrimental spell haste AA in line with quick buff, a new cannibalize spell that eats at least 30% more hp for 30% more mana than canni4, hastened canniV AA, and an upgrade to quiescence - either group torpor or an upgrade to Q that actually HEALS FOR MORE PER TICK than torpor, our uber kunark relic.<br />
<br />
these are solid ideas that have been mentioned repeatedly<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So shaman, &quot;king of buffs,&quot; the only way to really make us useful buffers again is to have a +Atk line. From level one, any melee class would be happy to have more atk. Im not saying to go over the top with some +200 atk 3 hour group buff at level 9 (that would be pretty sweet though), but having a scaled set of buffs starting at 24 with a group buffs in the 50's and 60's that give +atk would quickly fix our buffing problem. As long as they stacked with other classes spells and were not six minutes long, i would be happy to have my buff line up be hos(fos, or fo7), a haste and a buff that does +atk. If enchanters are the kings of caster buffs we should be the kings of melee buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Focus of the Seventh:<br />
600hp (I mean come on, Group Nine is LESS mana for MORE HP, + Mana Regen)<br />
Remove Str/Dex<br />
Add Avoidance 15<br />
Stun Resist 10<br />
Shielding 5<br />
<br />
Ferine Avatar:<br />
+160ATK (only fair that it's higher than Fero)<br />
Remove other Stats<br />
+15 Strikethrough<br />
+25 Combat Effects<br />
+15 Accuracy<br />
<br />
Spirit of Bih'Li:<br />
This needs an upgrade. Increase duration and the movement rate to equal Flight of Eagles, Increase the ammount of ATK it gives from 15 to 40, and make the mana somewhere around 450 to account for these changes and the duration boost. <br />
<br />
- now if that don't knock your socks off for effective and reasonable buff upgrades, nothing will. Would need to bump FA to 20 mins, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you guys seen a poison specific nuke focus . . .<br />
<br />
Don't hold your breath on Sony making one for us.  For god's sake, stick with cold nukes--at least they have cold focuses.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
with conjuration as secondary forte, posion nukes are money<br />
<br />
just need more focus effects with +% all nukes, hard to find good item with a improve damageIV (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3513&amp;source=Live)  or  Anger of Solusek (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3514), but they out there..</div></div><hr />

Upgrade to Spear of Torment: 975 Damage, 5 second cast time, 350 mana.<br />
<br />
Or: Velium Strike with a lowered recast time<br />

Buff Upgrade: (This is assuming that strikethrough buffs, avoidance buffs etc will remain unimplemented in any spell form in the new expansion. If they were, we should get them)<br />

they won't.  we are hosed.  i did not buy Yekesha, wished i had not bought LDoN, i won't buy GoD.  prob would have not got PoP except for the travel, and it is where all the crack dealers are.<br />
<br />
empirical evidence does not change Sony.  sit downs, massive whining and account cancelations do.  Shaman will not do that, break out the lube.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Buffs can add directly to skills, which is infinitely more useful than adding to stats. Hawkeye adds directly to archery skill, and there are already working % mods for skills in the game. Extending this mechanic to buffs, to provide meaningful increases to EVERYONE (regardless of if your stats are capped or not!) increases the support role power of the shaman class, increases group contributions, upgrades the power of pure melees (who have been lacking), and seems a win/win situation. I would say its surprising it hasnt been done before, but then I would be lying.<br />
<br />
To those who want more stats... with daiku and fo7, you and your party are BOUND to be approaching cap. Even if you arent, surely the end must be in sight. Recognize that a minor stat buff upgrade will soon be useless to you, while a SKILL/SPECIAL ABILITY buff will always be useful.<br />
<br />
Shamans need a hate giving ability. We draw aggro more than about any other class. We have no spell casting subtlety aa. We have no divine aura. Our ability to save ourselves with aggor is largely limited to root parking, as &quot;in teh face&quot; tanking becomes largely a joke with slow mitigating mobs quadding for 900 a pop (reguras). With each expansion, the % gap between our hp and casters decreases, and our mitigation vs mob damage becomes trivial. We AVOID hits the same as Int casters, who often have more safetly measures (self skins) to help them out. Our supposed tanking advante over an enchanter is rapidly vanishing, while beastlords and bards have a noticible edge. The Rancor of Innoruuk buff would provide help in our tanks keeping aggro, allow us to USE more of our abilities. Other auras would aid in diff situations, and the Khati or Tribunal lines would help in saving our asses greatly.  Thats what I want out of buffs, its how I think buffs should ahve been done since the beginning. I dont want an overhaul of how stats work, or any sweeping engine changes. I DO want useful spells. There are people who swear up and down that agi is worthless (I am one), there are people who swear by it. BOTH camps I would hope would recognize the inherent usefullness of a Dodge/Avoidance buff. The changes would please both camps.</div></div><hr />
