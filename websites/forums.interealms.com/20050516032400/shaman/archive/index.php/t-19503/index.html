I am still impressed the guide actually joked back.<br />
<br />
Lots of guides joke around when dealing with a non-agitated, impatient, jerk-off customer.  They aren't usually prone to start the joking around, as jocularity could be seen as not taking the petitioner seriously, which may add unneeded tension to the situation, and most people that I know are usually not at their happiest when they send a pet in.<br />
<br />
Not saying all guides are like this, as some are kind of dickish.  Othertimes, the guide might just be annoyed or tired, after a long day at work and a busy day on the queue.  I petition stupid names fairly frequently, and once I petitioned someone named &quot;Toohotforu&quot;.<br />
<br />
The guide informed me that there'd been a change to the naming policy, and phrases were now acceptable.  I asked if I could make a prexus worshipping bard, and RP him as a pirate, with the name &quot;Fishinmepants&quot;.  He said I could try, but that it might be construed as a sexual term.  I then asked if &quot;Fishinmegreaves&quot; (Fish are in my greaves, not I am fishing in my greaves) would be ok.  He said that'd be up to a GM.<br />
<br />
I responded, &quot;Arrrr, I be thankin' ye for the help, laddie buck!  Ye'd make a fine deck-swabber on my rig, if'n ye joined us!&quot;  He then said &quot;You're welcome, blah blah blah, bye.&quot;  He totally resisted my humor attempts, weak as they were, and as friendly as I was trying to be.<br />
<br />
There are all kinds of guides, who guide for different reasons, just like the players play EQ for different reasons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think if more people used the word jocularity a lot of the worlds problems would be solved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Except that most people in EQ would think that jocularity had something to do with athletic supporters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wait, it doesn't have to do with athletic support?  ****, I may have to reword that whole post!<br />
<br />
 ;) <br />

Gwain = English major, so most of his writing is for people who &lt;3 big words and give him higher grades for it.  Sometimes it bleeds over onto forums out of habit.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i couldnt be a guide.. well least not for long, i be to prone to ressing anyone i saw dead, cos i just kind that way, givening stuff away and well breaking most the rules guides have , so for the 5 mins before i was caught it be great:)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Selzzif O'retsam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe, I find myself out of game for a few weeks and click onto a post like this. Fantastic...lol, makes me want to log in and see what other mobs have &quot;ample cleavage&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You know, this story pretty well sums up all of my interactions with guides.  I've never EVER had a rude or ignorant guide.<br />
<br />
I just wish there were more GMs like this.  Most seem... a little lost upon Norrath.</div></div><hr />
