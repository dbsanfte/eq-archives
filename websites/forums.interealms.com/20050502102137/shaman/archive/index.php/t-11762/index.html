<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if i missed any posts on this subject.   I was wondering if someone could give me a link to any charms that shamans can use and where they might be found.  Thks for your time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Korrundar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bump!!  Anyone have any recommendations yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've still only seen two charms in-game: <br />
<br />
1. Stats raise as you have more money.<br />
2. Stats raise as your weapon skills increase.  <br />
<br />
And the final stats are laughable.  Someone with 100k gets something like 2ac and 3cha from charm 1.  Someone with every weapon skill maxxed gets 5dex and 5agi, or something similar to that, for charm 2.  <br />
<br />
I suspect many of the charms have yet to be added to the game yet.  Maybe some of the yet-to-be-added ones will be useful.  One clue is the fact that you can search for charms in the bazaar window.  However, both that I have seen are no-drop.  I haven't even heard anyone claim to have seen a droppable charm.  <br />
<br />
At this point, spending time camping a charm dropping mob is a waste of time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I picked up a really nice charm from the Captian of the Stormwave in Dulak's harbor.<br />

A Shimmering Emerald Crystal<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19710<br />
<br />
It has the stats shown for me with 4 of the 5 skills maxed.<br />
<br />
Nice little charm, easy to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dyrk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have a charm of deception, or something.  Dropped in Nadox, but his name was so long/funky, I forgot it by time I logged off.  In bear form (only activates in illusion form), it grants 6sta 10dex 10cha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Look in the equipment forum there are a few threads about charms there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I took a bit of time and found a Mammoth Tusk Powder from initiates in Gunthak.<br />
<br />
Gives bonuses as Wisdom and Agility increase.</div></div><hr />

Its not the best but it will do, for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have the crappy charisma.  I cast my cha buff and grabbed some steins - no effect at 175 cha.  At least I have something to leave on my corpse for a later res.</div></div><hr />
