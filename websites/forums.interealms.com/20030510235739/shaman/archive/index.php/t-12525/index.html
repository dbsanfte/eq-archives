<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night in BoT using True Spirit I saw something I haven't seen in a long, long time. <br />
<br />
&quot;Jenaner goes on a RAMPAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
First thing, let me say that it was definitely rampage, NOT enrage as everyone in the serverwide.crucible channel thought it was. I know well the difference between the two and I do know how to read. I was not drunk or high at the time either  ;) <br />
<br />
This is the first time I've seen our pet rampage in close to a year I think, last time I saw it was while I was level 60 doing AA's in Fungus Grove pre-PoP using our 55 pet. I thought it was removed from our pet abilities shortly thereafter, and therefore it was quite a shock to see it happen last night. Was this something new introduced in the patch?<br />
<br />
I got to thinking that it might have something to do with multiple mobs, as the only time I ever saw it in Fungus Grove way back when was when I pulled 3-4 mushrooms at a time (usually by accident hehe  :D ), and last night it occurred in the middle of a 4 mob pull that our monk messed up  :p <br />
<br />
Buffs it had were just FoSoul and Speed of Vallon, and was equipped with Blade of Walnan / Fist of Ixiblat / Girdle of Magi'Kot / Muzzle of Mardu - no avatar / ferine avatar.<br />
<br />
Was this just a freak thing I witnessed or has anyone else noticed it lately too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm positive it was my pet - group was war / clr / monk / ranger / ench / mage, and both ench / mage were using CoD / CotAM pets. I was standing right next to pet at the time and he didn't shield me or anyone else - we all lived through fight and no one got remotely close to dying - 2 CoD type pets make quick work of 4 slowed mobs in BoT. Whole fight lasted less than 90 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it was frenzied burnout , mage AA skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">it was frenzied burnout , mage AA skill<br />
<br />
No it wasn't - I asked mage in my group if it was, he'd used it on his charmed pet. Frenzied burnout only works for mages own pet anyways afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The 61 Dogdog and spiritcall pets will enrage when low on health, which gives a red message too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">never happen to me before, only see pet rampage message is when mage nearby and it is not my pet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have also seen my pet shield me recently. I've never ever seen this before. <br />
<br />
I have the level 49 pet.<br />
<br />
Is it dependent on how much XP you have at the tim? For instance, if you have below a certain percentage will your pet automatically start shielding you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not that I've seen.  I have not seen a rampage message on Goner, his younger brothers, or his Spirit Call siblings.<br />
<br />
All the pets that are above level 30 (I think that's the 44 + spells) will shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's pretty rare, but I've actually seen and have screen shots of a lvl 55 shaman pet, and a 50ish SK pet with the exact same names, in the same zone, hunting together in The Grey, and once again in ME. That would make it harder to see what pet is doing the rampage for sure, if that was a possibily of what happened.<br />
Otherwise that would be a nice little addition to True Spirit. Hopefully it will be more common than enrage, as it seems True Spirit only enrages once every 10+ mintues. I never timed it, but when I first got True Spirit, I wanted to see it for myself, and it did take a while to reset, too long that I lost interest when it didn't work within 20 minutes or so.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">you people are hitting the glass pipe too hard<br />
<br />
our 61 pet does not rampage. It will enrage when low on health, and thats it. <br />
<br />
sheesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
And not once, ever ever, have I seen 2 pets with the same name in the same zone at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have seen 2 pets with the same name in my years of playing, I can vouch for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have seen 2 mages' pet named the same &quot;Goner&quot;, believe it or not.<br />
<br />
Shielding is normal when u down below 30% life or so and near ur pet.<br />
<br />
Juka, a SS will be more convicing tho, if it happen again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've only seen my dog Rampage once and flurry twice.  Neither time did we have a mage in the group.  He enrages all the time (heal him quick, because the next hit would probably kill him, which doesn't do your DPS any good).  I never see the starts shielding message and if he was shielding me, I'm probably toast anyway, so it's rare for me to see the end shield message)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have seen pets with the same name multiple times.  Just a couple days ago my pet and a SK's pet both had the same name.  What you are NOT seeing is the fact that one is named Joner_01 and the other is Joner_02.  As far as rampage goes, while I haven't seen a shaman pet do it, my main's (necro) PoP pet has rampaged before (yes yes, I know they enrage at 10% health.  This was a rampage).  Please don't ask me to post logs.  I'm not anal retentive enough to save crap like that.  Even for bragging rights.<br />
<br />
My guess, since I don't have access to VI's pet(s) coding, is that the game screws up occasionally and a pet will rarely take on characteristics it shouldn't have from another pet or other NPC in the zone.  Kinda like those lizard/horse mounts that walk around on their own and even get into sparring contests in PoK or run off in Fear and tank CT.  Little easier to believe now?<br />
<br />
Pets are inherently screwy anyway and dangit, I like them that way.<br />
