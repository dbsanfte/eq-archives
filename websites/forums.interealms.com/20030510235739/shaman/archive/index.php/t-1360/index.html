<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok , for starters i have never been in here. I have the map and im looking for inside information on the easiest and safest spots to Solo.  Im equipped Well enough i think it wont be to difficult.<br />
<br />
Lvl 58 iks shaman<br />
2045 hp<br />
993 AC<br />
fungi tunic + epic<br />
<br />
now that being said, there are two wanderers when you zone in. Being lvl 58 and knowing i can take the HT's with a smile, should i fight the opening mobs and move on from there? Which direction would i go? <br />
Ive seen on other threads that people say they zone in with Levitate and run off north side and gate or camp.  Im still puzzled .. Are there mobs down where you run off? It looks like to me from the map(could be a little inaccurate) there are no mobs in the fall off basement, is this a Myth? <br />
<br />
Im just looking for a good time and great Xp soloing, figuring with the xp bonus in there i can get better xp as an iksar than soloing on the moon dealing with all the PR/DR mobs up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Zone in and fight two that are there.  At 58 i believe you still get good exp from the sets of golems around the outside, but i haven't fought there for over a year now.  Anyway, yes, drop down the north to the right of the north set of stairs.  There are lots of mobs downstairs, but you drop north as there is a ledge a little ways down and you can sit on the ledge (which slopes down to the rest of the area) without aggroing mobs, make pet, buff etc.  From this ledge, you can single pull the mobs you see to you (and you shouldn't get adds).  Again, been a long ass time now for me, but there are a few wanderers, and a few statics you can see from this ledge.  Once they are spread out you can also pull mobs from the entrances down below (either east or west doors which once through there also split again for more mobs.  HS is a great zone, i kinda wish i didnt get ot faction oh so long ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">if you are 56+, then you won't get immediate agro when zone in, just watch their walk and charge one when two at opposite position, choose one and run to it, then slow,dot,tank,epic. if other add, just root park and slow it and keep kill first one.<br />
<br />
now, after first die, then kill second in your own way, I ususlly set up pet anda make 5 minute between kill. write down spawn time and count 22minute for next<br />
<br />
after both zone in mob die, you can start pull 8 golem at each door, since Golem will run when low hp, and they alway run to EAST stair, so I ususlly fight at buttom of west stair, but if you let mob flee, it won't bring any train unless your pet follow it. it simple drop down to basement and can never reach you again, and his spawn will never spawn again untill someone kill it at basement, I been knock one skeleton down basement and never spawn again which make me safer<br />
<br />
there are one wander mob from east wing will open east door from time to time, so don't pull east when see wander there, it can summon and harder than normal mob<br />
<br />
if you have trouble from add, just Jump down basement . mob can't follow you to basement, or basement can't teleport to top<br />
<br />
for pulling, if you want pull west's golem, just stand at east side and cast there, don't silly enough to move as close as possible to cast spell. basement have lots of skeleton and HT which suck up hp fast</div></div><hr />
