<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How do I know what cure to attempt when party gets affected by a trap in LDoN. I know that some are easy to look up on Lucy. <br />
Example: Embalming Fumes I would cure with a cople of casts of Nadox. But how do I know how to cure Raging Sand? Lasts for 30 minutes, so is nasty if not cured.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get Radiant Cure and guess no more.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I'm almost 100% positive that Blood of Nadox cures this as well.  Though I did look it up on Lucy I did not see any counters added by the spell.  Though I know I have cured this in the past with Nadox.  My experince is if Nadox dont cure it then its a Curse.  And any of the remove curse spells will work.  I personally only have the lesser remove as I needed a curse removal spell and I bought that to do the job.  Works great is not for in the middle of a battle but out side of battle it works like a charm just takes a bit longer to cure curses then the greater one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">RC is helpfull but its not all powerfull. I have seen a lot of stuff that it takes 2 RC's to cure. You pretty much have to be ready for anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RC has a chance of curing it. Nadox did not cure it. Did Nadox and the single target cure several times on same target. No go. Remove curse (several casts) might have worked. Unsure if the 30 minutes had passed by then or if I cured it using the spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the nastiest *disease hand buff icon* trap DoTs I ran into took 3 or 4 (forget) casts of Blood of Nadox to cure the group!  That's 60-80 disease counters!  Amazing!  <br />
BLood is truly a useful spell tho.  I use it for large, important raids also where it's VERY helpful.  Such as Babnoxious the Spider Queen in PoFire.  Or the croc in PoEarth.  Both fights make BLood of Nadox look really pimp.  <br />
<br />
Radiant cure 3 is also hard to go wrong with.  Cures almost anything in one cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UnionTK</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe if you look at what Radiant Cure does it removes Poison Counters, Disease Counters and &quot;Detrimental&quot; which means it has a chance of curing bad stuff that doesn't have poison or disease counters. Raging Sand doesn't add counters but is considered Detrimental, so RC or dispel magic should do the trick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I also tried Blood of Nadox, didn't work. Wasn't doing much damage so I figured I'd live with it. It really starts picking up momentum as time wears on. I tried Remove Curse, didn't work. Finally, to avoid dying to it, I cast Annul. Stripped my Virtue, but also stripped Raging Sand. This was approaching the 30 minute mark so its possible that it went down on its own, but how likely is it that it went down exactly at the same time I cast Annul?<br />
I just assumed it was magic based. Been worried about that a bit too.</div></div><hr />
