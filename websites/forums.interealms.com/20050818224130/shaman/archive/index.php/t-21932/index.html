<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know they have talked about being able to return augments, but I never heard about the pieces..  1500 ldon points are hard enough to come by for me, so I would rather not buy 1500 armour then kick myself when the 2k armour (or however many points) comes out.  Anyone heard if you will be able to turn in the lower purchased armour for some points?  Even half points would be better than nothing..<br />
<br />
I currently have 2k points and am wondering if I should just save like 5k before OOW or just buy now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I have 1200 points saved and I'm not buying anything till OoW when I find out how this is all going to shake out.<br />
<br />
The elemental quality LDON armor will probalby end up being one of the biggest time sinks imaginable, with like 40+ adventures needed.<br />
<br />
What I wish they would do is implement a system where that once you have cleared out a theme, you then get more points per that theme's adventure won, like 70 points versus 51. But only after you get 1492 there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just wish they would let you turn in old stuff for credit.  Having to just trash the pieces I have, even if I can get the augs off, would be a PITA..<br />
<br />
Ok, don't HAVE to trash it, but seeing as how this is the top armour available for a non-raider adn there is no progression past...yeah, I'll get it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think they will NEED to implement some form of &quot;refund&quot; or risk some SERIOUS negative feedback. After all, LDoN is supposed to be the &quot;casual - non-raiders&quot; path to top quality gear. Well, lots took that path, and bought the BEST. Now you are going to ask them to replace those items with more expensive ones, and trash the existing item? Not good.<br />
<br />
They have already indicated that they will be creating some method to de-augment items and re-use the augs in new items. Perhaps they can implement some form of &quot;credit towards&quot; system, where if you turn in an Incorporal armor piece, you get credit for the NEXT  level up piece in the same slot ONLY, cant use those credit points for any others items or slots. Actually, I think this would be a great idea overall. Why have 2nd, 3rd and 4th level armor at all if its going to be trashed once you upgrade it. This isnt Kunark to Velious to Luclin to PoP. If I was a lvl 40, say, and could buy the 3rd best BP, with the assurance that when I earned some more points, I could buy the 2nd best BP with some points + my old 3rd level one, etc etc, then I would be more inclined to take this route, even if I only got 80% credit or so. <br />
<br />
Dunno if anyone followed that, heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It won't even be close to the time commitment of getting a guild elemental flagged and then farm enough gear for everyone.  Don't forget BP's only drop in Time as well.  Sorry, but 40 adventures is a bargain for Elemental quality gear.<br />
<br />

<br />
Why not?  Everyone else has to do that.  I don't recall seeing any time of refund for the amount of time/work that was putting into farming the gear I have each time I replace it.  <br />
<br />
You should be happy that you can get gear of that quality without the need for raiding, but some of you are wanting way too much.  You should have to put in just as much work/time for comparable gear as the person that gets it by raiding.   If its significantly easier to get it in an LDoN then whats the point of even raiding?  Everyone will just do LDoN to get the same quality gear for easier.</div></div><hr />

Sorry - but that dog won't hunt.<br />

Over and over we (the ubiquitous &quot;we&quot;) on this board are told that raiders raid because they LIKE raiding.  The comraderie, the sense of accomplishment, the taking down of harder and harder MOBs.<br />
<br />
Now you're saying that it's for the pixels?<br />
<br />
Shocked ! Shocked I am ! Shocked I say !</div></div><hr />

I raid becaue I enjoy raiding. <br />
<br />
I farm raid mobs for gear.<br />

There is a difference, a HUGE one, in fact.</div></div><hr />
