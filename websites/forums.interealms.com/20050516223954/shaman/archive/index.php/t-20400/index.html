Read some of the follow up mage posts, they feel our pain :).<br />

Also, the link to the wizard board...um...:rolleyes:.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Frankly if anyone gets a rez i think it should be us. I mean it would make up for the ****ty healing for 1, but just from a class stand point, we are the ones that deal with the spirits. What in the world would make a tree hugger be able to bring back the dead ? They grow thigns nad deal with livng things and nature.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont say that cause i want a rez, i have never wanted a rez cept for the times that im running back to my corpse ;)  But it just seems logical that we should get it over a druid  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">make them cost about 10K a pop. No reason to upset all the rezz classes, but give people the opportunity to bring a group/adventure/whatever back to life at a hefty cost.</div></div><hr />

Give clerics some form of slow or snare, and some more nukes or something. That way tehy can raise shaman and cleric healing and our DPS .</div></div><hr />

Yea, let's give them something completely NEW for slight upgrades to things we are ALREADY supposed to be good at.<br />
<br />
Much less class-specific things like slow for us, Beastlords, and Enchanters, and snare for Rangers and Druids.<br />
<br />
:confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lol, play EQ Much? Up until GoDS (Where too many mobs mitigate slow) Shamans were far and away the best healers in EQ (Based on Slow, Heals and Mana Regen). SoE made a significant nerf on slow with the GodS expansion and now Shamans just can't keep up. That is why Shaman's are being upgrade.<br />

Plain and simple, Shamans and druids need a heal upgrade.<br />
Find something unique to do with their heals though.<br />
Clerics have the big number, straight out heals. They should have them at the lowest mana cost and/or the fastest casting time.<br />
<br />
Give shamans a reverse canni heal.<br />
Sucks away from their mana bar as though it were a dot, and have it add to tank health for as long as that lasts. And allow other spells to be cast while that one is in effect. WIthout looking at the numbers, Let's say 700 health per tick for 350 mana per tick. Give it a 10 tick duration with a near-zero casting cost, and bam. Suddenly the heals a shaman has, which can be used on top of that, are more useful. Even VoQ wouldn't help the shaman much here. You'd have to time it right, and if you needed to, you could canni.<br />
<br />
You'd have a shaman who's feeding his/her magickal power into the spirit world, to provide healing for someone else.<br />
They'd have to code it so it couldn't be used on self, but *shrug*<br />
<br />
Numbers might need some tweaking, but a very interesting idea. <br />
<br />
Stack on Q or Thrushar pre-pull *BAM CLERIC DIES!* omg!<br />
<br />
Activate drain-heal and then spam heal. Will drain you extremely fast and probably empty, but you've got a good chance of keeping tank up.</div></div><hr />

After reading the WoW Shaman post, and the abilities of classes there to leash their spells (read the post to understand what I'm talking about), this sounds almost like plagarism.  Would be nice if Sony could come up with their own ideas.<br />
<br />
And on a side note, even if Sony did put something like that in EQ, it still wouldn't stop me from switching over.</div></div><hr />

I am new here, but I dont care where SOE steals ideas from, if there good and makes the game more fun for me to play who cares.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I believe shaman should get a moderately long recast AA which increases the chance of a crit heal to 50% for 2 or 3 mins. <br />
<br />
This would help us deal better with specific situations (hi 1 group encounter quad 2k unslowable boss), without overpowering healing in more normal settings. <br />
<br />
p.s Mages should get some form of cc, weaker than bard/chanter</div></div><hr />

Perhaps its just my personal opinion but it’s a minority of Druid or Shamans that seem to be vocal about wanting to be a healer, my question to them is always why? I’m glad I can heal, I’m glad Druids and Shamans have nice heal spells but I don’t see why when you have so many other capabilities as a Druid or Shaman you want to take on the role of healer.

A) Because I'm one of three priest classes, it's what priests do. B) Because I already have to rely on clerics to be present for raids, I don't want to rely on them for groups. Is it nice to have a cleric to heal for a group? Absolutely. Is there always one available? No way. Having at least two other classes capable of healing for a group is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You are a priest class and you can heal, you also have resources that allow you to heal quite affectively. Shamans have the ability to Slow, which is a great equalizer and well sought after in groups. <br />
<br />
As cynical as it may be if it comes down to simple convenience of being able to play then any class should be able to heal therefore allowing for convenience of grouping. The game is designed to be a challenge and allowing for players to use strategy, cunning as well as resourcefulness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">BuzWeaver<br />
What do you do when a mob mitigates slow it slight or is immune as a shaman in a group?  You watch the group members die because you cannot heal fast enough.<br />
<br />
What do you do when you aren't good enough to be the secondary healer in a group, with the main healer being the cleric?  <br />
Thesecondary healer has to be another cleric or a druid, because your continual spamming of tnargs with all the healing AA's and focus items isn't enough.<br />
<br />
Buz, it's easy to heal in BoT or on Easy LDoN's as a shaman. That's not the issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i've been able to be single healer in EP groups before the healing changes, the Q change was nice, and i'm lookin to get the new heal too :) .. i can't comment too much about GoD healing since i'm not all that experienced with the expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think there is a difference between druids and shaman on this.  I group with druids and rely on them as healers (my guild has a cleric shortage).  The druids in my guild will heal, if they have to, but would rather nuke and dot.  Most druids that I know &quot;don't care to be a healer.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The thing is Buz, shamans do not have effective nukes to fall back on.  We can slow, and act as secondary healers.  That is our real the extent of our &quot;capabilities&quot;.  My healing is based around the idea that I can slow.  So I have poor quality heals, since slow makes up for it.  This is all well and good until I am put in content where my slow is commonly mitigated, highly resisted, or not very useful because of the length of the fight.<br />
<br />
If I am in that situation my prime capability (slowing) is not effective, my secondary capability (healing) is also not effective, because shaman healing was balanced around the idea that I could slow a mob to 75%.  This is what screws the shamans that are trying to do high-end content.  If our prime skill of slowing is useless, our secondary skill of healing is also useless.<br />
<br />
Druids nuke well, and heal well.  Shamans nuke poorly, and heal fairly (although if a mob is slowed to 75% fairly is ussualy enough).  I can understand a druid not being enthusiastic about healing, if they would rather nuke.  Shamans how ever, have never been nukers, and our traditional means of damage (dots) are not strong in the high end content.<br />
<br />
When you said <br />
<br />
&quot;I'm much more affective using the spells designed for my Druid and Shaman to be concerned about healing a group&quot;<br />
<br />
I have to ask what spells those are?  If you're picturing a lvl 65 shaman stacking dots on a mob and watching it’s hps melt away, you do not understand.  The fights are too short, and shamans have no lure style dots, and so have to debuff before getting dots to stick, future shorting the time that a shaman has to dot.  Not to mention the agro that would result from using our faster poison based dots.<br />
<br />
What are these &quot;many other capabilities as a Druid or Shaman&quot; that I can do when my slow is ineffective?  I guess I can root park, and use heal over times to top off hurt folks hp's after the fight.  However so many classes can already root park, and the healing of any hybrid can top folks off.<br />
<br />
I've read that shamans do not need more healing, as it would be unbalanced because of all our utility (or “capabilities” in your words).  What is this capability or utility that shamans have?  I'm invited to groups to slow, and heal.  No one has ever invited me to a group and asked me to be the designated inviser, root parker, food summoner, or to buff the party with shrew, or even keep FA up.  Slow and heal, those are my shaman’s main functions.  Tormac’s pretty good at them.  But when my shaman gets in a situation where his slowing is ineffective, his healing also becomes ineffective, and there is no real utility that shamans have for a group outside of this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kiisekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Buz, diversity is a great thing. No, not every class should be a capable healer obviously, but there SHOULD be OPTIONS. Not being able to do single group content because 1 out of 15 classes (or however many there are now) is not available, is not good, I don't care how you spin it.</div></div><hr />
