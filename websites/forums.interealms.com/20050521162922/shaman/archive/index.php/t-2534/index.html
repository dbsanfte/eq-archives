<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, I'm looking for possible equipment upgrades or advice.<br />
<br />
Iksar Sham quest helm<br />
Forest Loops (2)<br />
Lizardscale mask (ie- crap)<br />
BA Mediallion<br />
Diamond Wedding Band / None<br />
Nath Bracers<br />

I plat on Tallon Zek. I'm level 24 atm (yes, this is a twink alt, whose gear is above and beyond his level). I have a few kpp to spend. Duoing with an iksar war.<br />
<br />
Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

What class is your main?  Can he solo to get you some stuff or farm cash to buy some stuff?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jade Prod - 11/30 sta3 wis6<br />
Dark Ember 13/32 Str2 Wis5 Fire Resist7 HP20 Mana20<br />
Isn't the DE quite a bit better (or is 1 wis worth more than 20 mana, and 3 sta for a sham worth more than 20hp? - enough to offset the loss of the fr?)? I would think the DE has better dam/del, better mana total, better hp total, better resists. Only bad thing is that I might be wanting to train piercing higher.<br />
<br />
<br />
My main is a decently equipped 55th SK (for TZ) so I can get many items and farm plat as well. I actually have about 16k lying around in the bank, I'm just not sure I want to invest that much into my Shaman. I was originally saving up for a jousting weapon (TT ~), but I only really raid or farm plat with my main atm.<br />
I should opt for two 6ac/65hp rings rather than 1 and the diamond wedding band? The mask sounds good and run about 500pp on TZ (decent price?). I have guildmates who can do combines for free, with reasonably high tailoring skills (some at prob 180ish), so should I get the raw materials, or be shelling out like 3k for acrylia cloaks, 4k for the major wyvern pieces, etc?) .I was planning on hitting Kaesora soon, so would a strathbone shield be good rather than the CGS or should I be completely focusing on hp?<br />
I put a iksarbp on my friend's war, the one who I duo with, basically 90% of my time playing the sham. Sort of thinking a regenbp on my sham might be nice, but taking depreciation and all into account, maybe holding out and saving up for a fungi would be good (fungi 50-60k, iksar bp 8k - It might take me forever to get 50k, so the fungi may just be a pipe dream for the time. I make about 1kpp in about 2hrs of farming roughly).<br />
<br />
What should I be looking to do with the shaman ideally, considering I'm on a pvp server too? Wis (205~) &gt; resists &gt; hp &gt; ac? hp &gt; resists &gt; ac &gt; wis? What should I be aiming for here?<br />
<br />
Also, if anyone could give me a rough breakdown of pvp tips for mid range shaman (ie- what I should be doing dotwise, debuffs, blind, etc? Should I basically auto run from most resist twinks since I won't be able to land spells, etc), I'd really appreciate it.<br />
Thanks a lot</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nasiir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just got a chipped bone bracer. I think I'm also going to go ahead and get an iksarbp, 2 6ac/65hp rings, wyvern mask, and coldain gloves (which my sk will use if I get something better for my sham) for now.</div></div><hr />
