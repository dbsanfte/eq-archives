<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Between quickbuff and spell casting reinforcement, which would most of you train first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">SCR for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCR3 = 1 more tick to torpor = way way less refresh (very annoying) = more mana<br />
<br />
QB3 = fast torpor, only worth for this imo. Good as well. Note that some items affect torpor casting time, so you may only need QB2 to be maxed. Those are quite rare and not that easy to obtain.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO get SCR first, and wait for your title if that what you got in mind :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">SCR &gt;&gt;&gt; QB<br />
SCR Effects how long Avatar, all regular buffs (regardless of level), haste and Torpor last<br />
QB effects how quickly these land<br />
<br />
If you need your Torpor to land THAT fast, maybe you're casting it at the wrong time.  How many HP's Torpor restores is MUCH more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did QB2 first, heh i wanted title :)<br />
I was also sick of waiting 8 seconds for Sltw casts<br />
<br />
I wouldnt go QB3 though not worth 9 points, find yourself a spell haste item to take you the rest of the way to haste cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yup, I did like Skadi, must´ve been a swede thingie..<br />
I dont know what would have been the best.. I will go for scr now anyway (if I ever exp again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did SCR3 first, then QB1, now am banking for SCRM for my title and that second and sometimes third tick on torpor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you solo alot, get quick buff. I know it saved me often in PvE, not to mention that it's a godsend in pvp. SCR waited until after alot of other AA for me (ND, SCM, etc.), and I wouldn't have it any other way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i did qb1.. then some stuff, sitll haven't done scr.. i figure 8th shawl 15% is good enough for now until im ready to do scr, plus in vt right now and there are many extended buff duration items there, whichever you get depends on the foci you have alot too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was going to do Qb2 before carrying on with SCR, but I got my hands on some cog encrusted epaluets(sp?) from PoI, which have 20% beneficial spell haste on them<br />
<br />
Now I have finsihed Scr3 I'm doing SCRM for the 50% extension then back to RC1/QB2/ND1-3 in some order ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was having the same debate a while back.  ended up training QB1.  but i am now changing my mind and gonna put next points into SCR.  once i get tired of SCR i will get a second one in QB and see from there, but with my current rate of XP it may take a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I chose qb3, at first like many other folks i had qb2 and a spell haste item that made in total my benifecials 45% reduced so not worth 9 pts for the 50 but I got a blackflame sphere to replace my wicked bone alter... so there went my spell haste and i dumped pts into qb3 key points I weighed in decision.<br />
<br />
I die more often from torpor being interupted than torpor lasting an extra tick or two.<br />
<br />
at raids I am plagued with tells for buffs.. its the bane of our class. qb3 lessens my grief in that i can shoot buffs out much faster.<br />
<br />
you can see the benefit directly... its present its not amorphous... i'm not knocking scr, its just that I like rightclicking on torpor or other buffs and seeing that (normal 6 seconds, but your casting time 3.0s) its gratifying :)<br />
<br />
the title is kinda cool too, but I was really wanting to be 200 plus aa and still be venerable =) oh well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Got scr1 first, I think it provides a pretty good chance at getting up to 1500 heals.  scr2 just improves that chance a little more, I dont think you can get 1800 heals with just 2 levels.  And I wasn't ready to put 3 in it yet, so I went and did qb1 and qb2 first.  I'm going back to get scr3 at least as soon as I finish nd3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I went straight for QB2 after Cann5, have never regretted it(also have a spell haste item). I also used to die more often from Torpor being interrupted, it has saved my ass plenty of times Not to mention I can now finish buffing alot quicker. As soon as I hit 65 I'll probably get MGB and then work on SCR/SCRM or SCM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did QB3 immediately after canni5 and I have never regretted it either. <br />
<br />
I have no enhancement haste or spell haste items, so it's a huge ability for me.   It was more valuable for me in the past when a torpor could actually save my life in an emergency.   Mobs that triple for almost 800 and bash in exp groups though, boy they eat torpor right up.<br />
<br />
anyways, I would also do SCM3 and ND3 before SCR, and I have.  SCR coming soon though for me.</div></div><hr />
