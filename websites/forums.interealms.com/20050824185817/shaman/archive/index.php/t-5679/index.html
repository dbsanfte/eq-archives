<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>McLeod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is my current UI.  Basically it's an attempt to get something pleasing to the eye while maintaining max funcionality.  The transparency is nice to maximize viewing space but will most likely not default as it looks in mine (R-click window, Alpha, Normal to 0% will set it).<br />
There are too many people to thank for the pieces I lifted from them, adding my own tweaks to make it what I feel is very shaman-friendly, however T.King and Remelio for their ongoing work deserve a lot of credit for the spellbook, icons, gems, cast bar and compass.<br />
The 3rd column of hotkeys are set to my current right-clicks, with my JBB still on a numbered box enabling me to still use a keystroke to use it.  If I can figure out a way to link a keyboard shortcut to one of those boxes, limiting mouse clicks, I would put it in the 3rd column as well (any advice?).<br />
Not pictured but working smoothly in this UI are:<br />
- an 80-slot no-scroll vendor window (yeah, it takes a lot of room but is easier than scrolling for me and hotkeys, spells, etc won't work with a vendor window open anyway).<br />
- Custom casting bar from T.King and Remelio, in addition to a cast bar that appears replacing the stamina bar during casting.<br />
- /feedback window that has been replaced with a library of LOCs for all continents, planes and cities as well as description of succor points for most zones.<br />
<br />
Screenies:<br />

Spellbook (http://www.strike9.com/file.aspx/path=/darkfritz/fullsize/spellbook.jpg) <br />
(The scribe and mem bars will appear as needed in the book; to change pages simply click on the edge of the page; to close click the center near the dreamcatcher).<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I do not have the webspace to upload the UI to at the moment but if you are interested feel free to e-mail me at<br />
my e-mail address (darkfritz@hotmail.com) and I will send it out to you.<br />
<br />
Have a great EQ day :)<br />
