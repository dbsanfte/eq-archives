<br />
I heard this is a great zone and got flagged for it today but had to log and didnt get a chance to check it out yet. Can any1 tell me solo capabilities in this zone. I heard stuff hits for 500s? And are level 60-61 but they dont summon so root/dotting is a possibility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rascalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They also AE DD for about 400....<br />
Definate tank only zone with multiple heals.  I understand in most groups a cleric and spot healer will go oom.  <br />
Not sure it is soloable :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wizard on test was quadding there. 27% aa per quad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">O yea theres gonna be a nerf for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It dangerous though. The wizzie needs 5000-5500 mana and harvest up to complete the quad and at the end will end up with no mana. As well, mobs in PoV are very resistant so there's a small amount of margin for failure. These also hit for 400-500 X 4. If the wizzie isn't paying attention, 2 rounds can = to smush.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Orionson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since when did you get a job at VI Divinator?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Since Ive been playing this game for 3 years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, the mobs in PoV hit up to 500's, yes they have procs in addition to regular damage that can do up to 375.  Are they resistant? no...  are they soloable? yes, it takes prolly 5-10 minutes to solo a mob because of their big HP's, but at 63 with 100% to AA I was getting close to 2 blue per kill.  <br />
<br />
Whoever said that in a group, clerics and spot healers will go OOM has obviously never been here.  I like to pull when i'm in this zone and I keep a mob in camp at all times.  Any decent cleric can keep up with the healing indefinitely.  As long as the mobs are slowed when they're in camp, the cleric should have no problem at all, and the only time i ever had to heal is when they are afk.  <br />
<br />
I'm suspecting a nerf very soon.  I almost guarentee that mobs will summon after the next patch.  Kinda sucks, but oh well.... blame the damn wizards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lots of dmg is key if u, the shaman, are the only healer.  I did monk rogue me and enchanter and we were pulling non stop.  The exp is disgusting but the zone is quite crowded :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Failbhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Fairly easy to be main healer in PoV or PoS as a shaman. Just make certain you Torpor on incoming before you slow the mobs. With slow in, the mobs do not do a great deal of damage.<br />
<br />
Watch carefully though when you slow. The slow bug is obvious on many mobs. I swear that on the giants in PoS that any slow over 50% actually acts as a haste to them. If you are having to chain heal, then you are using the wrong slow for that type of mob.</div></div><hr />
