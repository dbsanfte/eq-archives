<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">They lag me out when I turn them on :( when I get close to any large group of people my FPS drops to hell. I know they do for most people as well, but have heard other system setups similar to mine being able to run them just fine. I'm wondering if anyone else could tell me their experience using shadows or could offer any advice on clearing up the lag...I would love to play with shadows on.<br />
<br />
My current system is an AMD64 3200, using a Gigabyte K8N mobo (nForce 3 150 chipset). I'm using an ATI 9800XT with the 4.9 Catalyst drivers, with 1 gig of DDR RAM.<br />
<br />
ATM I run EQ on Windows XP and DX9.0c at 1280 x 1024 resolution with all the bells and whistles on, except shadows.<br />
<br />
I've also heard some stuff that it's solely an ATI problem but never really got anything confirmed on this. In any case, any comments or suggestions would be most appreciated  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My cynical comment would be - buy a 6800 GT and find out the lag is still killing you.  I froze my P4 3.2 running into the PoK bank area, took me 2 min to turn of the shadows and move out.  <br />
Don't know what you need to handle mass PC shadows, maybe a dual 6800 Ultra SLI solution.</div></div><hr />
