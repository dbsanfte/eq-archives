<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 63 Shaman, whom I love dearly, but has sadly become my bot..Well, not really a bot, but just not used as frequently as Id like, but here is my question.<br />
     I have a 42 Ogre Sk whom is my newest addition to the Gnomebane family and I love him dearly...What are some good places with decent drops that would proably normaly be impossible for him to solo that with the help of my &quot;uber&quot; shaman, he can go and level quickly and maybe, between the two of them get some pretty decent loot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the loot part would depend on your definition of &quot;decent&quot;, but as far as leveling the sk goes, that's an easy one.<br />
<br />
i helped an sk friend level pretty fast at that stage by taking him to Echo Caverns. at the time, the xp mod there was awesome, and i kept him buffed and healed w/o problems, and slowed mobs there for him to fight them. pull with slow, cripple mobs, switch to sk and have him peel...torpor on sham to make up for dmg taken, and sk has an easy fight.<br />
<br />
no real loot involved unless you decide to pull Taskmaster Torzakh (spelling?) and kill him, which is really easy with your sham (you can solo him with sham w/o problems), but the xp was awesome at the time we were down there. also puts you really close to the Deep, and once the sk is a few levels higher, you can use your sham to &quot;fish&quot; and cc mobs with root, and have the sk wail on them. there's a named you can camp even if you're pulling to entry area that's the first mob to the right at the first intersection...have only seen him up a couple times, but he's an easy kill and has 2 decent droppables. necklace for int casters, and a mask with decent stats.<br />
<br />
<br />
enjoy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Echo caverns it is then..Thanks for the help..I liked the deep with just my shaman, so with my SK as backup or vise versa it should be a blast, not a lot of foot traffic down there these days it seems..least not on Drinal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Take him to CoM. Group him with your shaman and slaughter greens. He should get a level ever hour and a half, two hours tops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>astop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure but I think that maybe you could take him to KC right off of The Dreadlands, but the thing you might have trouble with would be the adds or trains I use to have a blast in KC with my old SK I use to FD and watch the trains fly by hee hee, have a blast<br />
Astop Sign (an alt)<br />
level 58 shaman the rath server</div></div><hr />

An Ogre SK may not necessarily want to ruin his VS faction because of the OT outpost/hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gonjinnx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Once you hit 46 I would head over to POJ and do the exit camp I got my 46 sk to 49 in no time!!!! But now I am stuck on were to go after that. They are getting to be to easy to kill and the exp is slowed down to 1.5 exp per kill instead of 2-3exp per kill at 46-48. I can clear the entire 1st section before repops<br />
<br />
Any one know were I/We should go at 49+ to get fast exp!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can go to Mavuin's area in PoJ. The SK may have a bit of trouble tanking Punishers/Enforcers (200 hitters) there at first, but nothing that you can't heal once they are slowed. They come in pairs and are somewhat magic resistant, but their Flurrying and Rampaging are mostly harmless and they are great XP well into the 50s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Once a bit into 47, you could both head to Plane of Hate.  The tier1 mobs would be great xp for the SK and even halfway decent for your Shm.  Not much loot but some decent cash too, very easy mobs, and plenty to pull if your server hasn't caught onto the new hate port-up yet :)<br />
<br />
I second CoM until then though, that's such a great zone.  SolB would be a nice empty spot also.</div></div><hr />
