I've been trying to find this spell on Povar for a while and no one anywhere seems to have it.  I hear it drops in Akehvia Ruins and a couple other places...anyone have any luck on where I should start looking for it?  Also if your on povar and have it, shoot me a tell..it would be greatly appreaciated!<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalzran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">eqcasters is always a good start to find out where spells are located.  Here is the link directly to the spell.<br />

<br />
As you can see it hasn't been updated, but if you scroll down you can see others post on where they have found it.<br />
<br />
Mind worms in Ahkeva and Imperial Guards in ssra<br />
<br />
It's a great spell.  Good luck in getting your copy.</div></div><hr />

OMG how do they expect a 56 ranger to get that spell...I was hunting the worms last night and they had like a million HP and hit really really hard! /sigh</div></div><hr />

/bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Iweil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've been looking in the bazaar for the last month and a half and no one on Povar seems to have it.  I checked with my friends in the higher level guilds that do the places where the spell drops and none of them seem to be able to find one either.  So if you have a copy (or see one) and its on Povar drop me a line please!  Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>turgeran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">one of the seru houses is a ranger guild, if you kill the ranger npc's they drop a ranger dropped spell every time just about. Found this out while farming reports for the 3rd seru earring of veracity. Got Mark of Predator, Call of Predator, and Jolting blades, if i remember correctly. Or maybe warder's protection. You know if it's the right mob if it starts casting stinging swarm  and greater heal lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Iweil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm..<br />
Any reason anyone knows that I shouldnt be killing in Seru?<br />
If not this sounds like a gold mine for my ranger spells.  Esp since the bazaar has one of my lvl 60 spells lists at 4000pp :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Iweil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">foudn it last night...woot...great spell...I can now self buff myself to 1200 atk...heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>slfsearch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Turgeran, could a 58 Ranger solo these ?  Or would I be toast<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Consider yourself lucky.....4k for a level 60 spell may sound like a lot, but ask any level 60 shaman what he paid for that Torpor that just saved your life and it will shush you up...this is from personal experience as a shaman that forked out 60k for a copy of it.</div></div><hr />
