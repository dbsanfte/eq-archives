<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I DL'ed the patch and I want to use the new UI, I haven't actually played yet so I was wondering is there a tutorial on the web or somewhere that would explain how to &quot;do stuff&quot; in the Bazaar ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Apparently, this is how it's done as I observed on opening day.<br />
<br />
1. While in Nexus or Shadow Haven.  /shout How do I get to Bazaar.  (You know that zone that's been out for 7 months now.)<br />
<br />
2. In the Bazaar.  /shout What is a Trader Satchel?<br />
<br />
3. /shout Where do I get a Trader Satchel?  (repeat 400 times per minute)<br />
<br />
4. Have the new UI turned off, and /shout Nothing works!<br />
<br />
5. Set a price of 200pp on a Crude Stein and /shout Why doesn't anyone buy my stuff!?  (I'm not exagerating this one.)<br />
<br />
6. /shout How do I search for stuff?<br />
<br />
7. After having explained the /bazaar function, pick a common item that appears at least 20 times in a search.  /shout WTB: common_item, PST if ur selling.<br />
<br />
8. /shout OMG 400 PPL here!<br />
<br />
That's all there is to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You've missed off a couple Megumi,<br />
<br />
9. /say to a trader who is AFK will you accept 200pp for that spell? or Trade it for this item... (that happened to my trader at 4am... /boggle)<br />
<br />
10. Once realising that no one is using the auction channels start /Shouting WTS blah blah blah because it stands out better in red!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Har har, that's sadly pretty accurate :)<br />
<br />
To stormrazor - <br />
<br />
First, edit your EQClient.ini file. In the [Defaults] section add the line:<br />
<br />
NewUI=TRUE<br />
<br />
Save the file, then run EQ as normal. You should get the new interface.<br />
<br />
Go to the Bazaar. Type /bazaar to see what's for sale. You get a search window, it's pretty straightforward to use. For example to find a hat for a troll shaman, set the &quot;Slot&quot; menu to &quot;head&quot;, se the race menu to &quot;Troll&quot; and set the Class menu to &quot;Shaman&quot;. Then click find.<br />
<br />
When the list of found items appears, right click an item's name to see its stats. Right click a vendor's name and you will turn to face that vendor.<br />
<br />
To sell items:<br />
<br />
First, buy a trader's satchel, from Merchant Trekama or something like that. Put the items you want to sell in the satchel, and go and stand in a traders stall.<br />
<br />
Type /trader. The items in your satchel(s) are shown, Click each item in turn and enter a price for it. Remember to click &quot;Set&quot; after you enter the price. When all prices are entered, click &quot;Begin trader&quot;. This will list all the items you have for sale, along with the price, so you can double check. You are now in trader mode. You can still speak etc, or you can go afk and hope someone buys your stuff :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I haven't used the new UI yet, how do I find someone selling malo? Is there a general inventory slot search or spell search function?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">how do I find someone selling malo? Is there a general inventory slot search or spell search function? <br />
<br />
Yes, there is a selection menu for spells, however they list as &quot;scribe&quot; or something to that effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To search for spells you select &quot;class&quot; as &quot;Shaman&quot; and in the very last search option (which I am right now forgetting, go me) select &quot;scroll&quot;. Took me a while to figure that one out, dunno why they didn't just have it say spell :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Soloen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best way to search for spells I have found is to select Shaman as the class and type spell in the first text box on the screen (its the only one you can type in, at the top of the screen). I get alot more hits using that then using scroll in the last drop down box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">don't put your race either if you are searching for a spell.  It narrowed the spells I could look at for some reason.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, and understand that people become merchants in this function.  You click on them and buy your stuff.  I came home from work last nite and looked at my AFK mule and had some guy send me a tell saying &quot;i'll buy those boots&quot;  AFK message.   &quot;dude, i'll buy those boots&quot;  AFK message.  &quot;Hey, are you selling stuff or what?&quot;  AFK message.<br />
<br />
***?  How can he figure out i'm selling boots if he can't figure out how to buy em?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sort-of on topic I guess.  I saw two copies of Torpor for sale yesterday for 50k and 60k.  So, the good stuff is out there to be had.  I'd also imagine that it will take a few days for some guilds to get their mules in place.  I'm just excited that I sold about 2k in food and 4k in assorted bank-wasting garbage while I was at work yesterday.  Plus, I found 2 stacks of foraged vegetables!  Simple item, but a complete pain for a non-forager to find. Heard rumors of a Coldain Head price war going on too, although I didn't think to search for them while I was there.  Guess someone showed up and flooded the market with 50pp heads.  I'm hooked on the new Bazaar already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Haha. That is SO on the money. lol. Don't forget<br />
<br />
11) stand as near to the bank as possible and make sure you stand in the thickest cluster of traders. People love to try and find your name in the crowd and then clicking on you is such a joy the more people who are in our way. For bonus points. try and get the other traders to circle around you or put your back to a wall with a wall of other traders in front of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
that was my biggest pet peeve last night. I purposely went to the most remote tent I could find. That way I can see the lil theives trying to pickpocket me and I stand out of the crowd. Had great success. sold almost out of stock of SoW pots.<br />
<br />
Also note that unless last nights emergency patch fixed it. Players can pickpocket you when in trader mode about once every 30 minutes. I watched it happen all night last night. Soon as a rogue got close to me I ended trading and banked all my cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Numbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">People can pickpocket you in trader mode?  Jeez, I am so out of the EQ loop.<br />
<br />
What is the maximum amount of cash they can grab?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I havent been able to play for a week(faaar away from my comp right now), and i was just wondering...<br />
<br />
Too sell do you have to have the items in question on you, or can they be sitting in the bank, and to buy, you go up to the seller and do what?<br />
<br />
Im sure my questions will be answered in a day or two anyway(when i can get back home), but i would just like to know...im one of those people that likes to have reasonably clearmental images of stuff, or something like that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">0. Make a new mule toon and name him Bazaarho, Trayder, or Bankdude, then go /anon so that people will never suspect that you're actually someone's level 1 trade mule alt ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm sure the new UI is cool and the /Bazaar function will make buying and selling easier (I hate auc).<br />
Trouble is I'm broke...... about 1.1K on my Main and another 1K on my alt SK. So I really don't have anything to sell or buy that would be of any great use to me ! <br />
<br />
Being a casual, unguilded solo leezard does have its pitfalls ! <br />
Chicks still dig the tail though ! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You begin casting Summon Hot Barb chick <br />
Skyshire hottie ring begins to glow  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I wish I had that much plat Storm :)<br />
<br />
But I do have alot of low-mid lvl crap to sell to lowbies.<br />
 <br />
The bazaar for me right now is just a nice place to be able to offload a bunch of crap that is taking up bank space.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to know too. Anybody?<br />
Is this only on the red servers or all servers?<br />
<br />
Another question, I bought trader satchels to keep stuff in the bank. My items are in no danger in them are they? I mean they won't poof or be bought or anything like that will they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sony's EQLive site has a new tutorial on using the Bazaar, here:  http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/bazaar.jsp<br />
<br />
Oldshaman, pickpocket happens only on PvP servers, otherwise there would be a huge uproar.<br />
<br />
Trader satchels have to be in your inventory, not in the bank, for them to work. Also, you have to set prices on all the items in your trader satchel and go into /trader mode in order to sell them.</div></div><hr />
