<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I combed through the &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1379&quot;&gt;Magelo Profiles&lt;/a&gt; to find the Shaman with the highest HP, AC and Mana.<br />
<br />
These are the top 10 most uber Shaman! Behold...<br />
<br />
<br />

&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=6742&quot;&gt;Chukzmbi&lt;/a&gt;	Barb	3106	4415	1289	8810<br />

<br />
<br />
The composite score was achieved simply by adding the HP, MANA and AC scores. I didn't want to impose any values or modifiers on those -- since the Shaman community has wavered between &quot;It's all about the AC&quot; and &quot;It's all about HP&quot;. <br />
<br />
Here are the runners-up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Name	Race	HP 	MANA	AC	Composite<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=28366&quot;&gt;Chatraz&lt;/a&gt;	Iksar	2899	3965	1303	8167<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=90307&quot;&gt;Bladefury&lt;/a&gt;	Barb	2907	3993	1090	7990<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=230734&quot;&gt;Cantiz&lt;/a&gt;	Iksar	2731	4000	1206	7937<br />

<br />
And though he wasn't in the top 15, Tulkur deserves mention because he has the second-highest AC of the bunch: <br />

Secondary mana, even. <br />
<br />
Perhaps mana should be getting more stress than it currently gets? The less time spent actively harvesting mana through Cannibalization the more time spent healing others, debuffing and damaging targets.<br />
<br />
However, if mana really is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2252&quot;&gt;capped at 4250&lt;/a&gt; then 4250 should be the max points that a Shaman can earn from his mana pool...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't agree that it's &quot;all about mana regen.&quot; Because our mana regeneration is ACTIVE we have to spend time harvesting mana. That time could be spent killing mobs, buffing, debuffing, etc. If you've spent lots of time in the 4c area with a less-than-uber group you realize that you *hate* casting canni because it gets in the way of your ability to buff people and keep the group in tip-top shape. <br />
<br />
Even with Canni5 this holds true. Though it gives you 1k mana every 3 minutes, you've got to actively regenerate the missing 2k HP by either torporing yourself or getting a heal from someone else (costing them mana).<br />
<br />
Mana pool *does* matter in difficult situations. The fact that we have great mana regen just means that we're ready for difficult situations more often and for longer periods.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP = 1<br />
Mana = .75<br />
AC = 1<br />
Mana Regen (through items) = 10<br />
<br />
Does that sound like a good scoring method?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">God I suck.  I'm at 971 ac and 1644 hps....:/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well, one way to look at mana regen (up to the ft15 cap) is to just picture a scenario.  In the case of mana regen = 10, would you rather have an item with 133 + mana (yesyes, I know 127 is cap, the math didn't work out), or one with ft10?  The answer is probably pretty universally ft10, so mana regen (up to the cap) should be weighed a bit heavier.<br />
<br />
Of course, you can drive yourself crazy trying to balance it all.  Using myself as an example, I use a Ring of Immobilization (15 ac, 7 sta/cha/wis/int, 50 hp/mana, 5 sv all, 2.0 cast time Immobilize, infinite charges) over a Ring of the Shissar (8 ac, 4 sta/wis/int, 80 hp, 65 mana, Enhancement Haste 3...which is useless to me because I have qb3).  The immob ring is worth 123.5 or so (I'm not sure how far over 255 wis I am, so not measuring that at all).  The ring of the shissar is worth 148.75, simply because the stats it has are the ones being weighed.  But how can you weigh something like effects vs other effects, especially when AA might make certain effects useless for some shamans, but still good for others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Gathu ... <br />
<br />
I don't intend to weight some effects vs. other effects for the purposes of this &quot;ranking.&quot; Having a ring that casts immobilize, however, must greatly increase your effectiveness because it keeps you from having to mem a root spell in one of your eight gem slots. <br />
<br />
If these were once-yearly awards I'd consider going through every slot and looking at effects like this -- but since I'd like to do this a little more regularly... (once every 3 months or something) ... I don't have the time for that much in-depth analysis of profiles...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't agree that it's &quot;all about mana regen.&quot; Because our mana regeneration is ACTIVE we have to spend time harvesting mana.

<br />
Total starting mana is almost irrelevant, unless you start every fight FM and then drain it. (big solo kills)<br />
After the first few casts and your pool is lowered, it doesn't matter what you started at, unless you were to actually run into an OOM situation.<br />
<br />
It's about sustained fighting and regening it. Total mana doesn't help this. Whether soloing, raiding, or doing single group experience stints, the other people are either dead or oom long before the shaman is.<br />
Starting with more mana doesn't offset the need to actively harvest more with canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Starting with more mana does allow you to choose the spots when you harvest, however.<br />
<br />
A shaman with 150 wis has to canni constantly, often at the expense of casting buffs that take a long time and lots of mana (as a percentage of his mana pool) such as celerity.<br />
<br />
A shaman with a larger pool is able to more strategically harvest -- when **** hits the fan with adds on a long fight in Luclin, he can cast and cast and cast until things are under control and THEN harvest. The point is, he had a choice and could employ his spells on the battle rather than actively working up his own mana pool while people around him are in need of patch heals and torpor.<br />
<br />
But I also agree with you and with Wrothgarr that mana can be given a lower weighting in the next iteration of this.</div></div><hr />

2 - It really doesn't matter. :)<br />
<br />
Your new scale looks like it will cherish mana regen over mana pool a little more... great.. so now a Shaman with FT 15 will rank higher than a Shaman with Cann5<br />
<br />
(Trust me. Cann5 is better... I have FT 5 and I can beat all hell out of the mana regen of an FT15 shaman)<br />

And then. there's skillz..   for all anyone knows...  people on your list could have mad gear, but mediocre talent. :)<br />

1. I'm not ready to invest the time in checking AA. Most people aren't very religious about putting their AA in their magelo profiles anyway. HP, AC, Mana and Mana Regen are easy to evaluate. I'd love to be able to add Can5 to the mana regen calculation, but let's just assume that most shaman who are near the top of the ranking already have can5 or are pretty close to getting it.<br />
<br />
2. This is a gear ranking. It says nothing about the skills of a player or about the beauty (or lack therof *cough* snapdragon *cough*) of his or her race.</div></div><hr />

Sounds good need a bigger modifier for mana regen if you want it to count for anything tho. with ft15 being the cap the most you could get at the cap would be 150 and that isn't much compaired to the 3k+ hps 4k+ mana we see from people.</div></div><hr />

Assuming we would all just have Cann 5 is not a smart move...  for starters.... my counterpart Shaman in my Guild has Very similar gear stats to mine (Until recently he was beating me in the HP race actually), but he hates XPing.... I think he has less than 10 AA total.     So no, he does not have Cann 5.<br />
<br />
<br />
My point, is that there are SO MANY factors that would need to be counted if you wanted to do a &quot;Who's the best&quot; or even &quot;Who has the Best Gear&quot; list.<br />
<br />
What about Haste?  (Holy Vigor, GoDS, Belts of the Destroyer)<br />
Effects?  (Pendants of Malosini - Hello spell gem #9)<br />
Complete Spell books?   (Anyone missing Pox/Bane/Tirgir's?)<br />
<br />
<br />
On one hand, I'd LOVE to be able to walk around and say, &quot;Hey, I'm #5!&quot;   But I just can't... the subject is just up to too much conjecture :)<br />
<br />
The only thing I could say for sure is if you got all 10 of those Shamans together in the same Arena, it would be a very long and interesting war :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Once again, this is not the BEST SHAMAN award, but the most uber Crucible Shaman in terms of gear. <br />
<br />
I was very clear about the criteria for the first iteration of this. It's based on AC / HP / Mana and that is all. We all know that there are many things that go into making someone a good player, but those things are mostly invisible to the magelo system. I'm judging the toon only here, not the player behind it, not the play time, not the effects on items, none of that.<br />
<br />
Just recognize and accept the limitations of this (and any numerical ranking of subjective things) and enjoy the rankings. =)<br />

And the reason I give a top 10 and five runners-up is because I wanted to make sure that plenty of people near the top got recognition for outstanding gearing up of their toons.</div></div><hr />

btw Someone tell Jenamdar that FT from items is capped at 15.<br />
I think it would make it easier for his guild makes for them to make a hotkey /grats Jenamdar.<br />

PoP wont be released for some time and many of you will have a chance to surpass us (especially me!) by then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Small point on the FT comment.<br />
<br />
Yes my FT is double the cap, you think I'm happy about it?<br />
A large number of the top priest item per slot has FT. Highest hp bp a shm can wear is Mail of Judgment, its FT 7. Highest HP neck is aten head talis, and the effect is 8 mana regen, which isnt FT but since its innate it still counts against the cap. There you go, I have FT 15 in 2 items...... Ssra shield was the only 100 hp shield at the time it was upgraded and I got it.....has FT 6. You see the problem here? <br />
<br />
Add on top of that AL is the mother of dkp, which means point cost on items. Items with high hp and FT are going to cost more dkp....so im wasting points on FT I can't use in order to upgrade hps which I can use. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Second point, I was at FT 22 BEFORE the cap was fixed. At the time no one knew for sure of it would be fixed, stay at 15 or raised. At the time the regen FT 22 + buffs gave was insanely good, to the point of not having to use cano at all.<br />
<br />
What needs to be done is one of the following:<br />
<br />
Raise the FT cap to at least 20. If the majority of end game priest loot is going to have FT, at least make it worth looting it.<br />
<br />
Remove FT off of some of these items and put focus effects on them. There are no high end items with focus effects. Loading so many items with FT limits the number of items that lack an effect and could have a focus effect stuck on. I think we can all agree the chances of an item getting something like spell haste 3+ AND having FT on it are about zero.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Hi, <br />
<br />
The mana cap has been a big topic lately, so I'd like to take a minute to address it. Mana caps have been in EverQuest since the game was released. They haven't been changed, made more restrictive, or added at a later date in order to keep casters down. The mana cap as it is now has been there since you created your character, and only recently become a topic of concern for players. <br />
<br />
Most things in EverQuest have a point of diminishing returns - a point where adding more of a resource yields little or no improvement. This is most obvious in your basic stats, where you can easily see that after your strength score hits 255 it does you no good to put on more strength enhancing gear. These kinds of caps aren't intended to cause you distress, and in many ways they can help support a well balanced game system. <br />
<br />
While we have an appreciation for the benefits that stat caps can bring to a system, we're also willing to look at things like this with an objective eye. The mana cap on worn items has been in since release, and hasn't come up before as an issue that players felt overly limited by. With all the attention focused on the cap in recent days, the dev team looked it over and we agree - there's no reason to place an artificial cap on mana enhancing items. <br />
<br />
On test server now, we've changed the rule so that players get full value from all mana increasing worn items. We expect this will go live with the next patch. <br />
<br />
Thanks for bringing your concerns to our attention,<br />
Rich Waters<br />

Well... that's good news for ubershaman over 4250 mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">to Jenamdar...<br />
<br />
I feel where you're coming from on the FT issue....  we had numerous Cleric and Wizards who were over the FT15 Cap before the hardcoding of FT15...    most feeling the pinch by losing half the effectiveness of their 10th Shawls.    Perhaps they'll review FT and expand it's usefulness a little more, and also, it looks like the Hardcap on + mana is being removed too.. which will be a joy to the Wizard in my Guild who should have 5000+ Mana.. :)<br />
<br />
I chose to go the other way with regards to FT.... I have FT 5, pretty much by accident....  the FT came along with Items that had the +HP and +Stamina I was craving.   Cann5 has been serving me well, so I never sought much FT.<br />
<br />
We finally cleared VT on Tuesday of this week and my efforts were rewarded with an Aegis of Judgement (Absolutely INSANE Item...   so I'm damn happy with that.</div></div><hr />

I think the problem is that if the uber stuff gets any better effects or the FT cap is lifted uber guilds will just own (even more than now) &quot;old&quot; content to the point of sillyness.</div></div><hr />

now stand at  3118 hp 1208 ac and 4155 mana<br />
<br />
been saving for a circlet of disguise, but since my helm is currently my best slot already i just couldnt pass up a 100hp 12sta 60 mana upgrade over my current shoulders when mantle droped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proly kick myself later when we get another circlet to drop tho =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">haha, the CT Brain and Eye combo is something that I felt I had to do, for the amount of time spent in that damned plane and the overall look of the items. And yes, it really does jack the bejesus out of your charisma stat with -25 per item.<br />
<br />
Oh god, I was ranked?? <br />
<br />
My gear, regardless of ranking systems, is tweaked towards HPs and that alone. Also, for shamans its argueable that you don't need a stamina over 205 considering that you'll hit 255 with ToB. I took gear with that in mind. I'm a big fan of the idea that no matter the AC, you're gonna be road pizza if the wrong things get too interested in you.<br />
<br />
.&lt;preach&gt;<br />
People need to work towards their play style and not towards any artifical ranking out there for what they wear. You prolly won't see me change much except for anything thats on me that is tradeable so I can get it in the hands of my guildmates. Anything you wear is crap without the people to work with you, and I have some of the best damn shamans in Norrath to stand beside me in my guild :)<br />
.&lt;/preach&gt;<br />
<br />
To comment on Jen's post:<br />
<br />
Ssra shield was the only 100 hp shield at the time it was upgraded and I got it.....has FT 6. You see the problem here?  <br />
<br />
Whitestone Shield (http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=31316) always was an option, if sad on other stats. The Yaka's shield always was hp 100 as well, if argueably unreachable at the time. If people want to really scrounge and they don't mind trying to understand French, I highly recommend use of http://eq.goa.com 's search engine.<br />
<br />
Flowing Thought is something I never really got much out of. If you are inactive frequently and find yourself medding, great. Go for FT. If you are attentive at the keyboard, stick with CanniV and you're going to do more than adequately.<br />
<br />
Bleh, said too much. If you want my feelings, ;tell brell.ulver how much I suck and I'll stop wasting bandwidth here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">A few other problems with gear is the lack of uniqueness. Sure, there are a few items that just scream 'shaman', like the Pendant of Malosini, but they're few and far between. Verant really left the idea of class sets of armor far behind. I'm kind of tired of seeing things like Crown of Energy have 10 people roll on them. Why? Almost everyone can wear such items.<br />
<br />
Then there's the focus effects. This goes along with point number one, somewhat. I see spell haste 3, I see enhancement haste 3... what's the difference? 15%? That means little to me. How about increased cannibalize? Aggro redeuction?<br />
<br />
But on to the top 10 or whatever;<br />
<br />
Trying to make a ranking system with more factors than hp/ac/mana is silly at best. There are so many different things somebody could get; flowing thought, lots of focus effects, big mana pool... rating them all would cause nothing but headaches.<br />
<br />
Soupy: Could you make a list of shamans using point / distribution? Like how Jenamdar's in Afterlife and they use points. There's nothing wrong with that. Some loot systems work better for different people. Being in a distribution guild here, it's hard to get more than 2 items a month without people screaming about fairness.<br />
<br />
yep... bye</div></div><hr />

The person who wrote the above did not read the part of the thread where I repeated essentially the same thing twice.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, I stand by this effort and will continue to do it. It's meaningful, it gives us all something to shoot for, and it keeps us humble. ;)<br />
<br />
As for point distribution -- I really have no way of knowing who is on it and who is not -- to find out I'd have to involve myself with polling of individuals... maybe at a future date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To assume that just because someone is in points they aren't looking at distro to guildmembers when they get items as well is folly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I kinda don't agree about the high manapool thing being all that important.  Unless you're really young and don't have good stuff.  But by the time people get to the high 50's, it's pretty common these days to have somewhere around 200 wis(sometimes even better) not even counting plus mana items, and that's plenty.<br />
<br />
Soupy mentions being able to choose your moment to &quot;harvest&quot; your health, and being able to cast lots of spells and do lots of things until that moment comes.<br />
<br />
I think that's kind of being inattentive or taking the easy way out.  It sounds like slacking.<br />
<br />
We have regrowth, and AA mana regen points, and torpor at high levels if we're lucky enough to have the spell.  That to me means that any time we have full health, we're probably screwing up.  If you have full health, canni or find a way to do it damn soon.  If you don't need to because you're full mana -- well, isn't there something you could be doing that costs mana?  Even just finding some out of the way guy to heal?<br />
<br />
I figure that if I have too much health, I will replace it with mana thru canni 4 or 5, and if I have too much mana, I will replace some part of it with canni or any number of any other spells I could possibly cast.  I'll always be seeking to use canni or mana to replace each other constantly, until they're full.  <br />
<br />
So...that means my absolute level of mana will become drastically less relevant the more creative I get -- or the more responsible I get for using my mana and health interchangeably to create the best possible result for my group or raid.  <br />
<br />
Picking and choosing my moment to canni doesn't seem like a desireable thing to me at all -- what seems to me undesirable is having to put off canni at ALL for any significant amount of time when I could be using regrowth or torpor(or maybe an incoming group celestial heal) or all the above to replace lost health and thus amplify my utility.<br />
<br />
I really don't see the point of ever having full health unless you're just about to slow a tough mob.  Or full mana.  It's no virtue.  Barring that, delaying canni or torpor is pointless.  I find it both useful and a challenge to use as much mana as possible constantly without getting killed or disrupting my group or raid.  I don't want to pick and choose my moments -- I want to blast everything, all the time -- whether it's a mob, or a chloroblast on some druid who just over-aggroed, or a torpor for me, and I want to intersperse as much canni as I can all through it as I possibly can so that I NEVER waste regrowth or put myself in the position where torpor would give me no value.</div></div><hr />
