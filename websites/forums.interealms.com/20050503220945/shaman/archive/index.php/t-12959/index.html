<br />
I'm a 41 Bard on Solusek Ro.<br />
<br />
As our Spells/Songs overlap (HASTE, ect) I would like permission to ask questions and learn about your Class and Tactics.<br />
<br />
I group with you but I would be the worst type of fool to not know about your Class.<br />
<br />
One problem being that at some levels your better than I am &amp; at certain Levels I'm better than you. A misjudgment can cause an nasty TPW &amp; CR.<br />
<br />
Better to ask &amp; learn.<br />
<br />
May I?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My girlfriend plays a bard. The three biggest probllems I have are..<br />
<br />
1) Selo will stop Torpor and Q form takeing effect so I assume it also effects Sod. So once you start fighting make sure to click Selo's off.<br />
2) Haste.. We cant cast over your haste even tho they stack. So make sure to click your haste off when you ask for ours then restart yours after.<br />
3) Invis.. Let the shm know in your are going to invis... I lose more pets that way :P<br />
<br />
If you are going to charm a mob try and say so in group chat. That way we are less likely to waste cast time trying to slow a charmed mob.. A friend of mine is bad about this and I think she dose it delibertly :P<br />
Another thing that use to be really annoying with bards was the buff slots thire songs would eat up. The short duration buff window seems to have fixed most of that :) Nothing like getting low HP's and casting torpor on yourself just to have it not take hold :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman and Bard are brother classes.  Both are &quot;Jacks of all Trades.&quot;  Both are mainly support classes.  Both have activities that we perform until our fingers fall off (twisting and Cann'ing).<br />
<br />
The Shaman's buffs are more perminent than yours are.  Yours tend to be more focused and fit closer to the tactics.  Your debuffs complement ours perfectly (OOS and Malo make a STRONG combo).  Our differing area of concentration is a weak healing (better than Pally's but worse than dr00ds).  Yours is a weak melee (better than ranger melee but not as good as rogue).  Both classes can solo some awsome stuff, but SHINE when we group up.  We make groups 3x more efficient and can easily handle two adds all by ourselves.<br />
<br />
The classes were designed side by side and instead of making two classes that support well but don't stack, we stack VERY well.  Bards are welcome in my group ANYTIME!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very polite request, bonus points as far as I'm concerned.  Ask any questions you have, but first I'll give you some basic info I have from my experiences.  I have one RL friend who plays a 58 bard, and I have two good in-game bard friends, 60 and 61.  I've found bard's work wonderfully in concert (pun intended) with a shaman to maintain crowd control in situations where even good enchanter's get overwhelmed  (ahh, the memories of our warrior pulling trains to us in Sebilis ...).  Between mez, slow, fear, and charm, Bard's have a lot to offer in terms of saving me mana on healing, which is nice because usually when I'm playing with bards I wind up beig the only healer.  Not that this is typically a problem, because of everything I already mentioned, plus mana/health regen songs.<br />
<br />
In PoP groups and such I often have the luxury of having a cleric and a bard, and once in a blue moon an enchanter to boot.  In these cases I go for DPS mostly, though having a full party keeps me using a lot of mana for buffs.  Of course I usually remain the primary slower/maloer, because shaman slows are UBER!  I imagine (I'm usually to busy to pay attention to songs in these groups, so I don't remember for sure) that the bard's in these situations twist more towards DPS, although I'm almost certain that they keep haste up also, which in its own way adds a large amount of DPS, in a full group with several melees.<br />
<br />
So there's what I know off the top of my head on shaman/bard combos.  Its not as good as the venerable shaman/monk or warrior/cleric (or /sigh enchanter/cleric) combos, but still a really good one.<br />
<br />
One last thing: at one point, back before Verant nerfed the bug that made it so only 4 mobs could attack a person at once, some innovative shaman here on the Crucible pioneered a brilliant method for exping with just a bard/shaman duo (60/60) in Fungus Grove (and elsewhere).  The shaman would pull a patch (4) mobs with AE slow (50% attack reduction, only affects 4 targets max, we get it, if we have access to it that is, at 58).  Then the bard would steal agro with AE damage songs.  The shaman would run off to pull more mobs, and the bard would tank the first 4.  The shaman would keep coming back with more patches, and each patch would get taken by the bard with his AE songs.  However, since only four could attack him at once (even though all took damage) a single shaman with Torpor could keep the Bard alive by casting it between pulls.  Using this method the enterprising duo could get at their best upwards of an AAXP every 20 minutes, if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
So, good luck in your quest for knowledge, let me know if I can help in any way :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">while not exactly on topic, but since it was mentioned in the OP, our epic story is the best thought out... but it was better when the final boss wasn't a fight; it used to be that he became remorseful and just handed you the final piece.  Somebody thought that was too easy and changed it to a fight which totally doesn't fit the story.  oh wells...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the polite request. :)  I'd be happy to try to answer any shaman specific questions you may have to the best of my ability.<br />
<br />
I would like to say that I really enjoy having bards who know how to group well with me.  Unfortunately, there are many who don't do this as well as many of us would like, and many (but not all) seem reluctant to change.<br />
<br />
btw, I absolutely LOVE the bard mez/stun trick to keep gating mobs from getting away. :D<br />
<br />
A few areas where I think Bards can improve to make Shaman like me happier:<br />
1.IF you CHARM it, TELL the group!<br />
2. If you MEZZ it, TELL the group (this isn't as much of a problem usually).<br />
3. If you want haste, or want us to haste the group, you HAVE to drop your haste song first.  If you are directly asking a shaman for haste, please CLICK OFF your haste song instead of just waiting for the song to end.  It is particularly aggravating to have a bard ask for haste in /tell, have us /rtarget and cast, and see it not hold :P  As soon as the shaman haste buff (Swift like the Wind, Talisman of Alacrity, Celerity, or Alacrity are the shaman haste buffs you will see most) lands, you can resume the haste/overhaste songs.<br />
<br />
4. DON'T have group Selo's up with a Torporing Shaman in your group.  I'll be honest and say I generally pay little attention as to WHICH songs are going at any time.  It is extremely aggravating to cast Torpor &amp; see it not take hold even with buff slots available.<br />
<br />
One problem being that at some levels your better than I am &amp; at certain Levels I'm better than you.  <br />
What particularly are you wanting to know more about in this regard?  :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I haven't had a problem with bard haste overwriting shaman haste lately.  Maybe that's a newb problem?  I am not sure exactly.  I think at lvl 44 the shaman's haste will again be better than yours for a bit.  Bards have so many different things to offer a group, that if they don't gotta play straight up haste all the time they are free to do other songs for other effects.  I dunno, bards are wierd.  Some are awesome and some are just annoying.  I remember being very annoyed with some bards when I was lower level because they would charm stuff at random and I'd blow a slow on the mob, then charm would break 5 seconds later and they wouldn't even mez it just let it beat on people and I would have to slow it again.  I dunno, CC can be annoying.  The more you work with one person tho, the better you get.  Most classes can perform some fashion of CC if the player is good.  I'd say that Enchanter, Bard, then Shaman for CC ability, then Necro because they can't slow and tend to get eaten when their little Fear/mez wears off (as it quickly does).  <br />
<br />
Mostly, just adapt to the needs of each specific group.  Each one will be different and will need a different approach.  It's usually the people who know only one way to play that annoy me the most.  An unusual situation comes up and they panic.  Learn to adapt and you'll get a rep for being the best bard.</div></div><hr />

I have gotten KEI when grouped but I have yet to go look for it or pay for it.  I have never paid for any buff and I have never sold one.<br />
<br />
I got 1 rez last night when in a group ( very stupid death ).  This was kind of nice becuase I had been doing a lot of exploring recently and had racked up 7 unrezed deaths in a row and  lost level 61 and was down to only 2 blues in level 60.  I am an Oracle of Rallos-Zek and I do not go around begging for buffs or for a rez.<br />
<br />
Some people take pride in their independance and other just wine and cry and run around looking for KEI.<br />
<br />
Bards,  I don't much like grouping with bards but then I don't much like grouping :).  In particular, I find that the quality of bard play varies a lot and some bards just continual confuse this simple minded Ogre.  Charming this then charming that then swithcing to this then screwing up that.  My best advice for a bard is to keep it as simple as you can untill your group has a chance to adjust to the way you play and don't go crazy with the charming.  I have played with a bard that would continualy switch which mob he was charming in a fight depending on whetever mob he could easily target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Backbeat Downbeat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi!<br />
<br />
Somuch to cover I'll probably have to do several posts. If I don't get to it here I will!<br />
<br />
Selo: NASTY! I'll put it into my game notes today.<br />
<br />
Charm: I learned to Charm in the Rockhopper Caves in DSP and can hold as many as 4 at a time. I make it a POINT to tell groups that if there are ADDS to leave them to me. I never will foul your casts without PRIOR notice. That gets us killed. Rez or no you still lose EXP, time and are ingeneral pissed as hell. I only Charn if an Chanter isn't available.<br />
<br />
Cana 1, 2, 3: Sorry but that scares me silly. I have a Baron 60 Shaman friend that casts FOCUS in Nexus. He will Cana 3 down to 21% for casting. No KEI (I even offered to pay for it). I'm a support class as you say and when I see one of MY PEOPLE (you group with me for any reason &amp; your my job) go down that low and I almost freak. I have my Lute out and and singing Mana &amp; Heal. I know he knows what he's doing but I still don't like it. Isn't Cana really meant to be a last resort spell? Cast that Buff or DD or your facing an TPW?<br />
<br />
I don't have DOB yet. Is it the same problem with singing Katta? If I 2 Twist for EXP groups in the DL they usually want Katta &amp; Haste for the DEX boost. Rouges almost roll on the ground wetting themselves over it. The -DEX Proc is wanted from it also.<br />
<br />
At Work &amp; Boss coming. I'll be back later.<br />

<br />
Canni is almost never a last resort spell. I'm almost never FM, so I'm constantly casting it. Of course, sometimes I look down and realize that I'm at FM, and still casting it... but that's another story.<br />

I understand now about Cana 3 but it still looks like someone's getting killed. I'll live with it.<br />
<br />
Haste &amp; SELO:<br />
<br />
NP. I only use SELO for traveling (I hit the EQ Speed Cap at Level 38. Since Bards are the fastest Class in EQ why would I ever want SOW? It's slower). I never use it unless I'm Chant Kiting &amp; that's strictly SOLO.<br />
<br />
Haste: NP. This is one of the things I came to learn.<br />
<br />
Thank you!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kumeldar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">The way I always looked at it is if a Shaman is at full health, and not full mana then they are wasting mana.Keeping Regen going is just natural and once you have Torpor, and now the lower level version its just not sensible to not canni down a little bit so that the regen is actually doing something.<br />
<br />
Of course its always good to be well over 50% HP when a pull is incoming, and maybe more in PoP where a early Slow cast can get ya aggro pretty easy, and the mobs can hit so hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">well if looks like some one dieing that is becouse it is. every shaman has sucsedded in killing him or her self more then once with cani . and i dont mean can 5 ( that another thing can5 will be as fun for you as it is for the clerics from what i can tell  ;) ). <br />
<br />
on bards, boy i have ran across some real stinkers ( well lets just say for 54 lvls i had a real fear of bard couse every time i grouped with them i died, and died often ). but that has since canged and i just love having bards with me. to be honest i dotn rightly care what everyother class in my groups do, just so long as thay are nto overtly trying to get us or them selfs killed ( had a chanter that did that ). i love your overhaste song since most chanters forget to give me a haste even after the 3 round of me asking for it. and being that I can not get ahold of my swift spell yet ( darn iksar and thouse zones being empty ) It pushes me up to the point i realy dont notice it. <br />
<br />
In pop i just addapt to what ever role is needed in the group from main tank to healer to crowd control to damage dealer. and i expect all others to do the same ( have ran in to some trouble with this since alot of the peeps i run in to just are to inflexable to do this ). I have noticed that bards seem to go with this in stride but i dont know what you all can do realy. have looked at your song but never playing a bard thay make no sence to me. so i dont worry about it. you do what you need to do and I am happy for it.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and be aware that you're gonna die A LOT in HoT because of beneficial AoE songs while someone drags a corpse or opens a door (don't worry about it, just be aware that it WILL happen)</div></div><hr />

Oop and /wave Crucible, I just saw my sig and don't appear to have posted since lvl 24 odd.<br />
<br />
I've been reading up on bards due to an itch I have to try one. Was going to dual box my 57 ranger with Dim but I keep thinking I'd love a bard as my lil tank/utility extraordinaire, mainly so I can go off solo with either when I don't feel like dual boxing/single grouping. So, I wondered, whilst the topic is sort of on the bad bits/good bits just how well they can tank, at least pre-PoP? I'm thinking more fun factor than ultimate power duo, I'm intrigued what the shammies and bards reckon.</div></div><hr />

Just for the record, (and because my rangerly pride has been injured) Bards melee slightly worse than Beastlords and several notches below Rangers, who are 3rd or 4th on the straight melee damage list.</div></div><hr />

Hi!<br />
<br />
/looks at feet<br />
<br />
It's true. We are taught from day one to always attack from the rear (might as well be a Rogue). Never, ever pull agro from the MT. That way leads to an TPW.<br />
<br />
However, if you looking to be the DD then be a Warrior or an SK.<br />
<br />
Can I say things like this and not make the Shamem angry? This is after all your Class Board and not mine.<br />

I know I like OOC, Mez, Charm and that mana/health regen song and that the group won't complain about me using group haste over sltw if there is a bard there.<br />
<br />
My only &quot;pet peeve&quot; about bards:<br />
<br />
I have seen a bard use mez to stun a mob before when the group/raid will currently be attacking the mob. While this is usually a good thing if I am using my pet this causes my pet to stop attacking the mob since they won't attack a mezzed mob. This is even more of an annoyance when I use my spirit call aa skill on a mob then the bard uses mez to try to stun and causes all of my pets to stop attacking. Since the aa pets won't respond to commands I can't tell them to attack again so they go to waste.</div></div><hr />

This is usually done to prevent gates, and stopping a gate &gt; pet's melee damage for 1 second.<br />
<br />
&gt; Since the aa pets won't respond to commands I can't tell them to attack again so they go to waste.<br />
<br />
Again, rather this than a gate. If you want to make sure your pet attacks again, root a mob and sit at its feet. Insta-restart for aa pets.</div></div><hr />

Hi!<br />
<br />
Wellllllllll........<br />
<br />
I could fob this one off since I'm nowhere near as high as you are and don't hunt in your areas but I'll give it a try:<br />
<br />
1. One of my Jobs if no Chanter is in the party is CC. I tell my people that if there are ADDs to leave them to me. I can handle as many as 4 at a time.<br />
<br />
2. It sounds kinda like my having to give warning if I'm going to sing something that will over write a Shaman Cast or cause it to bounce.<br />
<br />
3. Shouldn't you be casting this AA using an /ASSIST button to target the pet on the MOB after the MT establishes agro?<br />
<br />
4. When you use this AA is someone else near death? If so them MEZZing maybe the only way to get the MOB off him before he dies. <br />
<br />
5. I use MEZZ to keep things off my peoples backs. Dead people means I failed and I'm my worst critic.<br />
<br />
6. Remember one last thing: MEZZing a MOB, any MOB puts me right on top of his HATE list. When MEZZ breaks that MOB(s) is going to come right at me &amp; no one else. <br />
<br />
7. If it's used correctly then you can Rest &amp; Heal your party. As it costs a Bard nothing (Mana, reagent, ect) to MEZZ. You could actually keep the MEZZ up for hours. Plenty of time for your people to attack &amp; kill singly as opposed to taking on a Pack.<br />
<br />
8. Have a brief talk with the group leader before you hunt?<br />
<br />
/waves<br />
<br />
PS:<br />
<br />
As long as I don't anger Shamen here or the Shamen Class Board Mods I'll do my best to answer your questions as you answered mine. One Hand Washes The Other.<br />

<br />
I am not talking about bards mezzing an add. I am talking about using mez over and over again on a mob we are currently attacking. Even though the mez gets broken immediately it makes the mob 'pause&quot; for a moment which makes him stop casting, swinging etc for a brief moment. If this is used on a casting mob I have no problem with it. its when it is used on non casting everyday exp grind trash mobs that it annoys me.<br />
<br />
2. It sounds kinda like my having to give warning if I'm going to sing something that will over write a Shaman Cast or cause it to bounce.<br />
<br />
Actually if you use the method above and are grouped with a pet class let them know you will be doing this, not before every pull but just a general &quot;hey i use mez to stun mobs, so your pet might give you some trouble&quot;. As soon as I know a bard will be doing this I know to not waste my aa pet skill and maybe not get my normal pet out.<br />
<br />
3. Shouldn't you be casting this AA using an /ASSIST button to target the pet on the MOB after the MT establishes agro?<br />
<br />
I am, I am talking about when the bard is using mez on the mob the MT is currently attacking, not on adds.<br />
<br />
4. When you use this AA is someone else near death? If so them MEZZing maybe the only way to get the MOB off him before he dies.  <br />
<br />
No, my AA pets do about 3,000 damage in one minute. I use it to kill the mob faster or when I want to save the mana for that pull so I use that instead of a dot or nuke. The bard is using mez to briefly stun the mob not to mez it.<br />
<br />
5. I use MEZZ to keep things off my peoples backs. Dead people means I failed and I'm my worst critic.<br />
<br />
The way you are talking about using MEZ is fine. This is not what i am talking about. I am talking about using mez to stun mobs the MT is currently fighting.<br />
<br />
6. Remember one last thing: MEZZing a MOB, any MOB puts me right on top of his HATE list. When MEZZ breaks that MOB(s) is going to come right at me &amp; no one else.  <br />
<br />
In normal situation yes, but I don't think its the case in this situation. Or if it does might be a reason for the bard to rethink using mez to stun the mob the MT is currently on if the bard is constantly drawing agro away from the MT by doing so.<br />
<br />
7. If it's used correctly then you can Rest &amp; Heal your party. As it costs a Bard nothing (Mana, reagent, ect) to MEZZ. You could actually keep the MEZZ up for hours. Plenty of time for your people to attack &amp; kill singly as opposed to taking on a Pack.<br />
<br />
I agree, I love bard mezzes. Its when they use the mez when only one mob in camp that is not a caster and I lose the 3,000 damage my aa  pets could have done on that mob and I constantly have to keep hitting my /pet attack key that it annoys me. And its really not that big of an annoyance. I just grumble a bit to myself and deal with it.<br />
<br />
8. Have a brief talk with the group leader before you hunt?<br />
<br />
I just wait to see if the bard uses the mez/stun thing when I see a bard in group, or just ask him. If he does I don't bother using my pets. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you are misunderstanding me. I LOVE bards. I love being in a group with a bard and love having bards in a raid. This is just the ONLY thing I could think of that a bard does that slightly annoys me.</div></div><hr />

Hi!<br />
<br />
Given your CASES.......I ****FLAT****OUT****AGREE****THAT****THE****BARD****IS****BEING****A****TOTAL*****MORON.<br />
<br />
Get away from that Bard ASAP. Cause a Soinc BOOM! getting out of there.<br />
<br />
It's sloppy work. Given the little I know of the Trials (where Teamwork &amp; DPS are EVERYTHING) let the FOOL rot &amp; never get Flagged. Put them on your Sh*t List (I have one using NOTES in EQ). That fool is gonna cause a TPW.<br />
<br />
Post a general warning to this, the Shamans (See? I learned) Class Board that THIS Bard can't count to 5 without using both hands &amp; feet.<br />
<br />
The only cases I can see MEZZ being used are:<br />
<br />
CC<br />
<br />
Casting Mobs<br />
<br />
Gating Mobs<br />
<br />
To stop the death of a party member.<br />
<br />
Pull Spliting<br />
<br />
I have only one goal as a Bard. To Be The Best Bard I Can Be. I know my job so I have no problems getting (no bragging. The simple truth. Word gets around) groups. Your a Shaman &amp; the above applies to you. I find a BAD Shaman &amp; I walk (stupid eBayer). You find a bad Bard &amp; you walk, PERIOD.<br />
<br />
My entire Class Board would fall in line with that.<br />

Argue about CHA all you like, this one though is like having an &quot;argument&quot; about whether 2+2=4 or not.  Shaman, plural shamans.  Period.  Check the dictionary, and good night.  VI/Sony screwing it up too doesn't make it right.</div></div><hr />
