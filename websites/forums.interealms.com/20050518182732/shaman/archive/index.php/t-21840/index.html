<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buffrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Realisticly what is the earliest that I could start the flagging process with my shaman.  Would a 54 Shaman even be any contribution to PoJ trial or would I just be in the way (aggro magnet).  Any input would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">on my server theres now a pickup channel for most raids....and the rules are usually flagged for the zone or a 60+ and 65 for loots...the channel was started by a time flagged warrior who basically puts together all these low PoP encounters and flags other peoples alts or new players...it has gotten my alt srt flagged and all but id reccomend 60+ at least</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shaman suck in PoJ trials. PoJ trials are all about fast dps. My advice to you is gain more levels or hope that the other 5 people doing the trials with you are nice enough to let you tag along to get flagged.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">lvl 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Trials depend on who you know or who is in your guild.  While it was a struggle early on for us to get anyone flagged, things have changed and in my guild Im sure we could get your toon flagged if you could zone in at this point.  If you want to actually contribute, I would wait till I was 61+ probably.   As for the rest of the flags, I would wait till 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Things have probably changed a lot, but I didn't get through until 62, when I could at LEAST bring the new dog. <br />
<br />
The level of the critters is going to make anything short of 60 of limited use (except maybe a cleric CH'ing).  You'll get a lot of aggro, and a lot of resists.  If you have friends that want to pull you through, though, PoJ is possible.<br />
<br />
The CoD access quest where you collect items in PoD would be the easiest to pull off, though very time-consuming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buffrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well then are there any other flagging steps I could be working on at this level(will be dinging 55 tonight).  Spiritous can you post that channel or pm it to me plz.</div></div><hr />
