THIS WAY, WHEN THE GUY WANTS 40K YOU WILL BE ABLE TO GIVE HIM CASH THEN AND THERE RATHER THAN SAY &quot;OK GIVE ME HALF AN HOUR TO GET IT&quot; AND HAVE HIM SELL IT TO SOMEONE ELSE WHILE YOU ARE BEGGING YOUR FRIENDS FOR MONEY.<br />

Argh, didn't you read my post?  Save it for yourself!!!!!  Don't end up a gimp like me.</div></div><hr />

I would save all my but my gear is so crapy I have to upgrade :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
noooooooooooooooooooooooooo have you learned nothing?<br />
<br />
spells &gt; gear<br />
<br />
Save all that money and buy SPELLS!!!!!!  No piece of gear, not even fungi or epic, is as powerful as torpor.  With malo, you can usually get in to a nice guild and get some nice lewts.  SAVE FOR YOU DAMN SPELLS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had Malo in the bank but traded it away for a Tae Ew War Maul.  Can't wait to smack some gnolls!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spells may be better than gear but I am in a raiding guild so gear is important to do the larger encounters.  Plus if I cannot reach lvl 60 cause I die from my crappy gear I dont have to worry about topor as I will never be a ble to use it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo<br />
<br />
none of you are listening.<br />
<br />
Trust me, please.  When you are 60 and spell-less you will kick yourself for every pp that you spent on equipment upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well...im currently going all out for my JBB...<br />
<br />
my thoughts are this...JBB's sell FAST, if i have a option of getting torpor, most people will hold onto the spell for abit, so i can unload JBB, or just trade pp+jbb for the spell...<br />
<br />
A JBB will get me up there faster then alot of PP in the bank would</div></div><hr />

WRONG read my story please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If simply having Malo will get you into a guild, it's no guild that I'd want to join.  However, getting into a guild based on your own merits may net you a copy of Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What he says is true. I saw Malo for 10k and i couldnt buy it because i only had 3k &lt;cry&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I agree with this. I am now 56. I used to hunt high and low for better gear and I would blow my cash on buying it. I did this with my alts too. <br />
<br />
I went broke.<br />
<br />
Now, I have sold off all my twinks gear except for one. I made some small upgrades to my main gear. I am done.<br />
<br />
I few months ago I went on a spell buying spree, listening to suggestions here. I have all of my spells except for a few 59/60.<br />
I am saving my money for Torpor.<br />
<br />
If I were 60 and saw Torpor fall from me when it was so close, I would die. <br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice. I am sorry it happened to you. I hope it does not happen to me. May your suffering save us all from the same fate :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Etric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Poor Jin.<br />
<br />
I'm on the same server as you, and I've seen malo at least 5 times in bazaar for way too much money.  I'm a poor shammy and I don't care about frickin' malo.. lv 55.. I'm in a guild with my friends so I don't need some leverage to get into a guild and I'm also the highest in my guild.  I've seen malo a lot and if I see you I'll send you a tell.  <br />
<br />
Etric<br />
<br />
P.S.  A mage friend of mine &quot;claimed&quot; to have bought it for 2k in bazaar.  If he really did he might sell it for 10k (grrr...)  we'll see... (the same mage friend also claimed to have destroyed torpor in seb because he was destroying spells as ML)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">the same mage friend also claimed to have destroyed torpor in seb because he was destroying spells as ML<br />
<br />
<br />
No offence but your mate is either:<br />
a) Full of it<br />
b) A fookin idiot - that would be like destroying a Fungi or CoF for space in your inventroy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If I was wearing something better than totemic I'd take that advice.  Maby its time I wezeled my way onto a hate raid......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>DarkPhase</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use my gear to make money in this kinda way:<br />
<br />
1. I buy something nice and pricey that I can use and has high demand for as low as I can get it for.<br />
<br />
2. Constantly auction the high priced items I use for more than I got them for. If I can't sell it I can still use it :)<br />
<br />
3. If I sell I repeat all the steps. This way I end up with lots of money in the bank and the spells I need before I'm 60.<br />
<br />
I'm currently level 58 and have Fungi, JBB, Lodi Shield, Malo and Torpor. All of that came from nice trades.<br />
My best trade so far was OOiV for FT3 boots. Got OOiV for 28k and sold FT3 boots for 43k :)<br />
<br />
Trades like this can get you rich, but keep in mind it has to be high demand items. But I never dared to trade Fungi and JBB in the same manner. They are just too darn useful for that.<br />
<br />
Hope my tips helps for future shamans in need of spells. Start your search early and you will not regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Tailen - try getting into a Plane of Growth raid instead - it's a MUCH nicer zone to raid (IMO obviously) and the armour is superior to Hate armour.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Uhm, Jin?   We're in the same guild, remember?  I'm pretty sure that if I lend you 5k or 10k or whatever for a spell sooner or later you'll pay me back.   And even if it's later, it'll still be before I hit 60 and need the money to buy my own copy :)<br />
<br />
Besides, the cash free is just that, liquid cash.   I've been spending quite a bit of time on my alts buying &amp; selling stuff in the bazaar.  I have quite a bit of inventory I'm constantly turning over, when I need to make the big purchases I'll just sell &amp; quit replacing my inventory.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Agreed Dark.<br />
<br />
I do the same thing with my Fungi.  Will it slow down my solo time? Yes.  So I go group again ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Currently selling mine for 52k as I paid 50 (yes I know that isnt' low)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Listen to Jin, young shamans.  He is a wise man.<br />
<br />
Save your plat and start kissing up to wizards early.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I still think a JBB is worth the plat, even if spells are your main focus.<br />
<br />
JBB is a tool to help you earn more plat/XP.  And you can always sell it to raise money, probably on pretty short notice given the demand.  Similar to the approach DarkPhase mentioned.<br />
<br />
Although, point taken, don't spend more than you have to on gear.  I still wear totemic legs and back and probably will do so until I get Thurg or SS to replace it with.  I could spend all I have on an Obulus Death Shroud, but I'm gonna stick with the tattered mantle.  My AC is in the high 800's unbuffed and my WIS is 180, but it doesn't hurt me that much.</div></div><hr />
