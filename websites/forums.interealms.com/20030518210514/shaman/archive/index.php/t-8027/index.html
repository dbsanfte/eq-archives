<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tymche</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok I was on a Hate raid (only Shaman and got ALL the drops), heard that I can turn in the stuff I cant use for Gems(?).  I have not been able to find anything posted...anyone got a clue?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All Rune Etched are handed in to the Shaman Trainer (Oracle Somethingsilly). Note: there are 3 trainers in PoK. He is the one in the GOOD side of town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, you can turn it in to any trainer with the &quot;Oracle&quot; title AFAIK.  I did all my turnins in the Neutral section of PoK.  Also, anyone can do the turnin, regardless of class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Can you clarify for me...I picked up some bard armor for these turn ins instead of letting it rot.  As a shaman, would I turn in to my trainer or there's?  The only reason I ask is when you hail the trainers, they say &quot;You are not a Bard, Begone&quot;  or whatever...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You should turn into any of thier trainers.<br />
<br />
Hailing them won't work, say &quot;What Armor&quot; and they will talk of how the lost/wore out/destroyed or something to that effect, thier beloved (Insert planes armor here).<br />
<br />
Then just turn it in, get the XP and reward. <br />
<br />
I turned in some old Etched and some Wizzy armor and got 2 Blue Diamonds and a Raw Diamond. The rewardsseem to be random, because a Enchanter buddy of mine turned in same wizzy item and got a peridot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I turned in rune etched greaves and got 1% aaxp and a dot.<br />
<br />
hmmmmm.....<br />
<br />
Oh well :) More bank space for me.</div></div><hr />
