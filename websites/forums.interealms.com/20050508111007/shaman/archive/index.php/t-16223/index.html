<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Farseeyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so my AC is FAR below what it needs to be...and its because my defense is much much too low.  Can anyone give me some tips on a good way to raise defense?  I'm a 54 Shaman, and I need to get about 100 defense.  Any help at all would be great, cause I get my ass handed to me on a regular basis when I solo. :p<br />

Once slowed, hit like pussies - max around 80ish.<br />
<br />
Or just dont slow em :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">this may be frowned upon, rightfully so, but you can skill up on the exterminator in almost any city.  hits like a grandmother and has a high level.<br />
<br />
Other than that, getting swarmed in a dungeon by blue con mobs will jolt your skill ups like mad.<br />
<br />
consider dueling a pet class's pet, so long as it cons blue or higher.<br />
<br />
I notice more skill ups when getting hit by multiple mobs, when I buff agil (for defensive skills), and when mobs are red cons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had the best results and fastest skill ups dueling a Beastlord.  The pet was dark blue to me.  I had Stoicism so I buffed as much HP and AC as I could, along with DEX and AGI high as possible.  Let the pet beat me down about 800 HPs.  Stoicism back up.  Rinse and repeat.  It took several hours to gain a significant amount, but it was WELL worth the time.  I also got to work on my 1HB!  :D  And the mana regen buff the BL has pretty much negated me needed to med at all (with a canni thrown in here and there for good measure).  Tried to use the Arena in the Bazaar, but there were too many punks who wouldn't leave us alone.  The Arena in Lake Rathe is just TOO remote (BL didn't have gate).  I found the Arena in Thurgadin worked perfectly.  The BL could just AFK with a pet up.  I could run out of the arena area when I got low, go back in and whack the pet for more fun!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have found that defence raises the fastes when you have more then one mob beating on you .... and if your also lakeing in the offence skill ( not weps but just the vinala skill ) that haveing a DS raises that. and if your going to be working on defence dont slow the sucker .... you need more attacks comeing at you the more the better. get all the agi and dex you can just incase ether one helps skill up. when going up you are going to notice a sweet spot for a certian lvl critter as compaire to your AC once you get to high skill ups will come less and less when your to low thay are going to also be less frequant de to the fact you are not even closee to nulling the hit with your armor. its only when the hit is closs to the hit/nohit line that the skill comes so you may need to move around a bit to max it the quick est. but as for you I would say if you can just go around and tank exp mobs for your dog. dont root rott just tank for the pet ... it may be slower right now for you but it will raise your skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You could solo Ice Giants for nice cash and defense skill ups up unti level 57 or maybe higer, I forget when they go green.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Duo with a rogue  :p <br />
<br />
No, seriously.<br />
<br />
Since she was 48, Amorae and I have been duoing in PoJ, Karnors, and a fun trip to Sirens Grotto (pre-revamp). I pull, she tanks, I assassinate. Prior to going out, we get the following buffs (as many as we can get, obviously):<br />
<br />
-Blessing of the Nine<br />
-Kazad's Mark<br />
-KEI<br />
-Fo7<br />
-Boar<br />
-Wrulan<br />
<br />
Slow is NOT ALLOWED (besides, stuff dies so fast, it's pointless). Sometimes I have a druid friend along who keeps Amorae healed between fights but that's fairly rare. Seafurbies (or Seahomers, if you prefer) are also great targets.<br />
<br />
Best idea though is to fight a pet class's pet in an arena. DONT /duel. Just go to an Arena and park the pet in the middle and go hit him some. I may wind up going that route as well but for right now, duoing with the rogue keeps me mindful of the Shaman's gear and shows me what I need to upgrade sooner.</div></div><hr />
