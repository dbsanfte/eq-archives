<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was told if i wanted to get good faction for Coldain and Veeshan I would need to get Giant toes and giant heads and turn them into a NPC.  However the source that told me this didn't remember the NPC name or where he is.  Can anyone recall this faction quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">&quot;Go to Loremaster Borannin in Thurgadin and say &quot;I seek to perform duties for the crown.&quot; <br />
<br />
Borannin will ask you to bring back to him four frost giant toes. Frost Giant Toes drop randomly of all Kromrif giants (most giants in the Great Divide and East Wastes fall under the Kromrif faction). &quot; From Ally<br />
<br />
Giving him the toes results in faction and a Burlap Coldain Prayer Shawl.<br />
<br />
Turn the heads into the same guy, 4 toes and 10 heads. Don't remember exactly when  but he gives you a 10 slot container for the heads, will be good to have a primary slot free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, giant toes and heads are quest items for the first 2 Coldain Prayer shawls.  <br />
<br />
The NPC you need to turn the items in to is Loremaster Borranin near the cleric guild.  To get there...enter Thurg...go straight ahead till you get to the T intersection and go left.  Follow that straight untill you end up in a building (you will pass the bank).  Borranin is the dwarf on the right of the stage (as you face the stage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Personally, I'd advise saving your toes aside from the ones needed for Prayer Shawl to turn in in Skyshrine. Claws of Veeshan faction is much harder to raise than Coldain, and must be raised higher in order to eventually do the armor quests there. The NPC in Skyshrine is named Lt. Milven and is located close to the entrance from Wakening Lands. You'll want to be at least dubious before going there. You'll start KoS to them, so hunt the Bank and/or Arena areas in Kael to get larger +faction hits for Claws of Veeshan. These areas also drop Giant Warrior Helms, which Lt. Milven will give you a larger +faction hit for turning in. He also accepts toes and will give you a bit of coin when you give them to him, so take a bit of time and do them one at a time, not 4 at a time<br />
<br />
I wish you well</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I recall correctly the location of Lt. Milven was changed, plus the faction hit is not as drastic as it once was for the turn ins.  It's really an inadequate way to faction now.   I could be wrong but I don't think I am.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am thinking who ever you were talking to got the temple of veeshan quest armor (velious era) and ornate armor (pop era) confused.<br />
<br />
Temple of Veeshan armor requires you to farm inside the Temple of Veeshan in western wastes.  there are a couple places to hunt depending on whether you are trying to get giant faction armor (which has better ac and hps) or the dragon faction armor (which had better resists).  both require the same dropped item (there are 4 types, one for each armor class.  plate, chain, leather, and silk).  they are totally random drops.  there is one section where you wont screw up your dragon faction.  killing in the rest of Temple of Veeshan will screw up your dragon faction.</div></div><hr />
