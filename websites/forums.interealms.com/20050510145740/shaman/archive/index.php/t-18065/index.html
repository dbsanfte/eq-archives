<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Guys!<br />
<br />
The last expansion I bought for EQ was Luclin.  Lately I have been curious to play again.  If I bought EQ:Evolutions can I just use the 2 expansions from it that I do not have (POP and Ykesha) and activate them on my old account?  Lost Dungeons is also interesting to me, would I be able to play in it without getting POP or Ykesha at all?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance guys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, Lost Dungeons of Norrath are in the old world zones (Butcherblock, East Commons, North Ro, South Ro, and Everfrost).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Answer to your first question would be yes as well. The $30 is worth it for pop, shared bank, and maps definately.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I had two old accounts that were deactivated before Luclin, I reactivated them, added an Evolutions code to my account and poof I had all the expansions up to LDoN.  (Note that LDoN does not come with Evolutions)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Maps are from LoY. Shared bank maybe to even tho it was added after LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bah yah didn't mean shared bank, just expanded bank. See what not playing for a few weeks will do to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I saw an account just through Luclin the other day, it did have 8 regular bank slots, plus the 2 shared and shared pp.</div></div><hr />
