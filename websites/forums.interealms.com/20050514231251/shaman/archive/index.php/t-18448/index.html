<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">{edit}<br />
With the announcement of a new expansion today (12/17/03) now is the perfect time for us to propose new and useful ideas for our class.  If you agree with ideas in this thread (or have ideas of your own) I would encourage you to submit feedback (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_feedback.jsp) describing those ideas to the developers corner website or to write to eqfeedback@soe.sony.com (mailto:eqfeedback@soe.sony.com).  I'd like to see this finally be an expansion where we can say something good about our new spell list.  SOE does use feedback, so be careful what you ask for.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've been pondering ideas for abilities/spells that I think would be a good addition to the shaman class, while not being overpowered.  They would give us back some uniqueness and would be both interesting and useful.  The upcoming melee changes open up a whole new arena of effects to choose from.<br />
<br />
<br />
We've had a few threads in the past couple of weeks on these subjects, here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18388) and here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=18305).  However there threads got quickly derailed by people asking for spells of other classes and for unrealistic things.  We are a very diverse class, in a very diverse game with a multitude of different playstyles.  We will never have consensus on what is most important.  However, I hope that people can look beyond their own little niche and think about what abilities and spells would be both good and balanced for the game and for shaman of many different stations.<br />
<br />
Let me be clear what this thread is NOT about.  This thread is not about asking for melee upgrades, unresistable slows, rezzes, charm, etc.  This thread is also NOT about asking for things we have asked for one million times already.  While having these abilities (AE shrink, improved invis, etc) would be nice, we've talked about them before a lot.   I would like this thread to be about proposing well thought NEW ideas for future expansions (or other improvement periods) for both AA/spells, primarily focused on level 65 (or higher, in the future).  <br />
<br />
<br />
I have several ideas, in the catagories of Debuffs, Buffs, Mana Regen.  I'm not talking about our healing or damage abilities in this post, because I don't have anything new to say (NOT because changes aren't needed in those areas).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
Our slows are powerful enough to have warranted nerfing (through the new mitigation system of Planes of Power).  I do not think we will get a slow spell upgrade again.  So I am not going to discuss slow.  Instead I want to talk about the Cripple upgrade that POP failed to bring.  With the new melee system, there is a valuable opportunity to make an addition to the cripple line both useful, interesting and unique.   A crippled mob could present more &quot;openings&quot; for meleers to use to execute their new melee abilities.  <br />
<br />
A new cripple could also directly modify a mobs ability to hit, decrease their ATK directly and/or decrease their mitigation (see the aggressive discipline on direct mitigation reduction (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4498&amp;source=Test))  avoidance.  There are a plethora of opportunities to upgrade the cripple line.   The chance to dodge, parry, dual wield, etc can all be modified independently now with the new melee system.<br />
<br />
I propose there could really be 3 new cripple spells (Cheesy names included free of charge).<br />
<br />
<br />
 Assailant's Ally - Opening Enhancer - Casting this spell on your target will cause the target to display 10-20% more openings (could be a multiple stage AA).<br />
<br />
 Debilitating Fog - Offensive Ability Decreaser - This spell clouds the mind of your target, decreasing their offensive concentration.  This will decrease their chance to hit and causes their ability to double attack (and/or double attack) to degrade by 10%.<br />
<br />
 Corrosive Aura - Defensive Ability Decreaser - Casting this spell will reduce the integrity of your target's armor, reducing their AC and mitigation and encumbering their movements(not snare), hindering their ability to parry and riposte. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
Shaman have been described in the past as the master of stat buffs.  Unfortunately as every day goes by stat buffs are less and less useful.  This is a combination of gear progression, AA points towards stats and ldon augs for stats.  Even in the beginning, statistic buffs were much less meaningful than HP/AC/Mana/Resist buffs.  Now with the proliferation of other specialty buffs including things like bulwark of vie, massive damage shields, etc...  stat buffs are less desireable than ever in the face of limited buff slots.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only worthwhile non-utility buffs we have left (at moderate levels of advancement at 65), are buffs that provide either direct hitpoints or ATK.<br />
<br />
As I discussed above, with the new melee system changes, there is a tremendous opportunity to allow shaman to do what they once did better than anyone else.  Buff meleers.  There is now the opportunity to give us buffs that increase chance to hit, increase chance to dodge, parry, riposte, increase overall avoidance or mitigation, increase dual wield rate or double attack rate.  There is opportunity to add diversity to buffs here.<br />
<br />
<br />
My proposal is for the avatar line to be attended to first.  Avatar was once our premier buff.  Just one expansion after we got the buff, it was turned into a weapon proc that was BETTER than the original spell.  The upgrades to avatar have been welcome but minor.  The statistics component (Str/dex/agi) of the buff we use now, Ferine Avatar, are largely useless.  Most meleers at moderate levels of advancement (Pre-Elemental) will max STR and DEX with just Focus.  The returns of AGI are very minor.  So the only important part of FA is the ATK portion.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see future versions of avatar drop the statistics portion and add in direct bonuses to melee abilities, perhaps adding something else interesting, like the effects on time loot (+ strikethrough ) or whatever.<br />
<br />
XXX Avatar<br />
+160 atk<br />
+10% to chance to hit<br />
+10% to double attack<br />
+10% to dual wield.<br />
<br />
whatever on the specifics, I am sure you can see where I am trying to go with this.  There is also some opportunity for a defensive avatar type spell for tanks.   In addition, there is the new field of endurance regen, and perhaps buffs that would extend the length of a meleers discipline or reduce the END cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
I discussed this in depth in this post (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=203938&amp;postcount=44).  The quick version is that chain cannibalizing isn't fun or balanced anymore.  We are punished in 5 ways for cannibalize.  We most devote a spell slot, we are prevented from doing anything else while cannibalizing, we must sacrifice HP.  Then there are the related areas where we are penalized for this &quot;superior mana regen&quot; with increased mana cost, increased resists on our spells.  All other classes have received updated mana regen abilities (that are passive, allowing them to do other things, not devote spell slots, etc) in Luclin or POP and we haven't since Velious. <br />
<br />
I propose we are given an improved cannibalize that doesn't have to be chain cast, but can be used more often and in conjunction with cannibalize 5.  Decrease the cast time to .5 and up the reuse time.  Make it take more HP and give back more mana.  You can tune it so the rate at which we can cannibalize for mana is similar to what it is now.  Just make it useable less often.  <br />
<br />
Cannibalize (at max efficiency, doing nothing but chain canni)<br />
1.25 cast, 2.25 recast<br />
50hp for 29mana<br />
1.7hp per mana.<br />
8.21 MPS (mana per second) 493 mana per minute<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 2 (at max efficiency, doing nothing but chain canni)<br />
1.25 cast, 2.25 recast<br />
67hp for 37mana.<br />
1.8hp per mana.<br />
10.5MPS, 629 mana per minute<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 3 (at max efficiency, doing nothing but chain canni)<br />
1.25 cast, 2.25 recast<br />
74hp for 42mana.<br />
1.8hp per mana.<br />
11.9MPS, 714 mana per minute<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 4 (at max efficiency, doing nothing but chain canni)<br />
2.5 cast, 3.0 recast  *fixed typo, thanks Giac.<br />
148 hp for 82 mana.<br />
1.7hp per mana.<br />
13.67 MPS, 820 mana per minute. <br />
<br />
Cannibalization AA - Cannibalize 5 (at max efficiency)<br />
2.5 cast, 3 minute recast<br />
1924 hp for 1066 mana.<br />
1.8hp per mana.<br />
5.9MPS, 356 mana per minute. <br />
<br />
Proposed - Cannibalize 6 (at max efficiency)<br />
.5 cast, 15 second recast.<br />
425 hp for 250 mana.<br />
1.7 hp per mana.<br />
16.6MPS, 1000 mana per minute.<br />
<br />
<br />
[edit:typo here, changed 15, from 25.  Perhaps that is a little more powerful than I was looking for when I typed it.  At the current time we can canni4 10 times a minute.  In this case, it would be 4.   Anyways case the main point of this example is that chain casting canni4 isnt practical in many situations and a bigger chunk would make it a lot better.  Another option is to allow us to greatly reduce the re-use time on canni5 down to like 60 seconds.]<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's it for my ideas for now.   If you made it all the way to the bottom of this, I congratulate you and encourage you to share your own ideas.  I realize that the new melee system is in its infancy and that any new buffs would need a lot of testing.   The numbers I presented I pulled out of the air for now.   I don't have any real ideas that are new or interesting for the other 2 major aspects of our class, damage and healing.  I have some general thoughts but nothing specific enough to share now.  I would like to see shaman gain and AA MGB'able Heal Over Time like all other priests and our hybrid class, beastlords.<br />
<br />
Our ideas have been used before to make future changes.  Talk about the things you really want, that would really make a difference.  Lets leave the talk of rezzing and death touch and even (/mourn) winged courier, elsewhere.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Those all sound great, only thing I would ask to add is a get out of jail free card.  Something to take the heat off when you catch too much aggro.   Alot of other classes have them, and i got really attached to them with Earing of Frozen Skull.  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=1744) <br />

However it should be visually pleasing too.  A spirit form.  Immune from attacks for XXX duration.  Something like these guys from matrix reloaded <br />

or maybe even faded from the waist down like medusa type mobs in the deep<br />

just ideas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Making this a hotkey instead of an actual spell would be a dream Having to sacrifice a gem to canni4 is highly limiting when you consider most shamans also keep tnargs/slow/malos up 100% of the time as well... <br />
<br />
Or better yet, add a spell slot 9 which you can place a spell, and can only change the spell that goes in that slot once a RL week,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Possible Upgrades:<br />
-An aa ability that allows our pets to be included in our group buffs.<br />
<br />
-I like Ceno's idea of a get out of jail card.  One because we don't really have one, and two because this not only sounds feasible but creative.  So I'm jumping on his train.<br />
<br />
-An aa ability that lets us cann off our pets?  The reclick time can be adjusted for length, the pet dies but grants us mana back (amount to be decided)  Maybe this one is silly/stupid.  I'm half filipino, must be the dog eater in me  :rolleyes: .<br />
<br />
-I know slow has been discussed so much, but I really would enjoy a level 65+ slow that is the same as turgur's but is faster casting/recasting.<br />
<br />
-A spell that grants a unique proc to each mellee classes' weapon.  Warriors get some dd stun proc, rogues get a dd proc that spins the mobs back to him for a moment.  Things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you mean 15 here? heh<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think so!  Either that or in my world there are 100 seconds in a minute, not sure which!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is what i really really want:<br />
<br />
bih li : an upgrade to this really good spell , maybe somthing like 50-60 atk insted of the 20 atk<br />
<br />
dots: with the new dots we are kinda good off right now, but i would love to see us have a FR and CR dot also in the same range as bane.<br />
<br />
DD: a new PR DD with alot faster cast time then the stupid cold DD, and with a lower resist check.<br />
<br />
slow: i think the slow we got now is pretty ok, but would love the 60-65PCT DR slow ( I hate having to wait for tash and other stuff b4 i can get my slow in), i would not mind a long cast time on this as long as the resist check after decay was 99% sure that it sticks.<br />
<br />
Rapid bear: pls pls pls give us a decent mellee table, im getting really sick of not being able to use the rapid bear to anything....<br />
<br />
cure: would love to have a AE cure, that cures PR,DR,FR,CR and MR , i dont care about heal or mana regen just plain cure.<br />
<br />
canni: no need to change this if you have problem with your mana, play a cleric or druid.. they got their self buff thingies....<br />
<br />
pet: a better pet is always nice..., and a pet buff wold rock, so it could do somthing like the beast pet .. proc and stuff...<br />
<br />
heal: how i hate casting 1700 HP heal on a person with 10K hps... takes forever.... here we need a upgrade, i think a 3K heal that cost 500 mana but with a fast cast like SL would be cool.<br />
<br />
well this is just my 2 cp i maybe way off, but i think its akk doable without over powering the shaman, even more then he is today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Beastlords have some kind of AA ability that gives their pet a snare. I'm guessing its a proc. Was in LDoN the other night and our BST was our snarer. No reason why our class can't get something like that too.<br />
Be very careful about asking for highly specialized buffs to be used with the new melee system. I can imagine a situation where you would have to have 20 shaman along on every raid, each of which would be responsible for buffing certain melees in certain situations. We already have enough spells to swap out and adding more would not make my game experience any more enjoyable. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">we don't need the snare thing.<br />
Beastlords have to lose their pet DD + stun if they want to make it snaring, so they are using it only when there are no other snarer ( aka druid, ranger, SK, necro, wiz )<br />
<br />
<br />
/agree Henora on all the ideas<br />
Moreover, I think that we really need a sticky post <br />
where we must have proposed ideas for spells AA but where we couldn't reply like I am doing now because it tends to go out of the main subject.<br />
So let's have a sticky ideas for spells/AA and when we want to add another thing, what about doing a poll in another thread and if it is approved, move it in the main ideas ?<br />
Dunno if I have been clear enough hu hu :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Nerf BST slow to 50%, nerf chanter slow to 65%, give us an AA to reduce cast time on detrimential spells, give us canni 6 (upgrade to canni 4), a new (and good) bear form and i will be happy.<br />
<br />
None of this will happen, but since verant got it all wrong with sharing abilities trough different classes while giving some higher group desirability than us, i had to share my vent :p<br />
<br />
I recall someone saying to add dodge buff to agi, atk buff to str, reduce hate to cha buff and regen the new endurance with sta buff. That was a very good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmm everyone has different perspectives about how shaman class can be evolved. And so this thread really does not differ from the other 2. If this thread negates innovation then here are some suggestions;<br />
Group remove curse;<br />
Enhanced MGB, bring down to 36 mins, while introducing a new spell for shamans to MGB in fight.(for example pr/dr immunity for x seconds was an idea)<br />
An upgrade to Spirit Quickening, with a decent duration.<br />
Ferine Avatar with either enhanced duration or put onto an aa. Or possibly a group version.<br />
I would like new abilities that make Dots a more viable form of damage in groups,  ideas suggested on the other thread about crits etc.<br />
A group only castable 100 hp/tick heal+cure.<br />
Rabid Bear-decent reuse or allow ferine avatar to stack.<br />
However,<br />
I would like &quot;innovative&quot; new spells/abilities, like for example, pop, who would have speculated about getting a hound of dogs, that is innovation and was good.<br />
I would like enhancement to dots.<br />
I would like an extra raid appeal.<br />
I would like to save some spell gem slots.<br />
And yeah I agree some sort of enhancement buff to melee, which would reestablish our strengths as the best melee buffers.<br />
Ideally I would kinda want a revamp of the buffing system but thats not going to happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with the need for an improvement for Canni.  I've read in many places that the higher cost of many of our spells is justified by the shaman's canni spell, but canni is a pain (quite literally and figuratively) and manna regen is hardly unique to our class.<br />
<br />
Many classes have passive manna regens that do not require them to spend their time casting a spell over and over instead of doing something more useful (not to mention the cleric’s manna regen does not require hit points to work).<br />
<br />
Shoot even the canni effect of hit points to manna is not unique to shamans.  Mages get their rod, and necros can do the same thing.  I've never read that necros or mages need to have high spell casting costs to offset this ability.<br />
<br />
If shamans truly deserver to have crummy manna cost to effect spells because of the amazing power of canni, then I ask for a canni that is as unique and amazing as it once was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Give us the ability to summon rusty daggers, omg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/rant on<br />
<br />
Can you explain me why someone always ask for nerfs on the other classes ???<br />
<br />
Look like some will never learn...  :mad: <br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
<br />
New/upgraded spells :<br />
<br />
A Cani4 upgrade would be good. A really good upgrade should be the same Cani4 but passive like the necro/sk lich form. 148hps every ticks traded for mana  ;) (but knowing SoE, it won't be stackable with KEI or VoQ).<br />
<br />
If no upgrade so a new AA : Hastened Canibalization<br />
<br />
A new Cold DD more powerful of course and 2 new Poison DD. One to equal our actual 64th lvl cold DD and one to equal the new Cold DD. <br />
I never understood why our poison DD was always 1 rank weaker than the cold one. All shamans don't live in Everfrost  :( .<br />
<br />
New Dots, but no new kind of dots. We have magic, poison and disease and that's enough. Fire and Cold dots aren't our business ;). Funny to see Druids asking for poison/disease dots and Shamans for fire/cold dots :p <br />
<br />
A new pet (maybe 2 if SoE feel generous  :D ) and please SoE, give us some some good pet only buff like a FoS/SoW/Sltw buff who last 1 hour even if it cost 700 or 800 mana.<br />
<br />
Make our heals equals to the Druids'heals. It clearly NOT funny to heal for 1350 hps when Druids do it for mostly 3k at the same cast time/mana cost  :mad:, both Druids and Shamans AREN'T Clerics, but until Luclin, we were mostly equals in healing efficiency.<br />
Make them 20% more mana intensive if you want so it won't be overpowered with Cannibalization but give us GOOD heals.<br />
<br />
Give the new endurance recovery buff line to shamans. Physical/Statts buffs were always our jobs while Mind buffs were for Enchanters.<br />
Do it like the Clarity line. The main line to Shamans, and some weakers and stackables versions to others classes.<br />
Enchanters have VoQ, Beastlords have Spiritual Dominion and Druids have Protection of the Nine. Do the same and don't screw it as usual ;).<br />
<br />
A new Malosinia, not more powerful but a PBAoE Malosinia with the same resist/debuff str. Give it to mage too but not to one class or the other. It won't be fair at all.<br />
<br />
Change Tirgir's (old dreams :p). Just change it into a PBAoE, no other upgrade needed, but a PBAoE please.<br />
The only other slow I dream about would be a new disease based one (but still weaker than Turgur's ;)).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
New/upgraded AA :<br />
<br />
For Shamans only.<br />
<br />
Hastened Cannibalization<br />
3 ranks, 3/6/9 AA, decrease Cannibalization reuse time by 10/20/50%.<br />
<br />
Variant Cannibalization<br />
2 ranks, 5 AA each.<br />
rank one : allow to lower the amount of hps consumed up to 50% via a slide button.<br />
rank two : allow to upper the amount of hps consumed up to 200% via a slide button.<br />
keep the same hps/mana ratio.<br />
<br />
While a minority of shamans has some unbelievable ammount of hps self-buffed, for the large majority, a 2k hps hit is still dangerous.<br />
It will allow them to reduce the risk. They consume less hps, but recover less mana too.<br />
On the other side, for more AA (exp grinding and time sink), those with insane ammount of hps can choose to burn more hps for more mana. It's up to them.<br />
<br />
Mastered Cannibalization<br />
3 ranks, 3/6/9 AA, improve the hps/mana ratio by ... 2, 5 and 10% for ALL canibalization (spells and AA).<br />
<br />
Insect's Master :p<br />
3 ranks, 3/6/9 AA, reduce the slow mitigation by 10, 20 and 40%.<br />
It's NOT a slow upgrade, but a mitigation &quot;debuff&quot;.<br />
It wont do anything better on a mob who don't mitigate ;).<br />
But one thing who make me shiver is the total fiasco we had when SoE introduced the mitigation system.<br />
<br />
Force of Will (AA for all doters/debuffers classes)<br />
3 ranks, 3/6/9, reduce the check resist on any detrimental spells by 5/10/15%.<br />
Maybe too powerful ? :p <br />
<br />
Critical Doting (AA for all doters/debuffers classes)<br />
3 ranks, 2/4/6, work like critical DD, same % of critical doting, same ratio (33/66/100% critic) and all ticks increased the same manner.<br />
If the first tick is increased so are all the other ticks.<br />
Would stack with burning affliction and call of the muse.<br />
<br />
Extended Doting (AA for all doters classes)<br />
3 ranks, 2/4/6, increase the lenght of dots by 5, 10, 25%. Stack with extended affliction and such.<br />
Will work only on dots and not on debuffs.<br />
<br />
Access to spell casting subtetly (sp ?). <br />
Something who help us to reduce our hate generation is always welcome (and on a side note, I found pretty stupid to be summoned by a mob after 4 cold nukes when it's not me who debuffed it and the wizard next to me already did for about 15k of dmg  :rolleyes:.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">All excellent ideas Henora. I don't think there was a single bad suggestion in there. I'm glad you addressed the melee debuffing, because I think a lot of people associate us with just slowing. I've always considered one of our major strong points to be debuffs overall.<br />
<br />
I'm going to be redundant and say that I'd also like to see an upgrade to Bih'Li, although that is certainly not critical. Also, if they don't plan on making the changes to Avatar that Henora suggested, creating a group version, increasing the duration, or decreasing the recast time would all be a welcome change.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">First I really like the ideas about &quot;opening&quot; debuffs that increase the chance of an opening for melee players. Very clever. <br />
<br />
Here is what I would like to see:<br />
<br />
- &quot;opening&quot; debuffs, specifically in the form of 30-45 second curses and possibly combined with a DoT component. Possibly something that extends the &quot;opening&quot; window (hurrah, shamans slow down time). <br />
<br />
- Casting debuffs, basically a slow debuff that effects casting speed. Possibly in the form of a 30-45 second debuff/DoT curse. <br />
<br />
- New combined stat buffs, remove all 61+ stat buffs and replace with a single group combined stat buff boosting str sta agi dex and cha. Most players i see have maxed stats anyway. I'd rather have ONE buff to cast that covers everyone. <br />
<br />
- 50% PBAE slow upgrade to tirgirs<br />
<br />
- Group Torpor and Quiesence, leave the instant heals to clerics and druids<br />
<br />
- Canniibalize VI, a 400-500hp for 250-275 mana version of canni, for 61+<br />
<br />
- a dogdog upgrade that quads without weapons or a summon club spell</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'll post my thoughts later, as I am in a hurry, but Cannibalize IV should read: <br />
2.5 cast, 3.0 recast <br />
<br />
Feel free to delete this post after you read it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Well, I need to add something real quick. Your cannibalize VI looks good on paper, in practice it would hurt us more than it would help us, though.<br />
I don't know about you, but when I just cannibalize during downtime I chain press my hotkey in order to cast it *immediately* when it pops back up. <br />
If you had a 15 second recast on the new Cannibalize, you wouldn't be chain pressing your hotkey for 15 seconds(because it would obviously cause you carpal tunnel after a month), so that you willwait for it to pop before using it and losing precious seconds. My suggestion is to up the efficiency some(by increasing the mana, not lowering the HPs taken) or people will go back to Cannibalize VI for downtime mana regen.<br />
<br />
I hope i made the point clear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hmm everyone has different perspectives about how shaman class can be evolved.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's a little bit founder effect, followed by genetic drift, a bit of selection for homozygous bear with mutations, and random mating in a small population.  The genetic drift is enough that it no longer follows the Hardy-Weinberg law (sorry, Bio final thursday.  gah!!).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1 )Innate detrimental spell haste that stacks with existing items would be nice.  <br />
<br />
2) Anything to reduce recast times would be nice too.<br />
<br />
Our dps and ability to perform other combat functions like debuffing and buffing are largely limited by cast/recast times, not by mana.   Mana regen becomes moot when you can't get off enough spells to use the mana you have.<br />
<br />
The new melee ability endurance bar regen and size buffs should be our domain as well.  We have umpteen buffs that are supposed to make us the great melee buff class, but most of them do very little or nothing at all.  Attack buffs with real buff durations and recast would be a bonus too.  We need enough buff duties to make more than one shaman needed on raids and in guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">hmm, maybe give us the AA options that should have been there since the very beginning, specifically:  AA that reduces agro generated by the spells we cast, AA that makes our dots do critical damage, and AA that extends our dots duration.<br />
<br />
i like the idea of giving us dominion over the new endurance line, and about shifting our focus from stats to new melee areas like endurance, double attack, dual wield, openings, etc. but i think that any changes in this department need to come in the next 6 months - 1 year since the new system will no doubt be fubar.<br />
<br />
also like the idea of advancing cripple (since it's pretty much worthless in any xp group), as well as cani 6 (since cani 4 is just too slow and takes up entirely too much time).<br />
<br />
more than most other things, i want tanks &amp; hybrids to be able to both tank and hold agro.  what i can do in a group isn't usually limited by my mana, but by the amount of agro i generate before i pull the mob off the tank.  give tanks the ability to do their job.<br />
<br />
i want a lower resistance check on the bane line.  said it before it came out, and think it needs to change still.  we need a one dot that has a low resistance check, even if it has the higher mana cost and long recast.<br />
<br />
group buffs affecting pets in the same group is practical and should have been implemented from the very beginning of the game.<br />
<br />
the single version of khuras focus (lvl 60 grp focus) coming before we get the group version - maybe at lvl 58.<br />
<br />
they made a statement a long time ago about reducing the amount of lag &amp; processing taken up by eq.  everytime they put out a new expansion, this just becomes worse and worse.  seeing them make good on that statement would be nice.<br />
<br />
this would be nice, but possibly overpowering, but allowing our heal over time to stack with the cleric version...<br />
<br />
instead of putting out a new expansion, i'd pay money just to see more events happen on e'ci.  new quests, zone revamps, gm spawned mobs, taking old items we quested for (velious armor, epic, etc) and adding on to those quests (phylactery will get you nowhere) are ideas a thousand times better than adding more zones in my mind.<br />

They can't say it's too fast anymore, since horses and Bard castable selo's now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When you are on a raid, what non-buff spells do you cast most often?<br />
- Canni<br />
- Tnarg's<br />
- Turgur's<br />
- Malos/inia<br />
- Cripple<br />
- Various DDs and DoTs depending on the situation<br />
<br />
Malos - 65<br />
Malosinia - 63<br />
Tnarg's - 62<br />
Canni4 - 58<br />
Cripple - 53<br />

<br />
I really don't think that upgrades for our sub-60 spells would be out of the question. <br />
<br />
Henora's suggestions for Canni upgrades are excellent. I too would like to see it become more passive.<br />
<br />
I would like to see us get an upgrade to Cripple as well. Ideally I'd like to see us dig into a mob's ATK value and possibly stats. Someone else can debuff AC.<br />
<br />
Slow upgrades would be easy - lower recast time or innate resist adjustment would be the two that I'd like the most.<br />
<br />
A bigger incomplete heal would be nice too. I don't know anyone that still uses Kragg's at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I like the idea of buffs that affect the new melee stuff.  We will have to see exactly how that works to make specific suggestions, IMO.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a commonly available item that summons pet weapons/twink items.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a group PR/DR cure targetable on other groups (and MGBable).<br />
<br />
For god's sake no more stat buffs.  Maybe one more no-initial-DD dot, but it's pushing.<br />
<br />
A slightly more powerful CH would be nice.  Maybe 3k instead of 2k, even if it was a 50% CH (heals at most 50% of the max HP of the target).<br />
<br />
A pet buff that works.  Our pets need HP, ATK and damage mitigation to be useful in POP.  I'm not looking for a pet that can tank for me, but I would like to have one that can take aggro for 30 seconds until a real tank becomes available or until I get the mob rooted and back him off.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a shaman DA, in concept... but to keep it from being overpowered, what about a semi-DA?  Like a 1-second cast spell with a long recycle time that mitigates 50% (or 60% or 75%) of melee damage for a short time, but you can't cast during that time.  Make it an AA:<br />
<br />
   Level 1 - 2 AA - 30% mitigation<br />
   Level 2 - 4 AA - 40% mitigation, minor hate reduction<br />
   Level 3 - 6 AA - 50% mitigation, decent hate reduction<br />
<br />
SOME kind of group heal.  I am really gimped as a healer on raids with no group heal at all.  A 600-point quick-casting group heal would be VERY useful on some encounters.<br />
<br />
OK, here's a weird one.  You know how necros get to use corpses as pets, right?  Well... what if Shaman can cast on a PC corpse and SUMMON THEIR SPIRIT to fight.  The PC gets a dialog box, and if they click YES, they are transported to the corpse site with gear (but no buffs).   However, they are in spirit form and can't loot their own corpse.  The PC *is* in charge of the summoned spirit and can attack the mob, cast spells, etc (remembering however that they have no buffs).   They can't loot anything or participate in trades, and when the spell wears off, they go back to where they were summoned from.  OK, probably more programming effort than they will be willing to spend, but it would be cool and very shaman-like - not to mention useful in certain near-wipe situations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is sort of similar to Twoflower's idea, but it's one I've thought about some before... Something like a &quot;summon soul&quot; counterpart to the &quot;summon corpse&quot; necro spell.  Could have the same restrictions (grouped and in zone, although I'd prefer it if it worked across zones), and even a long reuse time so it's not used as a ghetto CoH.  But basically, you can target a PC corpse and summon the player to it.<br />
<br />
It just kind of fits in with my thinking of shamanly abilities, and would be very handy for those times when your cleric buys it deep in a dungeon.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Short term situational buffs along the lines of avatar could be used to improve stackability of shaman on raids, and provide general utility in group encounters on more difficult encounters. You can only go so far with regular buffs/debuffs, and frankly what we have so far doesn't really make for stackability for shamans.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
HP augment: 6 min duration, 500 hp<br />
AC augment: 6 min duration, 50 AC<br />
all resist augment: 6 min duration, 25 to all resists<br />
specific resist augment: 6 min duration, 50 to resist<br />
ATK augment: we allready have this<br />
hp regen augment: we allready have this<br />
mana regen augment: too overpowering<br />
<br />
These would all be scaled by level from, say, 50 - 65, and consume some reagent of suitable value to enforce their situational use. The size of the buffs is arbitary in the examples above, I'm not sure what values would be suitable.<br />
<br />
Likewise we could have similar short term debuff augments, but these would probably be less usefull since most fights are less than 6 minutes anyway. Perhaps some short term really massive debuffs, lasting 15-30 seconds for example, which could stack on regular debuffs, could be valuable.<br />
<br />
Another type of spell that could be interesting to use would be short term damage related augments, similar to BoV and PoC. These would operate on the principle of providing a buffed enhancement, such as AC or hp, that lasts until a certain amount of damage is taken.<br />
<br />
Speaking as someone who plays both a warrior and a shaman, I think that spells like these would provide shaman with far greater utility and make for much more interesting play at the high end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Insect's Master :p<br />
3 ranks, 3/6/9 AA, reduce the slow mitigation by 10, 20 and 40%.<br />
It's NOT a slow upgrade, but a mitigation &quot;debuff&quot;.<br />
It wont do anything better on a mob who don't mitigate ;).<br />
But one thing who make me shiver is the total fiasco we had when SoE introduced the mitigation system.<br />
<br />
Although I'm hoping for a wider gap on mitigation on our slows versus other class' slows, I was thinking along the lines of 5-10%.<br />
<br />
I can't decide if I want a AA ability to replace/upgrade canni4 or a ratio upgrade to canni5. How about both? But then again if they did this, would we be overpowered if we still wanted to mem canni4 and cast it between casts of canni6 and canni5?<br />
<br />
I'd definately be happy with either (upgraded canni5 or canni6).</div></div><hr />

2) Slow mitigation should be removed on all xp mobs.  Mitigation is a great idea on raid mobs.  On group mobs it decreases our desireability too much relative to the 37,000 other classes that can slow.  <br />

3) NO MORE DAMN SHORT DURATION BUFFS EVER.  The avatar line should be junked.  The best thing they could do to increase my quality of life in EQ is make a 10pp pottery combine that had unlimited self only clickable ferine avatar.<br />

Thanks, I fixed that.<br />
<br />
I don't know about you, but when I just cannibalize during downtime I chain press my hotkey in order to cast it *immediately* when it pops back up. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I do too, but only during downtime.  Could sit down and mem Canni4 and use them both.  So I worry about that being overpowered.  I've been thinking about the problems I have with Cannibalize for a long time and I haven't been able to come up with a solution I really like.  Greatly reducing the cast time, making it almost instacast, and then upping the HP/Mana returned would make it better. <br />
<br />
I have over 5000 mana with VoQ, and I am in a guild that's not even in VT, let alone elemental.  Take a look at some (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370869&amp;resize=true) of the (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260100&amp;resize=true)  time-equipped (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=569089) shamans (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217594&amp;resize=true), I wonder if they waste a spell slot on Canni anymore.  It reminds me of when we used to complain about healing 7k tanks with 300pt heals... instead we are trying to fill a 7k manapool, 84 at a time.   Canni4 was introduced when the best equipped of us had like 3500 mana.<br />
<br />
The game has evolved a lot, our mana pools have doubled in size since when Canni4 was introduced.  In Kunark and Velious, when Canni was designed, during raid encounters we fought one mob at a time.  Now our raid encounters often have a large number of mobs to fight at once.  We have to chain cast our debuffs and heals and don't have time to regain mana from standing around chain canni.  That's really all I am trying to say.  There's a lot of ways to fix it but I haven't found anything that sounds perfect.  I'd even be happier than now with a version that had basically the same mana return for the same HP, for the same total mana per minute, just condensed into 3-4 casts, instead of 10. Anyways...<br />
<br />
<br />
Supposedly openings were removed from test and melee will be able to use the abilities whenever endurance allows<br />
<br />
Well, if that's true, there goes that idea then.. the other ideas for Cripple line upgrade are still valid though.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Several other great ideas in there.  Druids have mass damage shield on their AA MGB'able heal.  Beastlords have mana regen in theirs.  Ximix mentions these and cures in his post.<br />
<br />
An AA Heal/Cure would be awesome.  Make it like radiant cure (removes detrimental, curse, disease, poison) plus a small heal over time, MGB'able!  Oohh fun heh.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Uggok, Shaman are designed around the concept of a character that derives its power from enhancing or diminishing others in combat, so whatever we get is going to be something along the lines of buffing/debuffing, with the odd underpowered nuke or dot thrown in. There is a limit to how big they can make debuffs (slow is a good example of this), or how large they can make buffs. The probability is that any new spells will simply be extensions of what we allready have, so they will not solve any problems that exist in terms of current gameplay. While a canni 5 (spell, not the aa) might appear to compensate for todays standards of hp/mana usage, I dont see very much more than incremental upgrades of what we have now. I doubt that there will be significant improvements in the dps from our nukes, or agro generation from our dots since that would start to impinge on the domain of the INT casters.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm pretty happy with Mok's utility in groups, there is allways stuff for a shaman to do there. In raids however, shaman are pretty boring to play if there are allready 2 or 3 other shaman present. They simply don't stack very well. In my case Mokara is an alt, so when I play him on raids he is way down on the list for chores due to his poor itemization. I imagine that is pretty common. If you are the #1 or #2 shaman in a raid, you are probably kept pretty busy, but if you are #3 or #4, there isn't a whole lot to do.<br />
<br />
That is the reason I suggested the short term buffs/debuffs as possible improvements. Having a number of these will keep quite a few shaman busy and depending on your numbers, require you to make strategic decisions on a real time basis, which is something shaman don't really need to do on raids currently if there are a bunch of them there.<br />
<br />
My main, Yella, frequently MAs for my guild, and believe me, in my opinion such spells would be very useful on a strategic basis, particularly in raids. We allready make heavy use of short term spells that other classes cast to enhance my tanking capabilities. If shaman are buff/debuff specialists, then they should get a lot of these sorts of spells for situational use.</div></div><hr />

I&quot;m weighing a can5 ratio upgrade with this....<br />

so at a progressed state in the game you could canni down 4500+ HPs in one cast, bringing back over 2K mana. Seems like a win for sony, as they could implement it and it would scale for a long time in theory.<br />

Debuffs, and our buffs should mean something, and yet everything now revolves around figures. Ie hit points. To make it worse, str means nothing, dex means nothing, agi means nothing.... Lol, I can suddenly see the appeal of a game like warhammer where figures will be most likely replaced with visual measures. And with this insight, I can kinda see the reason of buffs becoming more pleasing visually.Ie the change of spell effects on test.<br />
<br />
Or they should possibly give information about the mob, its atk etc, so debuffs can be shown what effect they do to other people than just the shaman who knows its &quot;-stats&quot;.  How can you manage something if you do not know what something does.  Ferine Avatar should mean something, in the same way hp means something on a raid. <br />
<br />
WHy have I gone on this rant? Dunno I too tired, I will edit this tommorow morning.<br />
Plus I forgot the point I was trying to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">[QUOTE='Ceno']Those all sound great, only thing I would ask to add is a get out of jail free card.  Something to take the heat off when you catch too much aggro. However it should be visually pleasing too.  A spirit form.  Immune from attacks for XXX duration. <br />
<br />
<br />
   This is the one I would vote for first. I would like this to act like invulnerability OR like feign death in which it resets all agro until it fades. That would give us a chance to reach a safe place on group / raid wipes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Short term situational buffs along the lines of avatar could be used to improve stackability of shaman on raids, and provide general utility in group encounters on more difficult encounters. You can only go so far with regular buffs/debuffs, and frankly what we have so far doesn't really make for stackability for shamans.<br />
<br />
Some suggestions:<br />
<br />
HP augment: 6 min duration, 500 hp<br />
AC augment: 6 min duration, 50 AC<br />
all resist augment: 6 min duration, 25 to all resists<br />
specific resist augment: 6 min duration, 50 to resist<br />
ATK augment: we allready have this<br />
hp regen augment: we allready have this<br />
mana regen augment: too overpowering<br />
<br />
<br />
This gets my vote for the absodamnlutely worst idea I've run across. Not even if they gave us another 8 spell slots just for buffs would I even want to contemplate the hassles of something like that. <br />
<br />
NO MORE SHORT TERM BUFFS!<br />
<br />
I like the idea of a big canni with a long refresh timer, would make our life a bit easier. I'd like to see a lower percentage lure based slow; 65%, 3 minute duration, -50mr maybe. Not that much more powerful than what bards currently have. Also, some type of heal and Quiessence upgrades although I'm one of those people that doesn't think our direct heals should be as powerful as a druid's. <br />
<br />
A group FA would also be nice (along with an AA to make group buffs stick on pets). Basically, anything that would get us away from the tedium of short term buffs. All the other stuff I can think of has been covered pretty well. Heck, we know it's just gonna be boring upgrades to spells we already have, originality with new spell ideas has never been one of SOEs strong points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Actually, Uggok, Shaman are designed around the concept of a character that derives its power from enhancing or diminishing others in combat<br />
<br />
Interestingly and contrary to popular perception, until the PoP expansion Shaman did rather little to enhance others powers in combat while raiding at all other than add a few hit points (much fewer than other classes).  Pre avatar, most shaman buffs except for haste (and, situationally, regen and dr/pr) were essentially worthless and, on raids, we didn't haste.  And, ancients aside, the avatar line was available as a weapon proc.  Now, there were always suckers who thought that those green numbers actually meant something, but I am talking about actual utility.<br />
<br />
There is a limit to how big they can make debuffs (slow is a good example of this)<br />
<br />
Obviously, which is why I suggested removing mitigation only on xp mobs.  I do not think that the cripple upgrade that Henora suggested is unworkable.  I would also not mind seeing some debuff along those lines with limited stackability.  We are primarily a debuffing class after all, debuffs are our raison d'etre.  Decent healing skills, some moderate damage dealing abilities, and some weak buffs are just side treats.<br />
<br />
The probability is that any new spells will simply be extensions of what we allready have, so they will not solve any problems that exist in terms of current gameplay.<br />
<br />
I think that just about everyone here knows deep down that all we'll see next expansion is group everlasting breath and a +80 DEX buff, so yeah.<br />
<br />
While a canni 5 (spell, not the aa) might appear to compensate for todays standards of hp/mana usage, I dont see very much more than incremental upgrades of what we have now.<br />
<br />
The gap between other classes mana regen and our mana regen has decreased dramatically, yet we are still saddled with outrageous spell mana costs.  One or the other should change.<br />
<br />
I doubt that there will be significant improvements in the dps from our nukes, or agro generation from our dots since that would start to impinge on the domain of the INT casters.<br />
<br />
I think we have a ways to go before we start taking jobs from necros, wizards, mages or charmchanters, but I agree that such increases should be moderate.<br />
<br />
In raids however, shaman are pretty boring to play if there are allready 2 or 3 other shaman present. They simply don't stack very well. <br />
<br />
This has always been an issue because we are primarily a debuffing class whose debuffs don't stack.  However, the situation on stackability is much better now than it ever has been before, due to:<br />
<br />
-better blast healing (presuming we get a linear upgrade to Tnargs) combined with more need for distributed healing (vs the &quot;all you need to do is the ch chain on the MA model)<br />
<br />
-nadox (which could be used more often)<br />
<br />
-moderate dps ability, albiet somewhat situational (our dps is very acceptable on a mob where you can chain tears/torrent effectively, not so much on high PR mobs or mobs where cc is going on close to the main target -- the main goal of my dd proposals is to make that slightly less situational).<br />
<br />
-turning us into twitch bitches is a lot worse than any of those options in my view.<br />
<br />
That is the reason I suggested the short term buffs/debuffs as possible improvements. <br />
<br />
I understand that is your motive and I think it is valid, but  I think you are underestimating the downside of your solution vs other possibilities.<br />
<br />
My main, Yella, frequently MAs for my guild, and believe me, in my opinion such spells would be very useful on a strategic basis, particularly in raids. <br />
<br />
Heh, pardon the tongue-in-cheek response, but I have no doubt that if I was the MA of my guild, I would think that having 10 buff whores eagerly servicing my needs every second of their existence with annoying short-duration buffs would sound like a pretty swell idea.  I have a SK alt myself, so perhaps I should suggest at the SK boards that SK's should be enhanced by turning them into shaman fellaters.  <br />
<br />
Or go poke your head into the Necro board and suggest that they should get zero dot or dd upgrades because they have more than enough power and stackability on raids already, because they can just twitch clerics all the time.  See what they think =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'll just cut and paste what the general consensus was on my thread.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.- Better Melee skills! Several different options have been put forward. Including 1) Better Bashing Skill. 2) The ability to either duel wield or double attack. 3) The ability to actually HIT STUFF! This may include a self ATK buff, or maybe at the very least lose our melee penalty. This would be good for all those extra shaman shuffling their feet at raids.<br />
<br />
2. - Alchemy - Forage herb or Droppable herbs (Made Perhaps NO DROP) and better potions. Any way that will actually make Alchemy something to use for profit. The ideas of making charms and fetishes is good and very role-playing, combing alchemy with other TS's is also good.<br />
<br />
3. - Do SOMETHING, ANYTHING! to make Rabid Bear appealing. Most are in favour of a complete overhaul. Perhaps wish No.1 could be brought into consideration. Oh and lose the hair-lip wookie illusion.<br />
<br />
4. - Better SLOW! Several ideas have been put forward, from unresistable 50% to a disease AE slow. Many, if not all of us feel this is one of our class defining skills, which is now available to pretty much every class in some form or other. We want something that really will give us back the title of KINGS of SLOW!<br />
<br />
5. - Better healing! The idea which seems to surface frequently is a group version of Q.<br />
<br />
6. - Critical DoTs! This is one we have a very strong argument for, we were seriously left behind when the critical AA's came about. How about something to put us back on par? Perhaps at the expence of losing our Crit DDs?<br />
<br />
7. - Summonable Pet Weapons! At the highest level of optermism, something that procs Snare! However most of us would settle for 'Summon Rusty Dagger'.<br />
<br />
8. - Improved Invis! We're tired of getting caught with our kilts down!<br />
<br />
9. - AE Malo! We all want it, and it's fair enough!<br />
<br />
10. - Casting Sublety! Need we say more.<br />
<br />
11. - IMPROVED BUFFS! Our other class defining skill is also limited these days. Everyone and their auntie in the high end game has maxed buffs. The idea of secondary stats on buffs is a good one, adding atk, regen, dodge modulation, etc. Endurance buffs also.<br />
<br />
12. - New Canni! Don't get us wrong, Canni 5 is great, but the normal canni (canni IV) just doesn't cut it anymore. We'd like to see something which has a quicker casting time and preferably gives us more mana too.<br />
<br />
15. - New Cripple (Paralyse perhaps). Something that actually has a noticeable effect.<br />
<br />
17. - A decent Pet-Only buff that LASTS! Having to rebuff our pet with several different spells all the time is anoying. Giving us something that gives our pets a proper HASTE, Melee buffs, HP's and SoW would be a good place to start.<br />
<br />
16. - Finally many of us just want to see SOMETHING NEW! We're tired of continually getting simple upgrades of our old spells EVERY EXPANSION! Suprise us! Give us something new and Unique!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Upgrade Canni 4:  make it short term Canni over time like necro lich,  better ratio 160 hp, 90 mana per tick for 1 mins, CANNOT CAST Canni 4 AT THE SANE TIME, won't be over power, but save shaman from chain click Canni 4 during breaktime.  <br />
<br />
Upgrade pet buffs: Spirit Quickening is totally unused spell for shaman, <br />
Make it longer duration like 30 mins ~ 1 hours, 50% haste will be much useful<br />
<br />
Upgrade Rabid Bears: Change it into a Targetable Player/Pet Melee buffs, change its proc to stun + dd,  Cancel its 99% haste, Reduce reuse time to 1 hour, its good to boost member dps for short term</div></div><hr />

2) One-or-the-other defensive buffs.  You can either get +10% mitigation cast on you or +10% avoidance, not both (or 5% or whatever).  Situational buffs are fine, as long as it's a situation that actually occurs sometimes and the buff lasts for more than 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
3)  Double attack.  I'm tired of being out-meleed by clerics that are only three apples high, it's embarassing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Lots of really good ideas here.  Some are way above my level, so i won't comment.  This is an area that is kinda tough to decide what is good and what is bad though, because of several reasons.  Mainly, because most people want something a little different (as these posts prove), and we don't want to become too overpowered as a class.  Also, I noticed that 99% of the posts here deal with high end abilities or spells.  That seems to be all right for now, since I rarely, if EVER, find a true newbie anymore.  Just an observation :).<br />
<br />
I really found some ideas interesting, such as the summon PC spirit idea.  Maybe like a revive with no exp return, but still allows the corpse to be rezzed.<br />
<br />
Alchemy (my personal hell) still needs retooling IMHO.  I posted on this quite a few months ago in an angered, barely legible rant (as many others had before me).  Would be nice if the majority of our potions were useful and semi-fiscally feasible.  I can understand that they don't want potions to take the place of spells, but make alchemy more than SoW, Shrink and Invis to Undead potions plz.<br />
<br />
Seen quite a few people talk about Canni.  I am 57 with Canni III, so I don't know about Canni IV and so on.  But, how about a spell, ability or discipline to meditate where mana regen increases by an amount more than normal meditation.  While using this ability you are not able to do anything else such as stand, walk, move or cast (like normal meditation but for a set period of time), and there is a short lived after effect, such as slows movement rate, can't cast anything for xx seconds, decreases AC, AGI and DEX.  Can be given at a lower level (30-ish) and mana regen increases with level.  Kind of like a short term Clarity with effects of Stoicism.  Just a thought.<br />
<br />
I also like the upgrade to Spirit Quickening idea.  Let's make it last a little longer.  And AoE cures/malo's sounds great to me.  As well as a Group Heal and a little more healing power.<br />
<br />
I'm probably way off base in my ideas, but why not post them?  lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">What's needed, IMO:<br />
<br />
Aggro reducer: Anything. Every class that has aggro issues has already means to reduce aggro, except shamans. Time to either fix DoT aggro or give shamans means to reduce it themselves.<br />
<br />
New slow: same %, negative resist modifier, no recast time, fast cast time. We should be the KINGS of slowing again. Bards are jack of all trades masters of none, give us a real PBAE slow. Again, this to reclaim the title of KING of slowing.<br />
<br />
New cannibalize. Our mana regen has not been upgraded for ages, while every other class had it's mana regen upgraded (directly or indirectly). <br />
<br />
Group heal over time (the best single target currently available).<br />
Group Avatar (the best single target currently available).<br />
Group Haste (the best single target currently available).<br />
<br />
Since stat buffs are now utter crap in endgame thanks to everyone and his mother being capped, give us buffs that actually do something. Add different skill modifiers to our stat buffs (% dodge, % parry, % strikethrough, % shielding ... etc).  Melee should drool all over our buffs.<br />
<br />
Better fast heal.<br />
<br />
Bonus stuff, fluff, pipe dreams, nice to have:<br />
<br />
Make Rabid bear actually usefull, reduce re-use timer.<br />
AE Malos.<br />
AA skill Malos or LDoN buyable right click Malos augment. <br />
Improved invisibility.<br />
Self buff with passive mana regen (Form of Really Ancient Bear).<br />
Put every single stat buff + HP from Talisman line on Focus of Something, make it group version too.<br />
Make Voice of the Berserker line into something actually ... useful. Same thing with our AC buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
one in ten, as I see it.  <br />
<br />
Yet this always seems to get near the top of the list of &quot;consensus items.&quot;  Why?  <br />
<br />
Frankly, I have no plans to buy Rabid Bear until I have something like 300 AA (and that assumes no interesting new AA come out in the meantime).  I would love to go back to being a &quot;battle priest&quot; but I don't see Rabid Bear as ever being more than an amusement.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I vote for Henora's list, and I like Ceno's idea, too.<br />
<br />
I vote against including any mention of Rabid Bear on a shaman wishlist.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">My suggestions:<br />
<br />
Shamans, as many have stated before me, need to reclaim the throne as the BEST slower and not just on paper. So, assuming Sony doesn't want to increase the % on our Slows, something else needs to be done.<br />
Increase our flexibility and versatility in it.<br />
<br />
1) Give us an AA skill that when activated will enable us to choose what resist our next Slow will check against. OR make it automatically check vs. the lowest resist of the target.<br />
Reuse - 7:30 mins<br />
<br />
2) Give us an AA that lowers the resist check for our Malxxx and Slow line for 10/25/50 or make it an innate skil that scales with levels to adress our expertise and proficiency in this field<br />
<br />
Expand the Malise line:<br />
<br />
1) Give us a &quot;Malu&quot;(unresistable, -70) and add &quot;Malosinu&quot;(Yeah I suck at making up names, resistable, -85)<br />
<br />
2) Malous(PB AE, unresistable, -45)<br />
<br />
Add an ability that will give me the possibility to cheat death for a few seconds or when lucky to avoid it completely, if my groupmembers are on their toes<br />
<br />
1) &quot;mens sana ex corpore insano&quot;(Make me temporarily invulnerable to incoming &quot;melee&quot; attacks&quot;, while placing a DoT on me for the duration(The Shaman drifts partially into the spirit world, which seperates him from his physical body. The signs of the permanent (ab)use of his powers are evident The spirit can't control this this while gone.<br />
<br />
Make this last for a max duration of 6 ticks+ SCR/M. Make it impossible to dispell, but leave the Shaman susceptible to detrimental spells(no heals except Div. Arb.) and stunned, as his spirit is still linked to the body, but that's not enough to control it or perceive physical harm.<br />
<br />
The DoT should do 1200 dmg per tick and be &quot;off clickable&quot;. More powerful Shamans(read: more HPs) can endure this for a longer period than others do. The Stun will prevent the Shaman from &quot;camping off&quot; while in this state.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
<br />
1) Shamans need a Groupquiescence(we were the first class to get this type of heal spell and it has a limited use. When you don't want to resort to MGB'ing Heals over Time or put a cleric in each group for those highly damaging AE encounters, you will be able to somewhat, albeit not as good as a cleric with Sup Elixier+, handle the regeneration). We are no clerics, so we won't ask for a GroupDirectHeal<br />
<br />
2) A single Heal over Time upgrade to Quiescence AND Torpor. The upgrade to Q should be 4 x 500(325 mana), while Torpor should be 4 x 800(400 mana, same side effects)<br />
<br />
DoTs<br />
<br />
1) Our DoTs lack an innate resist modifier, thus on raids I am often the one not able to land spells after full DEBUFFING. <br />
But not only on raids. In a normal groupsetup, and after everyone has put their debuffs on, the Shaman is the one that is penalized for his ability to debuff the target's resist by having the worst odds landing his DoTs(his primary mean of doing damage), due to the lack of any sort of resist adjust.<br />
Example: Bane(Shm 64)http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live vs. Horror(Nec 63) http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4098&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Horror has a magic -30 resist check, while Bane has none(magic +/- 0)<br />
<br />
So in a group with my Necro friend, I will cast Malos, then Malosinia, debuffing the target's resist by 70. Now I've spent a lot of mana on debuffing the magic resist of this particular mob, but when both, the Necro and Me, cast our respective DoTs, the Necro will have an easier time landing his than I do landing mine. <br />
So I end up spending 3 times the mana to find myself getting resisted.<br />
<br />
and finally &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; mana regen and issues that derive from it<br />
<br />
Ever since the beginning the Shaman class has been able to turn HPs into Mana, but he has also been the only one to had to actively do so in order to regain mana at a faster speed. In the early days the gap between &quot;active&quot; and &quot;passive&quot; mana regen was large enough to look at it as &quot;convenient&quot;, but this has changed over the years and TIME has become the biggest enemy of my Shaman.<br />
<br />
Today, the passive mana regen through buffs, Focus effects, gear AND the nature of the fights has made it so, that the higher end caster will not run OOM anymore...unless you are a Shaman. <br />
The Shaman class is balanced with Cannibalize in mind, which means that unless I am using it, I am running OOM due to the inefficient spells I cast. <br />
Casting Cannibalize takes 6 seconds(with spell gem refresh) and you pretty much have to cannibalize between EVERY cast to make the next spell you cast as efficient as that of another caster, practically adding a full 6 seconds to the cast time of every spell you use. This is a major problem. The fights just don't last forever anymore, so that i am basically stuck with being a &quot;SLOW&quot; guy and being much less effective than another class witout the ability to Cannibalize.<br />
<br />
I'll try to clarify the problem with active mana regen and Cannibalize specifically:<br />
A few weeks ago, we cleared Vex Thal with a small crew of people(between 12 and 18) and often the &quot;boss fights&quot; would be lasting 10 to 15 minutes. Now this, nowadays, IS considered a damn long encounter.<br />
<br />
I was easily the best equipped caster present and using my Rain spells and DD I was trying to test my overall damage compared to other casters in a &quot;long&quot; fight, as I am certainly aware that the Shaman shouldn't come close to the &quot;burst&quot; damage of a Wizard or Mage and I was pretty confident that 15 minutes were enough to call this a &quot;non burst&quot; damage fight.<br />
Unfortunately, using my highest DPS spells for the whole fight(I was chain casting and alternating Tears of Saryrn and VS with a 35% cold damage focus), I was finding myself at the bottom of the Damage parse each and every fight.<br />
Now consider that I have every AA I can possibly get at this point and that my gear was superior to everyone's casters there. I had the best mana regen buffs available and I was using a horse. More than once would i have a &quot;perfect run&quot;(read my last nuke would hit a second before the mob died and I'd be out of mana).<br />
<br />
Now I ask you, how long does a fight have to last before my active mana regen ability outweighs the passive one nowadays? <br />
Balancing an aspect on paper is certainly different. I will have to cast spells continually and I can't(not even in a 15 mins fight) afford to waste time on Cannibalize *just* to find myself on par with another caster in the end. Cannibalize shouldn't be exclusively superior when it comes down to &quot;down time&quot; mana regen, thus it needs to be improved and here are my suggestions:<br />
<br />
1) Cannibalize VI:<br />
<br />
This should be an AA to get around the 2.25 second spell refresh.<br />
<br />
Cast time : 2 seconds<br />
Converts 120 HPs into 60 Mana<br />
<br />
2) Cannibalization upgrade through new AAs that will cut down on the Canni V timer 10/25/50%<br />
<br />
3) An AA that increases the magnitude of all Cannibalize spells(including Can V and Can VI by 10/25/50%</div></div><hr />

Why smaller than we have now?  Would have to chain cast it even longer! :(   Chain casting tiny spell =bad, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This may sound bad, but this would seperate the lazy(or boxxed) Shaman from the efficient Shaman. <br />
Besides, many times I find myself in a situation were I chain cast 1 or 2 spells over and over. These are the situations where using this ability between casts(during the spell refresh, just like Wizards use their concussion pants between chain nuking), would enable you to sustain your job for a longer period of time.<br />
<br />
Henora, I like your idea of having fewer casts of bigger Cannis(hence my suggestion to decrease the recycle time and increase the magnitude of Canni V in 2) and 3), as this would adress both our concerns), but I think that it would be detrimental in the long run as it would be too static for me. And I seriously hate having to mem a spell that is greyed out 75% of the time.</div></div><hr />

I didn't forget! :)   I just don't have anything new or interesting to say about it.  Some others have brought up some nice ideas that would combine a blood of nadox style cure with a group heal that could be really nice and I wouldn't have thought of!</div></div><hr />

I agree we need a smaller canni for 'spot cannibalizing' in addition to c5. Something that chews around 200-400 HPs would be ideal like you posted earlier.<br />
<br />
Oh god please no. If I wanted to float, I'd cast lev. Floating is the suck. Upgrade to bhali? Sign me up.<br />

agreed. SoE/FoE needs to stay with rangers/druids. I abhor floating. An upgrade to Billy (Spirit of Bih'li) seems like a logical idea. Maybe it has been delayed because Shamans being able to buff ATK by 160 is too powerful?<br />
<br />
I must admit that I *love* in a group, after a druids casts FoE, to say, 'inc billy' and am delighted to see so many people click foe for it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Since it doesn't look like they are raising the level to 70 (thank god) and they didn't put a large emphasis on spells in the description I'm guessing there will be around 10-15 new spells for each class.  It is hard to say what upgrades I want when I have no idea what other classes will be getting but here goes.<br />
<br />
Bane 2 - 550 per tick, 610 mana.<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn 2 - 420 per tick, 670 mana with decreased hate.<br />
<br />
Velium Strike 2 - 1400 damage, 375 mana, 6 second cast<br />
<br />
Canni 4.5 - 300 hit points for 168 mana<br />
<br />
Focus of the Seventh 2 - 800 hitpoints, 90 str, 85 dex, and just add the <br />
<br />
Talisman of Celerity - Group 60% haste, 36 minute duration<br />
<br />
Talisman of Ferine - 700 mana, exactly the same as FA but group<br />
<br />
Tnargs Mending 2 - 1800 healed, 550 mana, 3.5 cast<br />
<br />
Talisman of Quiescence - Group Q, 800 mana<br />
<br />
Quiescence 2 - 500 heal per tick, 325 mana. <br />
<br />
Spirit of Bih'li 2 - Increase the movement speed to 60%, increase the attack to 30 and increase the duration to one hour.<br />
<br />
Not an extremely creative or exciting list but those are 10 spells I'd like to see upgraded.  In regards to other classes I'd like to see us somewhat catch up a little in nuking power as dots are more often than not unuseable.  As it is now our best nuke is 175 behind the next to last priest/int caster nuke not to mention our cast time and ratio is considerably worse.  In terms of dots I'm fine where we stand, slightly below necros and ahead of druids.  <br />
<br />
As far as heals go I'd like to see us closer to clerics in single target and group HoTs.  I don't see a problem having a group HoT that 3 classes already have as good or better than.  I don't care at all for CH's.  I don't want to be on a rotation and I can't stand casting a spell for 10 seconds.  Our quick heal could use an upgrade, however.  More hitpoints healed and at least come close to the mana to hp healed ratio of the druids quick heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">OK, here's a weird one. You know how necros get to use corpses as pets, right? Well... what if Shaman can cast on a PC corpse and SUMMON THEIR SPIRIT to fight. The PC gets a dialog box, and if they click YES, they are transported to the corpse site with gear (but no buffs). However, they are in spirit form and can't loot their own corpse. The PC *is* in charge of the summoned spirit and can attack the mob, cast spells, etc (remembering however that they have no buffs). They can't loot anything or participate in trades, and when the spell wears off, they go back to where they were summoned from. OK, probably more programming effort than they will be willing to spend, but it would be cool and very shaman-like - not to mention useful in certain near-wipe situations.<br />
<br />
This is very similar to what I was thinking about for an AA ability. <br />
<br />
Call it something like &quot;Vengeful Spirit&quot; make it only usable on members of your group/raid.  Instead of making the player control their spirit it could just act on its own, only attacking the creature that killed it and once the creature is dead it would disipate as it has exacted its revenge.  Would act in a manner expected from the class of the corpse, would NOT push if it was a melee and each corpse could only be used once.  You would be able to cast this on as many corpses as you have available but the spirits cannont be buffed or healed.  Essentially it would only be really useful for raiding, an area where we definitely need to contribute more to DPS.<br />
<br />
If the new melee system is going to use an endurace bar of some description I would like to see Shamans and ONLY Shamans given a regen list for this new bar, like chanters get for mana.<br />
<br />
As far as slows go I would like to se a 50-60% upgrade to Cloud of Grummus.<br />
<br />
Canni IV upgrade I would rather have a Canni DoT, say 300HPs per tick for 30 secs so that I can do more with my time that repeatedly hit my hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>zensation</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">I feel that the shamans roll is to improve the group (haste/stats/hp) and to debuff the enemy (slows/stats/ect). The problem with this is that our debuffs seem to have little effect. Any improvement on this would be great, something like -Atk or some sort of &quot;mute&quot; type spell that would prevent casting for a short time. When I play I mostly duo with a friend, but since Ldon has come out i find myself in many pick up groups. The one thing i hear the most is &quot;haste dropping&quot; or &quot;haste plz.&quot; im not trying to start some crazy flame war about it but having the duration of the haste extended would be nice. Also, instead of having the +Atk being on the SoW, it seems like +Atk would be better suited with haste. I would really like to see a haste and +Atk type spell similar to HoS/FoS, similar duration and it wraps up a couple of things into one slot. I dont think this is too outrageous. Also the thoughts about our group spells affecting our pets is a great idea, but what if we took it one step further. What if we had a set of spells that would buff the Pets of our group members. Grouping with mages/beasts/necros is an everday occurance. It would increase atk/haste and maybe AC and be stackable with the current buffs that each class has for their pets. It seems like it would be a good line that we wouldnt have to worry about beggars. The nature of pets to poof at zone will prevent this, ie no random begs for it in PoK. Our current haste line goes up to Swift, but our group version only goes to alacrity, an improvement in this is definately a good idea. That goes for pretty much all of our buffs. We have group versions of spells that have limited use (cha) and dont for versions that would greatly improve our desirability, such as the Avatar line. Finally, I really dont feel that nerfing anyone for any reason to make our class more appealing is the answer. It just causes more greif for the other people out there and that bat will be coming around again and might just strike us in the crotch. So to recap....<br />
<br />
1) Make our Debuffs worthwhile (-Atk or mute) <br />
2) Add a +Atk/haste talisman type spell<br />
3) Pets not only included in group spells but have a stackable pet buff line<br />
4) Group versions of our more usefull buffs (avatar) and upgrade the level of the ones we have (haste) <br />
<br />
I tried to make resonable requests with out infringing on other classes domains. I really doubt that we would get summon anything for pets (mages would go ape) and increasing our dmg output seems like it would be stepping to close to the line that we and beastlords share. Increased slow % most likely wont happen in this expansion (if ever) but an increased disease slow seems likely. I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cited from: http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/classes.jsp<br />
&quot;Shamanic magic has two main focuses - enhancing the mind and body of the shaman's allies, and weakening or damaging their enemies.&quot;<br />
<br />
further down also:<br />
<br />
&quot;The weakening and damaging spells in the shaman's arsenal are tremendously effective in battle. The shaman attacks his enemies with diseases and poisons that cause massive damage over time, while using cold and ice magic to inflict damage directly.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think were still waiting on that mind enhancement spell :) (besides the potion).<br />
<br />
a. FA upgrade to make the spell more convenient to use (i.e. group version)<br />
b. A upgrade to our DoTs (crit affliction etc)<br />
c. A upgrade to the evocation line.<br />
<br />
Candy for me would be:<br />
<br />
a. can5 upgrade<br />
b. pet buff<br />
c. group 60% haste<br />
d. endurance regen</div></div><hr />

AA or Spell To convert our HP to mana for our target.  Kinda like a Canni Other.  For fairness would cost a small bit of mana to so to say to form the bond to make the transefer.  Would be simular but not as effective as say the necro's transfer mana spell.  I dont know how many times I have sat FULL MANA health and had to wait eons for everyone else to mana back up.  This is even after rebuffing everyone.  Would be another option for us.  Though I really dont ever see tht happening for shaman.  And would really hate to turn our selves into mana batteries for some caster.  Just there are times I feel I'm just wasting mana.  Hell when I'm casting 1300 heals on warrior with only 400 damage done to them becuase I'm full mana and health and want / need to get rid of mana its truly sad.  Would be nice to be able to do something bit better withit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Splitzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">A lot of the ideas here got me thinking.  Here's a rather longish listing of the results.<br />
<br />
Possible Spell Ideas: <br />
<br />
Spiritual Restraints - Single target melee debuff<br />
Reduces melee damage by 10% (something that normally hits for 1000 would only hit for 900).  The system to do this is in place (think a reverse Bulwark of Vie).<br />
<br />
Emasculate - Single target melee debuff<br />
-10% chance to dodge, parry, riposte<br />
<br />
Turgur's Curse - Single target debuff<br />
Turgur + Cripple: 75% slow, decrease dex by 70, agi and str by 80, and ac by 34.  Same as Turgur's Insects for all other details, including agro.<br />
<br />
Tigur's Insects - AE (or PBAE) slow<br />
60% slow, -300 hate (so you don't get creamed after you cast)<br />
<br />
Malosi - AE (or PBAE) unresistable resist debuff<br />
-45 to all, 700 mana.<br />
<br />
Speed of the Srerendi  -  Group Haste<br />
60% haste, 50atk.  Slightly less haste than Vallon's Quickening, more atk.  Lasts 36 minutes.<br />
<br />
Shard of Sorrow - Single target poison DD<br />
850 damage, 350 mana.  Fast cast like Spear of Torment.<br />
<br />
Winter's Fury - Single target cold DD<br />
1300 damage, 400 mana.  Slow cast like Velium Strike.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Vorladien - Group Atk/movement buff<br />
Increase movement by 60%, +25atk, +5% chance to double attack<br />
<br />
Frenzied Avatar - Group short duration melee buff<br />
+160atk, +10% chance to hit, double attack, and dual wield.<br />
Henora's ideas for this one were so great, I'm not even going to try to improve on it.<br />
<br />
Clairvoyance - Eye of Zomm style thing<br />
Just a scouting type spell.  If anybody is going to have an out of body experience, it should probably be a shaman.  No graphic placeholder (like zomm's visible, killable eyeball) so raid leaders can't fuss at me for playing.  Or if you have to have an avatar for it, make it a willowisp.<br />
<br />
Spirit's Anger - Pet only buff<br />
60% haste, +50 atk, +80 Str/Dex, +400 hps, adds a 100 hp Cold DD proc.  30 minute duration, stacks with Focus.  <br />
This might be a bit over the top, but I wanted to get a lot of possible ideas included for thought.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize V - Upgrade to Canni4<br />
Turns 296 hps into 164 mana.  Same ratio as Canni4, same upgrade progression as from canni 3 to 4.<br />
<br />
AA's<br />
<br />
Halcyon - Group heal over time <br />
300 hit points per tick, lasts 6 ticks.  Can be MGB'd.  30 minute refresh time.<br />
<br />
Call Spirit - Summons a player to their corpse (works across zones).  <br />
A longer refresh should hopefully keep this from being overpowering.<br />
<br />
Hastened Cannibalization - Cuts refresh time on Cannibalization by 15%, 25%, and 50%.<br />
--or--<br />
Greater Cannibalization - Converts 75% of your current hit points into mana at a ratio of 1.8 hps to 1 mana.<br />
I can't remember who's idea this was, but it sounds great.<br />
<br />
Critical Affliction - Dot crits<br />
Looks like this one might be going in already, so I just stole the name.  Personally I hope it's a chance each tick, but that's been covered in another thread.<br />
<br />
Spirit Walker - Self only hate debuff/movement buff<br />
Drops you on all hate lists in the same style as a rogue's Evade skill, increases movement by 115%, turns your character transparent, like our wolf pets.  Basically Spirit of Cheetah with a hate debuff and eye candy built in.  18 second duration, 1 second cast time, 15 minute refresh (like DA).  Ceno gets credit for the original idea on this.<br />
<br />
Cannibalization Mastery - Boosts effeciency on all canni spells.<br />
Three levels, 10%, 15%, 25%.  I'm not sure if this is possible with the  way spells seem to be grouped together, but I like the idea.<br />
<br />
Quick Torment - Lowers cast times on all detrimental spells with a duration.<br />
Three levels: 2%, 5%, 10%.  Same idea as the Druid/Wizard's Quick Direct Damage ability.  This should probably go to Necros as well.<br />
<br />
Cleansing Aura- PBAE Cure<br />
Removes 72 curse, disease, poison counters.  Removes detrimental effects like Radiant Cure.  Radiant Cure 3 as a prerequisite.  15 minute refresh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">I suppose that its dreaming, but lets look at maybe making Focus of the 7th a real upgrade.....for clerics, their best hit point buff at level 60 is Blessing of Aegolism (1150 hit points and 60 Ac) with their best buff at 65 being Hand of Virtue (1405 hit points and 72 Ac). For Druids at level 60 its Protection of the Glades (485 hit points and 24 Ac with a 6 mana per tick regen) and at 65 its Blessing of the 9 (618 hit points 32 Ac and 8 mana per tick regen).<br />
Now we come to shaman Khuras Focusing is 445 Hit points and 67 Str and 60 Dex; our upgrade is Focus of the 7th which is 544 hit points and 75 str and 70 Dex.<br />
Talk about a rude gesture. 99 more hit points and a few more points of dex/str that no one really needs at level 65. Toss us a bone here, give it some ATK componant, hit point regen, hell I would even say some Ac....but something other than more buffs to nearly useless stats.<br />
Also a self only regen spell, wether it be mana or hit points; nearly all other hybrids and priest classes get some sort of passive mana regen spell, I can see why giving that to us would be a Bad Thing, but would a self only regen buff that gives say 35/tick be so broke? lasts say an hour and bounces replenishment? Heck make it give UV and See Invis to top it off and my day would be set. Oh yeah and make it a VENDOR SPELL so I dont have to fool with MORE runes and MORE BoT named or MORE jerks in bazaar that make shaman spells 20-30k more than they are worth.<br />
Plus make our Berserker line of spells give some atk componant to us when we use them and place us on a different melee table or make us at least have access to double attack via AA like bards and beastlords do.<br />
Its clear that of all the priest classes that were meant to be more melee oriented; looking at our buffs and skill caps shows that; if that is the case then why in the hell dont we get something that makes that useable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">You deserve getting flamed in all honesty. Posts like yours are one of the reasons we haven't been getting mana regen upgrades. The Devs must be thinking our mana regen is just fine or actually too good.<br />
<br />
I tell you it is NOT.<br />
<br />
The reason we have not gotten upgrades is that we attually have quite  good mana regen better then most classes.  I know only two other classes that uses mana regularly that when KEI drops dont start whinning.  One is Chanter as the can cast it on them selves. The second is necros with thier lich spells that are attually better then KEI but does not stack.  Our mana regen is very good it just requires active work to maintian it.  WHAT we do have problem with is because our mana regen is so good is that our spells cost tons more mana then simular spells from another class.  Even right now with my current gear which is truely lacking in many areas Its a VERY rare day I am the person holding up pulls or others waiting on mana.  There are exactly 3 reason I will not have mana.  1. I just got rezzed 2. I just buffed a full group of meele 3. I have been pulling, slow, and healing my group.  For the third reason I ussually get that way as I am not paying close attentoin to my mana bar as I am trying to keep a mob in camp at all times.  Our mana regen takes work unlike every other class in this game.  For those out that that work at it and work hard our regen rate is termindous.  I know currently I could be doing even more then I am now but I do tend to like to just relax at times too.<br />
<br />
Oh and about the Dev's well all I can say is 80% I would guess only know what they can see on thier slide shows every at every monday morning briefing.  The other 20% probley do have clue but as things stand right now I highly dought that 20% has much say in what happens and the policies with the game at this time.  And there are far too many varibles for any class related issues be translated to the slide show form.  Those classes the dev's attually play are the ones you will find the most balanced.  [doh.... I'll close my yap now :D]</div></div><hr />

Take a look at some (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=370869&amp;resize=true) of the (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=260100&amp;resize=true)  time-equipped (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=569089) shamans (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=217594&amp;resize=true), I wonder if they waste a spell slot on Canni anymore.  It reminds me of when we used to complain about healing 7k tanks with 300pt heals... instead we are trying to fill a 7k manapool, 84 at a time.   Canni4 was introduced when the best equipped of us had like 3500 mana.<br />
<br />
I'm sitting at just around 7k mana and I do not mem canni4 when i'm fighting in a raid environment.  Raiding.. it's more efficient for me to keep focus (if we are in a place where alot of people will poss. die and we need to get them back and buffed quickly) or some form of dmg spell memmed if we are killing some god.  Right now, with 8 gem slots, I'm rotating the dmg that I do to mobs through Bane, Rains, Velium Strike, and sometimes even Torrent of Poison.. all the while getting all mobs malosed and slowed, keeping all viable rogues/rangers FAd, and healing whatever it is that looks like they need a heal.  I don't have room to keep canni up (and I have a TA so slow isn't even memmed) nor do I have the time to keep sitting there chain casting it.  I will pop canni5 every time that the icon refreshes and hit the mana rod whenever I can, as well as stay on my horse in bard range if i don't need to be moving around alot.  <br />
<br />
So, needless to say, an upgrade to canni4 would be a nice welcome addition for me.  I will once in a while pop canni4 out and use it once or twice, but normally with everything that I'm doing during a raid, i don't have the time nor patience to sit there and chain it.  The only time is maybe when I get a rez and need to get back into the fight quickly.  <br />
<br />
I will say that having an MGB attack increaser would be a welcome addition along the lines for a short amount of time.  Also I agree that something along the lines of a hate decreaser is needed.  When I can keep agro for 50% of the duration of a fight using only one slow without a prior malos, then that doesn't help my ability to put out any form of dmg in a group, other than the extra attack they get from using my FA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">I admit that I only read the first page (I'll read the rest some other time) so if any of these have been previously stated, I appologize.  Just posting 10 for now.<br />
<br />
1.  An AA that either sucks all of our remaining mana and divides it evenly through the group (similar to a cleric's Divine Arbitration).  Melee, not having a mana bar, would just be sucking up some mana.  Give it similar drawbacks to Divine Arb per rank (rank 1/50% 2/75% 3/100% or something).<br />
<br />
2.  An AA that reduces slow resists (yeah been stated!)... what I recommend is rank 1/-10, 2/-25, 3/-50 (NOT percentage based or anything, just a flat resist mod.) 3/6/9 should be progression on this (good but not gamebreaking).<br />
<br />
3.  Also like the decreased slow mitigation aa.  Would need like a 10 minute duration and 1hr 12min+ recast also though (or more).  Give it 1/10% 2/25% 3/50% decrease to mitigation.<br />
<br />
4.  HOTKEYED spells...  Melee stats can be hotkeyed and even when the button in the abilities window is changed, the hotkey does not change.  Why can't they do something similar with spell?  Possibly give us a window like the melee's new disc window to even just swap spells.  The new quick load function is great... but say I want to be able to load gate in slot 5 QUICKLY without getting rid of any of my current spell lineup, just in case because &quot;it's&quot; hitting the fan.  Why not give us 8 buttons that we can program to &quot;Load X spell in Y slot&quot; just by clicking it.  This could save that extra 5 seconds to loading gate, or root, or this, or that.<br />
<br />
5.  I have a 65 monk and rogue alts I box on separate accounts and noticed that just using discs with the new endurance bar, it has plenty of regen to use multiple discs (on different timers) within a very reasonable ammount of time.  Depending on how the new openings work with the endurance bar, I hate to say, an endurance regen buff isn't really needed.  If every &quot;opening&quot; sucks up 10-20% when taken advantage of, I'll quickly change my opinion on this.<br />
<br />
6.  FoS line... for god's sake, next upgrade put stamina and agility (what a useless frickin stat) on it.  The current stats on it are good, they max people who aren't maxed on str/dex... but is removing sta from the spells we need to load too much to ask?!  I actually HATE casting stamina on raids... almost as I hate casting agi to give someone that 3 extra ac!!! /sigh  Put some raw attack on it too, like 75 or something, well however much dex/str it adds would be cool.<br />
<br />
7.  Avatar line... /sigh such good attack, but after that, pure crap compared to what the 65 bst spell Ferocity gives.  &quot;Yay&quot; we get to max out people's maxed stats and give them 140atk.  Ferocity gives 150atk, 65 to all resists, and like 40 sta.<br />
<br />
8.  My thoughts on a new cannibalize spell:  Just double the hp taken and mana given.  Increasing recast time just opens up the oportunity that you aren't going to have it when you want it.  I recommend 296hp for 164 mana, same cast, same recast.  If you SERIOUSLY have a problem with shaman mana regen where just bigger bursts of mana wouldn't help you more...  Oh yeah... please don't ask for any form of lich... the moment they helped us with a &quot;lich&quot; type spell it would hinder us and not be stackable with Enchanter buffs, or 9, or something like that.<br />
<br />
9.  Fury line of spells:  Why didn't we get an upgrade to Voice of the Berserker?  I'm forced to ask rangers for Call of the Rathe on raids for extra AC when I want it because it adds a descent amount more ac... they do not stack.<br />
<br />
10.  Talisman of Shadoo or Jacinth stacking with ToT just like a druid's circle of summer stacks with protection of seasons!  (wait, I take that back... they second we asked for that they'd FIX the druid resist stacking issue).<br />
<br />
BTW I really like some of Fenril's ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Hmm regen was pretty useful as I was levelling up I would like to see its usefulness again and a 75 hp/tick regen would be very defining.<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear, they could make it so using rabid bear you cannot cast spells. Then give it a wacky upgrade of 150 dodge(which someone suggested in another thread) then either (1) boost its offense by way of attack, dd, or the dmg on the dot. or (2) Give it a beneficial group effect/proc. For example maybe if rabid bear was made innate a -to aggro proc. Or a group cure. I am skeptical of having too many spells in the lineup unless a form which suggested above of a hotkeying spells, or like I suggested before a 2nd set of spell gems which would negate having to sit to mem a spell. So Rabid bear could be useful in another method of doing damage or debuffing/buffing.(perhaps cann6 could be implemented as a proc, but I hear already people saying &quot;eww&quot;<br />
<br />
Cripple could be combined to dispell beneficial effects on a mob. Also possibly stating with text what cripple has done to the mob, ie what effects have been removed with yellow text, and what it has done to the mob in terms of crippling it.<br />
<br />
A new shaman buff of adding +10% to weapon skills, +10% dmg to procs, +10% to avoidance lasting 1 hour. As str/dex/sta is pretty much maxed by so many people at the high end making the only beneficial means of buffing being hp and resists.<br />
<br />
2 things, I would like to have more of a choice in a situation rather than be forced into linearity of malos, slow, dot etc. And also I liked the idea of costbenefit analysis when you cast a spell. Ie you cast a spell but you get so and so detrimental effect.<br />
<br />
I don't think we need improved invis as I said before, but I think it would be good to let shamans have a means of obtaining the herbs for improved invis potion.<br />
<br />
/pet focus command, pet focuses on the mob you set it to attack and on no other. As I stated before Spirit quickening would be good to be enhanced to be a good long lasting pet buff.<br />
<br />
Spirit of Bihli given extra duration.<br />
<br />
And something along the lines of decreasing the procedure of Malos-Slow(if resist then alternative). A quick slow, or a slow with quick recast but only say 60%. Or a slow with a splurt type dot.<br />
<br />
Hastened Radiant Cure. Or a less laborious way of memming cures quickly. <br />
<br />
A new cannibalize would be good or a mana regen buff of some sort. As although I am never oom with cannibalize it is consistent canns and never a satisfactory proportion of bar full. Cann5 adds 20% of my mana.<br />
<br />
The ability to put words onto say the Cann5 button would be useful to but not as an aa just a general improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">We need our spell slots.. So more stuff to aa. Cann4 to aa or something would be nice. <br />
<br />
New spells.. Would like a self buff  like wizards get.. instead summon a crow have it add stuff. Crow fits the shaman thing. An idea for it would be when it dies  the group gets a heal over time casted on it and the shaman losses like 1000-2000 mana. <br />
<br />
A new sow. Why is it our sow sucks? We are supposed to be the kings of sow.   This advanced innate run is gonna screw us more. <br />
<br />
Group Avatar. Group heals, PB aoe malo Pb aoe Slow. <br />
<br />
An idea was.. that you have an AA ability where every 1 or 2 minute you can activate it and the next  detrimental spell with a duration you cast will become pointblank aoe..<br />
<br />
Also make rabid bear GOOD not sucky.. Make it pre-nerf ManaBurn good.<br />
<br />
My suggestions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">the big thing to consider is that when the level cap rises to 70 and typical encounters rise in strength, is that shamans retain their relative strength and desirability in groups, raids, and ability to solo.

<br />
I think locking threads just because similar issues are being discussed elsewhere does cause a few problems.<br />
<br />
Not that the comments I made in the closed thread are most important ever made but how do you decide which thread gets locked? &quot;Most posts&quot; seems like a REALLY bad factor because we all know how many flames a controversial post gets.<br />
<br />
I suggest you dont lock threads unless the flaming gets out of control. Then if the threads are equally interesting they will get a similar amount of posts and if they are not they will die a silent death (like the one you FORCE upon them).<br />
<br />
I realize that this is not a board I pay to access so its not my decision to make but by just flat out locking threads you will alienate people in the long run. And then a non-commerical board like this really looses its interest.<br />
<br />
PS. I would actually pay (probably not more than 5 dollars/month) to access this board if nothing was arbitrarily locked but still contained useful information for me. I sure as hell miss some of the GREAT original posters like Tudamorf and Robert135 that were either banned or left because people were unable to tell the difference between RL and a messageboard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Talsiman of Invisibility would be nice lol. Even of its is our same crappy Invis with group casting. Reallt sux having to be main invis on single targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I suppose that its dreaming, but lets look at maybe making Focus of the 7th a real upgrade.....for clerics, their best hit point buff at level 60 is Blessing of Aegolism (1150 hit points and 60 Ac) with their best buff at 65 being Hand of Virtue (1405 hit points and 72 Ac). For Druids at level 60 its Protection of the Glades (485 hit points and 24 Ac with a 6 mana per tick regen) and at 65 its Blessing of the 9 (618 hit points 32 Ac and 8 mana per tick regen).<br />
Now we come to shaman Khuras Focusing is 445 Hit points and 67 Str and 60 Dex; our upgrade is Focus of the 7th which is 544 hit points and 75 str and 70 Dex.<br />
Talk about a rude gesture. 99 more hit points and a few more points of dex/str that no one really needs at level 65. Toss us a bone here, give it some ATK componant, hit point regen, hell I would even say some Ac....but something other than more buffs to nearly useless stats.<br />
Also a self only regen spell, wether it be mana or hit points; nearly all other hybrids and priest classes get some sort of passive mana regen spell, I can see why giving that to us would be a Bad Thing, but would a self only regen buff that gives say 35/tick be so broke? lasts say an hour and bounces replenishment? Heck make it give UV and See Invis to top it off and my day would be set. Oh yeah and make it a VENDOR SPELL so I dont have to fool with MORE runes and MORE BoT named or MORE jerks in bazaar that make shaman spells 20-30k more than they are worth.<br />
Plus make our Berserker line of spells give some atk componant to us when we use them and place us on a different melee table or make us at least have access to double attack via AA like bards and beastlords do.<br />
Its clear that of all the priest classes that were meant to be more melee oriented; looking at our buffs and skill caps shows that; if that is the case then why in the hell dont we get something that makes that useable?<br />
<br />
I want to point out a little more descrepency compared to Druids and Clerics which really makes no sense except to show that while SoE balances certain things, others are seemingly completely arbitrary.<br />
<br />
FoS - 600mana 80min duration - 7.5mana/minute<br />
Fo7 - 1800mana 80min duratiuon - 22.5mana/minute<br />
<br />
Virtue - 1000mana 150min duration - 6.7mana/minute<br />
HoV - 2500mana 150min duration - 16.7mana/minute<br />
<br />
Pot9 - 725mana 100min duration -  7.25mana/minute<br />
Bot9 - 1700mana 100min duration - 17mana/minute<br />
<br />
While the single target version in comparison are very equal in mana/duration aspect, for the group version ours for some reason gets a large hike. To keep the duration static and keep in comparison a similar mana/duration as the others, Fo7 should cost 1500mana.<br />
<br />
This is just the top of the trend that our spells tend to be lower in duration and higher in cost, which has been stated a few times on this board before. While I don't feel too strongly about this, it is just one of the many handicaps we get to &quot;balance&quot; our &quot;not-so anymore superior&quot; mana regen.<br />
<br />
I'd like to also point out the redundancy of alot of our buffs. 6 out of 31 spells (not counting the imbues) are buffs, most of which never get cast by alot of shamans. They are almost meaningless but more importantly there are too many that do the same thing. Between FA, Fo7, Boar, Diaku, Wrulan we can buff a total of - 255str 245dex 200agi 60sta.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me, except for a naked player, who at level 65 with even average gear will even use half of that?<br />
Some of these other spells of course have other effects that make them actually worth casting, but the point is why add in all these stat boost when we know that they really don't do much, if anything, at all and to top it off give it to so many of our spells as &quot;added&quot; benefit.<br />
Players stopped gearing up with +stat items and worried more about the new holy trinity of hp/mana - AC - resist. So why then, do so many of our spells still give more of something that means nothing?<br />
<br />
If you really start looking at our spells and compare them to other classes, especially Druids and Clerics, you will find more and more of these things that supposed to &quot;balance&quot; us for our &quot;not-so anymore superior&quot; mana regen.<br />
<br />
I hope that in the next expansion they don't take the easy road as the previous expansions since Kunark and just give us small increases in the same old useless stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">AA or Spell To convert our HP to mana for our target. Kinda like a Canni Other. For fairness would cost a small bit of mana to so to say to form the bond to make the transefer. Would be simular but not as effective as say the necro's transfer mana spell. I dont know how many times I have sat FULL MANA health and had to wait eons for everyone else to mana back up. This is even after rebuffing everyone. Would be another option for us. Though I really dont ever see tht happening for shaman. And would really hate to turn our selves into mana batteries for some caster. Just there are times I feel I'm just wasting mana. Hell when I'm casting 1300 heals on warrior with only 400 damage done to them becuase I'm full mana and health and want / need to get rid of mana its truly sad. Would be nice to be able to do something bit better withit. <br />
<br />
Two thoughts on this post...<br />
First, to the person who said he should be flamed for adding to the misnomer that our mana regen is too good...  Agreed to a point.  I for one use most my mana during fight time.  I have pretty damn good gear for my level too, it's just that there are alot of things to spend mana on in a regular group environment.  If canni-ing didnt take so much damn time then sure, I would have alot of extra mana, but as it is I simply can't cast it enough because I am busy with other spells.  So I only really get to regen significant amounts of mana during downtime.  But I do thing I am sitting of a full box of mana whenever there is a med break.  In full downtimes I get mana back pretty fast, and then just wait for others to catch up<br />
<br />
Which brings me to my second though...  Being able to give mana to other classes like necros would give me something to do during downtime and would add alot to my group usefulness.  However, NOBODY wants to become a battery on raids, or even in groups, so I have a way around that...<br />
<br />
Give us a spell that takes away some of our mana and gives it to a specific target at a rate slightly less effecient than the necros spell, and add to that a penalty component: that the target of the spell can't cast for, say 5 seconds, after getting hit by the mana bump.<br />
<br />
This way the spell can ONLY be used in downtime.  We will not be batteries on raids, and we will not be asked to twich mana to the clerics when we have other things to do (i.e. a mob is in the camp).  This would be perfect for LDoN adventures by allowing the group to decrease downtime by a bit, but is ballanced by adding that extra bit of danger (the cleric is outa commission for at least 5 seconds).  Obviously some people aren't gonna like the downside, but that is the whole point to a well ballanced spell... its situational.<br />
<br />
Ok, just thought about it...  we might still be used for batteries to clerics on c-heal chains... don't know if there is a way around that, or if that alone is enough to scrap the idea.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just trying to come up with some new toys  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be blunt, I no longer use my disease dots unless I am solo'ing. And even if I am solo'ing, fights rarely last long enough for the full damage of the disease dot to be dealt. Breath of Uthor has to be active for 2.6 minutes for its duration to be complete. I'm not asking for them to be even nearly as short of a duration as our poison dots. But even cutting them down to 1.5 minutes would be a huge improvement. My disease spells have taken a backseat to my poison dots with the rare exception of solo'ing mobs with larger amounts of HP, and larger PoP raidmobs. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Probably the area that we're gimped the most in is Buffs.  Considering Shaman are supposed to be the elite at buffing, at 65 we really only have a few needed spells to use.<br />
<br />
Enough ideas have been tossed out about other stuff, so I'm going to toss out a few old ideas I had about buffs - and with some of what is in game (or coming), it's definately doable, from the programming standpoint.<br />
<br />
Totems<br />
Like the GoD Call of the Ancients AA, these types of spells would summon a &quot;pet type&quot;, dropped item.  (Pet type, as in we can only have one at a time, per individual).  The totem would be a fairly short term, ae buff - lasting up to about a minute, but hitting every player and/or pet within range.  There could be a huge variety of buffs available - healing, mana regen, resists, or whatever.<br />
<br />
[b]Spirit Avatar[b]<br />
Singel target buff spells, like our Avatar line - only expand on what's possible.  Instead of the same generic line of Attack, Agility, Dexterity &amp; Strength, add different things.  Skill increases, adding procs of various sorts, etc.<br />
<br />
Both types would be something new, stackable with mutliple shaman, and buffs that would actually be desirable in almost any situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I think the shaman is ok with how it is set up.  However, the bread and butter abilities of the shaman haven't been upgraded in a long time.<br />
<br />
Can4, as said needs an upgrade.  We should get rid of the idea that a shaman should always be casting in order to obtain maximum efficiency.  The cann that was proposed sounds good.<br />
<br />
Buff spells.  Talsiman of alacrity.  How have we let htis tand for so long.  Didn't we get over the idea that group spells should be worse than single spells in Luclin?  I dont think avatar should increase dualwield rates.  It shouldn't favor one handed weapons over two handed weapons.  I don't see why it shouldn't go over the haste cap.  Why not have it get atk + over haste?<br />
<br />
Healing.  Q isn't even that much of an upgrade over Torpor.  Let's go for 500/tic hp regen with the same duration and perhaps a group torpor or Q.  A larger heal at about the same cast time would help.  No more than 2k base.<br />
<br />
Slowing.  Shaman need to once again be the king of slows.  The ONLY way to do that is to give innate MR adjusts to their slows.  It should be noticeable that shaman have the easiest time landing slow.  WIth slow mitigation slow is no longer nearly as powerful as it once was.  <br />
<br />
I can't think of any place where these upgrades would be grossly overpowered.  I am sure other shaman can think of some upgrades for their damage dealing ablities.  I always have played the CC type shaman mor than anything.</div></div><hr />
