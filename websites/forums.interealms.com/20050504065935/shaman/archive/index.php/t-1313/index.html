<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rhysen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I created one today. Always wanted an ogre and never played a Shaman so I decided on starting to play one. As my starting points went I threw them into dex (5), agi (5) and wis (20). I read somewhere that getting dex/agi at least to 75 does prevent suffering from penalty of something. Can anyone explain?<br />
<br />
I also was surprised that Ogres get only one religion. Ralloz Zek. I wasn't surprised that Rallos Zek was the god (he created them) but I was surprised that it was the only god they could get. And I certainly did not like it when I found out that Ralloz has only one symbol for Shamans :confused Just wondering and really hoping that that changed in recent patches or maybe in the planning stages with the new Plains of Power? Any one heard any rumors?<br />
<br />
An advice on wis/mana items I can get him as he level would be nice. He will be going through as a non twink and I'm looking into some non-expensive items I can purchase.<br />
<br />
Oh and tell me your stories. You there with the big Ogre Shaman. How did your little poor misunderstood child deal with the big nasty Freeport guards that just didn't understand that you weren't a big meany, but just a big, clumsy walking disaster area. I mean of course it was an accident! You didn't mean to dent that helmet. And your club just slipped and accidentally fell on that guards foot. Not your fault a hot and sunny day makes your palms sweat. And some days the spells are just a tad too complicated and sometimes...whoops! Or in other words. Give me some advice on how to travel and level my way through the plains of Norrath with a minimum of accidents ;)<br />
<br />
Never played a misunderstood race/class seriously before.<br />
<br />
edit: Oh and I forgot. How do I speak Ogre speak? Is it difficult? Are there any guides? And what's the difference between Ogre speak and Troll speak?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, the easy question:  Always keep your AGI above 75, or your Armor Class takes a huge drop.  I don't know if there is a similar problem with Dexterity (it wouldn't surprise me if learning weapon skills, etc. takes a hit in frequency with low DEX, but I haven't seen any evidence of it.)<br />
<br />
Here's a nice thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=1238) on some of the good things to know about playing an &quot;evil&quot; race.<br />
<br />
Here's another recent thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=500) with some nice answers to questions about low level weapons skills, how to make plat, and cheap weapons and armor.<br />
<br />
My personal philosophy on this is that at low levels, you'll be best served by having a decent ratio weapon- as most of your damage will come from that- and decent AC.  Wisdom can wait (and remember, it is a LOT less effective at lower levels anyway- the amount of mana you get per point of wisdom does up as you level, so at low levels, even a high wisdom doesn't translate to much mana.)  As you progress, your spells will become more and more important... but at first, you'll find you spend a lot of time bashing.  Banded armor is outstanding for the lower levels (if I were doing it again, I'd be tempted to just wear banded until 30 or so), and you can get a whole suit for less than the price of one wisdom item, in most cases.<br />
<br />
As far as the symbol goes, Barbarians (me) are in the same boat- bleh.<br />
<br />
Ogre speak?  Can't help you there... I'm still learning to read and understand it in real-time.  Don't know how my brother manages to generate it that fast.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wisdom is junk at lower levels.  Mana is much better.  But better still is AC, and better than that is hitpoints.  Play like a melee as much as you possibly can for at least the first 20 levels, because you can do it for quite a while(done right, you can melee into your 50's, as my ogre shaman did), and doing so is the only way to build up offense, defense, and all your weapons skills.  Don't worry about falling behind in casting too much -- just spend an hour or two in town, perfectly safely, casting your lowest level spells to catch up.  Don't get too far behind, though, or you'll be spending a LOT of time.  BUT -- it's a lot easier to make up for casting skills that have fallen behind than for melee skills that have fallen behind.<br />
<br />
Be aware that in groups, people are going to want your shaman for heals and buffs though, not melee, and will not think much of you if you are low mana because you are busy meleeing instead of medding.  Only melee when you have enough mana to handle your present situations AND handle an emergency.  If that means you are sitting on your butt more than you like, just be happy you're not getting kicked out of your group for thinking only of yourself and not the other group members.  When they're counting on your mana for heals, they are COUNTING on it -- don't get selfish playing around with your weapons when your heals can do much more for your group than your weapons ever will.  If you need to melee more because defense is falling too far behind, or weapons or offense, go solo a while.  You're the perfect class for it anyway.  Group and solo both, so you're well-rounded and tough.  <br />
<br />
One reason to try to melee every level at least a little, or spend many levels meleeing non-stop every once in a while, is that every defensive point gained gives you about 2.5 of free AC.  That's 12.5 per level, the AC you could get from a very nice piece of armor.  If you try to stay away from melee, you will get more fragile every level, as the game is pretty well calculated to give you mobs that match a maxed defensive skill level.  If you fall behind, mobs quickly beat you much harder than you should be getting beaten.<br />
<br />
Dex is not of much use to a shaman; kind of a waste of points there.  AGI is excellent, especially for ogres, who fall short.  I picked 25 wis and 5 agi, and think that would have been better for you.  Some folks suggest putting points into stamina because it gives you more hitpoints, but ogres have a ton of stamina already, and are VERY poor in the agi/dex departments.<br />
<br />
Oh -- learn to run backwards.  That way, mobs won't stun you, which is one of the really nice things about being an ogre.  If you turn tail and get stunned, you could absorb an extra few rounds of melee impact on you, and even(ugh) get stunned twice in a short period of time.  Running backwards means at least you won't stop running in the middle of your flight to safety.<br />
<br />
You might want to try for rygorr armor, as far as what to wear goes.  It is dirt cheap and has some very nice stats.  The legs are especially good for something so cheap -- shamans have very poor leg armor selections as a class, and you might find yourself wearing rygorr legs into your 50's.  <br />
<br />
Finally -- save your money.  A shaman can do without pretty well and still get by.  You don't always have to be the greatest looking, most powerful shaman on the block, although there is a lot of peer pressure to show off your stuff.<br />
<br />
You will need to save a LOT of money.  The first expensive thing that would be a huge boost to you would be an iksar regen breastplate, which goes for 6000 on my server.  It regens 5 standing and 6 sitting, and that is the best BP to wear until you can get a fungi, I think.  Regen is extremely precious.  I have had this breastplate, a fungi tunic, and many other breastplates(currently wearing ToV quest BP), and I'm telling you, regen will vastly improve your power.  Get it ASAP, even if you have to let your other slots rot with crappy stuff sometimes in order to save the cash.<br />
<br />
You will also need to buy a jaundiced bone bracer(JBB) at some point, 15k on my server.  Another potentially game-changing item, still very useful to me at 60.  Eventually, you will probably want to buy a fungi, which is the best chest piece you can wear until you get the torpor spell at 60(IF you even get it), at which point regen isn't so crucial anymore.  You also will probably wind up buying at least a few of your spells, and you need money for that.<br />
<br />
So...save like crazy.  Make earning money part of your game plan.  Don't waste money on trades at all; that will kill your bank account and leave you nothing to show for it.  Even alchemy is no longer any good - it used to be good for selling SOW potions, but now too many people make them and sell them for cost.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />
