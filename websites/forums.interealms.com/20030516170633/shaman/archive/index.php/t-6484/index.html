<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chayce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, have read just about everything there is to read about this but still have yet to get to a point.<br />
<br />
I have MAX ally faction with Tormax to begin with.<br />
<br />
I am scowl after many evenings of killling coldains to giants.<br />
<br />
I have about 60 heads saved up.<br />
<br />
Question is.....<br />
<br />
Can I turn in heads to the recruiter *screw the bank guy atm* while i am scowling, or will he just eat them?<br />
<br />
Please ignore the kromzik and tormax lead offs, cause I have already read them. This just about the recruiter and being kos.<br />
<br />
Thanks =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What I did with my Shadowknight was do click a dorf head on the recruiter and hit hide at the same time. I guess  you could probably do the same thing with a buddy casting invis on you if you timed it right.<br />
<br />
The point is to get a trade window open with the recruiter and then have hide or invis up so that faction reads neutral. It allowed me to get my kromrif faction up enough so that I could do the hand in at the bank with the rest of my dorf heads so that I could get both kromrif and kromzek faction for the turn-ins there.<br />
<br />
Hope that makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chayce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i turned in one invisible and he just took it.<br />
Do you have to go with 4?<br />
I was really looking for some sort of definate answer before i blow 4 heads on a hell no turn in.<br />
<br />
I am a shaman btw. there is no hide option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">as far as i know you can't turn in anything at all when you're invi anymore. we've tried this is katta and the person doing a turn in either a) got aggroed and died or b) had their item eatne, i can't remember which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sounds like they nerfed it :(<br />
<br />
The other option is to kill dorfs until you can turn in heads to the recruiter, then when your faction is high enough for the turn-in at the bank switch to there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Do wtov a bit and get ally kromzek, then turn in heads to bvellos in the bank.  There's only a rif there every once in a while (he's a wanderer) and w/ sow up, I made it to the zone with a loss of 54 hp after regen ( I went in fully self buffed just in case ;) ), the one time that I got agroed.  And if you're near bottom rif, you'll need about 100 heads.  Mine took 97.<br />
<br />
Ignore me if I misunderstood your post and this is dumb.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You can't initiate a trade window when you're invis now... you can initiate the trade window, then have someone cast invis on you before hitting the give button... turns your faction to indif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chayce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, exactly Moraganth!<br />
<br />
