<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Near the alchemist merchant, theres a merchant with herb looking things... I was just wondering if anyone knew if these were for alchemy, or if they were gonna start putting Rogue Poison components there now....  I can't see it being Poisons, as they lack Frog Rogues...   So has anyone else seen this and wondered if we're getting a crap load of new stuff to make?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">we can only hope that they are A) adding some potions that are USEFUL and b) maybe even changing things so it is inline pricewise / usefulness wise with other tradeskills. not holding my breath though!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I hadn't read the other posts so this MAY have been pointless.<br />
<br />
I'd really hope their fixing stuff, but it may just be the old world components, altho it seems theres alot more components on this merchant than the number of old world potions i can find.<br />
<br />
There may be a chance their bringing back old world style potions for newer things tho /shrug/</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
  If everything costs 25pp or more, up to about 150p per herb, but they all sell back for 2sp... it is alchemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
  If most cost about 3gp a couple are maybe 5pp, and they all sell back at about half that...   it is poison.</div></div><hr />

hahahahhaa....  SO true..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There has already been a thread about this, but im too lazy to loc it, so im just gonna post whats there:<br />
<br />
The vendor you have found is just the &quot;old alchemy vendor&quot;, same as in Shar Vahl... Just old alchemy herbs...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>VeldamirVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ahh ok.  I couldn't find another post on it.  Sorry to get your hopes up i guess hehe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I went to Gukta just to peak... and  I found this vendor.<br />
<br />
What strikes me is that he's selling too many components for it beeing only old alchemy - I should one day make a list of what he's selling and compare it to the old alchemy ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Exactly same amout as the one in Shar Vahl... but....<br />

A lot of post counts got wiped out a few months ago, or at least knocked down signifigantly.  Might be the case.<br />
<br />
