<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We have had tons of discussion and analysis on our issues. I am going to attempt to sum them up in a condensed version, meaning no analysis or proof - instead I will search for and link appropriate posts.<br />
<br />
Hopefully this helps people understand our issues without them having to sort through literally hundreds of posts first.<br />
<br />
Situation<br />
This is all from the perspective of the current &quot;high end&quot; of Everquest, meaning elemental gear and higher, maxed flowing thought, plenty of focus items, plenty of AAs and the like. Parts of it apply for all shaman but most does not.<br />
<br />
This may mean that part of whatever fixes we propose or get may have to be restricted to those players by AA tiers, drop locations, vendors in restricted zones or the like.<br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
Shaman healing has been penalized (presumably for our slowing and mana regeneration abilities) during the priest rebalancing in Luclin. Since then shorter fights and slow mitigation as well as the mana regeneration inflation has severely changed that situation.<br />
Not only do shaman heal considerably worse then both druids and clerics in single fights (not even counting AAs such as Divine Arbitration or tools such as Divine Intervention), we also heal worse then clerics and druids in the long term even when accounting for slow and cannibalize.<br />
In fact one cleric (without a slower of his own) will often outheal two shaman.<br />

Damage<br />
Shaman damage spells in all their forms have received less upgrades then similar spells of all other classes for all expansions since Kunark. At the same time our advantage in mana regeneration has shrunk every expansion.<br />
Additionally our main source of damage, DoT spells, has been rendered largely irrelevant. In groups the short fight durations make it impossible to have our spells run for their full duration, especially if we also want to slow a MOB or debuff it's resists, which we often have to do to land spells reliably. On raids the extreme aggro generated by the counters on our DoTs makes it hard to use them without getting aggro.<br />

<br />
Buffs<br />
Shaman buffs have, similarly to our damage spells, received less upgrades then those of any other class. In addition stat caps have rendered our stat buff lines nearly completely useless. Shaman currently buff less HPs then any class except rangers (who we are tied with).<br />

<br />
Raid stacking<br />
Shaman have always stacked worse on raids then the other class. However both clerics and druids have received MGBable group heals which make it useful to have excess clerics and druids along.<br />
Other classes (like enchanters) have similar issues.<br />
