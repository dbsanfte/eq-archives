<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Great addition.  I agree that there are those that pride themselves on keeping 4 songs going and I know there are lazy turd bards that just click on Chorus of Marr and /auto follow, then walk away.  But still it is a game and if it makes it more fun then let them do it w/o having to never talk or go bio or take care of the dog/kid or turn your head to watch something on TV..... I think it's great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I might play my bard more when this goes live but what about auto-fire for rangers and auto-cannibalize for us?<br />
<br />
If they want to reduce carpal tunnel syndrome, allow players to communicate more easily, and have more fun they still have some work to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Holy crap dude. I loved my bard till i got to 30 and my wrists started to hurt. Makes me wish i hadnt deleted him. I could actualy have fun playing that. Not worht starting from scratch though.<br />

GG SoE though. Seriously, this is a awesome addition. I just heard about 200,000 wrists sigh in relief. And on a more serious note, this will help the carpel tunnel effect i hear a lot of bards get. Like i said, i had a bard and my wrists hurt bad enough for me to know this wasnt a good thing to do for hours a day. Hence why i stopped.</div></div><hr />

I'm really beginning to understand why rangers are leaving the game in such numbers.</div></div><hr />

They already did that, and its called pained memories. Now if only I can find spell runes and time to level to 68...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it looks pretty cool. How come bards are so upset over it? Because they spent time doing this instead of focusing on other issues? Or, because it will attract even more ignorant people to play bards?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, true, but I don't see a level 68 spell for bards that grants them the ability to auto-twist songs. ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Holy crap dude. I loved my bard till i got to 30 and my wrists started to hurt. Makes me wish i hadnt deleted him. I could actualy have fun playing that. Not worht starting from scratch though.<br />
You do realize it takes about 5 hours to get from level 1 - 30 if you can find a druid to dshield and heal you.<br />
Levels 1-9 you can do in blackburrow in about 60 minutes, including character creation time, xferring all your twink gear from shared bank slot, running to blackburrow, getting mediocre level 49 druid hp buffs, and scribing songs.<br />
Levels 10-25 you can do in about 2.5 - 3 hours in paludal caverns.  I was helping my friend level her druid today in pc using just my shaman.  With her own 6 point dshield, and meleeing mobs with me healing, she went from level 10 to 12 and a half in about an hour.  Another comparison, when I was levelling my wizard there, at level 20, I'd get 1/2 a level in about 10 minutes doing an AE pull (including pull and med time for the druid to get full mana).<br />
Levels 25-30 you can do in lower guk in about 1-2 hours doing the same thing.<br />
Hire a druid to plevel you by the hour, or see if you can bot one from somewhere.  It's not a lot of work to get back to 30 if you want to play a bard again.  (bards are great at AE killing since they get dshield songs and AE song as well).<br />
<br />
As for the wrist hurting thing, my wrists used to ache from just playing my shaman.  I've since fixed the problem though with decent wrist support when I play.  My wrists don't hurt me any more.  Setting up your keypad 0-9 buttons to cast your songs keeps your hands and wrists in proper position to avoid repeditive movement strain on your wrists, and I can play for hours without problems.  Even then, this was &quot;sorely&quot; needed for the bard class.  They just need to autofire for anyone using a bow though.<br />
<br />
And shaman can already macro cannibalize.<br />
line 1:  /pause X, /cast 8<br />
line 2:  /pause X, /cast 8<br />
line 3:  /pause X, /cast 8<br />
line 4:  /pause X, /cast 8<br />
line 5:  /cast 8<br />
Make that into a macro, but substitute the X with whatever value is right to recast canni after it's done.  probably needs to be about 80, but I forget.<br />
You hit your hotkey, and it'll wince 5 times for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">for cani 4 its around 60, I think mine is at 57</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That macro for canni is pretty useless though unless you are doing nothing but standing still and don't plan on interrupting the macro for about 25 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Can be a cool thing i guess, might be nice when in say a raid where the bard is on resist duty, autotwist might help with not dropping a song i guess.<br />
<br />
But i can see more people playing bards thanks to this, could be a good thing or bad i guess, part of being a bard is not only twisting x number of songs but using the best ones, with autotwist depending on the difficulty of changing out songs it might make people less flexible.</div></div><hr />

An auto canni dance button would lead to a dead shaman. So no thanks.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone PLs their characters to 65 to start playing them.  I have a 64 rogue, 54 bard, and 67 shaman -- all played, very very little of it was PLing (I PLed the bard a little in the mid 40s when it was impossible to get a group - once he was 46, all was ok again)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I played a bard to 63 and by that point I had a bag of ice on my wrist wrapped in an ACE bandage. Most of the bards that are pissed because they feel that the people that could not twist 4 songs are going to be able to do it now no sweat. This is regarded as one of the several ways to tell if your grouped with a gimp or not. Kinda funny though that some people need to realize it is not how many songs you twist but the songs in your lineup that seperates a good bard from a gimp more than how many you can twist. This is a welcomed change and all I can say is about damn time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">This got me thinking, I'm curious if you were to rank classes of who pounds the keyboard the most what would the rankings be? So many times I feel like I'm doing 2 or 3 different things with my shaman. I really haven't played many classes as high as my shaman, except for my monk, and my necro if you count to 45 high anymore. My shaman is by far the most labor intensive character(yes I know not as much as bards). So do you guys think we'd be second?</div></div><hr />

Yea, but i have power leveled so much i cant do it anymore. Im serious man, everytime i load up that druid and start hitting the shield and heals and power leveling whatever i want to level, i feel will ot play EQ all together slowly drain out of me. Infact i would say a large part of why i quit was the repitition that powerlevleing brought to the game. Burned me out.<br />
<br />
Naa its too late, if i have him still i would log in and play when it went live, but the grind from 1-30 i just cant do.<br />
<br />
<br />
But anyway, gratz to the bards man, this is freaking awesome for them :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I wish the Devs would just implement an auto repeat feature like CoH has.<br />
<br />
You just Shift-click the hotkey and it automatically fires everytime the hotkey refreshes. Archery, kick,bash  etc would be much less irritating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bozer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When I first saw this I groaned- bards are already insane in PvP and (less so in PvE but thats another issue) this just seemed to make life easier for them.<br />
<br />
   But, I have a pk bard-- and when I am fighting human opponents it would be simply foolish to macro or set up your song hotkeys.  Why? Because you have to react to your opponent and counter it very quickly.  Mobs are basically robots who can be predicted easily-- whilst a player may throw a number of different things at you and often I twist based on what my opponent is doing.  If hes trying to gate I'm not singing resists, for example.<br />
<br />
  So what this does is make it easier to play a bard.  More people-- who might have been otherwise discouraged from leveling a bard up-- will do so.  <br />
  I can't wait till I run into the first auto-twisting bard in a pvp situation; it will be nice quick kill for once.</div></div><hr />

I use that macro a lot.<br />
<br />
When the mob is slowed, the meele is healed and you want the shaman to grind mana while you 2box the meele... I see no reason not to let a macro do the work.<br />
<br />
You CAN interrupt the macro to do other things, mouse casting a spell works just fine to work a different spell in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">they need some kind of /stophotkey or /endmacro command to abort a running hotkey, cause if you have one of those &quot;canni five times&quot; things, you can't use any other hotkeys, like VP, Canni5, etc unless you type out /alt activate or whatever</div></div><hr />

Back when I played, I used  gamepad for my monk and my bard.  Never got Carpal Tunnel.  Had other issues with wirsts though, it was never diagnosed...  I went to the gamepad and it helped.  But what helped most was stopping EQ altogether :/<br />
<br />
I used to fire off those &quot;4444444444444444444444&quot;s quite frequently hehe, although as a bard it's more &quot;123123123123&quot;.  Frustrating much :)</div></div><hr />
