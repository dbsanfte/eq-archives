<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have been reading threads on the rep system and should it be kept or booted.  I have read people talking about giving others rep bumps, and just read someone got negative rep bumps....<br />
<br />
Retarded_Question_001:  How do I check my rep, or vote to bump/lower someone elses?<br />
<br />
sorry, I know this is a dumb question, but for the life of me, I can't figure it out.<br />
<br />
I see the little green things by the names, but I don't know how to vote to raise someones rep, or see if there is any smaller increments of rep other than each green box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ill give you the best advice i can my friend. Just like in real life, realize reputation is bullocks and just ignore the system and what everyone thinks or doesnt think about you. Read each post without looking a rep point cause it means about squat pertaining to the post they are making and you might end up missing the point cause you already have prejudged someone cause of it or even miss a good post entirely.<br />
<br />
Like i said, ignore it and deal with people 1 post at a time and with a open mind each time. Let the rep system wither and die like the diseased hyena it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>aphex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Like i said, ignore it and deal with people 1 post at a time and with a open mind each time. Let the rep system wither and die like the diseased hyena it is.<br />
<br />
you couldn't have said that any better Litgruv.<br />
<br />
i too have never noticed the rep system nor do i know how to access it.. which i'm very thankful for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">See the little talking head icon next to &quot;Edit&quot; on the lower right of someone's post?  That's how you add/subtract rep.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just for giggles i looked at my rep. I made a Ding!! post about me leaving EQ a few weeks ago and in that post someone actualy took the time to remove points from me and said &quot;Good Ridance&quot;. Im not stupid man, i know who it was. But that just shows how small minded and inane this person is. We have such a small reason to hate each other yet i get that from said person.<br />
<br />
Me on the other hand. I read this feedback and shake my head and continue on to read each of this persons thread with a open mind and unjudged, willing to take anything good he says for what it is instead of lurking in a shadow waiting to pounce to &quot;try&quot; to damage him in some way.<br />
<br />
I guess what im saying is this. Read the above and decide who you wanna be, then think about if you wanna bother with the rep system. Im not saying either person is right or wrong, i would never assume such wisdom to condem someone else cause they think differently then me. But just think about it and ask yourself if its worth it. <br />
<br />
And its not a dumb question.<br />
<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reputation system is pretty pointless, but I participate in it anyways.  It's kinda cool that I have three green dots and I like it, but I don't lose any sleep over negative rep bumps.  I know that I can be rather abrasive at times and people have a tendency to only see that, rather than the fact that 90% of my posts are pretty in depth and well though-out.  Thus, I don't let it bother me that people give me negative rep bumps.  Most people who disagree with me aren't intelligent enough for me to worry about their opinion of me, anyways :)<br />
<br />
I give negative rep bumps to anyone who contributes nothing but thoughtless negativity and cynicism.  I've been giving out a lot of negative rep bumps lately to people who can do nothing except repeat the complaints of their betters (&quot;we haven't been upgraded since kunark!&quot;) without offering any kind of positive input (&quot;this sucks, i'm cancelling my pre-order!&quot;).<br />
<br />
I give positive rep bumps to anyone who can come up with a creative or original idea and give an in-depth description of how it would work.  For example, that suggestion someone had about an Underworld instead of a GY.  I think it's an absolutely horrible idea and I would hate it with a passion, but I think it was very creative and the guy spent a lot of time working on the details and coming up with ideas.  I gave him +rep.  I also give +rep to anyone who makes a very long and informative post to answer someone's question.  If someone asks &quot;what AA's should I get?&quot; and someone just gives them a list, that doesn't impress me (not going to give neg rep for that, of course.)  If someone answers the question by going in to a multi-page reply that obviously took them over an hour to type, they're getting +rep.  I have made many many posts like that myself, and I know how much effort goes in to them.  Giving someone +rep is really the only way I have of expressing my appreciation to the poster.  I also give +rep any time I am factually wrong, and someone corrects me.  Anyone that knows more about EQ than I do is obviously a genius :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, I also give -rep to Coraz at every possible chance, b/c he's a tool who has never contributed anything to this board in over 500 posts.</div></div><hr />

I don't really plan on using this system to pass judgement on others, I just wanted to know how to give a little &quot;Good Job&quot; pat on the back to the people who post some clever/useful ideas for everyone.<br />
<br />
And I wanted to see why someone gave me a negative rep bump (should it ever happen) so I can figure out if I am making offensive / useless posts, and curb it before I get on too many peoples nerves =).<br />
<br />
I don't plan on taking offense, or agreeing with everyone that disagrees with me, but I'd still like to know (in general) if there are any complaints.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The reputation system used here is a silly waste of time.  It's random and arbitrary.  Anyone can give out negative and positive reputation hits left and right for any particular reason.  Some may participate in the system as it's intended to be used but the potential for (and existence of)  corruption within it makes it pointless.  The only way it could ever work would be for it to be moderated which would take way too much time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I understand the system is not very useful, and take all the information displayed on it with a grain of salt.  But I have been on these boards for several months now, and I read almost every post (I am a legal researcher for a living, and I have WAY too much free time between projects) and I am one of those people who like to know everything they can...  especially about things that I am somewhat involved in.  I don't know if I will seriously use the rep system, or ever check my rep score again, but I still like knowing how to.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for all the info.  Very much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The rep system as it is has almost zero impact on most of us, and has only limited purpose:<br />
1.  Assisting the clueless<br />
2.  Intimidating the foolish<br />
<br />
If you wanted a system that was less susceptible to abuse, you could do one of a couple things:<br />
1.  Only allow those with a high enough rep to add/remove rep counters<br />
2.  Add &quot;weight&quot; to points given such that those with higher reps give/take greater value to another's rep than those with low or negative reps.<br />
<br />
Either way, a rep system is mostly just a toy or a gimmick, unless you intend to use it as means to prevent users from posting.  Especially on boards where you can just rank a thread, since it's the content most of us are interested in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">1.  Only allow those with a high enough rep to add/remove rep counters<br />

It was damn entertaining.  Then I posted his IP and banned all his extra accounts.

<br />
By the way, Factors needed inorder to spread reputation:<br />
A.  A new account.<br />
B.  Minimum Post Count of 50 posts.  <br />
C.  A user can give 10 reputation clicks over a 24 hour period<br />
D.  You must give 20 other posters reputation before you can give reputation to the same person.<br />

<br />
Gagner67, yes, I actually do know how the reputation system works. It would be very difficult (although admittedly not impossible) to manipulate the system. Let me just refresh the basics:<br />
<br />
How many posts must a user have before his reputation hits count on others? Minimum Reputation Count 30  <br />
<br />
How much reputation must a user have before his reputation hits count on others? 50 <br />
<br />
Daily Reputation Clicks Limit <br />
<br />
How many reputation clicks can a user give over each 24 hour period? 4  <br />
<br />
Reputation User Spread <br />
<br />
How many different users must you give reputation to before you can hit the same person again?  15 <br />
<br />
Bah, damn simulpost. Yeah, a brand new person starts with 10 rep points. They need at least 50 posts before they can generate reputation. They need at least 30 reputation points. They can only hit 4 times a day (this was updated recently) and if you want to bump yourself, you have to bump 15 people (around 4 days) in between. You can bump for about one point as a newbie. I'm also wondering where your newly created accounts are going to get the 30 rep points necessary, they can't bump each other.<br />

I can always ask Sunmoon change the reputation spread to 50 people, that would make it even more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Just for your information Gloriana what I told you I witnessed with Giac is the honest to god truth.  later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I just did a cut and paste from the admin tool, which is more up to date than the previous post (which dates from what, August?)<br />
<br />
Please tell me how your guildmates (newly registered posters) bumped Giac down. They wouldn't have the ability to do so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">perhaps the confusion is that nothing prevents you from bumping anyones rep (besides the hard limits of per day and per user) even if you can't effect that persons rep.<br />
<br />
I get lots of rep bumps, both positive and negative.  The majority of them are grey dots, because the person bumping does not have enough rep themselves to change mine.  There is no message that tells you your reputation bump doesn't effect that user.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Woot, those bad hits don't count cause Morrigan-VZ and bonestomper didn't have enough rep to affect me.<br />

It just goes to prove that until people at least have to give rep points with their &quot;virtual&quot; self, then rep points will mean less than nothing.<br />
<br />
Btw, thanks for your bump Salorm, and I dare not mess with the instances in time, it's not very stable to say the least, so I'll just have to wait for a few more to drop for us :)</div></div><hr />
