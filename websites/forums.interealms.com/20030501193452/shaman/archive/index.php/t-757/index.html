<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I snatched this from the official SWG forum, where a regular poster was nice enough to create this outline of PVP in SWG. I wish I could give him credit, but I forgot to copy his name (<br />
<br />
Still hoping for an Interealms SWG forum ))))))))<br />
<br />
Here is the outline:<br />
<br />
**************************************<br />
<br />
SWG is divided into three (3) different types of space: <br />
<br />
Truce areas, <br />
<br />
Safe areas, and <br />
<br />
Wild areas (a.k.a. consequence land) <br />
<br />
The types of combat allowed between players in the different types of space are: <br />
<br />
In Truce areas, no one can attack anyone else. <br />
<br />
In Safe areas, players can only attack an enemy. <br />
<br />
In Wild areas, players can attack anyone, but if you attack a non-enemy, you are subject to being outcast; thus the term, consequence land. <br />
<br />
There are several layers of protection to ensure that a non-enemy cannot be attacked on accident: <br />
<br />
The default option will be that non-enemies cannot be attacked in wild space; a player needs to go into their option menu to toggle this default so they can attack a non-enemy, <br />
<br />
The ‘radar’ on the GUI will identify enemies from non-enemies via color-coding, and <br />
<br />
A ‘pop-up’ box will appear when you first try to shoot a non-enemy warning you that you can be outcast if you continue with the action; you need to acknowledge (yes/no) the warning to proceed. <br />
<br />
Your victim can outcast you if they die, in part or in whole, due to the damage that you did to them; damage is ‘healed’ on a FIFO (First In, First Out) basis. <br />
<br />
If you are outcast, you are prevented from initiated an attack against another player, period. However, you are allowed to defend yourself if attacked. This status will apply to every character on your account on that server. Thus, it is possible to move to a new server and ‘get a second chance’. <br />
<br />
The only way to have the outcast status removed on that server is to be forgiven. <br />
<br />
There are two levels of forgiveness: <br />
<br />
Forgiveness by your victim removes the outcast status globally (everywhere); and <br />
<br />
Forgiveness by the mayor of a player-built city removes the outcast status locally (outside the jurisdiction of that city’s government, the outcast status is still effective) <br />
<br />
The second method of forgiveness allows the creation of various levels of ‘personal freedom’ in various zones, dependant upon the existence of a player-built city in that zone. ‘Personal freedoms’ are also affected by the local laws of a player-built city within that zone, and you will be notified of the local laws before entering their jurisdiction. <br />
<br />
One thing to note, only the attacker can be outcast; the defender can always protect themselves. So, if you don’t initiate non-consensual PvP, you don’t have to worry about being outcast. <br />
<br />
************************<br />
<br />
Something I want to add   - if a player declares with a faction - they get access to restricted skills and skill trees, plus special equipment, plus special quest, and zones. In other words - players who declare a faction have a huge huge advantage. The downside - is that declared characters can pretty much attack each other anywhere.<br />
<br />
This makes SWG defacto RED, in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Carebear is just not going to be an attractive option on SWG (<br />
