<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Finally dinged 60 last night :)<br />
<br />
Did from half way through 55 to 60 in just under 3 weeks, mainly soloing.  59 Took me three days (3 very long days :D).<br />
<br />
Would just like to say thanks everyone here for all the advice and info that has helped me a lot through the life of my shaman.  Also want to send a quick thanks to Scurg.  Was kinda stuck in a rut at 55 and was reading these boards one day and saw Scurg had hit Oracle.  I am sure I remember you being around my level (even just slightly behind) and it served as a bit of a kick up the backside for me.<br />
<br />
Was lucky enough to have both Torpor and Malo to mem as well.  Torpor is just incredible :).<br />

<br />
I have found also that soloing is the fast way to get exp post 50, not very gear inducing to solo, but boy it's nice watching the bar move every kill.  Took me about 12 hours or so to get through 51 and I'm noticing 52 moves about the same. KEI is a godsend ;) <br />
<br />
Grats again.</div></div><hr />

Gonna take a week or so off xp me thinks - start some quests (coldain ring, earing of solstice) and stuff - then will start on the path to CanniV.  Did 6 points of AA when I was 54 (rs3 and reg3) so am already on my way :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I solo a lot too and notice the experience coming in faster...plus I rarely die solo. However I do group from time to time to stop myself from bagging my head off the monitor :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Congrats! Will be another year before I get to 60.... maybe.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">55-60 Im guessing he did at Katta killing guards. 58-60 May have killed katta Gargoloyes...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">55-60 Im guessing he did at Katta killing guards. 58-60 May have killed katta Gargoloyes...<br />
<br />
<br />
Did 55-57 in High Hold Keep, then moved to Katta.  Did bits of 57 and 58 duo'd with a beastlord friend, but a fair bit solo (including all of 59).<br />
<br />
Looking at my log files I would estimate that I have killed/been involved in killing approximately 1700 katta guards.  Exceptionally boring, but worth every moment of it.  <br />
<br />
I always worried that 60 would spell the end of the game for me, but I now realise it has only just begun.  I can now go anywhere and do anything without feeling that my time might be better spent getting towards 60.  I am also much more useful to my friends that I like to group with.  I have now started doing the quests that I have wanted to do (coldain ring/earring of solstice etc) and am not so bothered about wasting time farming stuff.<br />
<br />
P.S. If you are gonna grind out 59 like that make sure you have either a) great mates/guildies to keep you sane, b) another pc to read forums all the time (after that many guards you only really need to look at the screen to pull), c) both :)<br />
<br />
P.P.S Thanks for all the grats ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sheylock</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Grats on 60, Kronen :)<br />
<br />
Quick question: which of the guards in Katta were you going after? I am kinda tempted to get my monk/shaman twins up there and have my monk kill them solo to get through 59. <br />
<br />
I used to kill the ones at the Twilight zone for a while, didn't seem like the major exp kick though. Maybe I simply was in the wrong place :)</div></div><hr />
