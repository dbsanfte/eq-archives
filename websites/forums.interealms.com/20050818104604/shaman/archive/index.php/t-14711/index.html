<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Warning Long Post<br />
<br />
Background- <br />
I am a lvl 63 shaman with only 25 aa points. I have been holding off trying to get torpor before I spend my aa points into canni5.<br />
<br />
Recently I had quit playing my shaman and started playing a necro because no matter how hard I tried I could not seem to keep up with the cost of my spells.  I dont have pox and the only lvl 60 spell I have is Avatar (Gorenair dropped Torpor , malo and avatar all at once.) I was 59 at the time so only other shaman got all three and gave me avatar to smooth things out a bit (Thanks!!).  After funding my wifes 8th shawl I have been unable to come up with more than 5k at any one time.<br />
<br />
Recently when going to veksar to pick up a soulscream belt for my wife we we met a cleric a mage and another necro. (lvl 59-65)<br />
After grouping with these guys for a few hours I decided that it would really help the group if I brought out the shaman.  As soon as I dusted off the shaman our kill rate trippled and everyone was thrilled (holding 3 camps now instead of the one).<br />
1 hour later we get our first haste belt and my wife wins. <br />
8 hours later everyone but myself has won a belt and equiped their alts with them...  People feel sorry for me and tell me to loot a kylong bp.  Since I had better i ended up giving this to the cleric btw.  We called it a night.  Since I had alot of fun actually using my shaman again for a change and thought I might be able to afford my spells if one of these belts drops and I get to win one (after all everyone else did...) I was excited that the group formed again the next day.  Well we are there for 10 minutes and another belt drops.  Everyone rolls because its &quot;a new day&quot; and the cleric wins his second belt. He promplty send the guild a tell saying &quot;heres a belt for ya bud&quot; and gives it to a friend.  <br />
<br />
End of story:  I have been grouping with these people for about 2 weeks now and the only thing I have looted has been yaeths 118 and another kylong bp.  They have equiped at least 4 more alts with the belts and assorted other items.  Whenever the words to my spells drop I basically have to beg to even get them and then if another copy of the words drops they keep them to sell.<br />
<br />
The main thing I would like to discuss here is : <br />
1) Should I stay in this group and just keep getting the shaft and play a character that I have retired for this very reason?<br />
2) Should I just deal with it and continue to group with these people like my wife has asked me to&gt; (shes a 63 pali and has trouble finding groups)<br />
3) Should i start ninja looting and just tell them to kiss my ass until i get my spells. (j.k)<br />
4) Just start bringing the necro again and retire the shaman again because everyone in this game thinks we should have to pay 60kpp so that we can save THEIR ass in battle after wasting all of our mana trynig to buff the bastards.<br />
<br />
Thanks and sorry if this post was entirely to long...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ask yourself why you are grouping with them. Are you becoming friends with them or is it a business relationship? If it's friends, then talk to them and tell them your situation and see what you can work out. If it's a business relationship then every day is a new day and you have to accept the roll of the dice. Discuss with them the loot rules and stick by them, whether it be roll on every item, roll if you haven't won yet, whatever. Decide BEFORE you start so no one can complain after, or have a valid complaint at least. People will complain about anything and everything no matter what you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What I would do is go to a nice loot filled dungeon dou with your wife. Try OS or Chardok. At your levels and with her being able to use lull to single Pull most camps should be trivial. I'd say screw the greedy fools ya been grouping with and go and get some loot on your own. Theres a lot of dungeons you could probably handle with just the two of ya where you'll both come out ok in terms of loot, or if your wife really loves ya she'll let ya have it all until ya can buy the spells ya need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharkus Greenfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree with Stol.  Alot of high level people are getting needy(greedy) because the loot in PoP zones is pretty nil compared to cash camps like OS.  Try going back to the high end Kunark dungeons for better money.  Working as a pair you'll be amazed at what you can do plus you'll have alot less people to roll against.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharlok_Bonespirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would do . . .<br />
<br />
5) Explain the situation to the group and give them a chance to understand the issue and resolve it.<br />
<br />
If that didn't work out, I'd tell them to find a new shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't do pickup groups at all because I don't want to deal with this kind of garbage.  That also means that some nights I end up soloing or working on tradeskills iinstead of grouping, which is a price I gladly accept. <br />
<br />
If I were grouped with my friends/guild we'd go back until everyone had one.  *Then* we might start on alts.  <br />
<br />
That's the kind of environment I have in EQ because that is the way I choose to play.  I don't put up with this sort of behavior at all.<br />
<br />
I don't have a wife (or in my case a husband to deal with either) though.   Are yall guilded?  If so, why not try some guild groups?  Or try making a regular bunch of friends to group with.  That's what I'd do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">In pickup groups the expectation is generally that everyone will roll on everything, unless they have already won something.  <br />
<br />
If you do not like that system (and many do not) then you can usually specify at the beginning of the group (ie: before any loot drops) that you are looking for an NBG group (need before greed).  If the rest of the group is fine with that then you are set; if not then you haven't wasted any time grouping with them.  <br />
<br />
I've always found the &quot;it's a new day&quot; argument to be kind of annoying, especially when people use it simply because one person left the group and was replaced.  If I were in a group like the one you describe, I would tell them to find a new shaman.  Actually, come to think of it, I would more specifically tell them to find a new camp since I was going to solo this one and they were dead weight anyway...  :)<br />
<br />
If it is a constant group (you mentioned you had spent two weeks with them) then why should you receive nothing for your effort?  Are you not contributing equally?  If it was a different group makeup every day, then you'd probably have to live with the roll of the dice.<br />
<br />
Loot is always a sticky issue, but basically I would suggest that since the item you're looking for is a fairly common drop you should just say &quot;since this is a regular group and this item drops frequently, lets take turns on the belts&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It sounds to me like they are taking advantage of you.<br />
<br />
Speak up about what you want, and why.  If they are friends/guildmates they should care enough to share the wealth.  If not, dump em and duo with your wife.  A shaman/paladin group while not the fastest kills is definately a solid group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well I for one hope you don't drop the shaman. A sweeping generalization here, but there's a hoarde of players I've met in game that are greedy, malicious and most particularly, patronizing. By your post your definitely not one of them, so I hope you stay as a shaman and keep giving us shaman a good rep.<br />
<br />
I think you have more than a right to state your issue with the group. If it doesn't go down well, leave them and get a guild (I'm assuming you haven't already).<br />
<br />
Which server are you on? I'm sure someone here could suggest a decent guild where you'll find people who play fair. It's the main reason I finally joined a guild after 3 years in Everquest. The general populace just started to piss me off too much. I'm finding the game much more enjoyable again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">they like to group with you, because you take it in the backside.<br />
<br />
you group with them because of your wife.<br />
<br />
i am glad my wife doesn't play the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do what you are good at and do it for profit. XP and loot = power. Both should be distributed equally amongst those who earned it. Meaning: If he ain't contributing, toss em, and if everyone is, divide it up fairly, or do without my services. Either way you go, if you stick to this, you ALWAYS win, by either getting your fair share, or evading being taken advantage of.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, NBG was always good enough for the majority of players until DKP showed up. NBG was tossed in favor of DKP due to the necessity of a more &quot;fair&quot; system, in which effort was rewarded more often. Downside: much like jobs in any large corperation, as long as you clock in, you keep collecting a paycheck (DKP). NBG downside: People who don't understand what the word &quot;need&quot; really means. <br />
<br />
Sounds to me like you are grouping with what EQ so lovingly refers to as &quot;lootwhores&quot;. These people are the scum of Norrath. Unfortunatley, although there are a miniscule part of the EQ playerbase, they find haven from enough desperate guild who need the body in the raids, or worse yet, band together for the common cause. Most of the banding don't last long (go to the RN server and watch the fun) but they can wreak havoc while they DO last. <br />
<br />
Get outta there and go soloing pal. Find some people to group with if you must, but if their vocabularies contain only the monosyllablic words &quot;me&quot; , &quot;mine&quot;, or manage have a hotkey for &quot;My twink needs that&quot;, then it's time to re-evaluate your role in EQ. Sounded to me like you made a shaman, not a doormat. Stand up for yourself dammit, you are valuble. <br />
<br />
 It's bad enough that your employer, neighbors and government cornholes you for your efforts every day of your life. No sense in allowing it in EQ as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jebeksis Stormcaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Call it the &quot;non-melee steamroller.&quot; Remember back in the day when the melee's were all screaming NBG because 90% of good drops were melee? Now that things are evened up a bit (runes in BoT, etc) they suddently want to roll on it all. I love losing runes to a monk when I gave up RBGs for those same people way back when. See, this is why I avoid groups with people I don't know and trust.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Tell them your concerns.  Or charge them for casting spells on them.   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Loot camps tend to bring out the greedy, the selfish in people.  Even among friends.  For this reason I decided a while back to avoid camping loot with groups unless I know everyone and we talk loot distribution out beforehand.<br />
<br />
Don't worry.. you're a shaman, you're great solo or in a duo.  And a paladin is a great partner, one of the best.  So just dump the group (it sounds like they're being unfair and unreasonable) and go find a tough but rewarding place to solo or duo in the planes, in Sebilis, in Chardok, in Cazic Thule...<br />
<br />
And so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In any pickup group that is gonna last a decent amount of time, my rule of thumb is that once you win a &quot;good&quot; drop, you &quot;pass&quot; until everyone in the group has a good drop....once everyone has wone something decent, you start again. Its fair, it works, and if people in a pickup aint happy with it, I disband and LFG somewhere else</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I really like the ML/split idea.  When I play with my normal group of friends, we do this on the vendor trash(pretty standard in a lot of groups) and any sellable drops that no one needs.  If you can find a few people who will stick to this with you, and you trust enough to take some things to go sell in the bazaar, and split up later, this is a great system.  No more losing out to the RNG.  As for taking stuff for alts, we typically don't, unless we have had several of the particular item drop, or it's something we specifically decided to camp for an alt.<br />
<br />
This is just for my normal playing group.  When I venture out to the random pick up group, I settle for rolling.  I'm usually too nice, and won't roll on stuff if it IS an upgrade for someone though.<br />
<br />
Try suggesting this to your friends.  I think it works out for the best for everyone in the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, my guild groups usually do what Hibbert said if no one would wear the item.<br />
<br />
One of us vendor it, then give an equal share to everyone in the party.  It's nice because everyone gets a decent chunk of money instead of one person getting a ****load and everyone else left with jack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't understand how, in 8 hours, everyone had won one for themselves AND their alts, and you still had not.  I totally agree with a straight random on pickup groups, but once someone has won (especially a duplicate item), they can **** and sit the roll out.  When all characters that are present and contributing have one, THEN we can see about alts.  Lose those *******s.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I group with friends sometimes, people I know to be honest.  Here's an example of how a recent hunting trip went. <br />
I zone into Plane of Tactics and invite my friend (65 druid) Khan, we make our way to the pit.  We get in the room and I make the pull that gets him a &quot;pet&quot; boar.  We start to slay.  Several frenzied initiates later we have two spec parchments.  I loot both.  Later on we intercept piggy from a stampede and a very very nice droppable shield drops.  I loot this too.  <br />
We end the trip about 2 hours later with another AA and change and some lewts.  I sell the cash stuff, do a /split, then turn in the parches to the druid NPC.  I get Blessing of Replenishment, which Khan needs as his last PoP spell so it's his obv.  I get the fast heal spell too.  I give the spell and the shield to khan, who puts them on his bazaar mule.  I log out.  I log in later that evening.  Shield and spell have sold.  I get my split: 22500pp.<br />
<br />
Not a bad day's work eh?  Both of us were very happy.  Both were winners.  No losers.  We didn't roll the uber valuable (30k sold for) shield, we sold it and split profits.  <br />
<br />
That's just an idea.  If you know the folks you'll exp with well enuf for a mutual trust, you can rake in serious cash by cooperating rather than trusting the dice.  Chances are, you'll have more fun and cause more good feeling between you and your partners as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wish I had a uber partner like you Lan, not just talking about levels but mindset also. I have a few friends who are in the second best guild on our server, and they occasionally when not raiding help me with xp, and if anything drops I need and they don't they let me have it. It just sucks that they raid so much i might get lucky and get 2-3 hours with them every other week. Good friends make EQ fun, loot whores make me want to go and play by myself or go play diablo2 for the gazillionth time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I prefer the the Master Looter method as well.  ML loots all the drops and VT.  At the end of the &quot;session&quot; just have everyone roll.  Highest gets to choose one loot first.  Second highest chooses next and so forth.  People who dont get loot split the VT.  Not perfect but it is a good method in pickup groups where several items drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I haven't done pick up groups in ages. Lately all my exping has been in the elemental planes so pick up groups aren't even really possible. But for the most part things are simple with loot (mostly tradeskill things) those who need then split them among those who need. When we've had no one in group who needed something particular it's either gone to the guild for someone who needs it or been made into something, sold in the bazaar and split between everyone. Rescently that was a set of earth silk legs which sold for a nice chunk of change and netted everyone in the group over 10k each.<br />
<br />
As far as your situation I would talk to them and let them know your concerns. If your a regular group and go back to the same place repeatedly like you said there's no reason things should start over just because your coming back the next day.<br />
<br />
As others have said a pally/shaman makes a pretty good combo and the 2 of ya could probably do pretty well on your own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I almost always master loot for groups that I'm in.  EVERYTHING is NBG first, nodrops /randomed immediately, everything else /randomed at end of night.  There is no such things as &quot;for alts&quot;.  NBG means you will equip it to replace something you have and use it &gt; 50% of the time you adventure.   Rarely have had to worry about &quot;resist gear&quot; type rolls so far, but when somethign like that has dropped it would go to a &gt;50% use person before it would fall to a &quot;resist gear&quot; person.  Once you get a NBG item, you get no more NBG items unless you are the only NBG person on that item.  Once you get an NBG item, you can't have a &quot;gravy&quot; item until everyone has gotten one item (nbg or gravy).  If you got 2 NBG items, you can't get gravy until everyone else has a combination of 2 items of nbg and gravy.    I sell all vendor loot at end of the night and then /split the proceeds.   I'm always encumbered not long into the night ;-)<br />
<br />
In my RL Friends group, when the second string started getting higher levels and could replace the primary in the group, we started letting a person decide which character they were bringing based on where we were going as long as &quot;base group needs&quot; were met.<br />
<br />
Exception on rolling for alts (rl friends group only) - If no one needs a SPELL in group but there is an alt within 10 levels that could use, then alt gets the spell.  Trying to avoid having anyone in RL friends group pay for spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thank you all for your insight.  I am glad that I posted here as I have definitly learned alot about this issue.  <br />
<br />
I have spoken with the group again about this and mentioned that I will not stand for this in a guild/friend group.  I reminded them of the benefit to the entire group that I have been and basically told them that if they dont start at the least rolling on all loot with 2 different loot tables (one for vt and one for big ticket items) I will no longer be able to group with them.  <br />
I finally managed to get something of value out of this group( ID3 Bracelet with some stats). And it seems that everyone is willing to work on this (of course this is based more on a business group than a friend/guild group and I am sure there will be problems with it down the road when someone loots something someone else really wants...)<br />
<br />
I really wish I could find a group like some of you have mentioned that just wants to explore and then is willing to sell anything our ACTUAL characters cant use and then go sell them and split the proceeds.  Seems to me like that would the best way to go about this thing.<br />
<br />
But anyhow Thanks again all for your great advise and insight!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sounds  a bit improved. Perhaps they wised up and realized they need you more than you need them... a pallie is great in veksar vs the undead, I would imagine you and your wife can easily duo some lucrative camps there. However, good slowers are hardly a dime a dozen.<br />
<br />
NBG is often a crock. You see people hiding gear all the time. I'm sorry... you didnt bother gearing up your character so want charity? Sounds like you are doing LESS work so should be rewarded LESS. I do it in guild groups, and with friends, and in general with strangers, but if I am in a pickup BoT group as my shaman, and a ornate plate molds drops, I am damn well rolling. My roommate could use it, and theres no way of knowing if the plate wearer didnt dust out the old velious armor right before the camp anyways. Get a good group of pals and this wont be an issue. With pickup groups yer taking your chances. I personally prefer the masterlooter bazaar mule option when doing cash camps with friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Pick up groups are greed only in my book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I would say that you should tell them your situation and I am sure they will help. Also, it seems to me you may be perpetuating the situation. I mean, everyone one a belt so they started equiping their alts? You should have said the next one is mine then we go to alts if you need the cash. I have never been in a group where they didn't ask if anyone wanted an item before handing it to an alt. I will pass on loot if a group member needs it and I can't use it but if everyone in the group has it or does not need it, you bet I am gonna take it. Don't equip all their alts till you get one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">From your initial post I get the impression that these are random people you happened to hook up with as opposed to actual friends or guildies. If the agreed upon loot rules are to random, then your personal situation isn't relevant. Just stick it out untill you actually win a roll. <br />
<br />
If they're randoming belts that seem to drop commonly enough that everyone has managed to aquire one and equip alts by winning on random rolls ... You must be insanely unlucky not to have won at least once. I sympathise with your situation but it occurs to me that the rolls could have gone the other way and you could be the one equipping alts and friends, in which case I doubt we would be discussing how greedy &quot;the others&quot; are for not giving you preferential treatment in a pickup group and defaulting you a belt. If you don't agree with the way loot is taken care of, then you find another group. <br />

I'm sorry to hear things aren't going so well for you but hang in there.  I think a lot of the shammies here will tell you that you can play a shammy fine without some of those 60 spells.  I have Focus and Malo and no Torpor (still saving) and I'm doing ok.  Now when I get canni 5 like I'm working towards I might be in trouble LOL.  But for now I can still play and have fun.<br />
<br />
It's up to you.  Do the spells mean that much to you that you'd retire your char if you don't have them?  If so then maybe you should retire.  If the class itself is what makes the char fun (like it does for me), then which spells you have shouldn't make that much difference.<br />

Good luck to you and gimme a purr if I ever run by.</div></div><hr />
