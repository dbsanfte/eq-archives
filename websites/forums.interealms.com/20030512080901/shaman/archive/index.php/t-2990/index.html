<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>budakai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had a question.   I have been hunting in CoM with a 60 ranger, and i have been able to loot a few Ghiosk Books.  I am now ALLY with Truespirit and i have done the entire epic up to Ghiosk, but no further..    Have they nerfed the cheat where you can skip the hole part?  ( i know its not that hard, but unfortunetly i dont think i have enough friends who are able to help me do that).  Also since i am ally and i have not done the Kurn part, have I accidentally screwed myself over from completing the remaining part of my epic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Possibly.  The Ghiosk books should stop giving you faction at a point (possibly low Ally)...  You need to do Kirn and Nek to finish getting your faction up to where it needs to be for Rak to agro upon you when you provide him the tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personaly from someone who did epic step by step part by part. If you try to skip some of it and he eats your tear dont cry about it latter cuss you did it to your self.<br />
<br />
I did epic start to finnish and had np at any time. I did it step by step turning everything in in order. The only part I did twice was to take the gem from NFP to wisp island. The only reason I did this is becuse I gated when the shark attacked and had forgot to rebind at the island (DOH) I was around lv45 at the time.</div></div><hr />
