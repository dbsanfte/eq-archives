<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got my new spear, and was wondering whats a good place to start soloing?<br />
<br />
PoJ is a nice place but I find one add and I have to zone.<br />
<br />
No regen and no JBB, got a horse though.<br />
<br />
Eqipment in my profile.<br />
<br />
Wouldent mind a little cash also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sedax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Katta guards just past zi from Twilight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yeah katta guards at twilight are good<br />
chardok zi zo aren't bad either. I'm not sure though might be a bit rough at 56 depending on gear<br />
you can do another level in HHK but katta is gonna be better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I will try the guards, thanks.<br />
<br />
BTW, how would the raptors in TD be? I hear they be good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i dunno. never hunted them, I think they are pretty much a spot for the droods to quad. i could be wrong<br />
<br />
i killed a few on a BL epic raid. they are very easy, but i seem to remember seeing LBs..not sure about this though.<br />
<br />
they didn't seem like good exp at all, but i'm higher, and i'm spoiled by grouping in pop.<br />
<br />
i just can't stand to go all the way out to the middle of td.. :)</div></div><hr />
