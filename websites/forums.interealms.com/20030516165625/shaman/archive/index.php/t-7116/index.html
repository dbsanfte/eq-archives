<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">welp when i go to install it.  it goes thrue the first disk just fine in. when it prompts me to put in the second disk i do so.<br />
<br />
Now is where the problems start :(   when the second disk is in it says there is no disk or incorrect path or somethign along those lines (at work so cant remember exactly what it said) i checked the path and it is the same as the original path and the one all other expansions have used.<br />
<br />
i click on E:/ (thats my drive for cd-roms) it says to type manuel links or something..  (ex. e:/install.....e:/setup)  non of the common ones seam to work i tryed VI tech support and got busy signels for the last 3 days...<br />
<br />
If anyone has any ideas i would greatly appreciate it.<br />
