No  :D .<br />
<br />
But we could agree on tuning down the whining and flaming a bit and keeping the discussion in some central threads as opposed to all over the board.<br />

And if SOE will now ignore us again and we accept it yet again, then we will be STILL standing where we have been now for years. We wont be moving on by letting this stuff just drop. &quot;Get over it&quot; is stupidest advice one can give regarding this, we've been getting over it for far too long now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Increasing the number of whine threads isn't really going to make them change our class.  So I kinda agree with Sharok in that maybe keeping a number of threads going with discussion would be way more beneficial to our cause and way less detrimental to the health of the board.<br />
<br />
I very much disagree about getting over it though.  That just doesn't help anything.  Been there, done that.<br />

Hail,<br />
<br />
Maybe we could start moving or merging the whine threads then,  :confused: oh beautiful moderator. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Kinda hard to not read it when the page is flooded with them though i think we agree on. I mean yea, no one is asking for the muzzle to be put on, but its a lil silly at this point.<br />
<br />
Banadan. Look around. Im not saying nothing matters, im saying WE need to move on from this particular issue cause its getting unhealthy. Think about what exactly those threads are doing at this point. Are they a positive influence to bring change for the class that we all want? Or are they scources of infectious negitivity that is only hurting you and others around you. There is a time to fight and a time to move on and get over it. Now is the time for the latter of the 2.<br />
<br />
Anyway my point was made and message given. I know im far from alone here so im not about to argue about it.<br />
<br />
Peace all.</div></div><hr />

I would say, the bitching about bitching about bitching about GoD.<br />

That's great advise... Right up there, with &quot;Lie back and think of England&quot;.<br />
<br />
SOE has demonstrated over and over that, as far as they're concerned, the squeeky wheel was the one getting greased. <br />
<br />
I would so much prefer that they be open to the calm, reasoned approach we're have attempted, with a healthy debate and exchange of concerns and idea between this community and the developers. And yeah, the whining and the flaming is getting tedious, irritating, ****ING annoying even. <br />
<br />
But we ain't balanced. We're stagnant. Not only that, but every nice, distinctive touches the class had is slowly getting carved out and distributed to the other classes. All thing considered, I would rather not end up a weak beastlord, with pally heals, ranger armor and healer HPs. <br />
<br />
While I don't agree with the methods, I definitely agree with the goals. On the other end, with all the whining and flaming about whining and flaming this board has seen in the last week, others don't seem to share THAT point of view. If you're so complacent and supine that you won't help... at least, shut the **** up and don't hinder. It's not like the class is going to get any less pleasant to play because of anything that'll come from this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">But i ask you this. Does this not all seem just a lil familar? Have we not done this before?<br />
<br />
See me as a shaman i remember a time when our way was not the way of anger and threats. I rememeber when our way was of intellectual discusion, pasring and knowledge exchange.<br />
<br />
Please anyone else that will reply to this thread, try to focus on this next statement.....<br />
<br />
My point is not that we lie back and take it. No where have i explicitly said that you should not voice your concerns, infact the only part of this im really addressing this thread is the shock and awe about GoD and how bad it is. No where have i suggest that you do or do not voice class concerns, so please direct those comments to the appropriate place or use intelligance and ask me if thats what i mean before writing off my words and givng me bad rep points ( oh nooss!1!@#  lol )<br />
<br />
I wonder if i was a SoE rep, who im going to bother reading and listening to. A post or comment/communication that is filled with hatred and despair and flaming. Or the intelligent, coolheaded and thought out approach to getting yourself heard, like the thread Glori helped put together. I cant profess to tell anyone what to think, i can only request that you DO think and with that request i ask you think specificly about what i mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Are we the same shaman that looked at ather classes like the druids grove and shake our heads? Or are we know as bad as they were. I very much remember the time where we all thought it would be a good idea to start bitching and complaning as much as them cause they seemed to get the attention and it appeared that the squeaky wheel got the grease and i was right there bitching with everyone trying to squeak like a sombish. But i think its quite clear that no, the squeaky wheel doesnt get the grease, it just squeaks alot.<br />
<br />
<br />
I challange you to reflect on the shaman you were a year ago, to openly look at yourself unhindered by a framework of thought created by frustration. I challange you to look at yourself and ask, am i bringing the most creative and positive change to my class when i make the 5th thread on the first page valiantly exclaming, again, that we are so broke and everything sucks.<br />
<br />
No one is claming we are perfect, but i think 9 threads all dealing with the same topic that do not involve intelligent discussion but rather yelling and flaming and fistshaking interaction is simply not what i remember this community being. That is all.<br />
<br />
<br />
This thread is now yours. /does a spin and glides off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bah, EQ is easy to quit.<br />
<br />
I've done it 4 times now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As much I would prefer the SOE employees to be high-minded, reasonable people, their public track record over the last 5 years is that they won't deal with problems or suggestion or feedback... they'll deal with noise.<br />
<br />
And, as whiny as this board ever got, it never got within a couple orders of magnitude of how whiny the other class boards got. And look where that got THEM.<br />
<br />
So, yes it's unpleasant. Beyong unpleasant... it's an affront to our diginity, to be reduced to take our turn being a whiny kid throwing a temper tantrum. To say it's useless is, sadly enough as a matter of record, wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it's very very very obvious which threads are GOD bitch threads, avoid them if you don't want to read them, otherwise, kindly **** yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think that the negaitvity is an expression of a couple things:<br />
<br />
1. We have tried to use calm, reflective, and and intellegent posts to get a bit of attention to our problems...... FAILED to achieve anything.<br />
<br />
2. We have bitched and whined on every board imaginable....<br />
FAILED to achieve anything.<br />
<br />
3. We all have posted our problems with shaman, and possible solutions to those problems multiple times..... FAILED to achieve anything.<br />
<br />
4. We all came together and agreed to the top four problems and in a well thought out and lucid letter, informed Sony of the problems and possible solutions..... FAILED to achieve anything.<br />
<br />
5. Tried to ask questions directly to a CService rep on the live chat. FAILED to achieve anything.<br />
<br />
6. Tried to discuss shaman concerns AFTER the live chat. FAILED to achieve anything.....<br />
<br />
So, Lots and lots of us are at our wits end with this ****. True its not really proactive to continue to bitch and moan.... But, the irritation and frustration after all the hard work of some here is now bubbling to the top.<br />
<br />
I know Im so frustrated personally that I dont wanna bother with a shaman anymore except to PL my Zerker... Hell, If I could get away with it I wouldnt buy GoD at all... but I owe my guild alot and we will be doing the GoD content alot so I have to get it.<br />
<br />
I see the threads here move of a blowing off of steam than whining.... Seriously no other class wants to hear us complain cause they all live in the Kunark era and think we are gods.... Guild boards arent the place to blow off steam either so where else would you suggest some of the people here go?<br />
<br />
If we cant get some understanding from our brothers and sisters of the shaman class who is it we are supposed to turn to?<br />
<br />
The complaints will get much much worse people.... GoD mobs are a upgrade in hps/dps/AEs/Magic resistance etc...... With no upgrades for ages we are gonna struggle like no other class.... <br />
<br />
Its gonna get worse before it gets better.... count on it....</div></div><hr />

I'm still playing my shaman at 100%, I still get groups same as I did before. The Crucible is so not what it used to be, a collection of people who play one of the most awesome classes in EQ and are proud of it. Now it's about it's, no, worse than Monkly-Business. Says something considering I still read there daily and not The Crucible anymore.<br />
