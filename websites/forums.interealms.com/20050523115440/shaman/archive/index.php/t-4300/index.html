<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey Yo:<br />
<br />
I currently have Jaundiced Bone Arms on my Shaman and would like an upgrade.  My retired monk has some Grey Flesh Sleeves I could nab, or I could trade them for some Barbed Ringmail or Crystal Chitin ones.  Any advice would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
This:<br />
<br />
Hardened Grey Flesh Sleeves<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: ARMS  <br />
AC: 16<br />
STR: +6  DEX: +6  STA: +6  HP: +25  <br />
SV COLD: +5  <br />
<br />
or this:<br />
<br />
Crystal Chitin Armplates<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: ARMS  <br />
AC: 18<br />
STR: +5  STA: +5  HP: +10  <br />
<br />
<br />
Also I am thinking about scrapping the monk altogether and spending the 20-30k pp on my Shaman, if anyone can be bothered to look at my profile and tell me what they might upgrade, I would appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm..Obolus Death Shroud or Crystaline Torc for Mana Preservation 3 might be a good idea. Makes medding/canning 10% better and your mana pool 10% bigger all at once. :)<br />
<br />
You can probably buy Earring of Solstice for 15k or so.<br />
<br />
As for the above 2 arms, I'd stick with the grey flesh cuz of higher HP and 1 more sta. that'll offset the lower 2AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm wanting to change my arms from Crystal Chitin to Grey flesh sleeves currently.  So I would go with Grey Flesh.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sweet deal, thanks!   <br />
<br />
It's really cool that with the deluge of equipment posts on this board, people still give good quick responses.<br />
<br />
Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katnyp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just upgraded my sleeves yesterday. I was able to find a pair of Barbed Ringmail Sleeves in Bazaar for 4k on Druzzil Ro. I did some checking with friends who group in Velks and heard that these are a rare drop from the castle, so I didn't mind paying as much as a Barbed Ringmail BP. Between the two sets of sleeves you mentioned, I think this would be in your price range.<br />
<br />
Barbed Ringmail Sleeves   <br />
MAGIC ITEM  <br />
AC: +20 Dex: +3 Wis: +3  <br />
Weight: 4.5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I went on a little shopping spree last night.  I sold my monk's IFS and bought Barbed Dragonscale Boots, and a Seahorse Cloak.  I also traded my Gantru Charm for a Goranga Idol, and my Cobalt Drake belt for a Spider Fur one.  I am having a hard time letting go of my Cloak of Truth as this combo puts me at 143 wisdom.  The HP bonus is nice though.  I will test it out and see how much the reduced mana pool effects me.<br />
