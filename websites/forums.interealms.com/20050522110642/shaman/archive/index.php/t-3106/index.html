<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moglyzok Moogleman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im sorry if i am repeating anyone, or if tons of people know about this, but nevertheless a great way to get around is to bind yourself in the nexus, just gate and you have access to all of the continents except for odus.  Again im sorry if this is quite popular or if its already been said, but just letting ya know so u dont have to spend a noticable amount of money for young lvls on ports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep, it's the new firepots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would have access to odus, they shar a spire with velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, I used to be bound at the Nexus but now I'm at the Firepots.  I've been doing lots of soloing or groupin in The Hole, occassionally soloing Seafurbies and DL or EJ aren't that hard to run to as long as you have invis.<br />
<br />
GD is the hardest to get to but all you have to do is go to GFay or Tox &amp; ride the spires.<br />

<br />
One way that is also convenient is to bind in the fire pots.  From the fire pots you can port to Greater Fay, and ride the spires to the Nexus.  And the old world cities are very handy for people working on trade skills.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately the fire pots do not provide easy access to Velious.   You can cover this hole fairly cheaply with Thurgadin gate potions though.  Worst case scenarior you can head to Gfay, ride the spires to Nexus, and then ride the Nexus portal down to Gd.  But I strongly recommend the Thurg gate potion route -- has a 10 second cast, so can sometimes even serve as a &quot;Get me out of here NOW!&quot; ticket.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Bound in nexus, can get to the Overthere with proc hammer, gate to innothule with portstone, and most times have a thurg gate potion on me.  Druids?  I dun need no stinkin druids!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to be a bound in the nexus, but recently tried the firepots. The insta port and whider choice of the firepots is great. The only neg thing is no ports to Velious or Luclin (H9 luclin anyway).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">binding in nexus is the new, hip thing to do!<br />
<br />
if you dont do it, you arnt cool</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I also prefer firepots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I prefer the Bazaar meself.<br />
<br />
As Gikk said, with Luclin bind, OT Hammer, Innothule Gate Potion and Thurg Gate Potion I can get to any continent.<br />
<br />
On top of that, all my guilds druids are bound in the bazaar and it is becoming a very popular trade zone (will be even more so when the new interface and bazaar code go live).  I would rather have to spend a bit of time running around to get to places than have to catch the spires up to Luclin everytime.  Nothing I hate more than sitting around and waiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm really paranoid about using the firepots, myself.  I'm sure that some time I'm going to accidently click the wrong fire pot and find myself instantly transported into a mob of angry trolls somewhere in Grobb and I'll get lost and die and never find my corpse.<br />
<br />
Just thinking about it makes me break out in a cold sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Grobb fire puts you about three feet from the zone to Innothule. <br />
<br />
The Neriak one, though, puts you in Third Gate if I remember right, which would be a bad place to be if you don't know anything about Neriak. But, hey, start a dark elf and level to 6 or 8 or so and you should learn the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I bound myself at firepots about a month ago,  as a barbarian, I'm yet to hit a pot for a kos town that got me killed (and I've ported into all of them).  neriak is the only town that doesn't put you right at the line to zone out (in the evil cities).  I think if you're evil some of the good pots will get ya killed, you're evil, what do you expect.<br />
<br />
Another perk is you can hit the pots while invis is up and it stays if you're really that worried about it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">teh neriak pot port you to neriak commons at foreign quarter zone.PoD in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I've got the gatestone to innothule(antonica), thurg potion to velious, overthere hammer to Kunark, and am bound in Luclin.  <br />
<br />
The only continent I can't get to is Faydwer, but who cares?  There's nothing interesting there at all unless you're low level.<br />
<br />
I find being bound in Luclin is much more useful than being bound at the firepots.  Whenever there is a guild raid on, there's always a druid or wizzie bound in nexus or bazaar to grab me and port me and a bunch of people all at once instead of hopping around to different hotspots you would get to (well, eventually....) if you bound at firepots.<br />
<br />
If you need to get somewhere quickly, it's much better for someone whose guild raids regularly.<br />
<br />
Just on my own, though, the overthere hammer/gatestone/thurg potion solutions get me most anywhere I need to be easily, and binding in Luclin or the firepots is just gravy.  The game has come a long way in making places easier to get to now.<br />
<br />
Thurg potion is a real life saver too!</div></div><hr />
