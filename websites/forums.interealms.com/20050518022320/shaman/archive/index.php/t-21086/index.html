<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">k got my 46 bard i am goig to start 2boxin with and which class do u think out of the shaman or cleric would make the better partner? i dont care which one is easier to controll i just want to know which one would better suite the bard... to give you a better idea of what i want my duo to be here is some info... i want to be able to exp to 65 whitout a problem(like if i cant get a group i want to be able to just go exp myself and be able to make good exp,otherwise i dont want alot of downtime heh)i want to be able to farm with my duo(such as quest items,tradeskil stuff, of course pp heh).. also want to be able to kill pretty big named(dragons,boss mobs and the such).. sorry if this isnt making much sence lol very very tired right now but cant sleep...<br />
<br />
so the question in short: cleric/bard or shaman/bard for the better all around duo at doing everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">none of these 2 choice are really good. necro would be better</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kinrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">k lets just keep the suggestions to the bard/shaman or cleric idea hehe i like all these classes equaly and will have fun playing both but can only play 2... so which one would make the better duo..thx for ur suggestion though =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, shaman/bard is the very best combination for utterly ruining your wrists. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Of the 2, the shaman will really outshine the cleric for your combo. Clerics, regardless of hammer procs, bash etc, are not really suited to laying out a hurtin. They nuke fairly well, the stuns are pretty nice and they have a nice selection of anti-undead stuff that is very mana efficient, but for the most part, its not all that mana efficient and requires more ass full of ground time to do it.<br />
Shaman however, lends the pet to the situation, as well as a nice selection of dots....aggro kiting with the bard and letting the shaman dot and sic pet will be a nice combo (if somewhat distasteful for most true old school shaman), netting some very phat kills at the high end. Shaman heals and regen should be more than enough to keep any decent bard alive, and if you want to PL its a great combo as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shaman &gt; Cleric to answer your question but...<br />
<br />
WHY?  Bard is probably the best solo class there is.  Anything else is just going to slow you down.  You don't need a healer - if you are getting hit then try another way of fighting the mob.<br />
<br />
No matter how well you gear your cleric or shaman, if you try to tank with the bard the priest is going to have mana issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree with Jenina<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are hurting there is always another way to fight that mob with a bard.  I cant tell you how many times i have run into zones like podisease and watch a bard train about 15-20 mobs at a time, just running in circles, and not working at all to get that exp.  Any hard content, lie BoT bosses+, and your bard isnt going to be able to tank very long, even with a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cleric Bard all the way.  Cleric = mana needy, bard = mana provider.  The HP/AC/Healing/Rezzes from the cleric provides the bard with everything that he needs.  <br />
<br />
Bards are intessive to play well.  <br />
Shaman are intensive to play well.  <br />
Clerics are fire/forget and non intensive<br />
<br />
Can't play 2 intensive classes at the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so the question in short: cleric/bard or shaman/bard for the better all around duo at doing everything.<br />
<br />
If you are looking to grind XP, then cleric would be better. Best XP for bard is swarm kiting. In that contaxt cleric is better to res for mana or unplanned deaths.<br />
<br />
I think a better choice in general would be wizard though. Wizard seems an odd choice at first, but once you do it, it's pretty darn impressive. Not much that can't be killed with bard/wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>lanolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">As someone who has all 3 I can say 100% for certain its Bard/Shaman for duoing. For 2 boxing in a whole group I prefer Bard/Cleric. The cleric is a TON less work so in a group you can play your Bard fully. Duoing a Shaman does a ton more DPS is the type of fights you will be doing. Shaman are a very efficient class as are Bards. So for duoing they are a good match.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Bard can get better solo xp than bard/cleric or shm/cleric. Honestly they would just slow u down. None of the bard uber-grinding involves taking hits from mobs. <br />
<br />
For duoing very hard mobs, like dragons, shm/brd is better but since a shm never runs oom with bard. i dont think it'd be better boxed though since bards are so keyboard intensive and clerics arent. So boxing, clr/brd better. <br />
<br />
Basically a non-boxed bard &gt; shm/brd or clr/brd duo for xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How high do you plan to take your duo?  If you wanna go all the way, go cleric.  You'll be tons more useful to raids and groups at the high end of the game.  If you just want to mess around and maybe get up to 65 someday, a shaman is a great choice.  We are very balanced right up to the very highest part of the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How are ya gonna solve songtwisting and canning while twoboxing? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>csivils</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">How are ya gonna solve songtwisting and canning while twoboxing? :)<br />
<br />
When I 2boxed a shamn, I had a cann5 macro... It cast cannIV (5 times).  Worked like a charm.<br />
<br />
That said, I vote for bard/cleric.  The bard demands a ton of attention and so you need something easy to play that compliments the bard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you want a wicked exp duo that includes a bard, consider bard/wizard.  Quad kiting with selos, mana song, and rizlona's is awesome.  This duo is fairly dependant on having lots of space, though, so you won't be very effective indoors.<br />
<br />
Cleric and bard wouldn't work very well, in my opinion.  The bard doesn't tank or hold aggro very well, so the cleric would be spending most of his time and mana healing the bard.  This leads to possible downtime (even with mana song), and poor damage.<br />
<br />
With a shaman, though, you have a perfectly viable duo in almost any situation.  A shaman's slow is usually effective enough to allow their HoT's to keep them healed while tanking.  Mana song + cannibalize ensures minimal downtime.  A shaman with mana song going has some amazing mana regeneration, which means they can throw on some DoT's.  Shaman dot's combined with bard dot's and/or melee will put out an acceptable level of damage, especially with Call of the Muse (is there a lower level version of that song?).<br />
<br />
So, between cleric/bard and shaman/bard, the shaman partner is definately better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I wouldn't make the combo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It really depends on your level and your gear. Bards actually can tank quite well, but it requires that they play at least 3+ chants to hold aggro. A good bard, with 1600+ AC and LR5 can tank any XP mobs including hard LDoN or Elemental XP. The key is playing those chant songs for aggro. The downside there is that they can't play many group buff songs if they are tanking.<br />
<br />
That said, I 2 box a 65 bard and a 65 cleric all the time. I XP in Plane of Earth and its cake. A shaman would be nice, but a cleric really balanced out a bard better imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I play a shaman / SK combo whenever (very rarely) i do 2 box .. i do have a bard on my shaman's account .. so i've tried the SK / bard 2 box in groups .. and that's been kinda hard with all the twisting / tanking / aggro generation .. the shaman seems hard to canni and keep up all the debuffs and damage while the bard twists .<br />
<br />
but if you have alot of manual dexterity, more power to ya :)</div></div><hr />
