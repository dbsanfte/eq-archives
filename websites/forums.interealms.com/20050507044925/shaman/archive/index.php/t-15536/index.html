<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You expect to be able to play on patch days? /boggle  History shows that:<br />
<br />
1. The patch will take 2-3 times longer than expected<br />
2. Rabid players will flood the login server, so most people will still be unable to login for several hours after the patch is posted<br />
3. SOE will take down the play servers after 2 hours for an emergency patch that will take 2-3 times longer than predicted.<br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember flying from Orlando, FL to Raleigh, NC back before all flights were nonsmoking.  The flight was declared fully nonsmoking due to the large number of nonsmokers on it.  Man, one guy went totally ballistic about it, and ended up lighting up 3-4 times in his seat, in the bathroom, etc. during the measly 90 minute flight.  Just TOO addicted and pissed off that his addiction was being denied.</div></div><hr />
