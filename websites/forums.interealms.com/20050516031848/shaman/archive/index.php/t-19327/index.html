<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">suppossedly after chatting on aim with a few friends who are crack addicts with eq, G.o.D. the adventure points from LDoN won't cross over, vice versa.<br />
meaning WHOLE new point banks...<br />
is it me or are they trying to make this harder ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just another way to use the same old idea to milk more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I expect new adventure themes. If I am right your points will carry over but you will have to adventure in the new themes to unlock stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont believe anything that a friends heard from a friend; wait and see when the expansion is out and if your really worried that this is how it will really turn out, then dont buy the expansion till the facts are well known and posted online. There are already tons of posts on nearly every class board about this rumor, that rumor and I heard this from a guy that is in beta but you cant tell anyone blah blah blah; dont add to the confusion.<br />
When you find a hornets nest you dont jab your finger in it to see if anyone is home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">while yes this is &quot;rumor&quot; nonetheless I agree with Murtak.  Ideally the current adventure point total pool will carry over and be cumulative with the new GoD adventures..  but they will be new separate themes that have to be unlocked separately.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets see, new points = more time you play = more life you invest and therefore more you will care.<br />
<br />
Yea Sony is a bunch of dumb sh|ts</div></div><hr />
