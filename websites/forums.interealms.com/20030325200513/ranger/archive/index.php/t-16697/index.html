<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MeeChuSUh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I Ding 30 and i was wondering of a place to lvl at 30 besides Mistmoore. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wombat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you have some friends that commonly hunt alongside you, then one consideration would be Crystal Caverns. The exp there is pretty good since the orcs have low hp and ac, so if you have decent weapons you can disperse them quickly. If you are looking to solo then I dont suggest going there until 35 unless are have some really nice gear.<br />
<br />
Many people like to visit the rarely player inhabited zone of Stonebrunt and fearkiting the animals there. I myself have never done this, but the word is you can raise your platinum funds at a steady rate here killing the ?giant pandas? i think it is because they can drop gems to sell to vendors.<br />
<br />
In your early 30s you can try the shrooms in Dawnshroud Peaks, they are easily killable with decent gear. Also you can fear kite the zelniaks or wolves later here.<br />
<br />
I have zone &quot;Mars Seru&quot; come up alot for level 30s fighting, although I am unsure as to what there is to kill there due to my lack of exploring in that zone. I simply used it as a walkway to the higher level areas on past.<br />
<br />
If you have above par gear on yourself then a place I would suggest about low to mid 30s is Highhold Keep. You can kill the guards inside there for some pretty decent money loots and exp.<br />
<br />
When I leveled my first ranger, Wombat, from 30 to 40 I took off for Eastern Wastes and did nothing but fear kite the walruses and any other animals I could get my hands on, about 35 I headed to Great Divide and proceded to fear kite the wolves there for very good exp and it raised my dragon faction dramatically.<br />
<br />
The final place I can think of right now wold be the Overthere. You can group or possibly fear kite here, although I do not suggest this zone due to the dangerous mobs that roam there. I was never fond of this zone.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps in some way, I am currently leveling my second ranger on Terris Thule. As I am going along im writing down the little tricks I used to level him up. So I will try and post my own leveling guide for the ranger on here once I reach the 50s. Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I came here at level 32 with my 35 Ranger friend and my 31 Cleric friend. We were all in the same guild so we exped together. Just get together and go to the Barroom (if not camped) and if it is camped go to Kings Room, and if that is camped walk around and kill stuff. Well anyways, the 35 ranger would go around pulling from adjacent rooms and rooms that were close enought to pull from back to Barroom (since the Barroom spawn time it's self is pretty slow). I got about a yellow bubble per half hour -- no joke. Though the downside to this zone is there is hardly anyone in here exping so it is really hard to find a group. This place is only good if you have about 2 or 3 friends willing to exp with you every night. Thats what I am doing right now... great exp still. When you hit 38, 39, or 40 (depending on if the exp is crap at those levels) move down to SolB and walk around and kill stuff (in group). I plan on staying here till around 44-45.</div></div><hr />
