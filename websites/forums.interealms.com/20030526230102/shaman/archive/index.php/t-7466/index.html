<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Might be worth a test...<br />
<br />
I’m properly gonna get so much flame on this.. <br />
<br />
The parchments that drop for spells in PoP can be identified. They get weird names, but you can be sure that the same name will always return the same spell for your class when you turn in. So when you turn in its not random.. It has been predetermined. <br />
<br />
The Clerics site have made a list of this for their spells. I suggest we do it for Beastlord 60+ spells. Btw. Unless two different parchments with different names after identify gives our class the same spell, we are going to get spells pre 61 for turnins too.. Dunno what Verant meant by their patch msg. All I know is. The parchments you are already holding will return the spells according to their identified name. Verant may change the spell return table for hybrids. But they haven’t done so yet. <br />
<br />
In grps, have a Wiz i.e. loot all parchments and identify them. Write down the new name and what spell you get in return. No point in you looting a parchment you already have the spell for. The wiz of cause have to turn in at your vendor... <br />

Plz test this yourself before flaming me.. <br />

And if this have been posted already pls feel free to flame me..<br />

Desperate to be flamed? lol. Interesting post... let's see if it is true.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Isn't there a rather cheap item with unlimited charges of identify? Like an eyepatch or something. Can't remember the name.</div></div><hr />

Silvery Mask (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/adv_search.html?stn=silvery+mask)  clicks identify.<br />
<br />
HERE (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/spell.html?spell=304)  are some other items that have this effect as well.<br />
I have two of the masks.  Situational, but very handy to have on occasion.  I think their worth just went up if this is true. ;)<br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've got the mask, but it doesn't seem to work for me... I hold the item in hand that I want Id'd, then right click on the mask.  The spell &quot;fires&quot;, but I get no text.  Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The wizard doesn't have to loot the parchments. You can loot them, then he can cast identify on you while you have the parchment on your cursor. You'll get the identify message.<br />
<br />
Or if you have an item with Effect: Identify, you can identify your own.<br />
<br />
Nice tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Why would they do something like that tho? To make some spells more rare than others? And now each class has a rare parchment to get that rare spell?<br />
Seems kinda silly. Maybe someone has a better analysis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have the full table of ID # of the parchment to spell for every class, you can almost eliminate replicate spells.<br />
<br />
remember that just because you looted a parchment doesn't mean you have to turn it into your own class vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kudoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You must have yourself targeted when you cast identify. I'm very much looking forward to a table of what parchment returns what spell. I'll certainly post any results I find.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I doubt a table will be of much help.  VI LOVES to change the look up tables frequently.  Just look at how many times in the last month we've had to delete the .txc files because VI has redone the tables.<br />
<br />
This identification of scrolls *would* be cool if VI didn't scew around with the tables so much, it would certainly eliminate a lot of the guess work and duplicates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Thanks, I picked up some Holgresh Grand Vizier Beads in the bazaar today to try this out. They were 300pp compared to 400pp for the Silvery Mask and works the same from inventory. Now, I just need to get some parchments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Star of Eyes is a by-product of the Wheel of Tarton wizard quest.  It's very very easy to do, especially now with PoK portals to all the hard-to-get-to cities, and involves only picking up drops in fountains and the like (iirc) and combining them in a box.  You don't have to kill a damn thing... well, unless you want to....<br />
<br />
Of course, if you have the faction the Mask is easier, but not everyone does :)<br />
<br />
It's a bit tricky to get the ID thing to work until you get used to it, but not difficult.  Just target yourself and hold the star over the item you want identified (and I believe right click).<br />
<br />
I got this thing to identify the VP medallion pieces and stuff... worked very well.<br />

<br />
THIS IS BS, I HAVE GOTTEN 18 PARCHMENTS SO FAR.<br />
<br />
What happens is you will NEVER GET THE SAME SPELL REPEATED UNTIL YOU HAVE ALL THE SPELLS IN THIS CATEGORY.<br />
<br />
Then the cycle will repeat.  Not sure how they coded this in but its pretty sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Khul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Not true I have I have turned in 4 parchments so far and got 2 repeats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Dont know if its true.<br />
I tried this yesterday and got the same message on 2 parchments but I didnt get the same spell.. <br />
It was worth the try atleast and now I have a silvery mask to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Turned in 7 parchments and got 6 pets 1 agi. So no they do not cycle. I have wondered about IDing them to. But some how I dont think that is going to pan out. I belive they will just be random like the 51-55 turn in spells where.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">5 pets? lucky bastage :(   i want one.....  Got Tnarg's though... :)<br />
<br />
  As for ID items, Star beats the mask since it is instant cast IMO.  Quite an easy quest though.  I will start IDing my scrolls, but sounds like it is a no go already :(<br />
<br />
  If it is true though, that would mean the upgrade for Topor is most likely rare as all heck :(   But that also means one of the level 65 spells for all other classes is EQUALLY rare, so it would be a universal screwing, unlike the drop rates of Malo/torpor presently where we have THE rarest spells (so far as I know at least... a few wizzie nukes may compare)<br />
<br />
<br />
  On a side note, my guild did Gorenaire tonight, I got to pull and we ended up with Torpor AND pox off the witch.   had 2 other shamen, a 60 and 61 there without either, randomed torpor, and gave loser Pox.  Quite nice that we had the 2 spells to do it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>IvorlieVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">We've identified a few ethereal parchments before turning them in, all give the same message but returned different spells (&quot;The magic is in a state of flux&quot; or very close to that).<br />

And yes, you will get duplicates... I have been, errrr, lucky enough to end up with a few copies of Ancestral Guard.<br />

Looking for some attention imel007 ?<br />
Total BS on your part , its totaly random since i IDed  the parchments since i heard of this and even those who IDed the same tuned out different spells.</div></div><hr />

But, I do remember some thing on a patch about fixing the spell turn in so you will not get anymore duplicates. So maybe the parchments after that patch do not give duplicates? Just a though. info on this would really be great.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The patch said you will not get any spells that can be bought off merchants.. a couple of spells come into mind here.. replenishment and swift like the wind.</div></div><hr />

There has never been a patch msg that said you couldn't get dupes. There was a patch msg that said you wouldn't get your lvl 61 vendor buyable spell or spells that could be bought from other vendors (aka swift like the wind, lvl 49 enchanter spell) or dropped in a previous expansion (talisman of eurpation for bst etc). Heck the MOTD logging in yesterday basically said you will get dupes. It's intended. Stop feedbacking it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The in-game motd puts this rumor to rest. It is random. I havent got any dupes tho. Admitedly I havent even got any parchments yet, but no dupes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I wouldn't recommend the Holgresh Grand Vizier Beads or The Star of Eyes for Identify. Both these items only work from inventory for Shaman. If you're a pack rat like me ;) and always have 8 containers, you won't be able to hold the item you want identified. That's why I like the Silvery Mask since you can wear it.<br />

Get tink bags or other 10 slotters to make up the difference.</div></div><hr />
