<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ofl-kd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was curious if my shaman (who will hit 46 real soon) can duo successfully in any of the PoP zones with a 60 paladin friend of mine.  I was told PoI and PoJ had the easier mobs so we were planning on checking there but is this a waste of our time?  If it's not feasible, what level should we plan on checking those zones out?<br />
<br />
Right now, we've been duoing in FG with no problems (I slow, incapacitate, throw down my two dots, buff up the paladin with hitpoints, haste and regen, and have dogdog attack, while he pulls singles with cease and keeps aggro with it as well, and yaulps occasionally, healing himself with celestial cleansing as well.)<br />
<br />
Sorry if this is  in the wrong forum but I wasn't sure whether this should have gone to 50 to 60 or not but decided to try here first since my shaman is in the 40s.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wouldn't try it at 46. What's going to happen if you ding 46 and go to one of the PoP zones and get killed and you get knocked back to 45? Better hope you can get a rez is all I can say. Cause remember you can't even zone into the PoT until 46 so getting your corpse is gonna be a problem if you loose a level. PoD yard trash is good exp for a group of low 50's and even then yard trash mobs are hitting for around 150+ and fast. So without knowing what gear you have and all I'd say hold off and get a few more levels. Also if your grouping with a level 60 he's going to be sucking a lot of your exp. Anyway that's what I think. Have fun.  :)</div></div><hr />
