<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been doing this site for over three years now and I don't think I've ever made more than 100 bucks or so for beer throughout the time. Now, I'm finally going to ask if you all can help me financially, but for a wonderful thing.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon has decided to ask his wonderful girlfriend to marry him! :) <br />
<br />
I haven't done it yet, pending the purchase of a ring... and that's where I want to try and get some help. I'm going to open up a short donation drive and hopefully, I can put a serious dent in the cost of a wedding ring since my finances aren't too hot right now.<br />
<br />
So, I'm asking if you can send anything... yes, anything, a buck, five, ten, whatever... to help me purchase the ring. I've been with you all a long time and haven't asked for much beyond taking care of the server costs, so if you can, please try and help me here.<br />
<br />
Thank you all so much for making this place what it is today. Over the years, I've gained so much from this site in ways of happiness, stories and lore. Now, I'd like to see if you can help me give her the happiness she so deserves.<br />
<br />
As usual with the donation drives, you can donate via PayPal or ask me for my address and I can send it to you for a check or money order.<br />
<br />
Thank you!!!!<br />
<br />
David<br />

Dude my name is David too. I am going to try to send a donation, little bit, but still every little thing helps. I salute you for having the balls to ask, and I salute you for doing this amazing site, and forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">donation sent.  Good luck.  And for people who complain about you askng for help, screw them!  Marriage is a big step in life.  Glad I could help put you a step closer to that big step.  It's the least I could do for you running such a great site!</div></div><hr />

I plan on giving Sunmoon something when I can because I know how he feels and what it takes to getg to this point.  Compassion is not a tool, its a feeling.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Talabus.. you are certainly entitled to your opinion. Should I say, &quot;Hey everyone, can you please pay me for the time I've worked on the site, then I can use my newfound part-time job money to help pay for my ring.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So far, so good! :) I've received a little over 300 dollars.. thank you everyone that has helped!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
btw, David isnt begging, he's asking.  We do the same thing to him.  We ask ourselves &quot;Would someone post the info I need&quot; and come to this great site and there it is.  We ask ourselves &quot;Would someone sticky that Stoicism thread&quot;, and its done.  Alot of selfless work goes into keep the shammy community together, and I for one appreciate it.  People ask for donations for thier church's during family crisis, or start drives for a good cause in thier schools, they ask those people because that is the community they are apart of and feel comfortable enough to ask for help from.  I applaud Sunmoon's faith in the community he helped build and think that anyone who thinks otherwise should have a fun time trying to find another shammy site as good as this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Sent what I could.  Hope it helps.  As someone who took the plunge 6 months ago, and someone who spent hours reaping the benefits of this site, I am more than happy to help out.  GL David!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Eatbugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">same type of people critisized me when I asked for help a few months ago. <br />
<br />
Yeah, I was one of them.  And I have to say, I was an idiot for doing so.  If I didn't approve, not donating and going on to another thread would have been just fine, taking the time to make a reply that made it obvious I was being a jackass that day was a bit off.<br />
<br />
Bit late, but my apologies, Sarjent.<br />
<br />
And Sunmoon, good luck with the proposal. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Plexuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Wow... Only one word comes to my mind, pathetic.  I would work 3 jobs before I asked any of my RL friends for money for an engagement ring.  Take pride in purchasing the ring on your own.  This just boggles my mind, I don't know what to say.  People will probably bash me for this, but you opened yourself up for this by posting it here.  Umm anyways good luck with your engagement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>harowen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Go back to lurking Plexuss.  That comment was hardly a worthwhile way to get your post count to 1.  You call someone pathetic and then wish them good luck?  Why not just be a decent person and wish him good luck?<br />
<br />
In any case, I agree with Ridik.  This is a community, and communities take care of their own.  If your personal feeling is that you don't feel it's the right thing to do then don't do it.  Sunmoon's not demanding it, he's asking for support &quot;if you can&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hey Sunmoon...please send me a private message.  I'm stationed right now in Tampa Florida and I'd love to help you in any way that I can.  Please let me know where I can reach you at so that we can talk.<br />
<br />
And I haven't of course donated yet...but I'm at work and will as soon as I get home</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Diamonds are dumb. <br />
<br />
De Beers controls the supply of and artificially inflates the price of this common rock. The value of a diamond depends primarily on the De Beers corporation's ability to continue to dominite and control this market. Furthermore, their manipulation of the diamond market is a direct contributor to the ravages of diamond conflicts that rage in several African nations.<br />
<br />
http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/82feb/8202diamond1.htm (awesome article. If you get one thing out of my post, read this.)<br />
<br />
http://www.maths.tcd.ie/local/JUNK/econrev/ser/html/try.html<br />
<br />
http://www.fguide.org/Bulletin/conflictdiamonds.htm<br />
<br />
Diamonds are only forever so long as one corporation maintains control of them. Furthermore, the &quot;tradition&quot; of diamond engagement rings is the direct result of a De Beers marketing campaign started after WWI. Many Americans have bought into this marketing lie without questioning how it came about. It's been a very successful campaign.<br />
<br />
<br />
In its 1947 strategy plan, [De Beer's advertising agency] strongly emphasized a psychological approach. &quot;We are dealing with a problem in mass psychology. We seek to ... strengthen the tradition of the diamond engagement ring -- to make it a psychological necessity capable of competing successfully at the retail level with utility goods and services....&quot; It defined as its target audience &quot;some 70 million people 15 years and over whose opinion we hope to influence in support of our objectives.&quot; N. W. Ayer outlined a subtle program that included arranging for lecturers to visit high schools across the country. &quot;All of these lectures revolve around the diamond engagement ring, and are reaching thousands of girls in their assemblies, classes and informal meetings in our leading educational institutions,&quot; the agency explained in a memorandum to De Beers.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I were proposing to my wife all over again and had 10k to 30k to show her &quot;how much I loved her&quot; I'd put that money into the purchase of our first home together. Diamonds don't buy love, but a home is a good place to make love. ;)<br />
<br />
Your pathetic desire to blow wads of cash on an overhyped collection of carbon molecules that were obtained by exploiting labor aside, I wish you luck with your soon-to-be wife.<br />
<br />
PS: I don't expect you to be so open-minded as to say, &quot;You know what, I took the time to read those articles you posted and I'm going to do some thinking about this now.&quot; You've made a public post and you've stated your position and therefore it's very hard for you to back off of it. But I felt morally obligated to let others know that this is a dumb idea and that supporting it is also a dumb idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ten Reasons Why You Should Never Accept a Diamond Ring from Anyone, Under Any Circumstances, Even If They Really Want to Give You One (2-14-02) <br />
By Liz Stanton, CPE Staff Economist <br />
<br />
<br />
1. You've Been Psychologically Conditioned To Want a Diamond <br />
The diamond engagement ring is a 63-year-old invention of N.W.Ayer advertising agency. The De Beers diamond cartel contracted N.W.Ayer to create a demand for what are, essentially, useless hunks of rock. <br />
<br />
2. Diamonds are Priced Well Above Their Value <br />
The De Beers cartel has systematically held diamond prices at levels far greater than their abundance would generate under anything even remotely resembling perfect competition. All diamonds not already under its control are bought by the cartel, and then the De Beers cartel carefully managed world diamond supply in order to keep prices steadily high. <br />
<br />
3. Diamonds Have No Resale or Investment Value <br />
Any diamond that you buy or receive will indeed be yours forever: De Beers’ advertising deliberately brain-washed women not to sell; the steady price is a tool to prevent speculation in diamonds; and no dealer will buy a diamond from you. You can only sell it at a diamond purchasing center or a pawn shop where you will receive a tiny fraction of its original &quot;value.&quot; <br />
<br />
4. Diamond Miners are Disproportionately Exposed to HIV/AIDS <br />
Many diamond mining camps enforce all-male, no-family rules. Men contract HIV/AIDS from camp sex-workers, while women married to miners have no access to employment, no income outside of their husbands and no bargaining power for negotiating safe sex, and thus are at extremely high risk of contracting HIV. <br />
<br />
5. Open-Pit Diamond Mines Pose Environmental Threats <br />
Diamond mines are open pits where salts, heavy minerals, organisms, oil, and chemicals from mining equipment freely leach into ground-water, endangering people in nearby mining camps and villages, as well as downstream plants and animals. <br />
<br />
6. Diamond Mine-Owners Violate Indigenous People's Rights <br />
Diamond mines in Australia, Canada, India and many countries in Africa are situated on lands traditionally associated with indigenous peoples. Many of these communities have been displaced, while others remain, often at great cost to their health, livelihoods and traditional cultures. <br />
<br />
7. Slave Laborers Cut and Polish Diamonds <br />
More than one-half of the world's diamonds are processed in India where many of the cutters and polishers are bonded child laborers. Bonded children work to pay off the debts of their relatives, often unsuccessfully. When they reach adulthood their debt is passed on to their younger siblings or to their own children. <br />
<br />
8. Conflict Diamonds Fund Civil Wars in Africa <br />
There is no reliable way to insure that your diamond was not mined or stolen by government or rebel military forces in order to finance civil conflict. Conflict diamonds are traded either for guns or for cash to pay and feed soldiers. <br />
<br />
9. Diamond Wars are Fought Using Child Warriors <br />
Many diamond producing governments and rebel forces use children as soldiers, laborers in military camps, and sex slaves. Child soldiers are given drugs to overcome their fear and reluctance to participate in atrocities. <br />
<br />
10. Small Arms Trade is Intimately Related to Diamond Smuggling <br />
Illicit diamonds inflame the clandestine trade of small arms. There are 500 billion small arms in the world today which are used to kill 500,000 people annually, the vast majority of whom are non-combatants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'll jump on the &quot;kinda lame to ask&quot; bandwagon and take my flames from everyone else.<br />
<br />
You don't need to buy a big ring for it to be a big deal.  If you can afford $300 for a ring then spend $300 for a ring.  If you future wife values the size/cost of the ring over the proposal itself then go ahead and keep the numbers to the divorce lawyers handy.<br />
<br />
I spent $250 on the first ring that I ever gave to my wife because that's all I could afford as an E-2 in '91.  You know what?  That $250 ring could have been a $25k ring for all she cared.<br />
<br />
It is the gesture, not the price tag that should be important.  Spend what you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hmm, I don't see where all the hate is coming from.<br />
I glanced over in the Glade and they are all overwhelming supportive of him.<br />
<br />
/shrug  Don't donate if ya don't want to, but I don't think it's right to criticize him for making the request, esp. considering all he has done for this community (hell, without him, this place would not exist).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">So does the amount you spend on the ring determine how much you love her?  Do you feel good panhandling for money to buy your fiancee a nicer ring?  Are you going to tell her that you didn't think she'd like the ring you could afford on your own, so you got some of &quot;the guys&quot; to pitch in some too so she'd really appreciate it then?  Does everyone that pitches in for the ring get a piece, like a time-sharing condo in Florida?  Buy your own ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>lunarstorm01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Please realize that this thread has nothing to do with Sunmoon's contributions and time spent here to this messageboard.  If you want to thank him for his help here - donate for that reason.  Another idea is to just give him a sincere &quot;thank you Sunmoon!&quot;<br />
<br />
For those of you saying things like:<br />
<br />
...I don't think it's right to criticize him for making the request, esp. considering all he has done for this community (hell, without him, this place would not exist).<br />
<br />
Please be aware that this board has nothing to do with this thread.  These are totally separate issues and requests and are not applicable to compare.  There are people (like myself) who can feel that his contributions here are tremendous, yet disagree entirely with his actiosn here.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon, here are some things you should be aware of:<br />
<br />
You're a smart guy.  Please give some serious thought to what you're doing here.  The fact is, you are taking advantage of your work and popularity on an EQ messageboard to earn money to buy your gal a ring.  <br />
<br />
I think you will agree with this:  she should accept you for who you are and what you can afford within your own rights.  Don't go panhandling to buy her a ring that you cannot afford.  Give her a simple, but beautiful (and inexpensive) ring and tell her that once you can afford the ring you have in mind, you will get it for her, but for now, you want this ring to symbolize your unity and spending a lifetime together.  Many, many couples do this - and it brings a laugh and a tear to their spouses eyes when they return years later with a gorgeous ring and say &quot;This is what I wanted to give you years ago.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you use the donated money to buy the ring, you will look back and realize that it is not what you could afford and give her - it's what you got from a gaming messageboard when you asked for money to support your ring.  Had you earned this money in other means and then bought the ring with that money, that'd be one thing.  But in this case ... you're slandering the entire concept of an engagement ring by doing this.<br />
<br />
Also - you should know that this thread is being made a laughingstock in other communities.  :(  There are others who feel you are being very, very foolish with this request.  Again, you are taking advantage of your popularity and efforts here to do something that you should not do.<br />
<br />
Please, man.  Give back the money you've been given, or perhaps use it to do something further for the EQ/shaman community.  Don't do this.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what you decide to do with this issue, I wish you the best with your relationship and all you do.  You've been a boost to this community, and my hat's off to you for that.  :)<br />
<br />
I hope you seriously consider my advice...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">It is funny that most of the people bitching are single posters.  Are you too spineless to say anything under their real username?<br />
lunarstorm01 you&#8217;re a pansy&#8230;what's your real name&#8230;are you scared?  How the hell is he taking advantage of anybody/anything?  He is asking&#8230;not telling people to donate.  If you feel you are being taken advantage of by this then I think you need some serious therapy.  If you need to prove your self-worth buy posting an idiotic message then please log into your real username and post it like a man chickensh*t.  I've said it before and I will say it again.  If you don't want to donate, move to another thread in these message boards.  99.9% of the people hear don't really care what your opinion is.  Please don't take this post as some sort of personal gratification that you are missing in your real life.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon I would close up shop here and let these crybabies move to the other message boards.  Or just ban their IP's.<br />
<br />
&quot;The fact is, you are taking advantage of your work and popularity on an EQ message board to earn money to buy your gal a ring.&quot;<br />
Let me just point out&#8230;it's his message board and he can do what ever the hell he wants.  Do you see ads and banners popping up everywhere here like most other message boards????  No!  Maybe he should put some on here just to teach you ladies a lesson.</div></div><hr />

You can not afford a ring, yet you can afford a wife?????<br />
<br />
Please before you endeavor yourself to countless hours of your &quot;Wife&quot; bitching at you for being such a broke ass loser, consider the facts.<br />
<br />
Your too broke to even buy a ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
Save your money, quit begging like a bitch and step up and be a man.<br />
<br />
If and when you can afford to buy your woman the life she deserves, then ask her to marry you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know this isn't the political correct statement of the year, nor does it have any intentions of wanting to be.<br />

What happened to real men?<br />
<br />
What happened to Men's Pride ??<br />

To much feministic bull**** is what I see here.<br />

<br />
Since this thread has gotten way off track, I decided I'd put in my two cents about the original subject.  What I think is important here is two people starting a life together.  I consider the donation I sent to be a token of my appreciation for Sunmoon's work on the sites and a small pre-wedding gift to a friend I haven't been fortunate enough to meet in RL yet.  If you guys wanna see it as begging, or whine about diamonds, or what have you, go for it.  I'd like to just say I wish David and his future wife all the happiness in the world.  <br />

<br />
Stop behaving like asses.<br />
<br />
Sunmoon has put a lot of time and his own money into this board.  All he's asking for, in essence, is some financial assistance for doing this, for a purchase he needs to make.  God nows he's worked for it and earned it.<br />
<br />
This is not the case of a noob in EQ running up and wanting something for nothing.  God, people, the man finances this board on his own.  We ALL use it and refer to it for information to help make our own lives enjoyable.<br />
<br />
If Sun had said, look, I'm having trouble with some finances right now and if you could send something to help towards the board, recouping my costs and what not, everyone would have leapt upon this.<br />
<br />
So are you giving to a bum?  I don't think so.  Get off your high horses.<br />
<br />
Sorry, Sun, I'm out of work right now and can't afford to assist you, or I would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ariannda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Real name ? Here it is, check it out on EZboard. I was linked from another website. Why don't i ever post or anything ? I'm a mage =p<br />
<br />
Hon, if you want donations to run the website i'll donate to that (i have a lot of friends who swear by this site *cough* Juu* cough*), but this is dishonerable. And unless you tell her where you got the money you're starting off your new life in a lie. If i was her i'd be upset, dissapointed, and ashamed of you. It's the thought that counts not the cost. A Lot of people get married and buy a ring later when they can afford it. A simple gold band will do is she loves you the amount you believe she does. If you can't buy a house , you rent, you don't ask everyone to help you pay for it.<br />
<br />
Like i said, ask for donations for the board and i'm sure you'll have overwhelming support, but do this and expect the the fires to rage.<br />

Denero, most of these lurkers are first time posters coming to express their views after a link to this post was brought up on their own boards.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">two things. as a woman with a diamond ring, i dont really care about debeers etc. i dig my ring, i like the way it looks, and i really don't care how much my fiance spent on it. if he spent $200 vs the $6k, it would mean the same thing. as for slave labour cutting diamonds, that is bs. i know people who do diamond cutting and that are in the diamond business.<br />
<br />
second, DO NOT buy the ring unless you know 100% what she wants. this is something she has to wear for like, the rest of her life. don't go out and think you know what she likes unless the two of you have been looking together. my fiance has 0 clue about my tastes. he luckily waited, and found out what i wanted / liked. it makes no sense to drop cash on something she only semi-likes. people who say this isn't romantic, too bad. buy a cute little cigar band, or one of the plastic adjustables from a gumball machine and propose with that and a promise to ring shop. the ring you would have bought would need to be resized anyways (if you're getting something other than a chain store diamond). that is way more romantic, than being proposed to with a hideous ring that you are stuck with.<br />

<br />
No, I said 99.9% don't care about your opinion.  You feeling uncomfortable and 99.9% not caring...you see what I mean?  I'm sure even less of us care if someone comes all the way ever here to register to post a single flame.  Just as much as someone would care if I went to a mage board (just an example) were the community there is strong and I posted a flame to someone I don't even know under a topic that I knew nothing about.  The only reason for doing that would be to piss people off in that community.  What's the point of that?  That's not what the game or all these close knit message board communities are about.  If you want to intentionally piss people off to relieve stress go play a medic in team fortress classic for Half Life and infect everybody&#8230;it works for me.<br />
<br />
What does it matter what he spends the money on.  At least he's being up front and honest...do you want him to say &quot;please donate money so I can get an 8-ball for the weekend?&quot;  I say lap dance and a drink and he says diamond ring the size of her head, in the end who the hell cares.  You just assume that his girl friend is money grubbing because HE wants to get her a nice ring.  Some guys just want to by their women nice things.  If he can buy a bigger/better ring from the money he gets here then that's great.  <br />
<br />
To whom ever said he would be starting his relationship on a lie...come on...don't be so damn dramatic.  If/when you get/got a wedding ring are you going to grill him/her where the money came from to buy it.  No, unless of course it&#8217;s a $20K ring and your working at Burger King&#8230;part-time.<br />
<br />
Kiteless you are right there.  I went shopping for a ring with my future wife a few times about a year before I asked her.  I bought the ring she liked the most and we where both happy.  I just came up with a cool way to ask here and all was great.<br />

Now does this have anything to do with how I feel about Sunmoon?  Of course it doesn't.  I thank him for keeping this board running for as long as it has.  Not all the posters on this board are so quick to flame and many keep this place on topic (shaman).  Now do I agree that he should be asking the people of this board for money to buy a ring?  Not really but more power to him.  Do I think people should ridicule him for doing so?  Again, not really.  Do I think people have a right to express their opinions?  Absolutely.<br />

It's LAME of Sunmoon and a disappointing abuse of these forums.

I very much do appreciate your contributions and this board has helped me greatly and say you were to ask for money to buy a house or food or something like that i probably would have donated.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you want to buy a ring though. A wedding ring is a personal gesture of how you are going to marry a person and how much you love them. A better wedding ring means nothing and if your girlfriend really loves you wouldn't care if you gave her a plastic pokemon ring from a $1 toy despenser. It is kind of like asking for money so you can donate to an organization and recieve a placque in your name or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well then again i am a clueless newbie and have no experience with wedding rings and stuff so  I don't know if it really matters but when i eventually marry I wouldn't spend more than $100 on a wedding ring because it is a gesture nothing more and the money can better be used to buy a house, pay for children food car e.t.c.</div></div><hr />

No, it's both. Women have been psychologically conditioned to want diamonds for since shortly after WWI through some really slick ad deceits. <br />

I tried to send a little, but couldn't get through the Paypal.  I donated sometime before to someone w/ Paypal, have NO idea what my silly password is, and it won't let me re-register using my correct name/address.  Keeps saying I have an account, but I can't remember what e-mail address (I've had many) I used when I registered originally.  What a pain in the butt. :(<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck on the upcoming nuptials.  I need to figure out this Paypal issue for a few other reasons, &amp; I'll send something your way once I do.  Lap dance, engagement ring, or site maintenance, I don't care.  Use it for whatever you want.<br />
<br />

You have a point here - I hate it when people foist their own moral Crusades on others. Even when they have a point. Explain, by all means. Educate. But don't dictate.<br />

I repeat: this thread has nothing to do with Sunmoon's labor and work here.  This has to do with his act of requesting donations to afford an engagement ring.  These are two seperate issues and should not be combined.<br />

If you want to donate for his ring as a token of appreciation towards this messageboard, so be it.  But by doing so, I fear Sunmoon may later on think about what he did and wince.  If he stopped to think about what an engagement ring meant, on a more grand scale, then perhaps he might not be so fast to beg for money.<br />

I'll state for the record, I had over $2000 of my own money I've saved to buy this ring.. the more than $400 dollars I got from donations will be simply to just make the size a little sweeter.

As far as some of you saying more size doesn't mean more money, blah blah. Trust me, I could give this amazing woman a soda pop ring and she'd love me forever the same way she would with a 6 carat nugget. I had plenty of my own money for a ring (I'm not a bum ya know :)) but I jsut wanted to make it a little nicer and thanks to more than a few of you, I was able to.<br />
<br />
So, have fun wallowing in your misery (those of you condemning me for this thread) but I don't feel any less of a man for asking for a little help from this site; especially when I've NEVER asked for a penny to go in my pocket in over three years.<br />

vs.<br />
<br />
I'll state for the record, I had over $2000 of my own money I've saved to buy this ring..<br />
<br />
This is a direct contradiction.  You've exploited people Sunmoon.<br />
<br />
Attacking your values and decision to elicit donations here is one thing.  Now I question something else entirely: your honesty.<br />
<br />
First you claimed that your finances &quot;aren't too hot&quot; and then you say you had over $2000 saved up for a ring.  Nobody who can save up thousands of dollars for an engagement ring has any right to claim that their finances aren't doing too well.  Shame on you Sunmoon, I didn't think you were the type who lied.<br />
<br />
You will likely delete my post very soon, to cover up this blatant exploite of the shaman community.<br />
<br />
For shame.</div></div><hr />

Complete and unmitigated bull.  My finances SUCKED, but I managed to save.  You just start saving when you start thinking you're gonna ask, and by the time you get up the guts to (or when you *plan* to, if you're the planning type) you can have quite a bit saved.<br />
<br />
Cut out Micky D's a couple times a week, brew your own coffee, make your own food instead of the Banquet chicken... it's amazing how much you can save when you put your mind to it.<br />
<br />
So glad you could take the time to post not one, but THREE glimpses into your heart.  I feel the better for it...<br />
<br />
... primarily because I don't have to endure you in real life, come to think of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You missed my point.<br />
<br />
From Sunmoon's original post, he made it sound like he was poor and couldn't afford an engagement ring.  Now he steps forward and claims he had thousands saved, just for the ring...<br />
<br />
Deception is no good.  Are you saying you support that, Shandy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Plexuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">You guys should have donated your money to buy some homeless people food or a new pair of shoes.  Not some guy who already had $2,000 saved for an engagement ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">You missed my point.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I did.<br />
<br />
I chose to think you simply didn't grasp how much a person whose finances aren't that good was able to save up two grand for a ring.<br />
<br />
I know your point was another outright attack on Sunmoon, but I figured I'd give you the benefit of the doubt and correct you about saving.<br />
<br />
Did he say he wasn't able to afford one?  No.  <br />
<br />
...hopefully, I can put a serious dent in the cost of a wedding ring since my finances aren't too hot right now.<br />
<br />
I'd have to say that even a hundred bucks qualifies &quot;serious dent.&quot;  Just that little can upgrade a notch or two in color, or clarity, or fewer visible inclusions.  (Note for Sunmoon -- remember that a smaller, higher grade diamond is the better choice over more or bigger ones of lower grades)<br />
<br />
I didn't read his plea as &quot;poor and couldn't afford.&quot;  I read it as &quot;not making lots and would love to have a hand.&quot;  But then, I tend to give folks the benefit of the doubt when I'm not at work.  Take above, for example, when I chose to regard you as just uninformed and grumpy rather than vicious and deliberately inlammatory.<br />
<br />
In either case, welcome to ignore.<br />
<br />
Edit: Fixed a tyop<br />
Edit2: When posting the edit, it ate 1/2 my post.  ?</div></div><hr />

No - my attack does not attack Sunmoon.  It does nothing more than emphasize his decisions on this thread. Surely even you can recognize a difference between questioning the actions someone does and the person themselves.  :)<br />
<br />

<br />
5% is a &quot;serious dent?&quot;  *laugh*  OK!<br />
<br />

<br />
Cool.  Then I won't have to waste my time reading another of your replies.  You've expressed your point, albeit with oodles of venom and personal attacks.  <br />
<br />
However, I am going to call your bluff.  I wager you are reading this.  And in that case, I offer the advice:  please refrain from posting while you have PMS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Jesus, if you're all Sooo upset that the guy who's run the site for these boards for the last 3 years is asking for voluntary contributions and being honest enough to say, &quot;Yeah, THIS time it's going in my pocket more or less&quot;, while ignoring the large amount of time spent without compensation... Just quit posting and reading here.  Seriously, if all you can do is bitch about Sunmoon, then put your money where your mouth is and boycott/leave.<br />
<br />
Just go the hell away.  I'm sure the Crucible and Glade will crumble shortly thereafter without you and all the work you do for the sites/boards.  Then you can start your own sites and laugh at sunmoon for being such a loser.<br />
<br />
For my part, Grats on your engagement and Good Luck with the wedding plans...;)  /cringe  I'll never go through that hell again. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">You've exploited people Sunmoon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
for the love of god , let the man have his moment. If any of you dont wanna donate , then simply exit the thread and let it go.<br />
<br />
Gratz to you sunmoon , i know what its like to run a community of sites and message boards. Its hard cause no one realizes what the man behind the curtain is doing , they just enjoy the results. <br />
<br />
Good luck man</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">I dont think Sunmoon was trying to really exploit or lie to people at all, I have been on the same server as him for years and hes just not the kind of person to do that, he is highly respected here as being a very honest guy.  He needed a little help with the ring, so what, even if his fiance didnt care what ring he got her maybe HE cared, maybe it mattered to him what he gave her.  I know that when I get married I wouldnt want to give my wife a cheap ring even if she really wouldnt care one way or the other, I would want to get the best I possibly could.  Sunmoon has put ALOT into this site and I am sure it has cost him over these years quite a bit more than what he was given for this ring,  those donation drives cover alot of the cost but I will bet you that he usually has to pay some from his own pocked too.  If you didnt want to help him you shouldnt have donated and moved on, not went off on the poor man who had the balls to actually come here and ask.  Very sad, very sad indeed.<br />
<br />
BTW, Sunmoon, saw your pic of the ring, very nice  :D</div></div><hr />
