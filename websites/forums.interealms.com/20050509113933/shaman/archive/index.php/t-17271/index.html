<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I started my shaman I remember in June on AB server cuz i heard they were uber, got sow and level 9 and could solo dragon. <br />
<br />
Year and a half down the line I've finally made it to the level cap, I'm level 65, w00t! This feels soooo great, no more crappy girnding, AA all the way!<br />
<br />
Just though I'd put this up on the boards as it may not be a big accomplishment for all you ubers with 200AA but for me its a big thing and I'd like to say a lot of what I've learned from these boards has helped me along the way.<br />
<br />
Telosk, the PROPHET :D</div></div><hr />

Congrats on 65.  AA grinding loses it's excitement pretty quick, though =)</div></div><hr />

60 was the big one for me. 60 - 65 was no big deal was done in like 2 weeks in plane of valor when PoP came out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I used to grind aa's as well, now I just play with some friends, do whatever we find fun, and the aa's come one at a time, slowly, but they add up eventually, and there's less chance of burning.<br />
<br />
Edit: And grats, no matter what 65 is still a great accomplishment.</div></div><hr />
