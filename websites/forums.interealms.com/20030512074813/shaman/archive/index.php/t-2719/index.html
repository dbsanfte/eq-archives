<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Talene</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am finishing my quest for the Totemic Armor.  I went to the Temple expecting to find lvl 20 -30 Mobs.  I got there and the zone was full of lvl 55-60 Characters.  I sent a message out asking about the Ogres Chamois from the Lizard Page and I was told the zone was changed.  Does anyone have information on this!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The zone was changed several months ago, chief.  It's a VERY high level zone now, and you don't want to be in there.  As for the previous mobs, I believe they were all moved immediately outside of CT.  You'll see swarms of level 20-30 greens on the ruins and temple structures outside of CT.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you,<br />
