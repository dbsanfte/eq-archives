<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ioki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 15 lvl orge shaman. A friend who recently quit the game, gave me an FBSS and some other equipment that I can't use. I guess my question is should I keep the FBSS? or selling it and to buy an Iksar regen BP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Iksar bp would most probably serve more use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bloogbloog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sell it and try to get Iksar BP...I didnt think it would make that much difference to my ogre shaman also but now I love it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Both are very nice to have.<br />
<br />
On Vaz fbss == 3kp and Iksar chestplate == 9kp...<br />
<br />
For the price I think da fbss is the better value.   It will increase joo mele damage ouput buy 20%.<br />
<br />
The choice not be easy depending on how joo play.<br />
<br />
If joo a grouping shaman and only solo to maintain joo mele skills defense / offense / pierce / 1hb / 2hb....  then the Iksar BP is da better choice.<br />
<br />
If joo solo lots of the time then I would rather have da FBSS.<br />
<br />
An Ogre shaman can do great damage with a big 2hb like a GFG and an fbss.  With an ac / dps setup you mele solo well into the high 40 without any trouble at all.  Just pull with slow and kill with the big hammer.   All damage comes from da hammer and mana is used for a) slow b) buffs and c) some spot healing.  The only time joo get a big chunk of down time is when a bunch of buffs all drop at the same time.<br />
<br />
Some day I want to pick up a REIF and get those last few points to max pierce so that I can compare dps with REIF and GFG.  I think it is very likely that the GFG will outperform the REIF buy a significant margin but hard to tell without having both  /sigh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Go for the Ikky BP, it will serve you much better the FBSS. Or you can use the FBSS until 24 then sell it for an Ikky BP. Regen is the name for KING on the lips of Shaman.</div></div><hr />
