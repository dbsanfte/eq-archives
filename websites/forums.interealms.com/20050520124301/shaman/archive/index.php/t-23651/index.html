ENTERING THE PLANE OF TIME! :) <br />
<br />
After countless tries, getting Calamari Man down to 1% THEN GETTING PORTED OUT, trying with low numbers, trying with high numbers...last night we killed him with just over 60 people (some of which were boxed for the flag...)  <br />
<br />
Decade is now in Time :)</div></div><hr />

No matter how tempting, do not blow big points right away on phase 1 or phase 2 loot.</div></div><hr />

I don't think I'll ever see it first-hand. Or even VT for that matter.</div></div><hr />

Samanna, you are one of the most organized people I know. Do some research, lead some raids. If you start winning, you will get people to follow you. <br />
<br />
On Emarr, we have this guy named Deshane who has nearly singlehandedly flagged 100s of people for the elementals. I have no doubt when the level limit increases to 70 that Deshane will lead successful elemental God raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, wise advice.<br />
<br />
For NE, we lotto P1, P2, and P3 now ( minus EP legs and loot from last 2 Bosses ).  Most of this loot is going to apps now.<br />
<br />
Because of the nature of P1, all loot that dropped there was always lotto'ed.  Funny thing is:  I never won the earring yet.  I had no desire for the mask or the bracer.  The only p1 loot I have is the neck piece.  It helps extend Cheetah!  Go Go me running for my life to get past a see invis mob in KT for an Ikky raid!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I also never got any Phase 1 loot!<br />
<br />
From day 1 in Time, my DKP guild decided to random Phase 1 loot. When loot dropped, the random was only open to people in that trial who didn't have any Phase 1 loot.<br />
<br />
The stupid earring would NEVER drop when I was there, I never even got a chance to roll on it. I passed on every other piece of phase 1 loot while waiting for it to drop. I ended up getting 2 decent earrings anyway.<br />
<br />
Personally, the phase 2 loot is THE BEST. Yummy mask, shoulders, glowing chains, shield, druzzil's distance earring. All of it currently going DIRT CHEAP. I picked up the shield for 18 points a couple of weeks ago (dirt cheap in my guild).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, same with my guild.<br />
<br />
I got the Shield of the Vortex for free from P2.  I think it is the only piece of gear I have from P2.  I want the earring, but so does everyone and their cousin, and I never have that good of luck for stuff I really want.  I lost on the p1 earring about 5 times now, and it is always to people that hardly play :(<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that loot in p4 will be reduced in cost soon.  A lot of stuff is rotting or will rot soon.  I figure I can clean up on somethings that I have my eye on for awhile.  Maybe Saryrn can be nice and drop the TA a little more.  I am tired of seeing Tallon drop the Hopebringer every week.  We did get lucky with Rallos - he dropped another Darkblade of the Warlord for us - now we have three  tanks equipping this now.<br />
<br />
On a side note, my guild is a little crazy and always tries to push the envelope when it can.  So, we tanked CT and Bert at once and WON!  *lol*  Was a huge mega rush, and I was the MH in my group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">P2 is absolutely a great place to gear up on Shaman goodies once the initial mad rush of people who &quot;must get Time lewtz now!&quot; dies off and things become more reasonable.<br />
<br />
Drape of the Unending, Glowing Chains, Hoop of the Enlightened (although this one tends to get snapped up for quite some time), Shield of the Vortex, Tiny Jade Ring (although I like other rings much better), Veil of Warmth, and Wand of the Vortex are all shaman-usable.<br />
<br />
Compared to p3, where we can get ... erm, pants.<br />
<br />
Now, a lot of the p2 stuff isn't the ideal choice for the slot, but you'll see a lot of it, and its not a bad way to fill in holes while waiting for bigger pieces further in.</div></div><hr />

Is there anything in particular that I should be looking into getting (aside from TA, which I am last in line for anyway...) from Time or Ikky+?<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Glori= Glorification   :) Although I am sure there are many who would find Glori attractive :) I however don't go for soft skins :p so you're outta luck honey</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I beg your pardon!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ikky Loot<br />
Shale Shoulderpads<br />
Bloodlink Chestplate - sooo common, don't spend any points for awhile, let it get nice and cheap. Or wait until everyone has a Bloodlink and get a Time BP nice and cheap (like I did)<br />
<br />
Time<br />
Pants (pants are common in Phase 3, chain legs are now going to twinks)<br />
Any of the nice phase 2 loot which will go cheap (earring, shield, mask, shoulders, glowing chains)<br />
Symbol of the Planesmaster<br />
Quickening of Mith earring from CT<br />
<br />
Heck with it, check out my Magelo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When you get to phase 4, again, dont dump points on a TA, no matter how tempting. It's class specific and will probably rot/go to guests and then alts long before any of the more general drops. Mok is only one main away from having a shot at it (alts pay dkp for raid drops in our guild as well btw, they just dont get to do it first ;) ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a lot of stuff you can get into time.  Here is a list of some items from P4 - P6.  This is not a complete list.<br />
<br />
P4:<br />
TT: Coif of Flowing Time<br />
VZ: Temporal Chainmail Sleeves<br />
VZ: Earring of Temporal Solstice<br />
TZ:  Cloak of Falling Skies<br />
TZ: Winged Storm Boots<br />
Saryrn: Ring of Evasion<br />
Saryrn: TA<br />
<br />
P5:<br />
Bert: Leggings of Furious Might<br />
Bert: Plusing Onyx Ring<br />
Bert: Belt of Temporal Bindings<br />
Bert: Veil of the Inferno<br />
CT: Wristband of Echoed Thoughts<br />
CT: Earring of Unseen Horrors<br />
CT: Mask of Simplicity<br />
Inny: Gloves of Airy Mists<br />
Inny: Gridle of Stability<br />
Inny: Timeless BP Pattern<br />
Inny: Earring of Celestial Energy<br />
RZ: Visor of the Beserker<br />
RZ: Platinum Cloak of War<br />
<br />
P6:<br />
Quarm: Whorl of Unnatural Forces<br />
Quarm: Shawl of Eternal Forces<br />
Quarm: Spool of Woven Time<br />
Quarm: Bracer of the Inferno<br />
Quarm: Prismatic Ring of Resistance<br />
Quarm: Talisman of the Elements<br />
 <br />
<br />
Here is some Ikky Stuff.  Again, not a complete list.<br />
<br />
Single Group Ikky:<br />
<br />
Gyphed Prayer Ring<br />
<br />
As for Ikky Raids:<br />
<br />
Bloodlink Chainmail<br />
Fleshthreader's Mace<br />
Bloodied Ritual Trinket<br />
Bauble of the Forlorn<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  Personally, I would wait/pass on getting EP Legs and go for Leggings of Furious Might.  The +10 Avoidance helps.  The Bloodlink Chainmail is a toss up.  I got one ( Bloodlink ) because Inny was being dumb and not dropping the Timeless BP Pattern.</div></div><hr />
