<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think I'd play this one actually.  Looks great and maybe play during server outages but I'm pretty well entrenched back into EQ.<br />
Just wanted to bring back old memories of theose wonderful gold box games to those that enjoyed them as I did.</div></div><hr />

I still have my copy of Pools of Radiance and the Curse of the Azure Bonds...  I dug them out to look at them after reading this.  I still even have the code wheel... not a crinkle in it :)<br />
<br />
My computer equipment has come a long way from an 8088 with a Monochrome Monitor on an old Hercules graphics card running SIMCGA at 12Mhz while in TURBO MODE!!!  WOOHOO!<br />
<br />
Ahhhh... memories.</div></div><hr />

Yes but how many computer platforms do you have it on? I can name at least two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The first video game I ever played was pong. The first computer game I ever played was star trek that printed a grid on paper and took commands one at a time. I think the next one was adventure that was loaded on an IBM 360 where my brother worked. &quot;Twisty little passages...&quot; heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well....<br />
<br />
If we want to go back to ancient history.. :)<br />
<br />
Pong was my first video game as well. <br />
<br />
My first computer was a TRS Color computer with a cassette tape player to load programs. I had a whopping 16k of memory on that machine. Also did some programming in Basic on it. My friend had a TRS Model 1 that we played Star Trek on, along with a couple of other games. <br />
<br />
I also remember when the Atari 2600 was the bomb in cartridge entertainment games. It was the first really successful cartridge machine and still has a following even today, after over 20 years since it was first introduced to the market. <br />
<br />
I also remember pinball machines before they talked to you.. (Trivia piece.. Gorgon, by Williams was the first voice machine). <br />
<br />
Remember when hard drives were 4 bucks (and higher) a meg? <br />
<br />
Ahh.. the good old days.. hehe. :)</div></div><hr />
