<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelzarQuickfoot</div><div class="date">11-06-2002, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok been hammering at this one for 2 weeks now.  I talked to paralin notion he sends me to speak to the master sergeant although he will not talk to me... just nods.<br />
<br />
I have petitioned about 10 times and even spoken to 2 admin gm's.  Not sure why I can't get him to talk to me so I can complete it yet I have watched 2 other guilds get the key and kill aerin'dar to get to hoh.<br />
<br />
I should mention I did go back to paralin notion and hand in the hearts anyways... he ganked them and didn't return them hence involving the gm's.<br />
<br />
Any of you experienced Rangers out there able to tell me if I missed something?  this is driving me nutz.  I'm 65 and can't even get my 63/64 spells cause they drop in hoh not in valor/storms.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delfner</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 08:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Same thing happened to me, he just nodded at me.  So I started the conversations over with the first guy and just repeated everything again, second time through everything worked...I'm guessing it's just some sort of bug, but that's what you should do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelzarQuickfoot</div><div class="date">11-07-2002, 09:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok I did some research I think I know what i'm doing wrong.  thanks for the responses.  will test tonight when I get off work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharidann</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eonowyn, you really should stop speaking to Prince Thirneg that way. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yzen Danek</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 09:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of these conversation 'flags' seem to be temporary, so that if you, for example, zone in between talking to one npc and the other, you need to go back and talk to the first one again before the second one will cue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BelzarQuickfoot</div><div class="date">11-08-2002, 03:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok... Well I have tried it 5 times last night alone.  Initially when you hail paralin notion he doesn;t speak to me either.  I have tried every variation i can do to get this to work with no luck.  I also heard there's some other guy you have to talk to named jonah poopah(1or something like that) but haven't seen him on track to speak to him.<br />
<br />
On my server.. these guys are on top of the tents....  (sigh) Talk about frustrating.<br />
<br />
Can anyone confirm for me then that either when you initially &quot;hail&quot; paralin notion he responds? (i only get stands at attention).  So i just say &quot;i am brave&quot; and he will start talking.<br />
<br />
2nd...  Is there someone you have to speak to before paralin notion?<br />
<br />
Thanks guys over 2 weeks working on this and have all the key parts.  GM's just are no help after going through 15 of them now including 2 admin gm's.</div></div><hr />
