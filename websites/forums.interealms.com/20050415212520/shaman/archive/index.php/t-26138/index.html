<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for me to move on :(<br />
<br />
Real life has just been so amazing for me now and I find little time to do things that I used to do, mainly game. With a new wife, new house, a new puppy and everything going so well, I want to dedicate more time to it. Therefore, I will not be continuing my involvement with the boards after that time. OGaming.com has agreed to bring the boards into their network, but I need one or two people from each board to still manage and run the place.<br />
<br />
Gloriana and her team has consistently done an amazing job on The Shaman's Crucible and I hope they can continue to do so. If not, I'll certainly be open to other leaders in the community that want to take on the same duties.<br />
<br />
Rangers, you've been my heart and soul for so long and it really is a difficult thing to walk away from. But after 5 years of tons of memories, good and bad, it's time for me to move on. I need to find someone amongst you that can continue the fine spirit of The Glade and The Crucible and continue this place on a new server.<br />
<br />
I can't thank you all enough for the years of fun and entertainment I have had running these boards. I know I don't play EQ anymore, but I still read about the trials and tribulations, the heartaches and more importantly, the joy, of being a Ranger.<br />
<br />
I will continue the Hunter's Lodge at a small server I have for personal hobbies and projects. So those of you that play WoW (all classes are on my board it seems) can still find a small slice of home there. I'm also going to open up a RL board, because that's the part I love and there is still a thriving community there.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how it will be on the new network. But I know that EQ, and to a lesser degree, EQ2, just doesn't have the appeal and the following that it once had. This community has reflected that change and I just think it's finally time to move on. I will let everyone know in the next week or so where the boards will be moving and who will be leading them. If you think you can step into this position, or know someone who can, please, let me know.<br />
<br />
Thank you again, for everything. I mean it from the bottom of my heart when I say I love you all and I will treasure the memories of this place and the people that made it what it was, forever.<br />
<br />
Goodbye my friends,<br />
<br />

You built a clubhouse and let us freeloaders slack about in it for half a decade.  We threw gummy bears and argued over woman woman vs. batgirl until it was sunrise again.  So many funny remarks and so really sick of pudding.  <br />
<br />
Thank you, David.</div></div><hr />

This place made me a GREAT shaman, showing me a lot of neat tricks that made EQ fun for me and my friends.<br />
<br />
The mods where(are) great, and sunmoon', thanks for providing such a great, lounge and resting spot for us Norrath weary folks who walked through and had to blather our tails of the good fights, the bad fights, and the raid targets who dinged off our dieing corpses.<br />
