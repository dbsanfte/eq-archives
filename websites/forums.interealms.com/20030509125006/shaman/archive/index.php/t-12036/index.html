<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know that just under me there is a post on where to hunt at 55 and most of these spots should work at 56.  I don't have LoY downloaded due to my slow connection and don't really plan on downloading it.  I am looking for spots in maybe PoP or somewhere that I can solo for say an hour at a time if I am on and off.  I have JBB and epic, no horse yet but will be getting within the next couple days.  I hear lots of talk about Katta guards?  Could anyone help me out with a guide on these?<br />

Katta guards are okay.  I'm there at 54 with JBB and mount and I get about 3 blues an hour.  Pulling is fairly easy.  6 mobs (8 if you pull the cave guards), come in pairs.  If they're not broken up yet, you might get double pulls.  All dark blue to me at 54.<br />
<br />
My usual battle goes like this:  Come in invised, set up near wall between tavern and staircase.  Pull tavern guards, then staircase guards, then bank guards.  By the time I'm done with the cycle, the mobs are up again.  So you get a steady stream.  I generally pull with Turgur's, then land an ebolt and click away on JBB.<br />
<br />
In the map below, the general area is where the bank and tavern are (items 10 and 11 on map)<br />

They drop some nice loot.  Custodus breastplates sell in bazaar for ~200pp (or 16pp to vendors) other weapon loot sells for around 4-5pp to vendors.  Plenty of weapons to save for/give dogdog too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info on Katta, I usually set up on the wall between the stairs and bar as suggested.  As far as adds go they don't seem to be a problem at all, half the time I only get one on my pulls, and if I do get too I just slow both and send dogdog onto one and let him deal with that while I root rot the other.  Thanks again, great spot.  I also camp my 60 enchanter there for KEI so I never have to leave and to sell weapons, as well as make dogdog a killing machine with haste.<br />
