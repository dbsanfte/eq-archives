<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dumahim Ashenbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So there I was last night in Erudin waiting for someone to log on so I could MQ a SSoC for him.  I was sitting behind the NPC for the turn-in just waiting, and a Ranger comes along and starts commenting about my swords and how he wished he could get some.  I assumed it was a newbie, but when I looked, he was 55 and duel wielding Centi LS.  So I told him I was just waiting for someone to come along so I could MQ the stone for him.  So he asked how much and I said 1k.  He said he'd offer me 2.5k.  Since our guild has a ton of them and me personally having 1 on my Ranger and cleric offered to do the MQ right then and there.  So I showed him where the bank was, I logged on my cleric and we went back to the NPC.  I asked for the money up front and asked him to link the hammer to be sure he had the right one.  So he said just tell him what to do.  So I tell him to sneak until she is indifferent.  I was doing the same, but had 2 failed sneaks so I was waiting.  Then he said he handed her the hammer.  I sat and thought for a second, &quot;no he didn't just do that.&quot;  I asked him, &quot;you didn't hit give did you?&quot;  He said he did.  /sigh  Right away he knew he screwed up and said he was an idiot.  I gave him his cash back and suggested talking with a GM to see if they'll be nice and return it.  I realize it's a fat chance, but still worth it.  <br />
<br />
But now here's where my problem comes in.  The other Ranger logged on right about then and was ready to do the MQ.  Well.....  The problem is since she has the hammer already, as soon as I hand in the stone, I get the hammer back.  I'd rather not have a quest item laying around for an epic I already have, just so I can burn another stone to do this guy's MQ.  So what I'm wondering is, am I going to have to wait for someone to come along and do his epic or a server reset before I can do the MQ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is a third option, much as you might not like to hear it . . .<br />
<br />
Kill the NPC.  <br />
<br />
I do not know that anyone has done this, but I doubt the respawn time would be too bad.  At best, you wait a half hour or so and then do the MQ.  At worst, you've forced everyone to wait for the next server reset.  <br />
<br />
Which, looking at the EverquestLive site, won't be all that long :<br />
Tuesday, January 28th, at 3AM PST, (11AM GMT), all EverQuest servers will be brought down for a scheduled patch<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Braslo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">another option is for you (or cleric) to turn in the sphere which causes you to get the hammer back for the 1st guy... <br />
<br />
(this clears NPC to do other MQ with your friend)<br />
<br />
then hold onto the 1st guys hammer untill he has done the other steps and is ready for the Kaladim part.  You turn in the hammer and he can get stage-2 for swirfty.  They you guys have to decide if you hold the ore for another MQ later, or if he does that part seperately, but it would require a lot of redo for him, including this whole part that got messed up, including him having to get another sphere (which was the whole problem in the first place).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kimexe Calmbow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">=/  If he wanted to do MQ, he should have known the process in detail. It is his own Epic, he is responsible for every single step he takes.<br />
Dumahim, not your fault.<br />
<br />
What he did, though, had screwed not only himself, but also every other rangers who want to do MQ. If GM won't help (as it's issue about MQ), MQ is practically disabled on your server till next server-down. <br />
Two way to reset this status...<br />
1) Waste one sphere and complete the turn-in. destroy the returned hammer.<br />
2)Kill the NPC (no one would like to do it tho)<br />
<br />
---<br />
Sometimes people want their epic without knowing steps/items for their own quest. In one of Hole raid for Shaman friend, we've killed Iksar NPC at top of undead tower. Then, a pally looted the item!! He said he thought it's for his epic. So, he did not know name of the mob, location of the mob, name of the item, well, know nothing about his epic. Not deserve to epic.<br />
That was mixed raid include 3 or 4 guilds. There was looong silence in chat channel. (I felt a bit relieved as the pally is not of my guild.)<br />
We can not be too careful when doing important action.</div></div><hr />
