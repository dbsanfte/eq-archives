<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry about this but I know there was a thread on this some time ago, just can't seem to find it.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was thinking that for this part of the epic, I might attempt to tag along on a raid for some other rangers epic. I would then have to convince the raid to help me do my epic after their ranger has done his/hers (I'm unguilded). So the question is can we make Jaeil the Insane spawn twice in a row ? Or is there some sort of block on this.<br />
<br />
If it is possible to make him spawn twice in a row, then their ranger can make him spawn, kill him, loot the piece, then I make him spawn again, kill him and loot too. <br />
<br />
Any help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

When you get down there, Jaeil the Wretched should be up.  No one should ever kill him, and if someone accidently gets aggro with him that person should be left to die and get a rez.  He should be dubious to you, and non kos to everyone.<br />
<br />
Each ranger, in turn, hands in the Shiny Tin Bowl you'd used to make the Hardened Mixture.  At that point, Jaeil the Insne spawns and the raid kills him, leaving Jaeil the Wretched alive for the next ranger to do his hand in.<br />
<br />
Note, it may be necesary to sue sneak to ensure good enough faction.  When I went I was dubious, and I used sneak.  All the rangers who got Jaeil when I got him used sneak.  I have never heard of anyone not using sneak, just in case, so I do not know if it is really necessary.  However, I (and the rest of them with me) was unwilling to risk the loss of the bowl due to bad faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok thank you. Going to try that just as soon as I find a raid kind enough to take me along for the ride.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lucor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">remember each ranger does one hand in at the time, i.e. forst ranger hand bowl, the wretched spawns, kill him, then do next hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you're chain spawning J the Insane, pull him a little way up the tunnel when you engage him, just makes it easier to be sure that nobody can accidentally agro the J the Wretched.</div></div><hr />
