<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sure there are a few threads already going about Shaman effectiveness in GoD, but I want to talk about our general effectiveness over all in this new expansion.<br />
<br />
I knew already that this new expansion would give everyone a challange that they havent experianced for a long time.  And in order to do that, mobs would have to hit with insane damage, and everyone would have to try their hardest in order to overcome many obsticals.  Yes, that sure seems to be what is happening.   <br />
<br />
Now, in order to overcome these obsticals, a perfectly balanced group would need to be formed, which includes = <br />
<br />
Healer - Tank - DPS - puller - and you also need crowd control (mez, slow, root, etc)<br />
 <br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is that only 6 people can be in a group at one time. SO, you need to pick and choose classes that can fulfill all of the above.<br />
<br />
You see, they made these mobs hit very very hard, but with few hit points.  So yet again, our dots are useless. <br />
<br />
And since we cannot fulfill the duties of the first four jobs (Healing maybe a little), our only option left would be crowd control.  But what do we have in our spell books that would help that. <br />
 <br />
Well, lets take a look. We have Malos, Slow, and Root.  I am sure most of you know by now that slowing most mobs in GoD are only &quot;slightly successfull&quot; , &quot;Partially successfull&quot; at best.  And slow alone would not keep the mobs under control alone. No, you need the mobs to be either mezmorized or rooted far away to do that.  And we all know what rooting mobs far way can do (if the mob can acutally be rooted).  And anyways, there are classes that can perform all of these tasks (mainly bards and enchanters).<br />
<br />
Personally, I have seen many groups formed in my guild that would not even look twice at a Shaman to be invited into their group. Although, we do have one thing, &quot;I am sorry we are looking for an enchanter or a bard.  BTW can you give us Focus please&quot;.  I cry in agony every time I hear those words.<br />
<br />
I am sure that I am not the only one to share this pain.   Please, let your fellow shaman know how you guys feel about our overall effectiveness in this new expansion.   :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I'm seeing single pulls in GoD are relatively easy.  You really dont need a &quot;puller&quot; or crowd control any more then you do in PoP for example.  <br />
<br />
That leave us with needing healing, a tank, and DPS, the same as its always been.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">apparently you havent been to the KoD Expeditions yet, have you ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My regular group has SHM/SK/ROG/BL/BRD/CLR and works really well imho. Mobs hit hard enough to make our cleric lom sometimes, so an extra patcher is usefull.  <br />
With the lack of easy CR'ing keeping a cleric alive is key to many of the expediation, we can fill that role too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I can feel your pain.<br />
<br />
Mobs indeed have less hp and hit harder.<br />
Mobs mitigate slow even more then they did in PoP<br />
<br />
Effectively this comes down to reducing the need to have a shaman in your group.<br />
Our heals are so small (compared to mob DPS) that they are not a factor when building a group.<br />
Our slow is (as stated before) not that much better then an Enchanters or BST’s <br />
Our DPS is low, we need to slow a mob (granted that only takes 3 seconds with a tA but still) and then we can start casting that DD.<br />
<br />
Fact is that I would not include a shaman in any GoD group would I myself not have been one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It is really not any players fault, its just how things came to be.  Things in a group that eveyone tries to get, in GoD =<br />
<br />
1-Healer<br />
2-puller<br />
3-Tank /dps<br />
4-dps<br />
5-dps<br />
6-slower<br />
7-Mesmerizer (recomended but not required unless things get sticky)<br />
8-backup healer (recomended but not required until you get to mobs that hit for 2k+)<br />
<br />
Now, practically all classes can fulfill multiple tasks very well, all depending on the situation.  Now for regular exp. groups, I think we can contribute quite a bit.  As for as the new Expeditions goes, there are better, more efficient choices out there. <br />
 Yes, we can pull off being backup healer, and we always slow.  But if a situation starts getting out of hand (which can EASILY happen), there is nothing more we can contribute.  <br />
We cant pull a mob off of a cleric without dying ourselves (tank/mez).  <br />
We cannot keep our heals up with the infliction, that a mob can put on another person.  <br />
And our dps is all dependant on how long the mob stays alive.  <br />
<br />
Ask yourself this, if you had to put a group together for a very hard expedition, in which all of the requirements above needed (or wanted) to be fulfilled, would there be any room for a shaman ? <br />
<br />
I didnt type two extra dps requirements by mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am sure most of you know by now that slowing most mobs in GoD are only &quot;slightly successfull&quot; , &quot;Partially successfull&quot; at best. <br />
<br />
Far from the truth... in fact I have found that there are far less mobs mitigating slow than those that do not, and the 'normal' mobs most commonly mitigate at mostly.<br />
<br />
Unless you are spending time in different zones than I am.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm...I get calls to GoD on a daily basis....<br />
<br />
And I think I heal rather well even in GoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The sewers expeditions I have done so far 95 pct of the mobs were fully slowable with the exception of some that were completely immune.<br />
I didn't feel useless at all... we didn't have any CR's (except then for the scouting rogue who met a mob that saw through his Sos).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think that people that feel that GoD mitigates so much more then PoP or whatever are just killing mobs in the entrance and stuff. On the expiditions i have found so far that mobs are full slowable, again, unless you count the unslowable beasts that are practicly like killing a BoT named.<br />
<br />
I think i do well. You have to remember that we do get a form of CC now. VP is not just a root, but its a knock back root and at VP3 its a serious knockback. The person above states that we have no way to get a mob off a cleric, i disagree. I use VP almost exclusivly for this as well as handling adds. This is why the term &quot;ghetto mezzing&quot; is so popular these anymore with shaman. I see it on their root hotkeys more and more. If the mob summons you can then sick dog dog or SC on it to stop it from summoning whoever it is also.<br />
<br />
Shaman have alot of tools and i more often then not find that things people claim we cant do, we actualy can, it just requires more work and inovation then another class. Like in my example of CC obviously its not as easy as clicking you /cast 4 hotkey that the mezzing chanter has, but in the long run its pretty much as effective if your group listens to you and moves away from the &quot;ghetto mezzed&quot; mob. I think one thing that would seriously help is in the usefulness of CC would be a hasten VP AA. 3 min is not too bad a recast time, but if you could get it down to 1min or even 30 sec, would would become VASTLY more useful, infact i would put us right up there with bards on CC if we got this cause i see bard mezz get resisted alot more then i see my VP not take hold. A slight negitive modifier would be great too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, i can certainly feel your pain. We did get shafted again, we all been over that and sighing and moaning is over. Personaly i think its time to take what we got now and just run with it best you can. Thats what im doing anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">OK, the way I see it, if the mobs hit &quot;very, very hard&quot; then I want the best, most reliable slow I can get.  Even a small percentage difference in slowing can make a significant differnce in the mobs dps.  I would rather have a shaman that can reliably stick his 75% slow (with debuff or not), even if it gets mitigated.  Yeah, dps of course is not our forte, but spot healing and root parking still add significant value.<br />
<br />
Sure, all things being equal, a shaman may not be part of the GoD Dream Team, maybe.  But I would propose that a well played character is the best member of any team.  And we certainly bring enough to the group to be considered a valuable member, even if not essential.<br />
<br />
Lets face it, many of the Kunark era folks got accustomed to a Trinity group, Tank/Healer/Slower, being the core of all groups (when shaman were essential and therefore king).  We need to get over this, things have changed, we are no longer essential in all cases/scenarios.   Just like clerics are no longer essential in LDoN, etc.  However, being a good player with a good reputation will get you a lot more invites than the +5% slow advantage.  Max the abilities of your class and you will be wanted in plenty of groups.  And if your guildies are not inviting you into groups, then I'd go to a guild that is willing to play with all of it's members, whether they are part of a &quot;perfect&quot; group or not.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, all I have to spare.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">All our complaints have been amplified in GoDs: no dps, no serious healing, expendable slow. I am currently in Vxed and Tipt to support my statement.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The problem is not with our slow being useless - it is very worthwhile. However you do not invite someone just for slow. Our buffs are still sub par, our healing is more insignificant then ever and our DPS is still crappy.<br />
So far I did feel a little better then I did in LDoN / PoP, mainly because so far groups tend to load up on healers, making kills last longer and thus I am able to sometimes get a Bane running for full.<br />
<br />
By the way, I love the new content - it is innovative, challenging and fun. The only way to make shaman more useful by content is to introduce more single group 10 minute fights or zonewide manadrains or super-resistant MOBs that must be slowed and it is understandable that those are not widespread.<br />
<br />
Bottomline, GoD changed nothing about our situation so far and I do not expect that to get better as I progress further.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hell, no.  Right now I'm the 2nd most desired class in GoD.  First being a cleric obviously, but I'm above the tank really cause a 12k tank isn't going to do **** without a slower, and tanks can come in sks, warrior or knights.  I have not for a minute not been able to get a group asap when I wanted one.  Mobs in most sewer zones don't mitigate slow and that's great for us.  Mobs in vxed and tipd do.  But, the mobs now in the kod'taz trials are fully slowable, and a beastlord is not goin to be able to slow off the bat reliably without some form of debuff on the mobs first.  I can't wait to get the new slow to use here so that I can get off a quick slow without malos first.  On top of this, most of the named in the trials are fully immune to slow.  This means that we may need to help heal.  I find that I can easily heal keep a warrior healed on a non-named mob while the cleric/druid meds.  Easily.  Doing it with keeping BoT on the tank, and rarely casting tnargs.  Hell, I went three fights once being the only slower where I slowed the mob, stuck BoT on the tank, and sat there and watched the tank stay at 90% health.<br />
<br />
Nope, I can tell you right now for some areas we are golden.  I've got three active shaman in my guild (5 total, but 2 are busy at this time) and 4 beastlords, and it is the shaman that have had 75% of the groups.  Hell, out of the first 10 groups that finished the tipd trials, 8 of them consisted of a shaman, and I was in three of them helping flag others.  <br />
<br />
I do think that maybe at least a 500 point increased heal will be needed.  With slow, we can prob heal kod groups, but I don't think that we can do it effectively without a bigger heal.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah, even with fully debuffing the mob, I find I can still do 4 - 7k dmg on a mob before he's dead.  That's still pretty substantial considering the time that they last and stuff.  All depends on crit rates and resists of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And where did BoT drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">kod'taz.  At least, the only taelosian stones that i've seen linked were from kod'taz.  You need to turn in the stone to an taelosian in abysmal.  So far i'm pretty sure that the only spell you get from the turn in is BoT.... at least every shaman that i know that has it has gotten the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">VP is not just a root, but its a knock back root and at VP3 its a serious knockback.

.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Well i do not know how much u have used VP in GoD, but it resists atleast half the time (and that is with are disease debuff on), and if it does work, it NEVER lasts the full two min.  Not to mention there is a two min recovery time on that.  Infact my regular root seems to stick a  lot more the our VP.    <br />
 As far as the first for trials go (sewer trials), sure you can you have any differenct combination of classes, any gimp group can do them.      <br />
 But it is when you start going up in the trials is when you will start seeing what im talking about, haveing all 8 of those group requirements filled.<br />
 Sure, I have been choosen to be in groups for the KoD trials, but I am sure if there was a druid or chanter availiable, they would have picked them first.  <br />
 It just seems like we are on the way bottom of the wanted list when it comes to GoD groups, mostly because other classes can be more effective at multiple tasks then we can.  That is all I am trying to say.<br />
<br />
I mean, who would you rather have as a slower.............<br />
<br />
-Enchanter =  They can mez right away needed in sticky situations(so there is no need for an additional healer to heal everyone thats getting hit from th adds).  their slow is almost as effective, and they can put out more dps then any other class if they make a charmed pet.  Not to mention the always wanted Clarity5.<br />
<br />
-Bard = One of the best pullers in the game (i think). Can mez, slow, snare, add dps, give dps to other classes, clarity, etc.....<br />
<br />
-BL = Can add good dps to a group with their pet.  Can give whole group a good amount of mana and hp back from their AAs.  Their 3rd best slowers in the game, which is still very effective to say the least.  They dont do too bad at light tanking.  And they have a light form of clarity.<br />
<br />
-Shaman = our slow is a bit better then the other slowing classes.  Our heal is about equivalant to about one and a half hits from a mob.  We either dont have time for any DPS, or we get agroed all the time from doting too early.  Our buffs have no form of mana regen.<br />
<br />
Why would I pick a Shaman over the other slowing classes ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">i did replace my guilds best beastlord in a vxed group after their fourth wipe the other day.  they had killed 95 mobs and almost had the stonespiritist popped, but they had serious problems in the trial.  The group makeup consisted of 2 clerics, 2 monks, beastlord and a paladin.  After they asked me to replace the beastlord cause he had to go, things became so much easier for them. First off, the group wasn't exactly made up of ideal members.  Second, one of the clerics was just barely there (meaning at the time she was supposed to be healing, she was two boxing a shaman that she'd never played before in bot.  i know this cause she sent me tells asking me how to play one right before i joined them).  When i got there things changed, because I suddenly because something that they lacked.  Someone to control adds.  When mobs were in camp, i would make sure they took agro to me and run them slightly out of camp and root park them.  Then when mobs would turn to run, i would make sure to keep them out of the way.  I also helped keep the melee healed, and the monks pulling healed.  It's hard to say exactly what I did, but things became so much easier for them when i got there.  <br />
<br />
I really don't know why some of you complain so much.  Right now my class is the most highly sought after class for my guilds group, next to clerics.  Maybe this is cause they know I can play my shaman, and I can add just as much dps as a beastlord can, albeit a bit more work for me.  I don't know, but I'm not complaining.  <br />
<br />
I think more and more shamans may be getting disgruntled, but I think more than anything most of us are bringing it on ourselves.</div></div><hr />

Because you don't understand the strengths of each character in a group when more than one are in the group.<br />
<br />
Enchanter slowing AND handling a charmed pet that hits for 1k+? That's just asking for a quick wipe.<br />
<br />
Best group I have seen so far in Vxed/Tipt, although doesn't have to be this make-up to succeed:<br />
<br />
Enchanter: Charm Pet, mez<br />
Bard: Pulling, Mez, DPS<br />
Shaman: Slow, CC, healing, Some DPS<br />
Warrior: duh, tank<br />
Cleric: Heal, and also some DPS if the group is doing well<br />
Insert any other class here... DPS or whatever</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">On the contrary, charmed pets are commonly done im my guild with next to no complications.  When pet breaks - <br />
<br />
 Usually someone in the group stuns it right away so chanter has time to recharm it.<br />
<br />
It is sometimes snared as well , so when charm breaks it will let the chanter have a bit more time to run back and recharm it.<br />
<br />
Yes, you have to keep an eye on the chanter and pet most of the time.  But it is so worth it, if your group is not lazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Shaman = our slow is a bit better then the other slowing classes.  Our heal is about equivalant to about one and a half hits from a mob.  We either dont have time for any DPS, or we get agroed all the time from doting too early.  Our buffs have no form of mana regen.<br />
<br />
Why would I pick a Shaman over the other slowing classes ??<br />
<br />
I hear ya man. But this is where you bring you skills to the table. I realize VP gets resisted, but if this happens, you toss out a regular root. I have built into my root hotkey in big letters MOVE AWAY FROM IT. So not you dont get the knockback effect and instantly push it out of the way, but if your group is listening you will have the same ghetto mezz effect. <br />
<br />
Actualy another CC method is to hit something with slow and even if it gets resisted, itll aggro you over everyone else if its a add, then run away from the group ( sit if needed ) and cast root through a few hits and back up. Now even if a mob is hitting for 800+ you can still channel off a root generaly. If it doesnt work, well thats life, you take risks, i cant tell you how many times i see a chanter die cause a mezz was resisted and the beast ate through rune and them. The cleric should be paying enough attention to shoot you atleast 1 quick heal before you die and thus giving you ample time to try to channel through a root a few times.  The cast time on GI is 1.8 seconds, thats pretty freaking fast. Like i said its not a perfect science, but honestly, how trival you want this to be ? I know you want a lil danger a lil challange a lil uncertainty dont you ?<br />
<br />
But i hear man. I will not even begin to try to argue we need to bring more to the table, something unique now that our stat buffs are more and more less important, especialy with GoD content now. I can only hope that we are simply not high on the &quot;tweak list&quot; more then we are neglected. But thats pure hope.<br />
<br />
Just saying, try to make use of your tools as best ya can. Try to not look at it as &quot; this is what i have and its not enough&quot;. Try to see it like &quot; this is what i have, lets see how i can make something work &quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Garreth Lawbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yes I think we could use a bigger direct heal, aside from that I havent had a moments rest since GoD came out.  If im not in an expedition, I have lots of tells begging me to join.  Shaman get a very diverse set of abilities, so much so we are stronger than the sum of our individual abilities.  I feel wanted on raids still, and I still get into exp groups, so maybe we should stop looking on the greener grass on the other side of the fence and enjoy what we have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Having worked on the sewers a little, I can definitely say that I am a worthwhile addition to a group.<br />
<br />
I may not be the &quot;perfect&quot; member, and yes, a time-geared beastlord can probably get the job done just as well as me minus malos, quiessence, patch heals, sltw, FA, focus, regen..oh...wait...no they can't.<br />
<br />
Our slow is the best in the game.  Yes, there are lots of people that come close, but ours is the best.  Do I think it needs to be upgraded?  Sure...but do I get passed over for groups because a BL is lfg?  Not often.<br />
<br />
I bring a lot to the table as a shaman, healing, cc, dps, buffs, debuffs.  If you use the tools right, you can do a lot in most groups.  <br />
<br />
One of the problems is that we are a true support class.  We're not flashy like even our priest counterparts are.  Clerics have huge heals, druids have great nukes.  We drop slow, malos, Q the tank, dot the mob while dog dog chews at it.  No one sees big letters flashing on the screen that say &quot;SHAMANS ARE GODS!&quot; like the 7K crit the wizard got, or the 6K cleanse the pally just had, etc.  But trust me, if we're not there, they notice.<br />
<br />
Even if the mob mitigates, I feel I'm still bringing plenty to the table to be useful.  Would a BL or other class put out more dps in some situations, or maybe add a little extra oomph elsewhere?  Absolutely.  Would the group wipe because I wasn't there in some situations?  You're damn right.  Which would you prefer, to be 6 seconds faster on each mob right up to your CR...or avoid the CR and keep killing?  *shrug*<br />
<br />
I've seen SO many threads about our class being nerfed.  I completely agree that we need help, we need fixes to spells (Turgur's, anyone?) and some new abilities.  But I still love my shaman, and I know for a fact things run a little more smoothly because I'm in a group, even if it's not flashy.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes, your right. We do bring alot to the table.  But in the much higher tier trials (way past the sewer trials), our combination of tools that we have are not saught after all that much anymore.<br />
For instance, our first job is to malos/slow the mob when it first comes.  Yes we can do that great.  But now groups are looking for much more then that.  And the problem is, the rest of what we got hasnt shown to be the most effective.<br />
<br />
The only thing we can do after we debuff is heal, DPS, and buffs after the mob is dead.  The problem comes in when we cannot be efficient at these things.<br />
<br />
Heals - well, we all know whats wrong with this. <br />
<br />
DPS - our dots are out of the question because mobs only last about 3 ticks after we spend the time debuffing the mob.  And our nukes takes too long and puts out little damage. Doggy is a plus, but no one takes a shamans pet serious.<br />
<br />
Buffs - Everyone that has gone this far is max stats anyhow, so only our FoS, and perhaps the old sltw is wanted.  FA is also nice, but you dont hear anyone whining about not haveing it.<br />
<br />
 When Shaman were first created, we were the &quot;Swiss Army Knife&quot; of classes.  We had just about everything that a group needed, we just werent the complete best at them (exept for debuffing).  So for Exp. groups, or non-balanced groups, you couldnt ask for anything more. <br />
<br />
 Now, Groups need classes that that can do the best at whats needed for a successfull Expedition.  <br />
Well, the only thing that we are the BEST at, is slow.  Which can be substituted by 3 other classes.<br />
<br />
I am sure many of you are not haveing a hard time finding groups, and playing a big part in groups. Hey, I was almost being harrased from people wanting me to join their groups for the sewer trials.  But now that I have past all of that, I just sit on the sidelines soaking up information just so I can at least be effective at that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Second, one of the clerics was just barely there (meaning at the time she was supposed to be healing, she was two boxing a shaman that she'd never played before in bot.  i know this cause she sent me tells asking me how to play one right before i joined them).  When i got there things changed, because I suddenly because something that they lacked.  Someone to control adds.  When mobs were in camp, i would make sure they took agro to me and run them slightly out of camp and root park them.  Then when mobs would turn to run, i would make sure to keep them out of the way.  I also helped keep the melee healed, and the monks pulling healed.  It's hard to say exactly what I did, but things became so much easier for them when i got there. <br />
When discussing class balance, would you mind not comparing us to people who are twoboxing in different zones? Talking from personal experience is nice but telling us you did comparetively well in a group where someone was paying at best half attention seems silly.<br />
<br />
Right now my class is the most highly sought after class for my guilds group, next to clerics.  Maybe this is cause they know I can play my shaman, and I can add just as much dps as a beastlord can, albeit a bit more work for me.<br />
You can? Ok, I will bite. How?</div></div><hr />

Chanters are a bit too fragile on the named mobs in there and if u have a decent puller, mezzing is not so much of an issue.<br />
<br />
The ability of the shaman to do the best slow and resist debuffs as well as patch heal the tank and the cleric if they get agro is VERY nice on these trials.  And no not all mobs mitigate slow in Kod.<br />
<br />
On another point my experiences in the two mountain trials are crowd control for a shaman was not an issue.  If two mobs came i just tried fast root at a distance and if it was resisted i hit vp.  Seemed to work 90% of the time with at least one of them.  Adding in a disease debuff if time helped further.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">How are Enchanters a bit to fragil for boss mobs? they tanking or what?<br />
i dont have agro problems with a decent tank but then i usualy dispell the (boss)mob first on inc to get rid of haste and sow and stuff. and dispell has not much agro. But Enchanters have a nifty thing called CoD (call of druzzil i think) wich lets them charm a mob and haste wich lets the pet put out some 900ish dps.They also have a free selfrune i think for 1500hp or something wich puts them easily above a shamans hp.<br />
and since they can slow aswell as a shaman (well the good chanters can atleast!!!) there is just no point of adding a shaman add to that the posibility of mez. bards on the other hand can not only slow but are also very good pullers. and shamans we can um slow.. thats it even a paladin would be a better backuphealer especialy combined with an enchanter.<br />
druids are better too and they can snare. lets face it we might get groups cus friend but never cus our class is the best choice it isnt.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: oh before you say but if charm breaks chanter is dead. thats just not true. if your tank has any clue he can use his taunt abilities (warriors) or nifty spells like stun (paladins ) wich gives the enchanter more then enough time (since he is runed aswell of course) to recharm the pet. sure if you allready have 4 mobs beating on your group and the pet breaks that might be bad however i cant see a shaman of any help with that anyways:)</div></div><hr />

PLaying the chanter is an art form when charming. And if you are the primary slower your group will die. It might not happen right away. But it is going to happen. <br />

Inc 2. Charm broke. One resist dead as the developers souls. <br />

Enchanters have alot of advantages, but I rarly see a chanter Spot heal a cleric when he has aggro and is getting mugwhumped.<br />
<br />
Enchanters die more than any other class in the game. When they are pushing thier abilities. I wish there were SoE logs to prove it to everyone but over 5 years of playing It is a fact to me. <br />
<br />
Are shaman a holy trinity group?  No they are not. But I am a viable group with just me and mutt. And can add ANY other class as well to make it even better. That does count for something. In my mind at least.<br />

And the first time a guild member told me no we don't need you they would be reminded that next time they want to come group with me an the 5 billion other times they already have come and grouped with me... Well I didnt need them either. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I dont agree that enchanters die most. i have seen more tanks die lately then enchanter charming. our tanks can easily of agro the mob of the ench when he hits the charm broke hotkey . more often then not the rune isnt even gone by then . sure i have seen charm gone bad but that is realy rare.there is also the nifty divine arb ability from clerics if alot goes bad. it has no agro aswell. our clerics normal dont agro on a 2 pull so wont need the spot heal. and like i said if you want a back up healer druids and especialy paladins are much much better . divine arb plus a groupheal from paladin is very nice combination. the fast heal from the paladin with its ultra short cast time(tho long recast) is also way better then anything we can bring on the table. plus if he stuns the pet the enchanter can easily take it over again. also as your group is good your chanter wont realy die  minus some ugly trains but then like i said what can a shaman do then? and the pet is sick dps....<br />
i never said KT trials are imposible with a shaman but if they have a chanter(and if they dont fix the last mob you kinda need one or a bard) there is no point to add an shaman if there is a skilled druid cleric or paladin avail as backuphealer avail. we are only 4th choice. thats the whole problem with the 6 person limit and having 16 classes. you look for those who offer the most(or are required). and shamans are certainly not the best choice. but like i said before: i have seen more warriors die (not nessesary in my group) then chanters. but you are right if you consider how many nonskilled chanters are out there most likely their numbers should add up on deaths:)</div></div><hr />

Maybe im just playing in zones where AoE stun is not effective, but i cant remember seeing a chanter us this tactic in a LONG LONG time. Perhaps its not effective to do so in PoP/GoD/Higher end content?<br />

From what I've seen I don't think replacing me with an Enchanter or Bst would have helped the party. Either mobs are easy enough to me to offtank or the enchanters that I know would get smooshed in seconds on a resist. Even the one Time enabled enchanter I know (with all his AAs) doesn't take hits all that well. Admittedly, he hasn't been raiding much so his gear is probably subpar for Time. As for a Bst, would you rather have a shaman to help keep the group alive in a bad situation or a BST who can help the group kill mobs 10 seconds faster? I guess the answer depends on the person forming the group but I certainly don't feel that I bring less to the table. After all, I haven't heard of many time limits even in the trials so killing speed isn't that important. <br />
<br />
Bard, on the other hand, I'll grant you. They can take the hits on a resisted Mez along with everything else they bring to the table. Even given that, you can build a pretty powerful group around a cleric/bard/shaman/tank combo. They might not kill as quick as other combos but it's extremely resilient if you get in over your head.

So far from my observations:<br />
1.Cleric &gt; all<br />
2.War &gt;&gt; Pally &gt; Sk<br />
3.Ench &gt; Shaman = Bard &gt; BL<br />
4.Monk about even with Bard for pulling, not sure of this one tho.<br />
5/6 &lt;insert any other class here&gt;<br />
Bard can fill 2 major roles in pulling and/or cc.<br />
My advice, make friends with a monk or bard, because without reliable single pulls I would go for the chanter first. (rooting has not been reliable cc and my VP in particular has performed very badly).<br />
Good news is we stack well with those 2 classes, and I have succeeded in 2x vxed, once with bard, once with monk.<br />
Bad news is chanters **** all over us again because adds need to be controlled better than ever before, and they have the option in many cases of using monstrously overpowered pets.<br />
Being in a time equipped guild makes my job easier tho, and I haven't yet been stopped from doing anything because of no chanter. <br />
I would like to hear more from the perspective of the non raid guild player, and hear some more from people like Snoww who play both classes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are some good observations.<br />
<br />
I'll add to the anecdote about Virulent Parlysis.  Its been breaking way too early and when a mob doing on the order of 800-1000 dps is banging away at you its really hard to get it off because of its relatively slow cast time.  Also it just plain doesn't land on alot of stuff in the more difficult trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">i see that the only way my guild will use a beastlord in a kod trial over me, is if they have two clerics as the healers.  We are just too valuable with our extra heals, and I often take over heals for the cleric while him and the druid regen some mana (because 95% of the time the only buff that they have for regen is 9 and mana song).<br />
<br />
oh, and I do as much damage as a beastlord by... /gasp... casting spells.  Yep, i throw a bane up there, throw a rain or two and use either torrent or VS, and then dogdog adds what dmg he can do himself with that.</div></div><hr />

A defensive warrior and two clerics to pull off a 6-person encounter is freaking asinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, (especially after they twinked it two nights ago) the KoD trials cannot be done with just a cleric and a shaman for heals, at least not on the named npcs that spawn adds.  Even a druid is haveing a hard time with it now.   Yes, we can do dps, but you have no time for it when your spaming heals on the mt, trying to keep him alive.  And the names with their spawned adds, cannot be slowed.   KoD expedition groups are just not looking for shaman, we have nothing to offer that would give them an advantage to win those trials.  <br />
<br />
That is the point I am makeing.  Now I am sure shaman have gotten the flags but that is either before the recent patch, or the group substituted a dps for the shaman instead of the backup healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">we did the trials kod trial 1 last night.  spent two days wiping to it before we finished it for the first time last night.  Two of the named fight I was the only person healing for a good 20 secs cause I was the only one with mana.  Tank wouldn't have stayed alive if not for me.  Had a druid and a cleric too as the primary healers.  Plus, I got the kill shot on one of them with bane, bos and nife on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Val I would be shocked if you are kicking out higher dps then you're BL+pet over a short peroid of time. And don't claim you didn't feel kinda useless during 7th trial, I know you felt the same pain I did :/<br />
<br />
Anyway, as far as kod trials go the perfect group for them does include a shaman. It includes the shaman zoning in, it includes the shm clearing trash.....then you rep the shm for a class that can heal better or do better dmg for the boss fights. Why? Because SoE has balanced our class around turgurs since rok. We are second to third class citizens in all aspects of mob encounters except for slow, and thats been our primary function in the eq world. Enter GoD red con's and how they are tuned. These red con mobs are designed to kick the hell out of the best geared tanks, so right off what do they do with them? Thats right, they make them slow immune. I would say all but maybe 1 red con we have encountered in kod trials and raids was slow immune. Puts a real handicap on our class desirability for 6 man trials, were everyone has to be either doing high dps or have a large amount of healing power to keep the poor tank alive. Sure we can do ok total dmg, but it takes awhile to do it. With the dps red cons are putting out, you don't have that much time. Now that ench charm is gone from these trials I suspect there will be a whole lot more attention to just how set the group makeup is required to win them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">yeah, we needed to have a third healer.

they added respawn on the pats thats what changed wich will make a chanter even more desireable since he can mez those if they show up bad moment. and with a chanter in that trial there is just no room for us until every other backuphealer is busy or our friends want to keep us because we are friends.and the one saying that alot of other classes are in same boat is correct. welcome to god</div></div><hr />

I guess we just hope our guildies take pity and push us through here, or that there is a raid to avoid flags like there is for the sewers and mountain trials.  Think i would prefer the first route as i quite fancy a prayer ring  :p  <br />
<br />
We can but pray that when we get out the other side we become useful again, like we were in the earlier trials.  I must of sat lfg with all the other time shaman i know on my server at the Kod'Taz entrance on AB today for about 4 hours before a smith raid was called in Ferubi.<br />

Yes, I did all three of these trials with a Cleric/Shaman combo. I'm betting your cleric was trying to use CH all the time, which will not work. You have to have a smart cleric who knows when to use CH and when to use SL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Well, I was asked to join in a few Tipt/Vxed specifically because I am a shaman.  Don't forget, even if you don't like a shaman much in the trials, what about everything that's past the trials?  Who's going to be giving you focus if you don't get shaman through? Count that as sub-par if you will, but who doesn't want it? Who will give you malos/malosinia, since mages are often rare and chanters are often too cowardly to tash? Okay, so maybe in Kod and later trials we must rely on friends.  That sucks in a way that only a non-necessary class can ever be expected to truly understand or give a rat's behind about.  (EQ is not a friendly game.)  But at this stage, you're probably elemental.  Or time.  Even if you have no friends, you probably have a guild to have gotten that far.  And if they got you that far, they have incentive to get you farther, so you can continue doing for them all the things that you did before GoD -- whatever that is.<br />
<br />
I wrote, as ReflanX, a response detailing what shamans can do on www.thesafehouse.org, main forum, under a thread they had on shamans and slowing.  I was talking about Vxed/Tipt/sewers. Some people on this thread are, some are not.  That's one of the things that make people argue -- what trial? HOW uber the shaman? how jerky the guild or supposed (*chortle*) friends?  (I guess now's your time to see, eh?)<br />
<br />
Seriously, you need a quite high level cleric(max FT at 15 as a bare MINimum) for Vxed/Tipt, and it wouldn't hurt in sewers of course, but you also need one with a big mana pool.  The difference in healing potential between clerics is incredibly vast in the GoD I've been exposed to.  I noticed just huge variations in cleric mana when they are pushed to the limit like many are in Vxed/Tipt.  When you have to keep moving, can't spend much time medding, and need plenty of healing, shamans can do what enchanters can't -- heal, and what a lot of enchanters can't but won't -- slow early and live with the consequences.<br />
<br />
If anything, I think GoD didn't make shaman irrelevant, it made other classes irrelevant sometimes if they don't have the gear and AA.  This is definitely a high level expansion.  Time geared people fail these expeditions.  <br />
<br />
However, I did great as a shaman in full ornate with only belt, mask, and cloak elemental in Vxed/Tipt/sewers.<br />
<br />
Thank goodness for decent AA! And a few good focuses, like detrimental haste off my POA cloak and extended buff duration off my AA and umm.. wrapped steel belt or something from POA too.  Anyway it's something, but my gear is not going to make all that many people drool to say the least, since every slot that can fit ornate in it has...ornate in it.<br />
<br />
What do I mean by other classes having the problem?  I wouldn't do GoD expeditions without a tank with all his defensive AA and a BoW if a warrior, and hopefully at least 9k in hitpoints.  Honestly, 9k makes me shiver - please give me 10k.  I've done it with 10k-plus tanks the times I've done it, and we've come darn close to wiping a number of times, and other times, well, we did wipe.  Never failed, though, on Vxed/Tipt.<br />
<br />
I pity the warrior without the AA, BoW, and gear.  I pity the cleric without the AA and gear and FT and mana pool.  DPS classes?  Better DPS good or you're going on CR soon.  <br />
<br />
Actually, I confess that I did wipe on an easier sewers expedition.  Monk puller didn't even have a clicky to help deal with dispells; I had to focus him and haste him every few minutes.  What the hell was he doing there?  NOT good on the mana or time.  Ranger snared when he was in the mood.  Grats adds!  Nice guy, I liked him -- I liked both the guys.  Really.  But - GoD separates people out fairly rigorously.  <br />
<br />
In a raid, you can have plenty of people along who suck just a little bit, or who outright, totally suck.  You can't do that in Vxed/Tipt, or even in sewers, unless you have such great gear nobody even notices you suck in the first place, by which definition, the outstanding group members might be barely noticeable too for their contribution because anyone with the most incredible gear in the game can get away with murderously sloppy playing without being called on it.  I've sure seen a number of crummy shamans being praised to the skies because their mana pool, HP, and HP/mana regen and conservation is so outstanding that they can barely play at all and still seem to shine like the brightest star in the shaman firmament.<br />
<br />
I sometimes find myself overwhelmed by requests to do GoD Tipt/Vxed groups, and sometimes find myself wanting to finish my sewers off, kinda ironically, to me anyway.  But if anybody is left out in GoD, I would say it is the two most vital classes -- cleric/tank, not us.  If they aren't great, sure they will get invites...and then their group will spend 8 hours trying to CR and cursing their luck and the expansion and SOE/EQ in general.<br />
<br />
GoD loot is incredible.  And you can get elemental level drops in as little as an hour's time there.  What do you expect but that it's going to be HARD.  You're not supposed to get that kind of drop that easy.  That's not a personal slap in the face; it's just what's to be expected.  And luckily for you as a shaman, your slow is the best there is, and you get it at level 51 fer crissake.  How hard is that?  <br />
<br />
It's the warriors, hybrid tanks with even worse hitpoints and mitigation, and clerics I would feel bad about, not shamans.  Oh, maybe druids -- goodbye, main healer role.  <br />
<br />
Slap a buncha HoT's on people, keep FA up the best you can, and don't expect miracles if you have low AA and super bad gear(I  only have ornate, how good is that??), and you will be a very valuable member of a GoD trials group through the Vxed/Tipt stages.  An unbelievable helluva lot less will be expected of you in terms of gear and focuses and AA than will be expected of tanks/healers, so count yourself lucky indeed.  <br />
<br />
And of course, don't expect there will be NO demands on you.  The loot is GREAT.  GoD is hard.   Accordingly.</div></div><hr />

I  have all 3 ikkz now since my friends helped me. i still think the shaman isnt the best choice, much better is a bard or ench since they offer mez or BETTER buffs(or other things like pulling or runes) for no big loss of slow %. they wont have my healing however there are better healers then me anyways. we arent as bad as poor mages or ranger however we are far from being the first look for those trials.</div></div><hr />

I haven't failed on those yet myself.  But some people are talking about easier things like sewers, and some about harder things.  You know what you know about -- Kod and zones I haven't been to yet, things I haven't done; I can only talk about the things I know about.  I'm at the level where I know many time/elemental people, but the people I hang around with most are still working their way through sewers and Vxed/Tipt.  Some of them are fully time geared and some of them have terrible gear and AA.  <br />
<br />
Generally, we're at a lower level than you are, and I'm talking about what they can expect from GoD.  People's experience is going to differ very widely, of course, depending where they are in the game.<br />
<br />
If you can't make it easily into Kod trials and through them as a shaman, then that's very bad design.  Many of the people I know, including me(Mr. Ornate) are so far behind that curve, though, that it isn't affecting us yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
see i have seen this argument (not nessesary from shamans ) soooooo many times in my 4+ years eq career. and all i can tell you : you will be affected with it sooner then you like it. and you wil lthank us if we get it changed BEFORE you reach it so you dont have to encounter the LFG orgies of some of my guildmates in KT in their hope they might get in a ikkz trial wich not only  CAN do it but also will take them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">Disclaimer: I think that the MOB design in GoD is a lot better for shaman then PoP and LDoN because of the fairly high HP MObs and mainly because of slow mitigation not being as widespread as I feared.

<br />
Well, I was asked to join in a few Tipt/Vxed specifically because I am a shaman.  Don't forget, even if you don't like a shaman much in the trials, what about everything that's past the trials?  Kod, whatever.  Who's going to be giving you focus if you don't get shaman through? Malos? Since mages are often rare -- malosinia?  We could go on from there, but that's decent enough, since I haven't even mentioned the best slow in the game.<br />
So your argument is, we will get pulled through trials by people who need us for Malos and Focus in later trials? I would rather get through and get groups because I contribute. And that &quot;best slow in the game&quot; is getting a little stale. We know we have the best slow in the game. We have been punished for it since Kunark.<br />
<br />

The difference in healing potential between clerics is incredibly vast in GoD.  I noticed just huge variations in cleric mana when they are pushed to the limit like they are in Vxed/Tipt.<br />
I just did Vxed with a secondary cleric - don't know her exact gear but FT5 tops. With the time limits in GoD being as they are you can just take extra healers.<br />
<br />
When you have to keep moving, can't spend much time medding, and need plenty of healing, shamans can do what enchanters can't -- heal, and what a lot of enchanters can't but won't -- slow early and live with the consequences.<br />
Shaman are by far the class that gets hurt the most by constantly moving. What that has to do with enchanters being unable to heal I don't know though. While you are talking of enchanters though, have you seen charm pet DPS?<br />
<br />
If anything, I think GoD didn't make shaman irrelevant, it made other classes irrelevant sometimes if they don't have the gear and AA. This is definitely a high level expansion. Time geared people fail these expeditions. However, I did great as a shaman in full ornate with only belt, mask, and cloak elemental.<br />
Are you trying to tell me that non-shaman need better loot then shaman in order to contribute on GoD trials? That coming from the same person who just said shaman are great because they can slow early and live with the consequences?<br />
<br />
What do I mean by other classes having the problem? I wouldn't do GoD expeditions without a tank with all his defensive AA and a BoW if a warrior, and hopefully at least 9k in hitpoints.

You can do those trials with just about any tank, you will just need to pile on more healers.<br />
<br />
I pity the warrior without the AA, BoW, and gear.  I pity the cleric without the AA and gear and FT and mana pool.  DPS classes?  Better DPS good or you're going on CR soon.<br />
I still do not get why the shaman somehow needs less gear then all the other classses.<br />

I've sure seen a number of crummy shamans being praised to the skies because their mana pool, HP, and HP/mana regen and conservation is so outstanding that they can barely play at all and still seem to shine like the brightest star in the shaman firmament.<br />
So, shaman are fine because GoD makes sure everyone is on top of their game? Seriously, I am completely unable to follow your reasoning.<br />
<br />
I sometimes find myself overwhelmed by requests to do GoD Tipt/Vxed groups, and sometimes find myself wanting to finish my sewers off, kinda ironically, to me anyway.  But if anybody is left out in GoD, I would say it is the two most vital classes -- cleric/tank, not us.  If they aren't great, sure they will get invites...and then their group will spend 8 hours trying to CR and cursing their luck and the expansion and SOE/EQ in general.<br />
Now, I may be getting this wrong . . . but are you trying to tell me that clerics and tanks have trouble getting groups in GoD? That they do not contribute?<br />
<br />
GoD loot is incredible. And you can get elemental level drops in as little as an hour's time there. What do you expect but that it's going to be HARD. That's not a personal slap in the face; it's just what's to be expected. And luckily for you as a shaman, your slow is the best there is, and you get it at level 51 fer crissake.  How hard is that?<br />
What I (and I think most others too) expect is simple - to contribute in some way beyond Turgur's. Slowing is fine, slowing is great, slowing helps a ton, but we want to contribute more, even if we do not have the mana or time to do it all at once.<br />
<br />
It's the warriors, hybrid tanks with even worse hitpoints and mitigation, and clerics I would feel bad about, not shamans. Oh, maybe druids -- goodbye, main healer role.<br />
I might feel sorry about druids if they have nothing to charm. But feel sorry for clerics because of GoD? Clerics are the single most needed class in this expansion. You can make up for any other class (often by adding more clerics) but you cannot make up for a cleric. CH, groups heals, fast heals, divine arbitration, rez, DA, stuns, the best HP buffs and pacify are amazingly powerful and not having a cleric at best means reshaping your entire group to compensate for it. At worst it means you wait for a cleric.<br />
<br />
Slap a buncha HoT's on people, keep FA up the best you can, and don't expect miracles if you have low AA and super bad gear(I  only have ornate, how good is that??), and you will be a very valuable member of a GoD trials group.  An unbelievalbe helluva lot less will be expected of you in terms of gear and focuses and AA than will be expected of tanks/healers, so count yourself lucky indeed.  <br />
Well, if all you cast is Malos, slow, Q, FA and Focus and you still feel you contribute . . . <br />
Please, tell me how you come the conclusion that shaman need lesser gear to do well. So far I was of the opinion that no other class has to collect as many focus items as the shaman to get the same overall power boost.<br />
So far to me the good things about GoD (apart from me just enjoying new content and challenges) are the slight increase in MOB hitpoints and the absence of widespread slow mitigation. Harder MOBs and sorta-ok-but-overpriced AAs are the same for everyone. Constant moving penalizes shaman but that is no different from LDoN. New spells penalize shaman. Charm DPS is incredible. Clerics are much much much more needed then in LDoN and PoP.<br />
Overall I just cannot see how GoD is so great for shaman. It generally favors healers and defensive classes, at least until we get used to this kind of damage output. Well, and charm damage is just sick.</div></div><hr />

But seriously, everyone freaking bot's an Enchanter, and VoQ/enchanter haste last a hell of a lot longer than FA, so just get an enchanter ho to lube ya up before an instanced zone, so in my opinion that makes Shaman &gt; Enchanter, YAY for short spell durations.

You know, there is a reason everyone levels up enchanters and it is not that enchanter buffs last long - it is because enchanter buffs are so powerful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">&quot;I just did Vxed with a secondary cleric - don't know her exact gear but FT5 tops. With the time limits in GoD being as they are you can just take extra healers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, why not take all healers and just one tank, then?  You can do all kinds of things in the game, but if you're taking extra healers, you're giving something up, too -- maybe a class who can offtank adds, who can mez, whatever.  You're not really making an argument here; you can do all kinds of things most anywhere.  What I was talking about was using a cleric as your healer, clearly.  And what I said applies perfectly, so why argue so much?  If you're going through with a cleric as your only real healer, get one with a big mana pool and very high FT if at all possible.  Nothing difficult or incorrect about that statement.<br />
<br />
What do I mean by saying shamans need less good gear?  It's perfectly clearly said.  I did fine in full ornate.  Well enough that I was invited back the next day and continue to get invited.  The proof is in the pudding, as they say.  I can't help it if your theories don't match my reality.  My note that warriors without good gear will suffer more than shamans will is completely true.  Very few people would want a 8k warrior, or one without lots of defensive AA, perhaps one without a BoW.  And they wouldn't want to deal with those warrior shortcomings, most likely, by adding more healers.  Who would?  Most people want group members who are pretty much up to the level of the mobs they are fighting, or even beyond.  The trials are hard enough without having to coddle people who are going to be a big liability.  Yet wearing full ornate, I wasn't a liability to people in time gear.  We succeeded twice in a row, and the next day I was back with more time enabled people for another successful run.  In the Vxed/Tipt/Sewers that I've done -- and I'm saying outright that's ALL I have done so far, I would rather be with a shaman in full ornate than a warrior in full ornate, or without a BoW, by a hundred miles.  The people I was with had dramatically better gear than I did, and they needed every bit of it.  Being with different clerics showed me how much a cleric's mana pool matters.  So yes, shamans do need less good gear to do well than warriors and clerics for the level of GoD I'm talking about.  That may not match your theories, but sometimes reality is more important than ideas about reality.  I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
The rest of much of your post is equally pointlessly argumentative without clarifying much, if anything.  What do I mean by enchanters can't heal?  I think this is easy enough to figure out.  I don't want to argue just to argue, so I'm going to not spend further effort responding to your post.</div></div><hr />

I find this a kindy funny statement.<br />
Did these nice guys in time gear not have a shaman guilded that they had to take you with them?<br />
Or are you now talking about ebayed characters?<br />
<br />
And to make an end at the gear theory, in Vxed/Tipt there is 0 reason to ever get agro and the time limit is so large that you can finish one with a cleric with FT0, so indeed gear is not that important, now zone into Kod and tell me how you do there.</div></div><hr />

Of course there could be about fifty other explanations for you getting reinvited too, such as there not being another slower handy.<br />
<br />
I can't help it if your theories don't match my reality.  My note that warriors without good gear will suffer more than shamans will is completely true.

Have you ever thought that just maybe you can make do with a lesser tank if the other members of the group, say maybe the shaman are better equipped? Just because you think you do fine with your gear compared to a specific set of people in time gear does not mean shaman need less gear. Also &quot;ornate + elemental&quot; vs &quot;time-geared&quot; is a little vague. There is a world of difference between people who are fully time geared and those who have a couple phase 1/2 loots.<br />
By the way, what is your idea for dealing with &quot;shortcomings&quot; such as not having a Blade of War or not having FT15? Do you honestly not <br />
group with such players?<br />
<br />
Most people want group members who are pretty much up to the level of the mobs they are fighting, or even beyond.  The trials are hard enough without having to coddle people who are going to be a big liability.  Yet wearing full ornate, I wasn't a liability to people in time gear.<br />
And the basis for that conclusion is? That you won? What exactly did you do that made you keep up with people with better gear?<br />
<br />
We succeeded twice in a row, and the next day I was back with more time enabled people for another successful run.  In the Vxed/Tipt/Sewers that I've done -- and I'm saying outright that's ALL I have done so far, I would rather be with a shaman in full ornate than a warrior in full ornate, or without a BoW, by a hundred miles.

So yes, shamans do need less good gear to do well than warriors and clerics for the level of GoD I'm talking about.  That may not match your theories, but sometimes reality is more important than ideas about reality.  I'm sorry.<br />
*Shrugs* Oh well, your reality need not match mine - but I am pretty grateful for the extra AC and HPs on my time gear, not to mention my focus effects and slow stick. With the exception of the tank I still fail to see how more gear would not help you as much as the cleric or druid or enchanter. Spell haste, mana preservation and click effects are pretty huge for a shaman.<br />
<br />
Have you ever actually compared yourself to a shaman with different gear? Have you seen a shaman with say 1500 less HPs and a couple less focuses in these trials? Have you seen one with 1500 HPs more and a slow stick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">When did I say that I believed that if another slower with better gear was handy, I would have been picked instead?  What's with all the imaginations working overtime here?   Building up straw horses to knock them down is child's play.  <br />
<br />
By the way, I do seem to get invited back by people.  And by different people.  If that's supposed to prove that I'm a bad shaman or that I a not doing a good job, that's a pretty self-contradictory idea.  You don't usually get invited by being known as a screw-up, and you definitely don't get re-invited for it.<br />
<br />
Nor, Stygiana, did I say I was talking about Kod.  Actually, I repeatedly expressly said I was NOT.  If you can't read, blame yourself.<br />
<br />
If you're going to insist on being pointedly oblivious, don't point that finger at anyone but yourself.   Much of the rest is similar blather.  Funny how some people in great gear resent the success of someone in lesser gear.  <br />
<br />
Again I say, I would rather have along a shaman with my level of gear than have a warrior as the MT with my level of gear.  Mask, cape, belt, are elemental on me.  Every other slot filled with ornate.  I'm not terribly impressed with that gear, and think it's not a really great level at all for even the trials I've done.  But for the trials I've done, I'd be much less impressed with a warrior trying to tank it in that level of gear.  I wouldn't feel very confident that we would succeed.<br />
<br />
But we did succeed, multiple times, with my sub-par gear as part of the equation, due to a more hefty tank and the other group members having better equipment than I did.  And due to us all working well together.  It's not conjecture.  You can theorize all you want, but the fact is, we succeeded.  WITH my having lesser gear.  So it's not conjecture.<br />
<br />
By the way, tanks I do know with similar gear levels to mine -- a few pieces that are above ornate level, some with more than a few -- are getting torn up right and left in the sewers/vxed/tipt regardless of the quality of the rest of their groups.  This at last is where we can come to something arguable.  Are the tanks I hear talking representative of every tank or tanks in general with that kind of gear? etc.  In terms of game knowledge, intelligence, whatever? Well, I don't know.  I just see the chat of a lot of tanks getting their butts kicked over and over again.  Their difficulties seem to be pretty interchangeable and by this time predictable.  As their failure at roughly my level of gear seems more and more predictable the more I hear it, similarly, my guess is that there really is nothing more special I am doing to succeed as a shaman in my level of gear than the tanks are doing to fail.  I'm sure other shamans with my level of gear could replace me easily, and get the job done just as well.  It sounds like the tanks(which include hybrid tanks as well as warriors) at my level are pretty much just repeatedly failing.<br />
<br />
Warriors are famously gear dependent and they'll be the first ones to tell you so.  Not that AA don't count, but AA are not enough.  If you don't have a BoW, black and white, you suffer as a warrior.  If you don't have hitpoints because your gear hasn't taken you there yet, well, sorry, it's going to matter.  A lot.<br />
<br />
It matters quite a bit less to me.  I don't have anything as class-revolutionizing as a BoW in my hands.  I've got a POTC ear, very average jewelry all around, full ornate.  If my gear makes me an unimpressively equipped shaman, it would make me a comparatively much worse warrior.  Especially for the parts of GoD I've seen. <br />
<br />
Taking a shaman of my gear level along would be and has been so far much less detrimental to a group doing my level of GoD than trying to survive with a low hitpoint tank and/or one who couldn't grab fast aggro.  The criteria for surviving these things cuts shamans an awful lot more slack than it does warriors.<br />
<br />
If you think a warrior in ornate is anywhere near as far along as a shaman in ornate against vxed/tipt mobs, I couldn't agree less.  Thank goodness I don't need a BoW to get group invites, too!<br />
<br />
&quot;With the exception of the tank I still fail to see how more gear would not help you as much as the cleric or druid or enchanter. Spell haste, mana preservation and click effects are pretty huge for a shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
The tank is what I've been talking about, not the other guys.  I've noticed a sizeable difference even between time-enabled clerics, also, so I would have to put the cleric there too, since he is also such a vital member every single pull, and his success at doing his job is absolutely central.  <br />
<br />
I've never once said here that good equipment wouldn't help me.  I've got some nice focuses that definitely do help me, some of the better shaman focuses for my level of play, I feel.  20% extended buff duration on my belt, my POA cloak has nice detrimental haste on it, my face mask from the spider in POF has extended range and FT2; it's a  nice start for sure, and I obviously still have a very long way to go.  I'm sure the extra mana and hitpoints, etc, would give me a nice boost in the amount of spells I could cast, hits I could take, etc.<br />
<br />
But I've managed to get by with measly ornate in the trials I've done.  I don't think a tank would have fared as well.  And while improvements to me would help a lot, they wouldn't be anywhere near as important to the group, I feel, as would having their main tank suddenly get the same kind of boost in gear.  They would be nice...just not critical. <br />
<br />
Some smart aleck made a remark about my being carried, yes?  Crude and ignorant, but while one can be snide and snipe at a shaman and insist he's just being &quot;carried&quot; ... could you &quot;carry&quot; your MT through the same trials?  I don't think so.  Maybe as some kind of weird stunt, someone might like to try, but I doubt it.  The gear requirements for a main tank getting through the trials are more stringent than for a shaman.</div></div><hr />

/whine on<br />
       I too would like to see a few more spells out there so we can do a bit more damage.  I mean give me a break...925 damage nuke on a 40khp mob?  That is laughable to say the least (we wont even mention the cast time).  Then the whole buff issue.  When a person reaches level 65 and is able to play in the zones/areas we are talking about they should have most stats maxed so our buffs dont bring much to the table except as extra HPs.  The few stats they do not have maxed is ususually only by a few points anyway so it will not make a huge difference in game play. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Blarg - in your original post you stated both that the constant moving of the trials favors shaman and that shaman need less gear to do well then other classes. Note how I explicitely excluded the tank as one of the classes to compare to - whoever is tanking profits more from gear then anybody else of course.<br />
What I have trouble believing is that a shaman needs less gear then another caster, especially a cleric, to do well. In my opinion we need more gear then the other casters simply because we often take aggro and because we need a lot more focus items to stay on par with more focused classes who need a third of the focuses we do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">No, I never said that moving favors shamans.  I like canni'ing as much as the next guy, probably more.  Lots of shamans do their best to avoid canni'ing and come up with all kinds of justifications -- I'm not one of them.  If my health is full, I feel guilty, like I'm doing something wrong.  And if that happens, there's a good chance I am.  If I'm not canni'ing, I'm probably AFK.<br />
<br />
As to gear, I would say that a shaman can get buy with a fairly small mana pool compared to a cleric because he can regen mana more quickly.  I noticed a quite dramatic difference between a few clerics in Vxed/Tipt, all time time enabled.  I don't think my improving on my kinda paltry FT7, say, or getting a bit more mana in other ways, is like to have as much effect as more mana for the cleric, which lets him cast one of the most powerful spells in the game, CH, more, or his great heals.  I don't rate the DPS I can do or much of anything else I can do after I slow a mob as high as what clerics do.   A high mana pool/high FT cleric seems to me to be a dramatic difference, and one that can cut down the possibility of wipes fairly dramatically when you compare him to a cleric of lower gear level.  <br />
<br />
My measly ornate seems to hint, to me, at the relative unimportance of my gear compared to a cleric's.  Really, I was underpowered to be where I was.  Luckily, I don't think it mattered all that much, as the times when I was out of mana were almost non-existent.  The only thing I tended to run out of was time, which nothing in the universe can give me more of.  Even Time's Antithesis casts in 3.0 seconds, right?  As I recall, with my Tethered Air Cape, I think I cast slow in the same amount of time.  Or anyway, you now what I'm getting at.<br />
<br />
If the differences between time-level clerics can be dramatic, and I'm sitting there with ornate?  And still getting by, our groups not failing, cleric and everyone happy with my performance?  (People who are used to shamans with hugely better gear than I have, fighting with them daily.)  That suggests to me that I'm kind of lucky, and my class is perhaps a bit out of sync with what GoD requires to this level, in a positive way.  If everyone's in time gear but me and we don't fail and I don't screw up noticeably, nobody is mad and everyone is happy, we win every time -- I have to conclude that my crappy gear is just not too crucial.  The shaman set of spells and skills is enough, at that level.<br />
<br />
On aggro, I think that depends a lot on when you slow, and whether, if you're with a warrior(which I always was), your warrior has a BoW or something of remotely similar aggro capability, basically.  I can't honestly recall dying from slowing in the Vxed/Tipt trials while with a BoW'd warrior.  I don't think I did; died from lingering around and having a named pop right on top of me once, things like that.<br />
<br />
So basically the aggro on me wasn't really about my gear and how I could handle it -- it was about the warrior's gear and how he could handle it.  The warrior with the BoW did a great job; it wasn't a particularly big issue my getting aggro, overall.  I was sometimes kinda panicky when it happened, but overall it seemed like no big deal.  The warrior and cleric came through for me so often I can't even recall dying while slowing -- it probably happened, but it wasn't a big thing to note.  The ole ornate held up fine!  <br />
<br />
All in all, I had extremely significantly worse gear than the warrior/cleric and everyone else there, and still seemed to do fine.  <br />
<br />
I won't say it wasn't really rough on my mana, though.  I sometimes stayed at 40% or 20% for extended periods, and after a named I went completely dry even after canni 5 once or twice(we repeated a few nameds).  I wish I had better gear, but it didn't really seem like my mana was usually a problem in the first place too much, and my HP did ok since the warrior had a BoW and the clerics went from good to excellent.  <br />
<br />
If the cleric were in a bunch of ornate and the warrior was too -- I think we could easily have been in deep ****.  If I improved myself up to their level, it would have been a nice luxury -- but clearly it wasn't a necessity, since we won handily anyway.  The deaths we had never seemed particularly traceable to anything I did, that I or anybody else noticed.  I'm sure they would have noticed if I could do more super shamany things.  But they REALLY would have noticed if the cleric  or the warrior sucked in any way.  That would have been doom.<br />
<br />
So, well, I count myself and our class lucky for the beginning points of GoD.  I feel bad for my knight friends, and for the warriors without good gear and especially without a BoW.  I think I'm in a much better position than they are....so far. I'm pretty sure I'm going to find things easier than they will for quite a while.</div></div><hr />

Shaman wasnt need there, period.  That's why your gear wasnt crucial.   They needed a slower, and you was available.  Had nothing to do with *super shamanisitc powers*.  Our PUSH group (for getting those thru trials quickly), did NOT include a shaman.  It had a beastlord and a bard (cleric and tank.. add two classes for flag), and they NEVER failed. <br />
<br />
Go back thru your logs, and check the slowability of the mobs in Vexd and Tipt.  They all mitigated, correct?  Which further lowers the difference between our super duper craptastic slow.  All mobs there are mostly, partial or slightly.  Majority in the partial and slightly department.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for my knight friends,  <br />
<br />
At least 4 (that i personally know of), was with a Paladin tanking these trials including the final named, in Tipt.  It can be done.  I dont feel sorry for them at all, unless they aren't properly geared, or incapable of playing thier class<br />
<br />
Now fast foward to first trial in Kodtaz.  Minimum of TWO healers required, at least for the final boss, and shaman isnt one of them.  <br />
<br />
Again, Im glad you think everything is peachy and right as rain, but for those not being pushed (or wanting to be pushed, and want to feel like an actual meaningful PRIEST class), all is not well in Shaman-ville.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">As to gear, I would say that a shaman can get buy with a fairly small mana pool compared to a cleric because he can regen mana more quickly.  I noticed a quite dramatic difference between a few clerics in Vxed/Tipt, all time time enabled.  I don't think my improving on my kinda paltry FT7, say, or getting a bit more mana in other ways, is like to have as much effect as more mana for the cleric, which lets him cast one of the most powerful spells in the game, CH, more, or his great heals.  I don't rate the DPS I can do or much of anything else I can do after I slow a mob as high as what clerics do.   A high mana pool/high FT cleric seems to me to be a dramatic difference, and one that can cut down the possibility of wipes fairly dramatically when you compare him to a cleric of lower gear level.  <br />
But that does not mean a shaman needs less gear. It means gear does less for us, so we need more of it.<br />
<br />
My measly ornate seems to hint, to me, at the relative unimportance of my gear compared to a cleric's.  Really, I was underpowered to be where I was.  Luckily, I don't think it mattered all that much, as the times when I was out of mana were almost non-existent.  The only thing I tended to run out of was time, which nothing in the universe can give me more of.  Even Time's Antithesis casts in 3.0 seconds, right?  As I recall, with my Tethered Air Cape, I think I cast slow in the same amount of time.  Or anyway, you now what I'm getting at.<br />
TA allows you to cast slows while spell gems refresh. TA essentially gives you time but not costing you mana you need to cannibalize back. As to what I think you are getting at - You are aware that spell haste does indeed give you more time? You are aware that mana regeneration and mana preservation frees you from cannaing, which indirectly gives you more time? And focuses which improve spell effectiveness (improved healing, improved damage, etc.) mean you need to cast less spells, spending less time to cast spells, spending less mana making you canna less, giving you even more time.<br />
Just about every focus effect does indeed wind up giving the shaman more time, directly or indirectly.<br />
<br />
If the differences between time-level clerics can be dramatic, and I'm sitting there with ornate?  And still getting by, our groups not failing, cleric and everyone happy with my performance?  (People who are used to shamans with hugely better gear than I have, fighting with them daily.)  That suggests to me that I'm kind of lucky, and my class is perhaps a bit out of sync with what GoD requires to this level, in a positive way.  If everyone's in time gear but me and we don't fail and I don't screw up noticeably, nobody is mad and everyone is happy, we win every time -- I have to conclude that my crappy gear is just not too crucial.  The shaman set of spells and skills is enough, at that level.<br />
Your logic is - people do not complain - people take me again - hence shaman are fine. This might possibly be true. There are of course a couple hundred other explanations. Possibly you are just a great player who makes up for less gear. Possibly those people take your gear into account when they set their expectations of what you can do. Possibly they are still in the Kunark/Luclin mindset of 'shaman are gods, shaman slow &gt; all'. Possibly they never had an enchanter with a charmed pet doubling group DPS while slowing, mezzing and pulling. Possibly they never really looked at what the different classes are capable of and think just slow is enough as a contribution.<br />
This is just off the top of my head but I think you get my point. Your explanation is just one of a lot of possible explanations. There are ways of objectively comparing how well shaman really do - parsing and looking at and analyzing class abilities. As I do not have access to or time for the hundreds of hours of parses required to proove anything, nor a capability to make up for differences in how well people play their class I analyze instead.<br />
So far none of my numbers support even in part any of your points. If you expect others to take your opinion seriously you would do well to cement it with something different then 'well, noone complained'.<br />
<br />
On aggro, I think that depends a lot on when you slow, and whether, if you're with a warrior(which I always was), your warrior has a BoW or something of remotely similar aggro capability, basically.<br />
Well, duh. Of course it does.<br />
<br />
All in all, I had extremely significantly worse gear than the warrior/cleric and everyone else there, and still seemed to do fine.  <br />
Perceptions are just that, perceptions. People see what they want to see.<br />
<br />
I won't say it wasn't really rough on my mana, though.  I sometimes stayed at 40% or 20% for extended periods, and after a named I went completely dry even after canni 5 once or twice(we repeated a few nameds).  I wish I had better gear, but it didn't really seem like my mana was usually a problem in the first place too much, and my HP did ok since the warrior had a BoW and the clerics went from good to excellent.  <br />
Yet you maintain shaman need less gear and you contributed just as much as the other classes?<br />
<br />
If the cleric were in a bunch of ornate and the warrior was too -- I think we could easily have been in deep ****.  If I improved myself up to their level, it would have been a nice luxury -- but clearly it wasn't a necessity, since we won handily anyway.  The deaths we had never seemed particularly traceable to anything I did, that I or anybody else noticed.  I'm sure they would have noticed if I could do more super shamany things.  But they REALLY would have noticed if the cleric  or the warrior sucked in any way.  That would have been doom.<br />
Let me state it again - I am not denying the tanks gear is not supremely important. A cleric on the other hand can make do with just the same gear as you. Of course clerics (and just about every other caster) profit much more from a lot of gear, especially flowing thought. That is not a an advantage for the shaman.<br />
<br />
So, well, I count myself and our class lucky for the beginning points of GoD.  I feel bad for my knight friends, and for the warriors without good gear and especially without a BoW.  I think I'm in a much better position than they are....so far. I'm pretty sure I'm going to find things easier than they will for quite a while.<br />
*points up to what he said about tanks* yep, tanks do indeed need gear more then all other classes. With the game design as it stands this will never change. Now, what about clerics, enchanters, druids, necromancers and so on?<br />
My point stands.<br />
<br />
Shaman do not need less gear then other casters.<br />
Shaman do not contribute adequately in short fights of any kind.<br />
Shaman do not contribute adequately on MOBs that mitigate slow.<br />
<br />
Shaman so far do not do too bad in GoD simply because with the massive amount of healing required fights are getting longer again. I would rather not depend on this trend to continue to consider myself halfway balanced.</div></div><hr />

There is nothing in this sentence which makes even the slightest bit of sense, and you offer no further support for it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after peremptorily deciding to skip both logic and actually experienced fact and then insist that the argument be pursued, logic and experience or not, purely in terms of numbers, you protest that I have no numbers and that I can't or certainly shouldn't therefore speak at all -- and then freely admit you have no numbers yourself and imply, quite correctly that these &quot;numbers&quot; you speak of are virtually impossible to calculate, thus more or less functionally irrelevant to the argument.  Yet after you've invalidated the premises of your own argument and even the terms under which you wish to conduct that argument, I see you speaking as much as I am without the aid of the very numbers you first admit are useless and then demand I produce!  <br />
<br />
In contrast to your theorizing, I am relating my experience directly, which is not an arguable thing.  On the other hand, you are talking about your theories -- which you suggest could number into the &quot;hundreds.&quot;  I think it's time for a reality check on which one of us is getting a little ahead of themselves in supposing just a bit too much, and building too many castles made of sand.  <br />
<br />
On a side note, I do find it entertaining when you come up with a list of reasons for why I might get by, most of which basically come down to that the people I was with were morons or ignorant or both.  Ok, as you like it ... all I'll say again is that we won every time.  (psst! despite my crummy gear! sorry!)  Is it fair to assume that time equipped people who win every time are all ... I don't know, incapable of figuring out what you may have figured out somewhere, whatever it is, but still succeed despite their ignorance or stupidity?  Or maybe indeed there is a simpler explanation.  Maybe they just played reasonable well and I did too.<br />
<br />
If you disagree, you really need failures instead of successes on our part to make your point.  I mean -- at least one.<br />
<br />
Oh, succeeded in another trial yesterday.  This time not with people who had any time gear at all.  Sorry!<br />
<br />
Psst! I was wearing full ornate!<br />
<br />
I won't bother responding too much about clerics getting along just as well as me with the same mana pool, as it's obviously false.   I at least can regenerate my mana pool, even without much flowing thought, fairly quickly.  For a cleric, both flowing thought and mana pools are the name of the game, and there's a fairly hard cruel limit to both of them.  For me -- neither matter as much at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">I am happy for you that you felt needed and useful.<br />

You were adequate you the job. Yay.<br />
<br />
I have a question for you however. With the current status of the elite leading the way. is adequate going to be good enough for the rest of us?<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else. But when I played my shaman in the years past I had a feeling of accomplishment. Of fun. Of being the rock that broke the backs of the enemy. I stood in the middle of combat with disease and poisen flowing. Healing the wounds of my comrades, and knowing for all intents and purposes the tide was stopped because of the contributions I made. I made the entire group function better because that is the strength of the shaman as a whole.<br />
<br />
That feeling is not there much anymore. Maybe with time gear some of that would be recaptured. But I will never be in time. An when I am actively playing a game to not be noticed by the enemy.. well that is crap. Utter crap. When the margin of error is this fine, you don't take what barely lets you scrape by. You take the best you can get. And when people are settling for shaman because of loyalty and or lack of the better alternative something is majorly wrong. <br />
<br />
If you were going in for heart surgery would you say sure lets get the 3rd best guy. The other guy is busy. and besides he only has a 2% greater chance of failure... (Yeah yeah I know heart surgery vrs EQ. Silly concept, I am trying to prove a point dammit! (Grins))<br />
<br />
Perception is key. And we have perception on our side. But that is changing. Because the reality is shaman have been delt with casually by the developers, given rote upgrades while handing out the things that make us shine to other classes. Or worse. Simply being ignored. <br />
<br />
Monk Pacification resists were fixed in what 6-8 hours. Yet we have a post from a dev (Yeah the one of two) saying mutt call 4-5 was broke but he will get to it sooner or later. Next patch and such.<br />
<br />
Perception is key. Over the years all the shaman problems have been &quot;hush kid you bother me&quot;, or &quot;Not while the big boys are talking&quot; and I really don't understand why we continue to think that is okay. <br />
<br />
My thoughts. Sorry if you don't agree. And I am glad you had fun in that group. Hope it happens again and again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Every old school(and even not so old school) Shaman has had that sense of accomplishment you are talking about in the past, Snoww. I'll be honest and say that this feeling is gone. <br />
Ever since the implementation of Slow mitigation my contributions no longer offset the downsides. Since PoP I have become a liability. Did you forget the days of when Shamans were self sufficient? These days are no more and more often than not I am the weakest link in a group.<br />
<br />
How many of us were used to getting healed by the cleric before PoP? I know I never needed that. Nowadays, my defense is so weak that I have a hard time thinking of any class less durable. Couple this with the fact that years of playing have educated us to slow all mobs and do so *early* and not even a caster is as much a haling burden to the cleric as me.<br />
<br />
With the event of Slow mitigation we have become a liability(that's a keyword!). I personally had my hopes up for Spirit Shield, but it didn't happen. Nor do I think people realize the discrepancy between classes when it comes to defensive capabilities. Classes like the Mage or Shaman give up any sort of defense for what once used to be desirable abilities.<br />
<br />
Edit: typo(one I noticed anyway)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">&quot;But that does not mean a shaman needs less gear. It means gear does less for us, so we need more of it.&quot;<br />
<br />
There is nothing in this sentence which makes even the slightest bit of sense, and you offer no further support for it.<br />
Let me offer support then. You stated you do not rely on Flowing thought gear as much as other casters. This is true. However, the reverse is also true, that being that shaman do not profit as much from flowing thought as other classes. Shaman also profit less then other casters from the various mana regeneration buffs.<br />
Now, as everyone gains flowing thought (not to mention horses) and as mana regeneration buffs are constanly upgraded shaman need a larger amount of gear upgrades to keep up.<br />
Shaman also require a far larger amount of focus items then other casters. A wizard can get an improved damage item and have his effectiveness increase by 10% (or whatever the percentage on the item is). A shaman will need to get an improved damage item, an improved heal item, a beneficial spell extension item and a burning affliction item to get a similar increase in effectiveness. That is what I mean when I say 'shaman need more gear then other classes'.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after peremptorily deciding to skip both logic and actually experienced fact<br />
Experience does not equal fact. Drawing conclusions from anecdotal evidence does not equal fact.<br />
<br />
and then insist that the argument be pursued, logic and experience or not, purely in terms of numbers, you protest that I have no numbers and that I can't or certainly shouldn't therefore speak at all <br />
No - I say that you should be careful when leaping to conclusions, especially as you have no data at all.<br />
<br />
and then freely admit you have no numbers yourself<br />
No - I have no parses. I do have numbers. I have posted a couple of things on LDoN grouping and on the development of mana regeneration and spell effectiveness which you should easily be able to find. They should at least be partially applicable to GoD trials. Moreover I do not actually present data here - I am just debating the truth of your data, or lack thereof.<br />
<br />
and imply, quite correctly that these &quot;numbers&quot; you speak of are virtually impossible to calculate, thus more or less functionally irrelevant to the argument.  <br />
Just because numbers are hard to get does not invalidate them. Also note that I never said that parsing was the only source of data. We can find out a lot of things just looking at data we can easily gather, namely spell effects.<br />
<br />
Yet after you've invalidated the premises of your own argument and even the terms under which you wish to conduct that argument, I see you speaking as much as I am without the aid of the very numbers you first admit are useless and then demand I produce!  <br />
Lets do this the simple way:<br />
- Do you agree that personal experience can be misleading?<br />
- Do you agree that randomness can easily affect a small set of samples?<br />
- Do you agree that concluding from a small sample set can thus easily be misleading?<br />
- Do you agree that hard numbers would be a lot better to base arguments and conclusions on?<br />
- Do you agree that the only routes to such data are parsing and analysis?<br />
- Do you agree that parsing is hard to come by, compared to analysis?<br />
Now, if you agree to all the above - do you have a better idea on how to judge class effectiveness then analysis?<br />
<br />
In contrast to your theorizing, I am relating my experience directly, which is not an arguable thing.<br />
It certainly is.<br />
- People lie to themselves. People see what they want to see. We all do it. Its just human nature.<br />
- You cannot accurately describe the nature of a random event by observation without a huge sample set. A couple trials are not a huge sample set. A couple hundred trials might come close to giving somewhat accurate data, if you make sure to record it in an unbiased way (in EQ this means parsing).<br />
<br />
How can you even argue personal experience is not debatable when there are other people whos personal experiences are completely different from yours?<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you are talking about your theories -- which you suggest could number into the &quot;hundreds.&quot;<br />
No - I am saying there is easily a hundred explanations as to why you think you did adequately on your trial and your explanation is one of them.<br />
<br />
I think it's time for a reality check on which one of us is getting a little ahead of themselves in supposing just a bit too much, and building too many castles made of sand.  <br />
I have yet to see you toss out as much as a single statement that is based on anything but personal experience. So I do agree, you are indeed supposing a bit much.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I do find it entertaining when you come up with a list of reasons for why I might get by, most of which basically come down to that the people I was with were morons or ignorant or both.  Ok, as you like it ... all I'll say again is that we won every time.  (psst! despite my crummy gear! sorry!)<br />
I can go to crushbone with crummy gear, solo crush and come back here to say shaman are fine because I won. Clearly I did win - however the conclusion is wrong. I did not win because shaman are fine or because shaman need less gear - I won because Crushbone is trivial for me.<br />
You could have won because the trials were trivial for your group.<br />
You could just have been lucky.<br />
You could just have an amazing amount of skill to make up for your gear.<br />
You could be right and shaman do indeed need less gear then other casters.<br />
But we will and cannot find out based on personal experience and anecdotal evidence.<br />
<br />
Is it fair to assume that time equipped people who win every time are all ... I don't know, incapable of figuring out what you may have figured out somewhere, whatever it is, but still succeed despite their ignorance or stupidity?<br />
Could you rephrase this sentence? I seriously cannot find out what you are trying to say.<br />
<br />
If you disagree, you really need failures instead of successes on our part to make your point.  I mean -- at least one.<br />
I find it a little hard to provide the kind of anecdotal experience you like, as my argument is that shaman need a larger amount of gear, especially flowing thought gear, to make up for the same amount of gear on another caster. I would need to have access to a number of equally AAd but differently equipped shaman and other casters and then run a lot of tests and parse them. Or I could just pull out a single event and say I am right like you do.<br />
Instead I prefer to analyze, as that is the only way left for me to insure I actually get meaningful data.<br />
<br />
Oh, succeeded in another trial yesterday.  This time not with people who had any time gear at all.  Sorry!<br />
And this is supposed to prove your point about other classes needing better gear then shaman how?<br />
<br />
Psst! I was wearing full ornate!<br />
And so apparently were they. Your point?<br />
<br />
I won't bother responding too much about clerics getting along just as well as me with the same mana pool, as it's obviously false.<br />
Even factoring in slow you cannot heal as much damage as a cleric. This will get worse the more gear both you and the cleric get. Just how big of a contribution do you expect to make to a group?<br />
<br />
I at least can regenerate my mana pool, even without much flowing thought, fairly quickly.  For a cleric, both flowing thought and mana pools are the name of the game, and there's a fairly hard cruel limit to both of them.  For me -- neither matter as much at all.<br />
Yes, flowing thought helps shaman less. That means that cleric get more of an upgrade from flowing thought. If clerics are remotely balanced before flowing thought they will certainly not be lagging behind once you figure flowing thought in.<br />
<br />
I hope that made my arguments a little clearer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly MY problem with playing my Shaman... It's simply not fun anymore. I used to be integral to a group or a raid.<br />
<br />
Now in a group, mobs fall over dead three seconds after Turgur's lands. My heal doesn't touch the tank's HP, even using Kragg's (I know, &quot;**** n00b&quot;, I don't deserve to post among the l33tz). I don't do DPS worth a damn because of how long it takes.<br />
<br />
In a raid, I'm replacable -- Just a slow-bot that tosses buffs on demand<br />
<br />
Let's just say i'm not going to be in a high-end guild any time soon. The bar keeps getting raised while i'm lagging way behind, all my gear is bazaar stuff. So I don't forsee myself joining the supershaman crowd so I can sit back on my free ride and say &quot;It's all good&quot;<br />
<br />
My class is a tool. An optional one, at that. With a cleric and a chanter (most groups have 'em), all you need is to catch a MGB Fo7 in PoK or something and go on your merry way. Hell, even that's purely optional, because, hell, if you're fighting in the high end of GoD, why the hell do you need focus, 300 odd extra HP isn't worth the hassle of dragging a shaman around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not always.  Rarely, actually.  In the trials, more often than not, usually some to most have been.  Then again, aren't these trials designed to need higher-end players?  Of course.  The fact that I wasn't one speaks well of a shaman's flexibility regarding gear compared to the inflexibility of some other classes, who are relatively screwed without gear not just equal to mine but much, much better.  The remarkable fact is that I didn't need to be a higher-end player...and others did.<br />
<br />
It's pretty ridiculous to use that fact as an excuse to bash me.  <br />
<br />
I never said everything about shamans is hunky dory.  Nor that they need no improvement.  Nor that they could do everything, should never ask for anything or get anything, none of that.  That's a misreading that there's no reason to put on my shoulders, and it's gotten pretty ripely disengenuous and long past fair by now, to say the least.  Yell at Sony for not making the game more the way you like it, not at me for relating some simple facts you don't want to hear about something that happened to me.  If anyone doesn't like that I generally lived and that our groups repeatedly succeeded, or thinks it somehow magically couldn't possibly have any meaning at all unless it's to advance your own ideas about things, well, you are free to continue implying or stating outright that I must be dumb, purely lucky, or that you have a theory that must take precedence over my own lived experience and somehow trivialize or invalidate it, as it doesn't fit your prejudices or agendas.  I don't actually see as many reasons to apologize for repeated successes as some think I should, apparently, nor to feel that success should be punished, derided, or declared irrelevant or the province of fools and the ignorant.<br />
<br />
You don't have to agree with things that actually happen; they just happen anyway.  My getting by in less than optimum gear in these examples is complete proof that you can indeed in similar instances get by just fine.  After all -- umm, I just did.  Repeatedly.<br />
<br />
Not theoretically.  For real.<br />
<br />
I'm not too stupid to realize I didn't have optimal gear.  For crying out loud, that's my point!<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I'm not terribly optimistic about shamans in general either.  I'm hardly here to proselytize for the perfection of the game, my class, or my personal capabilities.  I feel I have much more of a raid role than a group role these days and honestly believe many groups would be better off with a beastlord or an enchanter than a shaman -- GoD or not.<br />
<br />
But just because some things could be better, especially in certain parts of the game, doesn't mean everything everywhere is crazily out of whack or anything, either.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">I never said everything about shamans is hunky dory.  Nor that they need no improvement.  Nor that they could do everything, should never ask for anything or get anything, none of that.  That's a misreading that there's no reason to put on my shoulders, and it's gotten pretty ripely disengenuous and long past fair by now, to say the least.<br />
And I cannot remember anyone claiming you did - what I see is you hopping from one statement to another whenever you cannot defend your previous one. Do you still claim that shaman need less gear then other casters? Do you still claim shaman are better then enchanters in these trials? Do you still claim clerics without a big manapool and high flowing thought do not contribute adequately? Do you still claim a fast paced enviroment with constant movement favors shaman? Do you still claim there are no items in the game that can make you cast more spells per minute? Do you still claim that noone can get away with sloppy play? Do you still claim a shaman with great gear could play as sloppy as wants and still do fine?<br />
Oh, and have you made your mind up yet whether/when/how you died in these trials and if better gear might have helped you?<br />
<br />
You claimed all of these things, many of them in the same paragraph, and when called on them your response always seemed to be 'I never said that', quickly followed up by a different statement.<br />
<br />
Yell at Sony for not making the game more the way you like it, not at me for relating some simple facts you don't want to hear about something that happened to me.<br />
You did not offer a single fact yet, other then you succeeding in a couple expeditions. What you offered was a lot of opinion, some of it explicitely contradicting itself. Oh, and you dismissed every other opinion as it could not possibly be true, because you succeeded after all.<br />
<br />
If anyone doesn't like that I generally lived and that our groups repeatedly succeeded, or thinks it somehow magically couldn't possibly have any meaning at all unless it's to advance your own ideas about things, well, you are free to continue implying or stating outright that I must be dumb, purely lucky, or that you have a theory that must take precedence over my own lived experience and somehow trivialize or invalidate it, as it doesn't fit your prejudices or agendas.<br />
This is not about liking or disliking what you did. This is about you making up statements from thin air that falsely give the impression shaman are fine in the very situation they are worst in.<br />
<br />
I don't actually see as many reasons to apologize for repeated successes as some think I should, apparently, nor to feel that success should be punished, derided, or declared irrelevant or the province of fools and the ignorant.<br />
And this marvel of a sentence is meant for whom?<br />
<br />
You don't have to agree with things that actually happen; they just happen anyway.  My getting by in less than optimum gear in these examples is complete proof that you can indeed in similar instances get by just fine.  After all -- umm, I just did.  Repeatedly.<br />
Would you mind defining 'just fine' for us? A lot of people differ on what that means. While you are at it, would you mind telling us what exactly you did in these trials other then slow? I see various references to healing(your main argument as to what an enchanter cannot do) and buffing, followed up by you stating that you basically Q'd someone and FA'd a couple people.<br />
<br />
Not theoretically.  For real.<br />
A lot of things are for real. Enchanters outdamage me. For real. Beastlords outbuff me. For real. Druids outheal and outdamage me. For real. If there are MOBs to split or gating MOBs to stop a cleric outmitigates me. For real.<br />
<br />
I'm not too stupid to realize I didn't have optimal gear.  For crying out loud, that's my point!<br />
No - your 'point' was that you, as a shaman, did not need as much gear as other classes to contribute your share. Which, with the sole exception of the tank, is wrong.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, I'm not terribly optimistic about shamans in general either.  I'm hardly here to proselytize for the perfection of the game, my class, or my personal capabilities.  I feel I have much more of a raid role than a group role these days and honestly believe many groups would be better off with a beastlord or an enchanter than a shaman -- GoD or not.<br />
And yet you tell us again and again that you did just fine?<br />
<br />
But just because some things could be better, especially in certain parts of the game, doesn't mean everything everywhere is crazily out of whack or anything, either.  Or that it's open season on anyone who likes anything about the game or is part of anything that turns out well, or that positive results should at all costs be immediately discounted and attacked, or explained away as some kind of foolishness or misunderstanding.<br />
If you think you have been attacked you should read some of your own posts. I certainly feel that you have been much more insulting to me then I have been to you.<br />
<br />
I think it was Voltaire who said, &quot;Happiness, too, is inevitable.&quot;<br />
That was Albert Camus, not that it has anything at all to do with this discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Blarg, here'sa thought. Why did those time players group with you, despite you not being high-end yourself?<br />
<br />
Answer is simple... They needed you for a single spell. It's the same way incompetent, BS tunic-wearing level 62 clerics STILL manage to get groups. You only need them for one, maybe two spells they can cast.<br />
<br />
You could be replaced by an item, theoreticly. Entirely replaced by a right-click 4-second turgers. Yes, it won't happen, but you could be replaced just the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">BlargX,<br />
<br />
At 02-22-2004, 11:18 AM you posted about your succesfull trips in the sewers and in the 2 mountain trails.<br />
<br />
Now lets hear how well you did in the KoD missions.<br />
After all I am only a humble shaman in time gear who took 7 tries to get past that stuff so please feel free to state to me how good you did in the next serries of missions.<br />
I am looking forward to the wonderfull reports you will bring us about how a shaman needs less gear in those, why we are fine when you get asked to join in them and above all about the l33t strategies you use.<br />
<br />
After all you are now in KoD are you not? You did not make up any of these claims that are the basis under your posts? You still use that ornate gear you mention so often? and your time equiped buddies are still around to invite you for groups as they did so often before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Stygiana, you seem to have the same reading comprehension problem as before.  Again, it can be solved via the same method -- actually reading the posts you're commenting on.<br />
<br />
I never claimed to have done the KoD trials.  I've just done some sewers and Tipt/Vexd.<br />
<br />
Nor to have any opinion on the later trials or disagree with a single thing anyone said about them.  Not once.  Because I simply have no personal experience with them, there would be no point.<br />
<br />
Addressing a sampling of your other strange questions -- sure I'm still wearing the same stuff.  Why wouldn't I be?  Why are you curious and what's the point of knowing if I subsequently spent any DKP on raids?  I passed, am saving some up for a while, we have too many rangers building an almost insurmountable lead on chain drops.  Talk about a non-sequitur.  <br />
<br />
Umm, regarding invites for further GoD?  I am getting plenty, turning down some because frankly some of the groups don't look solid, and some because when I get home I only have an hour or so before raiding starts, and after raiding it's past midnight, sometimes almost 2:00 a.m. and I have to go to sleep so I can be somewhat healthy next morning.  I can't do GoD groups on weekdays and still do the normal raids I'm expected to show up for.  I do still get invites though; I just need the weekend to take advantage of them, so I can go a long time between getting an invite and getting an opportunity to actually take advantage of an invite.  Usually I just eat dinner, take care of a few real life chores or things or sometimes even read or watch t.v. a bit, make a few tradeskill things, do a LDON or two or something till it's raiding time on the weekdays.  I'll have to fit GoD in when I can, around raiding and around just staying employed and alive.  Almost entirely on weekends.<br />
<br />
As to your losing 7 times in some trials, I'm sorry to hear that.  A bard I was with on my first GoD expedition, a Tipt, had also failed 7 times in a row before his first win.  Considering how long those trials can take, I'm sure that must have been very frustrating for him.  I wouldn't wish difficulty like that on anyone.<br />
<br />
Of course you're being facetious when asking for my &quot;leet&quot; strats or whatever, but I'll address it legitimately anyway.  I don't do anything special, certainly nothing more special than I'm sure you do or anybody else does.  I have gone through every trial attempt with a warrior who has 10k hitpoints or above, though, and a BoW.  Really, I think that's what matters, not my contribution.  And a good cleric. <br />
<br />
I think something that maybe everybody is doing and maybe lots aren't doing is, I keep CHA on and keep it on the cleric and main tank and anyone else who wants it so that the cleric spell Divine Intervention has a better chance of sticking.  Divine Intervention can be important enough that some tanks even spend a good deal of AA on innate charisma.  True, though it sure sounds strange.  Anyway, clerics use what, emeralds to cast that spell?  About 13pp each, and the spell doesn't last long.  A cleric can go through backpacks worth of those in a Vxed/Tipt if he has them and wants to cast the spell.  That's a lot of dough for some people, as well as a lot of bag space and the presence of mind to go shopping before coming to the group.  It's not maybe necessary that Divine Intervention is used like crazy, but it seems to help.  Anyone who is having trouble getting through the trials and knows that Divine Intervention isn't being used much, might want to talk to his cleric and maybe even show up with a few stacks of emeralds or even a bagful.  Maybe everyone already does this, I don't know, but I have seen some clerics cast it a lot more than others do.  It can't hurt to mention it.  If anyone reading is getting by on only a slim margin or sometimes having too many deaths, it's worth considering.<br />
<br />
If there's anything different I personally do at all in GoD trials or other regular groups or maybe just that I can think of to say about what I do, it's just that I try to make sure that the cleric never has to heal anyone but the main tank, by constantly keeping HOT on everyone whose health is down, so if they suddenly take a spike of damage or have some bad luck, maybe it's not terminal.  Sometimes I even HOT people who are at full health, like a chanter when a tough bunch of mobs are incoming, or the main tank when the puller is about to come back to the group, or I HOT a puller so if he has to FD while injured, his health comes back enough while he's FD so there's less chance that we have to do a CR on him.  Some mobs see through even rogue SOS in some of these trials, so ...CR is bad news.  Many clerics will do the same thing with pullers or the main tank, but I would just rather do it myself to save a cleric's mana, when I think of it.  Which I try to make as often as possible.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of shamans do a lot more DPS than I do, but probably let the cleric's mana drift a bit lower, which I really don't like to do at all.  I do notice sometimes people seem to comment on how well I help heal people in groups, and I've often gotten tells from clerics saying they really appreciate how much I'm helping them out.  <br />
<br />
And I always sort of grin inside when group members praise a cleric to the skies for snatching them away from the brink of death at the last possible moment when I know actually it was me who did it. :)  And know that even if he hadn't had a HOT on him at the same time as he got my last-second instant-heal, he would have still been screwed anyway, so I healed him with two spells, not just one, long enough for say a good cleric heal to land or the warrior to reacquire aggro or the chanter or bard to mez, whatever.  Or maybe I know that in the same circumstances, if I hadn't been helping keep the cleric's mana high by healing people in general, the cleric would probably have run out of mana right before the last heal needed to save someone from dying.<br />
<br />
I never say anything in group when that happens; let the cleric keep the healing glory, that's what he's there to be appreciated for.  I don't want to steal his thunder, but I feel good about saving people and helping him do his job and save his mana for when he really needs it.<br />
<br />
A conscientious cleric will often try to slap HOT's around on people and do general healing chores, because he wants to be useful and responsible, and he can't be criticized for that.  I do try to make it so it as rarely as possible even crosses the cleric's mind that he has to waste precious mana healing anyone but the main tank, by constantly topping off everyone's health. I love a helpful heal on myself, too, when my health is down from canni or being beat on or whatever, but I'm even happier when the cleric knows I'm taking care of it myself.  I know it can't always happen by a long shot,  but in general, I like it when my clerics are so confident and happy with their mana that they start meleeing, and when they do, I often give them a ferine avatar; it kind of excites some of them to have a little fun that way, and if their mana is fine, why not?  All DPS is good DPS.  Anyway, I try to make it so that the cleric spends the minimum amount of time slowing us down by medding and that his mana is so high that if we suddenly get adds or a named, we won't be wishing the cleric had had just a little more mana at the time.  There are all kinds of ways for a cleric to lower his mana by using things beside complete heal, but hopefully I can remove the necessity or temptation for him to do so.<br />
<br />
Nothing special about any of that -- I just heal as much as I can and make the cleric's mana pool a top priority.  The cleric's mana pool and the enchanter's health, if there is one, are generally the first things I think about in any group -- besides slowing and debuffing and regular shaman duties of course.  I don't make DPS my main concern, so my contributions are probably kind of invisible to most people, especially melees who are just crazy for parsing damage. If they parse mine, they might be even less impressed than they are with the average shaman's damage.  Everyone makes their own choices, but I feel bad for people when they die on the one hand, and know it takes a lot of time and mana to rebuff them and wait for them to zone in and loot their corpse and have rez effects wear off, etc., on the other.  I think groups where people die a lot are often the same groups where people could usually survive with a little adjustment in play style.  I usually feel my help healing will make a more positive adjustment to what the group could be doing than my doing DPS.  DPS has its place, and it can help people survive; but I like to help them survive by healing them with HOT's and only then worrying about my own DPS contribution.  I simply value the cleric's mana pool much more than my own in most circumstances, as I do the chanter's health.  I work from cleric's mana and chanter's health solid and secure as I can make it as my top concerns after slowing/debuffing and I guess root parking if I have to.  If I can DPS, fine.  But if somebody dies while I'm doing it because I'm too busy doing DPS to heal, I don't feel good about it at all.  Same if we have to worry about the cleric's mana too much because I'm busy doing the more fun, showy stuff like DPS instead of doing whatever I can to keep his mana pool high.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there's something to blow up about or get weird about in something I said up there right now, so go for it if you're in the mood.  Again, I expressly state I'm just doing regular shaman stuff and I don't think what I do is the deciding factor at all.  I put that much more on the cleric having a good mana pool(and high FT doesn't hurt a bit) and the warrior having good aggro control via a BoW and high hitpoints.  I know people could succeed without me; the difference of not having a BoW-equipped 9 or 10k plus warrior or a good cleric would however be pretty dramatic I think.  (I'm not sure I would even want to be in those groups.  Eight hours or whatever is too long to spend for a success, much less for a failure.)<br />
<br />
Which means they better have way better gear than I do. :)<br />
<br />
As to a different poster who asks if I realize I was wanted for one spell and without it could be replaced by another class, well, who couldn't realize that?  <br />
<br />
However, to at least make some kind of point surrounding that assertion, while it would be nice to be useful for many things or an infinite number of things, most classes are wanted for one thing or another, with maybe an added talent here and there helping but not being vital.  I can slow and do some minor healing and reasonable buffing.  Rogues are not necessarily needed except in certain circumstances, nor people who pull particularly well, etc.  I'm not saying having slow is enough that shamans should be perpetually satisfied that their class needs no work or improvement or always has a place in the game, far from it.  But I've seen wizards and rogues and hybrid tanks and druids and beastlords and mages and even clerics and warriors left out many times in the game when what they had to contribute to a group wasn't central and another class could do just as well if not better.  And -- I've seen them included when what they do isn't central, too.  It's not like shamans invented or perfected having a hard time.<br />
<br />
Go to any board, pretty much, and you'll find a huge percentage of people saying that their class has the hardest time of all, is uniquely downtrodden, and that everyone else or at least some class they have jealousy over should be nerfed to as close to oblivion as possible, and then hopefully spit on while being stomped into the earth of an unmarked grave.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying all of the hysteria and woe is me you see on some threads like these is completely unfounded; but when things are getting exaggerated or there are specific factual things that can point out the contrary, you might as well take some comfort in them and enjoy the good things, too.</div></div><hr />

Maybe, just maybe you should consider you are to them what my TA is to me.<br />
In other words: A slow you carry with you without having the spell in your spellslots.<br />

But feel free to stay in your dreamworld, the world where a shaman still is god, where we have no issues and where we are Uba.<br />

<br />
I am glad you finally realized that. By the way, what happened to you doing fine and contributing just as much as anyone else?<br />
<br />
There used to be a time when fighting single slowable melee only single pulls nonstop was what shaman did best. Well, it is still what we do best, only now our best is below a lot of other classes' average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u114"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p114">You asked me, Stygiana, for reports on things you knew, and that I repeatedly stated, that I hadn't done.  Way to change the subject.  I called you on it, sorry.  Your reading comprehension remains astounding miserable, unless we can just admit what this is really all about -- your screwing around.<br />
<br />
You're not as dumb as you pretend, you just want to fake it to try to chop me down because I don't agree with your misery agenda.  Perhaps because I succeeded with less where you might have failed with more?  Dunno.  Your posting sure seems to indicate a helluva festering grudge that would sure seem to suggest something like that...or anyway something very very wrong.<br />
<br />
You asked for my comments on the Kod missions knowing full well that I had stated repeatedly(let me repeat that -- REPEATEDLY) that I hadn't done them and was NOT opining on them in the first place.  Stop jerking us all off.  What the heck is wrong with your brain, your attitude, or both?<br />
<br />
The rest of your post is even worse nonsense than you've posted up to now, which is saying a LOT -- one heck of a lot.  Are  you in some kind of competition with yourself to surpass your every ridiculous remark with another?<br />
<br />
Apparently when I say I have never done Kod, you think it makes all the sense in the world to ask my opinion on Kod.  When I say I have done other trials, you find it fair to malign my success in them or deny the validity of my passing those trials as if the events never happened.  When I say I did nothing special and even relate in what seems to me kind of way too much detail exactly what I did do, pretty much laying it out and well enough proving it is nothing special, you feel it is fair to accuse me of thinking I'm some kind of shaman superman.  When I say I don't agree shamans are holy miracle workers, you insist that I am saying shamans are holy miracle workers and am full of baloney because of it.<br />
<br />
Why don't you ever just address reality or simply what has been said instead of making up one straw horse after another and then thrilling yourself with knocking it down?  If that's your idea of advancing an idea or argument, I would suggest you have it mixed up with something else entirely.  Simple aggression, for one, and pointed, willful ignorance on the other.  I am not here to help you with, wallow in, or endorse either, though I guess my mere acknowledgement sometimes sanctions both.<br />
<br />
I'm not going to apologize for succeeding, sorry.  I don't care how much you malign me for it.  Nor am I going to say I agree with you that I've said things I've never said and experienced things I've never experienced.  Being whatever it is that you are is YOUR agenda, not mine.  I'm not about to take responsibility for you and I'm not about to honor your baloney any further.  It's already been given so much more effort than it's worth -- certainly much more honest effort than you put into it yourself.<br />
<br />
I do have the strong consolation of noting how crummy some bums can look when trying their best to twist any positive word that comes from another, or even try to sweep under the rug as if it never happened any positive experiences because they don't fall in line with an agenda that's all about feeling terrible about your class and the game.<br />
<br />
Sorry that I had something positive to say?  Not me.  You maybe.  Sorry that I could back it up by the fact of my own lived personal experience while you had only your &quot;theories&quot; to counter it?  Nope. Good luck on that theories thing, I hear it works wonders in ivory towers.  Sorry I succeeded the first time when you failed 7 in a row?  No, feeling happy for myself and everyone with me who succeeded in multiple trials.  And for other shamans who can undoubtedly feel the same thing.  Too bad you can't feel a little more happy for other people, too.<br />
<br />
Beats the hell out of a misery agenda.<br />
<br />
But I guess you have to decide what it is you're really going for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">Sorry that I had something positive to say?  Not me.  You maybe.

<br />
My little 'theories' tell me that an enchanter can slow 90% as well as me while still outdamaging the rest of the group. He also brings a better haste to the group and, more importantly, brings mana regeneration. Mana regeneration which, if applied to say, a cleric and a druid, will outheal the crummy amount of HoT healing you suggest we bring to such a group.<br />
Now, the single easily parsable part of that is enchanter damage. Go test it yourself. Charm damage is utterly insane in these trials, enough to easily make up any amount of damage a shaman might heal just by cutting fight lengths in half.<br />
Just because you prefer suboptimal groups and live in your own little world does not mean other situations do not exist. You accusing me of living in an ivory tower is just ridiculous, especially when you follow it up by requesting me to proove my theories in the 'real world'. Since my argument is, shaman aren't good in these trials and you would do better replacing us with any other class as long as you still have someone to slow my ideal (and second and third and fourth) group does not even include a shaman.<br />
I find it very hard to speak from personal experience on something I, by the very definition of my argument, can never participate in.<br />
<br />
I can however speak from the parses of a lot of other people. Bottom line, enchanters are by far the best slower for these trials. They are also the best DPS class and one of the best pullers and best buffers.<br />
<br />
With the marginal resists in there beastlords are able to slow nearly as well as us, while providing far superior DPS and far superior buffs.<br />
<br />
Bards are the only class we have a decent edge on in the slowing department. Of course they are by far the best pullers and our buffing does not even come close to bard songs. Oh, and they outdamage us. <br />
<br />
All of this does not even mention crowd control, offtanking, CR roles and many other things those classes are capable of.<br />
<br />
Now, I have actually been grouped with clerics(lots) and druids(once) in these trials. So here is some personal experience, which, by your words, cannot be wrong.<br />
Divine Arbitration is god. I cannot count how many times that ability saved us. The sum of my healing pales before the beauty that is Divine Arbitration. Complete heal is great. Group Complete heal is even better at times. Divine Intervention, especially with Unfailing Divinity is like a get out of jail free card. I cannot touch these spells. I never have and never will. Ok, on to other stuff.<br />
Hmm, Q does not land whenever I try to heal more then half a bubble of damage. I tell the cleric to med and let me take care of the little stuff. He says not to worry, hes fom due to KEI(gotten before we zoned in), 9 and the Shadowknight mind-biting like mad.<br />
I find myself doing fun stuff like casting velium strike and hoping it lands in time. When we get to the nameds is the first time the cleric goes low on mana. Of course my contribution to that fight was laughable thanks to slow mitigation and crappy heals.<br />
Overall I do not think I pulled my weight. Slow mitigation kicks my ass and I do not have anything substantial to offer besides slow.<br />
<br />
Druids! Surely I will look good compared to some weak druid. Nope. Good stuff:<br />
- Divine Arbitration is not making fun of my healing abilities.<br />
- Druid CH is not making my healing look like some funny add-on, merely underpowered.<br />
- I can cast Q to fill up the odd riposte damage!<br />
- Costly heals mean that he actually runs low onmana at times! So far so good!<br />
Bad stuff:<br />
- I get group heal envy.<br />
- 9 is so much better then focus.<br />
- Not having to look for a snarer is nice.<br />
- Whoa, harmony rocks. I want that spell.<br />
- I wonder if druids can charm stuff in here. Mine did not try as he was healing. Please someone tell me the cannot.<br />
Overall I felt a little better. Slow mitigation still pisses me off, especially when every healer besides me has a way to pull singles. Being able to do more then chain-Tnarg's until the real heal lands or I get a crit heal also stinks.<br />

Neither my theories nor my analyzing nor my real world experience matches your's Blarg. I still fail to see what maes shaman so great on these trials. The only substantial advantage we bring a group is slow, and slow mitigation pretty much makes that advantage disappear. That leaves weak HP buffs, weak haste, weak healing and the worst DPS in the game.<br />
Just because you could complete the trials repeatedly with a well equipped warrior and cleric(currently the most needed and most powerful class in GoD in my opinion) does not mean shaman do fine - it means that group does fine. It does not mean you contributed as much as everyone else, it does not mean the group would not have been better of with another class and it certainly does not mean shaman need less gear to keep up with other casters.</div></div><hr />
