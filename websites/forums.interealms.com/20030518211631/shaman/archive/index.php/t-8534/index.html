<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm looking to solicit any strategies and/or advice you all may have for the Servitor of Luclin in Griegs.<br />
<br />
Guild got the key, and it's on a corpse outside GE now.<br />
<br />
Everything I've read so far says he's slowable, hits 300-350ish, flurries a ton and procs a nasty poison DoT.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing we'll have 3 or 4 groups, 55-60ish in levels.  Anything special about this guy or is it straight usual raid/melee tactics?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">slow him and plaster him<br />
<br />
pretty easy really. cripple helps as well, just keep him on a MT and it should be fine. I'd go so far as to say one group of 65's could take him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ragnhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">slow is the main thing on him.  I've pulled him w/o the key b/f, but since you have it thats much easier. :D<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be suprised if a group of 65 could do him either.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We did him with 3 groups (52-60) a while ago. Don't remember the AE proc, but I may have just forgot about it. Slow landed with no problems after Tash and Malo. We just had a mini CH rotation going. Monk pulled him across the hall to the Large room there (make sure you kill all the spawns there so you don't get any adds during the fight).<br />
<br />
Fight lasted about two minutes? Was relatively easy and you should little problem with him if your guild has even minor raid XP.<br />
<br />
If you gat a Decent MA and good healers, he is a pushover. Dropped a dagger (went to Bard I think) and a Mask that Made the Chanter happy. Chanter was only death (Tashed too soon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you thank you.<br />
<br />
That's just the kind of info I was looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you can kill much of anything you'd think of as a &quot;raid-level&quot; mob, you can whack Servitor.  She's really not qualified to be a Luclin boss ... she clearly cheated on the application exams.<br />
<br />
Her resists are minimal.  In ~ 10 kills, I don't think I've ever had a slow resisted, and I rarely bother to wait for debuffs on her.  Her melee damage is fast, but not impressive like Vindi or anything of that caliber; any tank worth their salt should shake it off well.   The proc IS brutal, but its NOT AE ... so don't ping pong her and you are fine.  <br />
<br />
There is one possible catch.  When you get to her room, peek at her before you pull her.  Occasionally, she dual-wields (we've had 2 Lurid Daggers once ....).  If that is the case, she will quad and do remarkably fast amounts of damage.  Its just unpleasant.  But ... its also rare, and you probably won't see a dual-wielding Servitor unless you get into hunting her professionally. =)  Even still ... I pulled (with slow) the dual-wielding Servitor, and tanked her till she was around 85-80% without heals (was buffed to 4.2k or so, Runed, Bedlamed, Spellshielded for the proc, Torpor up on pull ... and had instructed the clerics NOT to heal me because i expected to die instantly ... lol, I probably could have tanked her the whole fight with healing).  <br />
<br />
Good luck - she's a fun fight, with nice loot for the RvR.</div></div><hr />
