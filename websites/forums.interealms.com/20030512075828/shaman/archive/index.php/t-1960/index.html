<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow Shaman, <br />
<br />
I've been camping in Mistmoore for weeks now to get the pelt for my epic. Here is the story of my latest camp session: <br />
<br />
I logged in one fateful evening to find the Black Dire UP! <br />
<br />
I shout at my guild to see if anyone is available to help me out. Two druids quickly assist with ports and before you know it I have 7 people there to help (2 clerics and a 60 tank included). <br />
<br />
I'm getting quite excited now, as we are more than ready to take this guy down. We make our way to the chasm where he is, slaughtering everything in our path. I hurry to the Black Dire's spot to take one more look at him before pull. <br />
<br />
What?! He is gone! Disappeared! <br />
<br />
I ask the druid to check track again. No sign of him. Advisor? Nope he's not up either. <br />
<br />
I couldn't believe it, these wonderful people came at a moment's notice to kill him and now he is GONE. Disheartened, I asked them to stick around for a bit just to see if he or the advisor would pop. No luck, and soon they all had to head off, leaving me there full of disbelief and anger. <br />
<br />
/rude Black Dire <br />
<br />
I guess what I really want to know is the this: <br />
1. Does anyone know how long the Black Dire will stay up if no one kills him? Obviously not forever, as I have proof of his disappearing act. <br />
2. If he and the advisor are both killed, whats the respawn time? <br />
<br />
Thank you from the dejected Mystic,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I cannot answer your question on their spawn time. I will tell you this though. I had been trying to get some help with getting the black dire from my guild. We have been real busy with epics and other raids and there never seemed time to do it. Then on Monday I said who can help me with black dire. I got a 55 epic monk, 57 epic enchanter, 54 cleric and 53 range. We walked into mistmore and killed everything in sight went up and killed advisor came back out and killed Black dire. Whole trip with travel time was like 30 mins. In other words, just pick a day during the week get your group to gether and go.  As they say, a watched pot never boils.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was told that advisor spawn time was 2 hours - but he was up for me when I went there, so I don't know this from experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This is not the full answer you are hoping for but from what I can tell, the Advisor seems to spawn again 4 hours after he is killed.<br />
<br />
I am also trying to kill the BD on Innoruuk server but being guildless, I am having trouble enlisting the services of friends and strangers alike to help kill him.  Still trying......<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killed the Black Dire last night with 45 Shaman (me), 47 Shaman, 53 Ranger, 52 Ranger, and 51 Rogue.  Truly the most ghetto group of 'Raiderz' I've ever had the priviledge to be in.<br />
<br />
52 Warrior (our MA) camps out to log to Druid to pick up our 53 Cleric. Rogue is headed in from zoneline. Overenthusiastic Ranger was killing anything that moves (yard trash, harmony pulling the blood wolves, etc.)<br />
<br />
&quot;inc Black Dire&quot;<br />
&quot;what?  NO!&quot;<br />
&quot;NO!&quot;<br />
&quot;too late&quot;<br />
<br />
No one was buffed up, no pets, etc.  But to our credit the rangers did a good job of tanking that punk...we managed to get him to under 50% health before both of them died.  About that time the Rogue comes running up - we throw a quick group invite his way and the 3 of us (2 shammies and rogue) end up finishing him off.<br />
<br />
Other Shammie loots his pelt and its time for the rezzes.  I went from 'Crap' to 'I'm Pissed' to 'Well, I guess its ok since we killed him' in about 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to share. :)<br />
<br />
The Black Dire was already up when the first guildie zoned in, he popped about 30minutes later.  We then had to get to the advisor, he was up when we checked on him 1 hour later.  Once he died Black Dire popped immediatly and we fought him.<br />
<br />
My guildmate said Advisor was 4 hour spawn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that the truth!<br />
<br />
I'm happy to report that I took him out on Friday with help from some folks in the zone.  I popped in and there he was!  Now leery of premature despawning, I immediately asked everyone in the zone to help instead of gathering folks in the guild.  These were my recruits, who were thrilled to help out:<br />
<br />
51 Paladin<br />
52 Bard<br />
50 Paladin<br />
50ish Druid<br />
me (52 Shaman)<br />
<br />
Druid harmonied, pulled the Black Dire and took the HT.  Slow stuck on first try (woot), and soon after it was byebye wolf.  <br />
<br />
I do think the spawn time on advisor is 4 hours (have yet to see him up), and I have no idea how long the wolf was up before I came in and checked on him.  <br />
<br />
Also on a happy note, I got my books and all pages from CoM that very day.  Talk about a lucky streak :)<br />
<br />
Thanks guys for the responses, they were greatly appreciated!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I killed the dire ONCE getting my epic... was me (lvl 47 at the time) a lvl 50 paladin and a lvl 54 mage...<br />
<br />
The paladin was getting eaten alive and I was OOM when the dire finally died. YESTERDAY (im now 52 with epic) a low shaman asked for help with the dire and I decided to take it SOLO!<br />
<br />
IT WORKED!! I SOLED THE DIRE AT 52 heres how!<br />
<br />
1. I invised and ran right up to the dire. Dropped invis an stabbed dire with my spear of fate... BAAM!!! he hits me for 1,000 DD (must have been HT)<br />
<br />
2. I trained the whole zone back to the zone line (MM was empty)<br />
3. I zoned and healed and ran back in to clean up the trash...<br />
4. Whacked dire again and trained him right to zone line - zoned out<br />
5. Everytime I zoned back in he was NO AGGRO and ALLY.<br />
6. I epic dotted him and zoned out...<br />
7. I returned and watched him DIE - while he was still ally - lol<br />
8. reapply DOT when I see him regen ONE tick - and repeat zone <br />
9 after about 10x of dot and zone he died!!!<br />
10 about 5 minutes total!!!<br />
<br />
WAHOO!!!<br />
<br />
Now a new shaman has his epic and learned how to dot!<br />
<br />

<br />
Killing Advisor makes the wolf repop--<br />
<br />
I saw a group having trouble killing BD today and I trained it to the zone line for them then applied the epic... took less than 5 minutes to kill him from 100% to 0%.<br />
<br />
DOT, zone, DOT, ZONE... lol</div></div><hr />
