<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon4.gif" alt="Exclamation" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Reaver</b></p>

<p>Recently, I've gotten the opportunity to acquire a Reaver. Stats are 40/40 12 Sv All 2hs. (Weight 25, but my STA is above 100, I believe) Currently, I'm using a Sword of Pain/Atra Shield combo, with Silver Chitin Gaunts for haste. So, Reaver looks pretty cool, but apparently it's not magic. <br />
<br />
So. I want to know if its worth getting. It's going to cost me around 60k (My bank acct :P) unless I negotiate pretty well. Is it worth getting?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I wouldn't buy it....to limited in scope and too heavy to carry around unless you have a tink bag. Even then I  personally wouldn't carry it.<br />
<br />
do Like Hideo said, spend that plat on a nice Dragon Necro 2hander ( Think  Massive dragon bone Claw) and keep your stamina bar semi full.<br />
<br />
just MHO<br />

<p>OK. I can do that <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> 40/40 sounds so nice though, hehe.<br />
<br />
I'm 55... sig outdated. And it's a long story. Think a lot of time in EC and you'll get the picture.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I have recently purchased one myself (only 40k on sol ro despite only 2 guilds capable of statue), and I love it. Have yet to run into anything I cant hit with it besides phini and his guards. Im aware it doesnt hit dragons. havent tested it on the real named giants in deep kael but works on all so far. I have SoP and SBS and 30/35 warlance as backups. Im 55 and best hit so far has been 217 with best double being 215/190. I wouldnt pay anymore then 40k for it though seeing as it does have its limited uses, but is still none the less a great tool(use it to solo ldc's atm they die a LOT quicker then with my 2 other combos). You decide though, maybe the 60k would be better off spent somewhere else in your equip then on this toy.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

for 30-40 k you can get a massive dragonclaw!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
28dmg 30delay 1h slash . <br />
with the haste from your guants its 24delay 28dmg.<br />

<p>Erm. I think it would be a good time to mention now that Bristlebane prices are HIGLY out of whack. (And high in general) It's an old, old server, so money is floating around like crazy. I don't think anybody's twink has worse weapons then a Yak, and most have Lammies or some such fast weapon. Fungi Tunics on half the monks. FBSS on pretty much everyone. Our prices are frankly, screwed up.<br />
<br />
I just might go for that MDS though <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>I picked mine up for 30kpp in trades/pp and I love it.  I hit for about 225 now.  I have the stamina and str to handle it so that is not a prob.  When I need to use something else I have my Zealot's and a Dragon Lance handy so no big deal.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> Ahh..the Reaver</b></p>

<p>Well, I was awarded one recently (Yay!) so I can't comment on price.  BUT I can tell you it is a kick-butt situational weapon.  The damage output is very good, and +12 to all resists isn't too much of a hardship either.  Just don't use it for Sirens, ghouls, phase spiders, etc. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p><b> 60k too much</b></p>

<p>To give you a frame of referrence, I traded one this week on Terris Thule for a Noc Blade (Noc sells for 7-8k now). <br />
<br />
After one day of use, I would have to say it hits like a mack truck.<br />
<br />
One question, what happens if your stamina is over/under 100? How important is it to have your stamina over 100?</p>

<p>Bristlebanes prices are so outa the loop that I no longer buy from other players, everything on my characters now I go get myself rather than pay tripple the price their worth.<br />
<br />
Guess its rather poetic justice that the server named after a theiving god gets greedy.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>
