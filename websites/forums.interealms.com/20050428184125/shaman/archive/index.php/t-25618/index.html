<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hertome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone.<br />
<br />
Finally im one bub before hitting 60. <br />
<br />
Now i dont have any idea where to go. I always hunt with 3 friends together (yes ALWAYS). The group consist of:<br />
<br />
60 BST<br />
60 Shaman (Me)<br />
58 Cleric<br />
58 Druid<br />
<br />
The Beastlord fill the role fo the main tank , and that is my problem. He has about 2500 HP unbuffed and 1010 AC.( We get him to 4200 HP Buffed) <br />
<br />
Anyone got an idea where we can hunt to 65? Can the BST tank the Planes? Im up for any Ideas.<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot in advance for the help!<br />
<br />
Greetings<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Back in 58-62 I liked to group in Acrylia caverns (the inner part). The mobs are level 55 or so and hit for about 200, except named who are 58 (i believe) and hit for 400 max. Good thing is you get some nice cash from vendor drops and a nice load of acrylia ore (be ready to summon extra bags, hehe). Named can drop nice twink items which sell for up to 10k on my server. Exp was still 1%AA per mob with 2 lvl 65 players (mage + shaman), easy and fast kills.<br />
If you need explanation on how to get to the inner part of AC just reply here. Oh, i forgot : be ready to root / offtank adds, because the mobs have a nice tendancy to help each other :)<br />
There are probably better places to hunt in newer expansions, but I really loved this zone.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking of Veksar (the dungeon under the Lake of Ill Omen), which is a funny zone too, basically always empty on my server since OoW is out.<br />
The mobs shouldn't be too hard once slowed if you don't go too deep inside.<br />
<br />
If you need more information about those zones, just ask here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hertome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
Inner Acrylia sounds interesting. U think we can handle some fights there? Prolly the named? 8)<br />
<br />
Would be cool if u can give me some information about Acrylia, where to set camp (if needed) which mobs to hunt down, as iv never been there.<br />
<br />
I was just once in Veksar at zone in, but had no fun at all ther, but thats long time ago. Is the zone in good exp? We plan to hurry to 65 to get done with lvling first (we dont have oow). and then grind some nice AAs 8)<br />
<br />
Any information about these zones helps.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the quick answer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Trollfarceur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You will find the map of AC here (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/acrylia1.jpg). Note that it is a pre-revamp map, so the text on it is no longer valid. It's only for navigation purpose.<br />
I'm at work atm so I can't make you an updated map. I'll post one when I have the time to make one.<br />
Inner AC is on the left part of the map. To get there i'd suggest you fight your way through till the 4 of you know the way so that you can go invis easily.<br />
At zone in, take to the right.<br />
Then take the second corridor to the left, open the grid a few steps further. You should be at the entrance of a big room.<br />
Hug left wall till you're at the SE corner of the room. If you're not invis you may aggro some shiknar. Just kill and go further :).<br />
Once you're at the corner you'll see stairs with skels on them. Pull them (with pacify if needed) and kill them.<br />
Then climb up the stairs and go south. You should be in a square room with a mob in each corner. Pull them and kill them.<br />
Now enter the big room (with lava on map). Hug NW wall and kill the 2 mobs guarding the door at West wall.<br />
Open the door and climb the stairs. 3 mobs will aggro you. Just root / offtank and kill them. They conned green at level 67 so it shouldn't be too hard :). Once it's clear med a bit and rebuff if needed and click on the totem with the big ruby on it to enter Inner AC.<br />
<br />
If you want to go with invis :<br />
Invis up at entrance, and follow the path till the skels on the stairs. As they're undead, they do see invis. Kill them and reinvis. Then go straight to the ruby totem and zone in Inner AC. Be careful, some roamers (usually necros) in Inner AC do see invis.<br />
<br />
The ZI is usually clear, but as there are some roamers you can have to deal with up to 4 mobs. It happened to me once at level 58, with my lvl 60 mage friend. Was tough but we managed it, so I guess you should do fine with your group, provided you know how each other play.<br />
<br />
Once inside, I usually move from PH/Named to PH/Named.<br />
Here's the cycle I usually do (It'll be much more simple when I post an updated map).<br />
<br />
1st PH : Go north from ZI. Pull the mob to the right at the crossroad. Once it's dead, the puller hugs the wooden door to aggro the PH for a grimling bloodmage. If the puller doesn't aggro the PH, just sit and the mob will come.<br />
<br />
2nd PH : Continue to the north, go down a few stairs. In this room there are 2 mobs guarding the jail's door to the west, and 1 mob in the NW corner. Pull the mob at the NW (use paci on the mobs by the jail door if needed). Remember to hug East wall or you may get aggro from the 2 mobs by the jail door (you can kill them before going further if you think they'll aggro). At the center of the next room to the north stands the PH for a grimling arcanist. Once again, use pacify or be ready to root/offtank.<br />
<br />
3rd PH : Once the arcanist PH is dead, kill the 2 mobs guarding the jail and open the door. All but puller stay in the small square room for the next pull (see point A on map). Let the puller enter the jail room and hug right to the corner. A few steps away stands the PH for a grimling arch sage. Bring it to the group, the mobs inside the jails shouldn't come. The small square room is quite safe : I seem to remember that only 1 roamer paths here, so you can set camp here for the next few pulls.<br />
<br />
4th PH : quite a bunch of mobs to kill to get to this PH, so you can skip it if you're not killing too fast, which may probably be the case before you're all 60+. Take the stairs to the south right by the exit of the jail (where 2 mobs previously stood), and pull the mob to the right at the top of the stairs. Pull the mob standing at the NW corner, then the 2 mobs guarding the corridor to the west. Beware of the roamers, they particularly like this part of the map. Take this corridor and go either north or south. Supposing you chose north, pull the 2 mobs in the small alcove (sp?). Go south after the alcove (basically, follow the corridor). To the west is the throne room, where you'll find the PH for a grimling warlord, standing by the throne. He's got 1 friend in each corner of the room (4 total). So use pacify or pull them carefully.<br />
<br />
5th PH : this one is a roamer, so there's a good chance that you killed it already. It paths between the ZI and the throne room, using the quicker way (north at ZI, west at the crossroad, then straight to the throne room. So be really careful when you fight in his path, because an add hitting for 400 (if named) and CHing himself isn't really welcome :). The named is a grimling high priest.<br />
<br />
To exit the zone, well you have a drood so that should do. There is a zone out in the room marked with a B on the old map. The zone out is a blue tapestry hanging on the north wall of the room, just click it.<br />
<br />
Some basic advice for this zone : watch your back, because adds are really common. Always debuff magic resistances (at lvl 69 i sometime get resisted because i'm too lazy to debuff the mobs) and keep root up. Buff up your resists, because mobs will nuke, DoT and root you.<br />
<br />
Cash loot :<br />
Etched runes : as they stack i keep them all :)<br />
Weapons : worth 140+pp at the vendor, worth keeping<br />
Acrylia : I hope you have weight reduction bags. Dunno if collapsible forges exist, but it may be worth having one in your inventory, with a smithing chisel.<br />
Other runes / pages : not really worth keeping unless you have lots of room in your bags.<br />
<br />
Now the best thing to do is seeing it by yourself and add any comment.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hertome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">wow thanks alot!!!!!<br />
<br />
we will give it a try next weekend!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should also check out Droga at your level.  The plat drops are good, and the named spawns are well known.  I go back every once in awhile to get stuff to tribute for my duo.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of posts in the forums concerning Droga.  I'd recommend you cut your teeth at an easy camp like Runri.  Then move on to something more profitable like Flame Master or King.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Memories of crawling Sebilis around those levels bring a tear to my eye.<br />
Juggs, spore king, and the crypt were my favorite haunts.<br />
If anyone really cares I can post a lot of info about this fantastic zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sebilis is a fantastic zone, but the exp there isn't all that, anymore.  They could do very well at Juggs I suppose, if they're good at crowd control with root.<br />
<br />
Given how many spells you guys are going to need in the next couple levels, I say head for PoP where you can get them without paying through the nose.  The best exp in Tier 1 is found either in the Factory in PoI, or in PoN killing Hobgoblins.  Hobs would be &quot;challenging&quot; for you to do cc on, though, since they're not rootable.  CoD is great great exp, but you have three casters who wouldn't get to use their drogmors.  If you can handle it, PoV is your best bet, doing Razorfiends in the cave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">was in Howling Stones this weekend with 62 monk and 59 shaman and exp was decent just clearing entrance, and that was mostly lt blue. With that group you could easily crawl through and work on master key for everyone. Only issue might be if you have want to keep OT faction.  Some nice old world drops, and mobs have Kunark HP so they go down fast. Just something to think about for off the beaten path.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">South wing of HS is 2hr/AA, solo at 65!  Oh yes, I collected *over* 3aa getting my epic drops from there, due to killing in the wrong area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sebekiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If you don't arleady have it, I'd recommend getting DoN.  Once your group starts doing some of the missions, you'll find you can get some nice improvements:<br />
<br />
1. Spirit of the Leopard at 61 - HUGE DPS increase for the party. Between the BL and 3 pets (Yours, Beastlord's and Druid's booboo bear) you'd get a nice increase, and a bit more if you step in to melee as well.<br />
<br />
2. Gear upgrades - The items available are better than LDoN, and tend to be a little easier to acquite (less missions to get enough crystals).<br />
<br />
3. The mobs seem to be easier than PoP. I was soloing in Lavaspinner's Lair to do some of the first tasks and only getting hit for 300 or so, max. Experience was so-so, maybe 1 to 2% AA per kill (if the stuff wasn't green), so you can figure that these monsters will probably give fairly good experience at level 60.<br />
<br />
4. Even if you aren't in a guild, you can use the Corpse Summoner's in the Guild Lobby to summon your corpses if your group gets unlucky and has a wipe.  You can rez up and rebuff in safety, and pick up some extra buffs like KEI in the Plane of Knowledge on your back for revenge!<br />
<br />
DoN isn't a huge expansion for some of the Raiding Guilds (though it looks like there are a couple nice high-end raid monsters), but I think it's got a lot to offer people that are in the smaller guilds or not affiliated with any guild.</div></div><hr />
