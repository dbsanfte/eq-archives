One of the (many) reasons my first marrage fell apart was that I spent a lot of time playing games on a friend's computer. You may argue that computers or computer games don't make anybody do anything and thus cannot be blamed, but in reality that is far from the truth. The internet and computer games are just as addictive as alcohol or gambling, and any addiction can and will lead to neglect or lack of communication or both, which in turn leads to all sorts of problems. The link between computers/computer games and many social problems is very, very real.<br />
<br />
All things in moderation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think some people are going to get addicted to things no matter what, and the internet is less harmful than alchohol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree that relationships can be harmed by excessive computer use.<br />
<br />
However, I disagree that the game it what is to blame. I would also argue that the alcohol or drugs did not &quot;make&quot; an addict do something. Someone had to make the choice to have that first drink, shoot up the first heroin or turn on the game. No one tied the person to a chair and forced them to play a game.<br />
<br />
It is not the responsibility of the game or internet insudtry to make less-addictive games. It is the responsiblity of individual players to moderate their own use.<br />
<br />
It is also the responiblity of others involved in the relationship to bring up issues such as excessive computer usage before it becomes a relationship breaker. The first time your significant other calls in sick to work for a game, or plays/surf all night when he or she has to work the next day is the time to address the issue, not six months later when he (or she) is fired.<br />
<br />
Personal responsibility - learn it, live it, accept it. The world as a whole would be a better place with a little more of it around.</div></div><hr />

It all depends on what's more important to you. When I first got my computer, even though it was a new thing to me, I didn't spend hours upon end on it. Even with EQ, I can only stand being on for a certain amount of time before I get sick of it. <br />
<br />
The people who can't prioritize are the ones who will have problems like these. One of my friends does this all the time and it pisses me off. I'll be over there talking to him and a couple of my friends and he'll just wander upstairs and start playing on his computer. I can see firsthand how this joepardizes relationships, whether it's between friends or couples.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree both that addictions will occur regardless of the source and that the source of the addiction itself is not the cause of the addiction. Nobody does something with the thought of &quot;I'm going to become addicted to this.&quot; Most often it's a thought of &quot;I'm only going to do this for a little while or infrequently. I won't become addicted.&quot; That's precisely(sp?) why addictions work the way they do. I'm not at all saying that it is anybody's responsibility to make an internet or a game less addictive. Addiction is a phenomenon that lies outside the realm of the details. Anything that is fun to do is addictive to some people.<br />
<br />
That having been said, the message here is simply to take a look at yourself objectively once in a while and make sure that your favorite leisure activities, whether they're games or TV or  gambling or Tiddly-Winks aren't causing problems with your job, marrage, schoolwork, etc. Most people &quot;never saw it coming&quot; simply because they were too caught up in the addiction to even realize there was a problem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Better advice was never given.<br />
<br />
I would also say that the reverse is true, that your job, marriage, schoolwork, etc. isn't causing problems in your enjoyment of life through leisure activities.  Being addicted to work is just as bad as being addicted to anything else.  However it is much more socially acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorneblade</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe firmly that what Tev said is true.   However, I dont see a huge difference between spending 4-5 hours a night on the computer is no different than the 4-5 (or more ) that are spent in front of the TV each night in most house holds with nary a thought about it.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to say that as just because a game is not controling your life you could still have problems with a relationship partner.  As Myrea suggested some sensitivity to your partners needs is in order.  <br />
<br />
BUT, more is the problem I see of couples getting married before they truely know each other and many dont think that sharing common intrest and hobbies are important.  I feel this is one of the more important things that should be matched up in a couple. <br />
<br />
Not spending enough time with significant others is a major problem of many couples.  Wouldnt this be more easily avoided if couples enjoyed doing most of the same things?  And they must enjoy them together, dont forget that.<br />
<br />
opps here I go again ranting and rambling but this is a pet peeve of mine.  That couples today dont look at the right things before getting together.<br />

<br />
They tell Heroin addicts to start smoking (*cough* or so I have been told). They are in fact trading one addiction for another, but in the end it is about which is less damaging I suppose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Guns kill people.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;DooM makes kids want to kill each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
Me have two words:  Bull Pucky.   Each of dem tings requires a person behind dem to make a decision on deir own to affect deir life and da lives of dose around dem.<br />
<br />
Da internet and video games is very inviting and it easy to get caught up in them and neglect yous personal life.   But dat is a decision dat yous make yousself.  Da internet is not to be blamed for yous neglecting yous life, yous are. <br />
<br />
Dat being said, if  yous find dat you may be having a tough time getting off da computer, me recommend taking a step back and, like udders have said, prioritizing.  Seek counseling if needed.  Human lives will always outweigh a machine and &quot;cyberfriends&quot; when it comes to importance in one's life.<br />
<br />
Bash good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 09:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, but what makes relationships in real life that more real than relationships and friendships within a game or on the internet?<br />
<br />
Addictions aside, I think of the internet as truth. People express how they really feel, because they are detached from the real world consequences. People are more likely to lie to your face than to you online. Though, with roleplaying and people faking their identity, it can be hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 10:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's amazing to me what some people say isn't important in a marriage.<br />
<br />
It's not important that we have the same friends, religion, hobbies, sleeping habits, etc. &quot;What matters is that we love each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
In most cases, love like that turns out to be mere infatuation.<br />
<br />
It's not imperative that ALL those things match exactly, but to really live together and love for the rest of your life, it IS important that you at least have some common ground.<br />
<br />
FRIENDS<br />
If you don't have the same friends just because they don't know each other, that's one thing. My friends and my husband's friend had never had the chance to get together, but once they did, we had one big circle of friends, instead of his and hers.<br />
If you can't STAND his friends, what makes you think you can live with him for the rest of your life? Birds of a feather... You can tell a lot about a person based on who his/her best friends are.<br />
<br />
RELIGION<br />
Not to get too deep into it, but assuming you plan to have kids, this can become a MAJOR issue. I'm not talking the difference between Cathoic and Lutheran. I'm talking Protestant-Pagan, Catholic-Athiest, etc. If you already don't like his best friends, and he has a completely different religion view from you, you're well on the road to marital hell.<br />
<br />
HOBBIES (Often tied to SLEEPING HABITS)<br />
He plays computer games all night. You believe in early to bed, early to rise. I hope you like spending your weekends alone. <br />
You play tennis with this really cute young girl at your club, she seldom sees natural sunlight.<br />
If you don't share interests in the things you do outside of obligations to work and family, can you really see the relationship lasting?<br />
<br />
Why do people get into a marriage thinking that these &quot;little things&quot; don't matter? They aren't little things. People's beliefs and habits are part of who they are, and that extends to every part of the relationship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 10:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would say that it is the little things that matter. The big things don't. You are forced to deal with the big things. The little things are optional and therefore mean that much more when you do them. I brought my fiance flowers two weeks ago. It was Thursday evening. I gave her the flowers and said &quot;Happy Thursday!&quot; She asked what they were for. I replied, &quot;Because it's Thursday.&quot; That's the kind of &quot;little thing&quot; that really makes a difference.</div></div><hr />
