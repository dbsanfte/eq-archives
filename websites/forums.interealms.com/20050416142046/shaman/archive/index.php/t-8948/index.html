<br />
MEdium-fast processor with 1gig of memory and a high-end video card will make your game zip along.  You can re-use many of your parts, and perhaps get good use out of your powersource and case, cutting your investment down to around $400 (US)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe two years ago I'd have given the same advice, but any more it is virtually impossible to put together your own machine with a price comparison anything close the the major companies.<br />
<br />
Consider--he says you can re-use many of your own parts and keep your price down around $400. And that is absolutely true. But, you can also go buy a brand new system without a monitor from one of the major companies for about the same price. At that point, it is hard to justify the time and effort to make a new machine (unless that is entertainment to you, as it is to me :),<br />
and you get all new components in the deal.<br />
<br />
I wish it was still true that you can build-your-own cheaper than the retailers--I used to make some decent extra cash building high-end &quot;tailored&quot; machines for some gamers and other power-users--but it really just isn't true any more :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dell (and any major pc maker) is crap.  The computer u get from them for $400 sure as hell won't play eq.  They say they customize but really there isnt alot of choice when you configure your system.<br />
<br />
If you are on any kind of budget it is far better to assemble your own with parts from your old computer.   Just make sure you know where you are buying from and know the warranty policy in full before buying.  A local shop may charge more for parts than you can get on the internet but the service should be better and you can always go there and bitch if something breaks :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even on the top of the line systems you're not likely to see anything better than a g4 mx, possibly a ti 4200... and these are $2k (us) and up...  Some come with ATI cards, which, while good cards, don't seem to run EQ well from what I've heard.  My system has a g4 ti4600 /flex :D  Building &gt; Buying</div></div><hr />
