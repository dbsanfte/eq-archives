<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was doing a Ldon last night, normal, with levels 59 - 65.  We zone in and Pally pulls 3 mobs almost before we are ready.  No Chanter and no Bard, root and snare are about the only CC we have.  So being the competent Shaman that I am, I have Tigers memorized and proceed to cast.  Boom I slow all the mods and then parked what I could.<br />
<br />
So here is my question, we had 3 or 4 more pulls like this on, and they were long fights.  Is it worth it to go back and reslow some of the mobs with Tugurs.  If mana is ok.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Totally depends on how long you think the fights will last.  <br />
<br />
Turgurs lasts longer.  Often I will follow up with Turgurs depending on my mana situtation and how long I think that will be around before it dies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It's what I used to do. It kinda changes when you get a TA though. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If mana is ok, then go for it, LOL. Personally, I burn a LOT of mana in LDoN Norms because I am usually the only slower and healer, but I also like to DOT and melee, so I rarely stand back and canni up. <br />
<br />
Honestly man, at this point in the evolution of LDoN, there arent many &quot;wrong&quot; ways to do Normals. If your consistantly going over 40 minutes, then maybe an adjustment can be made, but still, unless your actually FAILING them I wouldnt sweat it. <br />
<br />
Did one the other day, a room had 4(!!) Healers (3 clerics and a druid or shaman, cant always tell, I think they combine em sometimes) in it, and we had no mezzer and not a TON of DPS (no real DPS classes, cept 1 ranger). It was funny as hell. They Ched each other for 20 minutes until I finally started just pulling 1 at a time about 3 rooms back and parking it there, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It depends on how fast they die.  When I get a multipull situation I usually cast Tigirs and them VP and park some.  Whichever ones arent engaged when Im finished pushing them around get Turgurs.  The ones that are engaged its not worth it, because they will be dead in about a 40 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">IMHO, I would dot them instead of re-slowing them with a &quot;better&quot; slower.  I think it is better use of mana.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I will reslow all but the one that is engaged.  Then start to help the MA.  I just don't think that one bane on a mob will make up for the mana your gonna use healing a tank with 3 to 4 semi slowed mobs smacken people around until they are parked.  It also insures that the superman class that thinks they can tank don't use up to much mana from heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Turgurs is 3rd priority. <br />
1st=cc (Tigirs/VP/Root), 2d=Spot Heal(MT/MH/Rezzer), 3d=Slow 3d/4th/5th Mobs depending on speed of dps. <br />
<br />
Tigirs is nice on an incoming closely bunched multiple pull if I am cc. CC is top priority on multiple pull. If I am it I would have Tigirs loaded as my main aggro device. Tigirs, VP, root, run-root, run-root, run-root. If more than 4 I usually need some off tanking or kiting help.  Biggest problem with this sort of cc is folks who automatically off tank in range of Main Tank/Healer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I group with people (# 1, # 2 Guild on Server) and their MONKS tell me to not bother slowing.<br />
<br />
(Normals)<br />
<br />
Course I also did a normal with a Ranger and Beastlord healing.<br />
<br />
I remember when I started LDONs on my Enchanter. That was 1400 hitpoints and 100 AA's ago (or so).<br />
<br />
Heck with a good puller Hards aren't that hard. (Slow mitigation sorta grabs me at the base of my Snarflees)<br />
<br />
I only RE-slow if slow wears off.  If you're pulling three at a time and the Pally is staying upright, you're fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on your tank and group mana pools also.  Last night, we did Ruj ldon's with 2 shaman, 2 sk, 1 necro, 1 bst.  The main sk was from IB and rarely took any dmg.  <br />
<br />
Basically, we'd pull everything in site, I'd drop Q on both tanks, they'd grab aggro on all mobs, then I'd just chain rains.  I was main healer.<br />
<br />
Other shaman would AE slow, and depending on whether Q was keeping up with the mob dmg, would either apply turgurs or AE rain also.<br />
<br />
Its up to you to decide which is the best use of your mana.  In my case, with the tank being very robust, my mana was best spent doing dmg.  If the tank was bazaar geared, I probably would have been healing more and helping slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I am usually the puller in my normal LDON groups and the last few months I have usually initiated the groups also.  I do that for a few reasons, but mainly because I prefer to load up my groups with DPS classes who are less chicken than most peeps. <br />
<br />
One of the most fun group compositions is having 1 tank, 1 shammy (me), 1 cleric/druid and 3 wizzys.  Have the wizzys load their AOE nukes and just stack up the slowed mobs all around the tank.  I can usually keep about 4-5 mobs all together, bring um in slowed, root, grab more. Too much fun.  I think 8-10 stacked together was my tops.  Peeps just freak out the first time I bring in that many mobs. (lol).   <br />
<br />
Another fun type is the all pet LDON although you as Shammy need to be a bit more careful on the pulls because no one can help you with agro.  Q yourself before a big pull, use the aa root when its up.  You have never seen those mobs go down faster then when there are 4 mages and 1 necro and you.<br />
<br />
The reason I bring these up is that part of the fun of easy LDON's is doing screwy groups.  Peeps who insist on balanced groups or want to pacify mobs make me want to pull my hair out. I also like 6 shaman groups. <br />
<br />
Anyway, keep things lighthearted, laugh about the big pulls and communicate well and LDON's are tons more fun.  I personally never load our AOE slow since it is pretty rare that so many mobs come in that single slows are not feasible.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit surprised that normal LDON's are not popular on certain servers I guess.  They are still very much alive on Quellious.<br />
<br />
Purdypog<br />
<br />
PS: To answer the poster's most basic question about correct methodology of slowing etc.  Experience is the best teacher on that.  I remember when I started to do normal LDON's being the only healer and slower and puller I was pretty anxious a lot of the time about making correct decisions.  As I did more and more advs I got a ton better at agro management, healing and parking etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, interesting. I never mem Tigir's. I just pull with Turgur's, and have the MA and DPS tackle that one first. <br />
<br />
If another mob comes (which it usually does), I offtank, slow, root. <br />
<br />
If two or more other mobs come with the one I pulled, I VP one, then OT/slow/root the others, then slow the VPd one.<br />
<br />
Of course, this works best with high-damage groups, like a Pally and four DPS (caster, pet or melee). If I know I'll bring more than three mobs, I'll let someone else pull - like someone with fd, evade, lull, pacify, mez, whatever.<br />
<br />
And yes, this is for normal 65s or hard 60s, depending on the average level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Never found a time where someone would ever suggest that I don't slow a mob.  But then again.. I think that if they suggested it i would laugh at them cause it's far more effecient for me to slow something than not to slow it.. no matter who was tanking it.  <br />
<br />
But, i can see if your gear is a bit subpar then maybe it might be better for you not to slow it, cause you'll be taking more hits than normal and will require more healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When there are more than 2 or 3 mobs that need to be pulled, just Q yourself, and then proceed to pull with turgurs or even tigirs if you think the mobs are close enough.<br />
<br />
-Fin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Val, the MOBs died so fast that it was arguably better for me (according to them) to toss a nuke and mezz and let the MOBs beat on DS (117 point) for the 10 seconds it was standing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pally pulls 3 mobs ... I have Tigers memorized and proceed to cast.  Boom I slow all the mods and then parked what I could.<br />

<br />
Like others have said, experience is the best teacher, as you balance dps, cc, mana management, and the variations with slightly different groups.  <br />
<br />
I would note one specific principle, though:  choosing your tactics, instead of falling into them.  <br />
<br />
If you've agreed that the paladin will grab as many as three at a time and you'll all just engage the three mobs and plow your way along, then there's no problem, the paladin was doing his job.  <br />
<br />
But if the paladin's actions were making the adventure harder, and if he wouldn't change when you asked him, then part of your strategy should be to slow the paladin down.  You do that by letting the mobs beat him down to 20 pct or so, and then cast Torpor.  The goal is to keep him around 20 pct:  not actually dying, but worrying about it.  That may enable him to be more thoughtful about his pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i follow with turgur if i had to use tirgir. ( but i rarely meming tirgir)<br />
<br />
BTW,shaman can do some very good pulling.<br />
<br />
with a 4 mobs in room who would agro,and no pacify or mezzer,i cast (right click root) on one mob,cast my fast root (1.8 sec if i remember) (no recast time after casting right clicky  :)  ) on other who inc. <br />
<br />
the 3rd one is  VP (aa root) off camp and  we usually get one to kill if no root resist.<br />
then i cast turgur on mobs........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Never found a time where someone would ever suggest that I don't slow a mob. .<br />

I've seen this on some named where a toon wants to pop a riposte dissc and impress our pants off (or at least they think they do)</div></div><hr />
