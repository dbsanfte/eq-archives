<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to all my friends at the Crucible for your help and advice.<br />
<br />
Fight went flawlessly.  I actually brought 4 groups 50-60 including 3 chanters and 3 clerics...can you say overkill?<br />
<br />
I had everyone stay inside the tunnel closest to the illusion wall out to the hallway.  Lacking a 55+ puller with good iksar faction I pulled it myself (58 shaman). It went like this:<br />
<br />
I pulled the room trash out of the room in a big train into the tunnel..groups mez'd/stunned and ate em up.<br />
<br />
Did hand in to the iksar apparittion..who BTW hangs out RIGHT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TUNNEL. This surprised me as I thought he would be closer to the stage. He's VERY easy to aggro into the tunnel..so keep the softskins back.<br />
<br />
Once I did the hand in..the iksar turns into rile and moseys over to the stage.  The arisen pop in front of the stage and after a while VS shows up.<br />
<br />
I hung back at the tunnel behind the broken bricks and watched the show.  12 minutes later VS was targetable.  I pulled with slow..landed it and got 3 arisen as adds. One arisen (the priest?) never aggro'd me..I might have been lucky.  Not that any of this mattered, I pulled the whole lot of em into the hall and groups made quick work of VS while keeping the other arisen mezzed.<br />
<br />
Once VS was dead, I looted his skull, and made my way back to the stage (giving the still-unaggro'd arisen wide berth)..did my hand in, and the last arisen despawned along with Rile, who was kind enough to hand me his cudgel for my troubles.<br />
<br />
Anyway..the hardest part was getting all those people into HS..:)<br />
<br />
Please let me know if anyone needs tips on how to finish their cudgels..the effect is very nice, and it's still a pretty uber range item even in light of the new PoP items. (btw CARNAGE does currently stack with HoS..and bunches of other things.  The cast time doesn't seem that long.  It does NOT require you to have an emerald in your posession as someone said)<br />
<br />
Thanks again Crucible!<br />
<br />
P.S. thanks to mercuritrayin for his advice and caveats about his failed attempts.  You'll get yours bud..:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overkill is always good with things that take quite a bit of time that you really don't feel like doing again.  If you want, you can always trigger the fight again with a smaller group. :)<br />
<br />
The emerald was for the initial release of the 8th and was removed as a neccessary component in a later patch.  The only things that Carnage seems to have issues with atm are PE, VoB,  Avatar, and maybe Billy.  I use the buff mostly on pets and a non-primal melee or two.<br />
<br />
Just one question: Mask or amulet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mask, and nobody looted it so I'm wearing it now.<br />
<br />
(see magelo)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heya Csin. Congrats. As for not looting the mask, you never gave anyone a chance to roll on it who was present. I was eyeing it and about to ask you to let those who could use roll, but you looted it. Ah well..it was your right to have it to I suppose. I can just hope it drops when ever (if)ever I can get this damn thing done. Its impossible to get numbers for this fight on MT as everyone ends up joining the Uber guilds who are above this level of fight..<br />
<br />
<br />
See you in game.<br />
<br />
-Merc..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey grats on the cudgel! Oh and thanks for the info.  All I have is this part left ~ gotta get me a few groups of friends willing to die for my cause hehe.  Ok .. and thiers since i'll be clicking this thing alot =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Salamonda Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">About how hard does this form of VS hit for?  <br />
<br />
Approx how many hp?  32k?  More less?<br />
<br />
Any trouble mezzing the adds?  Did enchanters have to use level 61+ mez?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ack!<br />
<br />
Sorry Merc..I never thought of asking you about the mask until you JUST mentioned it.  I must have asked in channel a few times, there wasnt' much time left on the corpse, and at that moment I thought I was the only CT worshipper there..sorry bro.  Count on me to come to your fight.<br />
<br />
We had 3 enchanters on the raid (54, 56, and 59 I think)..so no AA stuff or PoP stuff was required or even thought of.   The encounter was designed as a Kunark thing..so post-velious equipment and abilities only make it easier.<br />
<br />
As for the VS kill, this version of VS procs a HT rather than the lifetap of the REAL VS.  I didn't actually fight him directly.  I got whacked by one of the Arisen before it was mezzed properly, and then VS was dead.  After a 12 minute puppet show everyone was FM.  Two clerics and two druids in a very informal CH chain were more than sufficient.  I don't think VS lasted a minute, but remember I brought waaay TOO much firepower.  I couldn't tell you how many HPS he had.  It didn't seem like many.<br />
<br />
To do this yourself: Post a notice about this on your guild and server boards weeks in advance.  You'll need to spend some hard-earned plat and time to make sure your whole team has HS keys (seems like nobody does anymore).  I became the local expert on HS, and had the chancellor in LoIo timed to the moment to make sure everyone had prods.<br />
<br />
Get a whole team confirmed: rogue, chanter(s), melees and clerics, then go put together ANOTHER team to follow it up.  This fight isn't that hard, but without the right people it can be a nightmare (&quot;Sorry..rogue didn't show up, so we cant' get into the S. Wing..raid over&quot;).<br />
<br />
All I can say is good luck.  I am really enjoying using the Carnage clicky on my MT and pet for exp groups, it really seems to help, and my MT's weapons proc'd  like crazy last night in PoI.  Carnage also has no level or group restrictions..so it's kinda fun clicking on lowbies as I'm passing by.  I also used it to buff a group from another guild last night and they were like &quot;*** was that!?&quot;.  Love that.</div></div><hr />
