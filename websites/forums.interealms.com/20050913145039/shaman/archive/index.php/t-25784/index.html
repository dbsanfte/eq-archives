<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">to find a nice place to level.... Ive come here twice with area questions and you guys have nailed the areas to go to perfectly... can ya help me out one more time?<br />
<br />
Tks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what you've done so far. I think at 49 you can do some of the south end of felwood. <br />
<br />
Sorrow Hill in Western Plaguelands has undead 50-52 range and a camp just around the corner that might have a quest or two you can do. <br />
<br />
I think i was killiing Stuff in Hinterlands at that level also. I know I'm missing one hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you don't know where to go, you haven't been doing your quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Searing Gorge is where the wife and I are currently hunting. There's an entrance in the Badlands for Horde. Alliance can get a quest for a key to the gates to SG in Thelsamar from the lil dorf chick on the ram at the gate itself.<br />
<br />
Tanaris over by Un'Goro crater, or in the crater itself might also be good for ya.<br />
<br />
Just learn to ignore Juujuu. Bitter fools aren't worth listening to anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And what I gave him is actually help.<br />
<br />
When you are hunting in an area, you get what I think of a &quot;linker quests&quot; that link you to a new area that you might want to go hunt in.<br />
For example, if you hunt in Stranglethorn Vale, Krazek has a quest for you to get something from the Dragon Whelps in the Swamp of Sorrows.<br />
Until you get that quest, you don't really know that you might want to hunt there.<br />
But in getting the quest, you look on your map to see where it is, you go on an adventure getting there, and in looking for the mobs you need to whack for the quest, you find more NPCs in the area that have quests for you to do, and you find more NPCs to hunt that are higher level than what you were hunting.<br />
Pretty much every quest area has 2-3 linker quests for other areas.<br />
Shimmering Flats has quests for you to go to STV and Tanaris.<br />
Duskwood has quests for you to go to Ashenvale and Menethil Harbor.<br />
Thunder Bluff (Mulgore) has quests for you to go to the Barrens and Sepulchar.<br />
Gadgetzan has quests for you to go to Feralas, Felwood, and Ungoro Crater.<br />
etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
If you don't know where to go, you haven't been doing your quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Class and pvp or pve server larry? Azshara be god, not many quests, but some good hunting, the undeads near windrider, the 44-48? blue hippos, and mid to high 40's timbermaws.<br />
<br />
Felwood be good, I believe the SW section has high 40's evil timbermaws and critters.<br />
<br />
Higher level ogres in Feralas still good, and the western portion has yeti caves be good.<br />
<br />
Think that is about all I did.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And what I gave him is actually help.<br />

...[SNIP]...<br />
<br />
If you don't know where to go, you haven't been doing your quests.Ok, that was a good explanation, and I'll give ya props for it. http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/images/icons/icon14.gif <br />
<br />
BUT...not everyone likes to do quests. Don't ask me why because I don't understand it myself. I personally LOVE questing over outright grinding, but he was just asking for advice on where to go for appropriate level encounters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My problem is that my quest log is full and I feel torn in too many directions sometimes.  It's a nice problem to have.  <br />
<br />
So many places to go that provide content, and the quests do steer you toward areas you otherwise would not know about and at a time when you are the right level to be there.  <br />
<br />
I love this design.  <br />
<br />
Since getting the mount at level 43, I've been really enjoying this design even more.  <br />
<br />
And I've realized that even though I am a quest hound, I've missed some, and so I backtrack a bit for them.  <br />
<br />
I've never looked for an area to hunt in because I am always guided there by quests.  <br />
<br />
That said, Thistleshrub Valley in Tanaris has a lot of 48-50 mobs that seem pretty easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">49 Shaman tank speced with a 49 druid 2box heal/newk speced... the problem is that because I 2 box most areas that I go to that are for my level are trivial.<br />
<br />
I did yeti cave at 46 to 47.5 then moved to the orge camps in southern Tanaris and now they give about half the exp they did since im 49... The thistelthorn vale area sounds good and I still have 2 quest for down there.<br />
<br />
As for Im not doing my quests....I like the quests that are grouped in a small area... not running all over the place for 2k exp.... Like one time I came here someone suggested doing Simmering flats.... that was a exceptional idea and was great for me cause of the high exp/low travel time of the 6 or so quests right there by the race track area....<br />
<br />
That is a example of what Im looking for... Ive heard horror stories about Felwood and all the caster adds and big arrgo ranges... and Ungro is supposed to be so boring and ugly you can go crazy in a couple hours...<br />
<br />
Im not sure as to where to go THAT is why I came here to ask... Ive never had to deal with someone being a smart ass about a valid question Ive had....  until now. Thank you to those of you that actually have constructive ideas... your much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What level critters wanna fight? With a shammy, pulling casters is no problem, lots of stuff in felwood, evil timbermaws and satyrs be good as well as animals.<br />
<br />
The yeti caves in western ferales, I believe, are around level 49?<br />
<br />
Pve or pvp changes things as well, alot of areas I talk about are because of low gank factor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">There are a bunch of quests from various areas like feralas and UC that will lead you to felwood. From there  you can get a few more quests at the bloodvenom village that will move you up to moonglade/winterspring areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>LARRY</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Pve</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh and at 50 you start getting quests for the argent dawn in the plaguelands</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Blasted lands has a few quests where you kill masses of 48-52 stuff and turn in random parts you get off the things you kill.  When you hit 50 you get the quest for a 5hp/mana regen trinket, but you have to kill level 57 things, so you'll probably be unable to complete it until around 52-53.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A lot of Horde players run out of quests in their late 40's unless they farm Zul or Mauradon to death or if they play rested most of the time. <br />
<br />
A bunch of quests open up at 50-3, where there are a lot of things to do open up in Ungoro, Azhara, Felwood, Western Plaguelands, Winterspring etc.<br />
<br />
I think I just ground through 49 at the ogre camp in Tanaris.  Fast xp, and I lucked out with 2 Widowmaker drops for cash :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm in about the exact same spot.  The raptors to the west of the initial path in Un'goro are good experience, plus I have like 6 quests in that zone to do.<br />
<br />
I really liked the Thistleshrub Valley in south Tanaris.  Wide, slow moving mobs, melee type, sort of in an out of the way place.  Plus, I had some quests there.<br />
<br />
I have linked quests to Hinterlands, but I went there once in my low 40's for a quest -- no Horde outpost, and lots of alliance = an annoying zone.  I'm hesitant to go back to Hinterlands.<br />
<br />
I have to check out Searing Gorge and Felwood yet.<br />
<br />
Mauradon/Sunken for instances?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Un'Goro is a lot like Stranglethorn Vale, it has so many quests you will get tired of the zone.  At 50 if you walk up into the outpost on the north side, you will see a veritable forest of &quot;!&quot; npcs.  I assume these are for both factions, so it might be a nasty place on a PVP server.  I see horde people in there regularly. You can easily go from 49-55 in that zone if you like.  Western Plaguelands is okay, if a little annoying to navigate through.  The horde quest outpost there is more conveniently located than the alliance one.  <br />
<br />
Searing Gorge probably would have been cool, but I first set foot in it at 53, and all the mobs are mid to high 40's.   <br />
<br />
If you have a regular group, proceed to Maraudon immediately, farm, rinse, repeat.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for 52-56 mobs since you 2 box, Burning Steppes, Winterspring, Eastern Plaguelands are all good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You bastard! I had to buy mine. Now if only I could find a gutwrencher. *edit* shadowblade.</div></div><hr />
