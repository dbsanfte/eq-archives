<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We tried this quest twice last night.  I was wondering if anyone has had similiar problems.<br />
<br />
Try #1, smallest container (shotglass?)<br />
<br />
60 Enchanter<br />
60 Monk<br />
58 Druid<br />
57 Paladin<br />
55 Ranger<br />
55 Rogue<br />
55 Shaman<br />
52 SK<br />
40sih Rogue<br />
40 Cleric<br />
<br />
We think its going to be no problem---wrong!  There was no break between waves of mobs AT ALL.  We had 2 named mobs in the camp at the same time and up to 9 mobs at once.  We just couldn't kill them fast enough and finally had a TPW when the druid and the cleric went down.<br />
<br />
Try #2, smallest container<br />
<br />
Same as above, +58 wizzy, 54 SK, and 60 cleric (we were gunshy).<br />
<br />
Incredibly boring, mobs spawned so slow we started using the caller for weapons skillups.  0 named popped and we finally quit out of boredom.  Anyone else have a similiar experience?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Elladan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Having done this a few times (smallest encounter only), let me pass along what little I know.<br />
<br />
Did this the other day with a 58-59 Rogue, 60 Druid, 56-58 Cleric, 60 Enc, 55 Warrior, 55 Ranger.  We went through 3 waves before we left (it was late, I had to work ...)  Our only problem was one of the named (Karchta?) did a CH, and so we fell a little behind at one point.  We were killing the big ones first, then going after the little ones afterwards.  The smaller ones hit faster, but have, by far, fewer HPs than the big ones.  The named ones all seem to be Cleric MoBs, you need to be ready to stun them when they get low.<br />
<br />
Now we had tried this before when we were all mid-low 50s, and were able to get through one wave, then had to succor/die durring the second wave (the tribes men will kill them IF you can make it up to camp.  Hard to do when you are snared from their procs though).  We also recruited a Bard, Shaman, and a Mage at one point, but it was really disjointed, and we all ended up dead half way through the first wave.<br />
<br />
It does seem to be rather variable as to how well you do though.  Our first time through, we were just rockin' the joint, though we had to succor during the second wave.  Went back and whipped in the first wave.  It really depends on what you get (a bunch of little guys is easier than a bunch of bigger guys.  Healers hurt as well), and crowd control.  If your enchanter drops, you are in trouble.<br />
<br />
What we got for our troubles the other day were 2 Tiny Cloaks of Midnight Shadow (Rog, Brd, Ammo slot, 1.5 sec self only Invis), and a Fungus Encrusted Hammer (10/21, 2 Disease, 3.3 weight).  Loot wise, don't bother with the normal scales (7g each), but there are some that have Fungal Infusion and such (these ones are no rent, however).  The eyes go for 9p each (stack), and the brains ... 23p each (stack).  So, if you can get a decent group together that can do these, you can get some decent cash out of it as well as some good xp.  Don't know how much I got in 3 waves (too busy trying to kill it all to look), but even the 58-59 Rogue thought it was good xp.  <br />
