<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im only 20% into 58 and i play wierd hours, usually only for about 45min to an hour. any solo spots that people have used would be nice... ive been thinking maybe some deeper poj spots.<br />
<br />
im on a pvp server and im purist dark so take that into consideration...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What does &quot;1/176 pure-teamers remaining on Vallon-Zek server&quot; mean ...?<br />
<br />
Lvl 58 ... hrmm Akheva?  I can do this at 55 pretty easy ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in same boat as you, no loy or ldon. I have been almost exclusively in HoH the last few levels, but I doubt you have access to that (the benefit of a server where keys are tradeable hehe). I have also spent some time in PoV, doing the razors mostly, not too much trouble slowing. Did the golems once, they were a bit harder to slow, but we didn't even have a cleric, we had a 2nd shaman healing, and we did just fine. Tried PoS twice, both times were immediately disastrous so I don't see myself going back there anytime soon lol. From my recent experience, the xp in tier 1 planes is just not that good, at least in full groups, so you're going to have to go tier 2, I'd say PoV. Or, you could solo or duo in PoD or PoN. I have solod in both places, PoD was a bit harder, but xp was also a little better. My magelo is probably off btw, I am 59 now, so just about the same level as you.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Sorry, it's early for me, didn't read your post about soloing mainly lol....so then, I'd say PoD or PoN, but grab kei and virtue if you can, it'll be a big help for downtime in between pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye ive checked out pos already but its hard to get a group there... most of my guild is permacamping hob.<br />
<br />
and for phatcow: my sig means theres only around 200 people left on vallon zek who stick to the server ruleset. 99.99% of VZ is xteam now... /rude programmers for not hardcoding the server</div></div><hr />
