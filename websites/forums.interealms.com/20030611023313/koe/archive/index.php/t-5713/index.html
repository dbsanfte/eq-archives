Found off of random outcasts and merchants in Echo Caverns.  I've never seen one from the hunting I did there.  If anyone comes across this please hold it for Grinric.  I'd be happy to donate 250pp as a reward for turning it over to Grin.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the cheapest thing for Grin to make to raise skill over the 200 requires Porous Mineral Blocks.  I have no idea where it drops but it allows him to work on his skill at only 3pp per attempt.  Most of the other recipies are 30pp+.  Many of the luclin items that increase skill 5% in other trade skills run around 30pp in cost and require an item that must be farmed off of a mob.<br />
Other items are :Chitterling Barb , Small piece of acrylia, Darkclaw claw, Belt of Leathery Fungus Flesh, Sensate Reishi Lens.<br />
<br />
The items made from these items trivial at 215 but are much cheaper recipies than the Velious and other recipies.  Please keep an eye out for these.<br />
<br />
BTW Grin, what's your skill at now?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boogahz Dokupuppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only had this drop once in about 50 kills of Dack Ticktopper in the Outcast Tunnel in Echo Caverns.  His common drop was a Deluxe (10 slot) Toolbox.  I almost didn't notice that I had the tools drop because they have the same graphic as the  toolbox had.  I think the only way I noticed was that I tried to put it in the bank to take the place of my last 8 slot pack and I could not open it. :p</div></div><hr />
