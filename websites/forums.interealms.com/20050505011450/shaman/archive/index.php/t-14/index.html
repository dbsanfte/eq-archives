<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While I am thinking about it and while the posts are small I thought I should post this which should actually be made a sticky (hint hint) heh<br />
<br />
We have a room up and running on irc.stratics.com called #crucible of all things.  You can go to http://chat.stratics.com/ which has a web java client but that seems to be rather buggy so I wouldnt recommend it.<br />
<br />
Go to http://www.mirc.com and use that as the client and if your not familliar with this form of chat I believe that they have some Introduction/Get to know sections on that website.  Enjoy there is a few regulars there during the day and some at nitetime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Any chance we can get this made sticky?  Alot of stuff can be discussed in IRC that can't be done that well on the boards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">*cough* BUMP!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maaxx Mhegamojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya'll come down and visit ya'hear! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Trying to keep up with irc chat as well as all the extra channels is a challenge</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd be there all the time, but refuse to use stratics. If you ever look to change servers, consider enterthegame. Lots of everquest guilds have rooms there.</div></div><hr />
