<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What's the fastest way to get Yelinak faction? Obviously killing Tormax but he's a 7 day spawn. Anything else? I know some of his guards give Yeli faction but how much? Are they worth killing? Any help is appreciated. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Turning in Giant Warrior Helms and Frost/Storm Giant Toes is the easiest way to up your faction.  Turning in SS quest armor also raises your faction.  So if you happen to be farming HoT for the Doze quests, you can just turn in all the armor you get for faction.  Worked pretty well for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I turned in a bajillion helms and toes and am still scowling.  I gave it up.  One of these days I'll get around to mooching faction from a Tormax raid and see where that gets me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Took me 3 tormax's, 4 vindi-AoW cycles, and several days of helping lowbie guilds out in the arena in trade for faction to get up to a good enough faction to talk to Yeli. <br />
<br />
Even after all that, I still had to turn in roughly 70 helms and over 100 toes to get enough to quest the boots/helm from Tormax head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">don't think vindi/AOW cycle gives any yelinak faction. <br />
<br />
Your best bet is definately grabbing faction hits from raids killing tormax, I think 6 kills from max scowling to max ally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hate factioning, not sure when I'll ever get my dain belt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">don't think vindi/AOW cycle gives any yelinak faction. <br />
<br />
<br />
Very true. However, you will need to be positive with CoV as well to even get to Yeli unless you have a mage friend who will do the running for you, plus it's the easiest way to collect helms and toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Leaching faction off of Tormax raids is the easist way to go, but it can take as many as 7 of those hits to reach ally with Yelinak. On the plus side, you should also be ally with Dain as well. But you might still be KoS with the dorfs at that point.</div></div><hr />
