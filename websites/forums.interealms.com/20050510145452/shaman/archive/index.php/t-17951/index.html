<br />
This is what is making its round amongst the EQ support boards.<br />
<br />
(Sorry I don't know who the original author is, but well done!)<br />
<br />
HOW PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT OTHER CLASSES<br />
----------------------------------------- <br />
<br />
Bard - Those that chat with you arent doing their job. Those that don't are antisocial jerks. <br />
<br />
Beastlord - I'm bored with EQ. I'm gonna make a kitty. I'm gonna be the first kitty on my block to level 60. I'm a twink. No, I'm a super-twink! Wait, what am I good at? <br />
<br />
Cleric - Second biggest egos in-game. See enchanter. Every cleric thinks that all other clerics suck. I just rezzed you with my click-stick, give me 200 plat. <br />
<br />
Druid - Interesting class. One with many idiots. Enough said. <br />
<br />
Enchanter - Biggest egos in-game. No one but them knows how to play. Break a mez, they throw tantrums. Ask them for haste, they throw tantrums. Pull singles, they get bored and throw tantrums. Pull too many, they get nervous and throw tantrums. Breathe funny, they throw tantrums. <br />
<br />
Mage - Biggest whiners in game. &quot;I want my pet when can I make a pet why can't I have a pet I'm naked without my pet where's my pet I cant think without my pet how could I possibly do anything besides love and heal and hug my pet I can control my pet if I don't get my pet I'm leaving. Oops? Where's my pet? What's that, a train? Oops, did I wipe the raid?&quot; <br />
<br />
Monk - Pissed off that rogues out-damage them. Pissed off that warriors out-tank them. Humans are pissed off that Iksar get regen. Iksar are pissed off that humans are pissed off. Pissed off that some skills don't work better. Pissed off that their planar and quest gear sucks. Pissed off that other classes even think for a moment that someone other than a monk might be better at *anything*. <br />
<br />
Necromancer - Antisocial misanthropes. Players are perfectly matched to their class. Hate everyone, solo everywhere. Third biggest egos in game. Solo anything anywhere with my own stuff because I looted this myself and I can solo better than you could ever dream of attempting. My mana regen is your wet-dream. What are these &quot;buffs&quot;, I have my own! Usually end up frustrated and angry at 65, start twinks. <br />
<br />
Paladin - The self-haters of EQ. Perpetually whining that they can't get groups, that they got the shaft from Verant, that everyone thinks they suck, that their epic sucks, that their spells suck, that their damage output sucks. <br />
<br />
Rangers - The wannabe's of EQ. They try to out-tank the tank, out-pull the monk, out-snare the druid, out-damage the rogue. Take great joy in taunting the mobs off the tank. Take great joy in pulling behind the monk's back. Hang back and shoot arrows while everyone else is doing real damage until they're lvl 60+45 or so. Then wizards and rogues glare at them.. <br />
<br />
Rogue - I wanna tank. I wanna pull. I wanna be everyone's favorite twink class. WooT Check out my backstab! WooT I did it again!! Cool! I am Ub3R! Rogues R0xx0Rz!!!!! <br />
<br />
Shadowknight - Think they can pull better than a monk. Think they can tank better than a warrior. Think they can solo better than a necro. Think they can CR better than anyone. Think, of course. <br />
<br />
Shaman - Here are 8 million buffs that you don't need. I'm gonna annoy you by canning for half an hour right next to your ear. d**n, that mob resisted my slow. Ouch, that mob is beating on me. Whoa, that mob is pingponging all over the raid. Oops the clerics are dead. Oops the druids are dead. Oops the wizzies are dead. Oops the melee are dead. Oops, did I cast too soon? d**n, that never happens when I solo. <br />
<br />
Warrior - Buff me. Haste me. Heal me. Now leave me alone. Wait, heal me again. I am better than you. What? I lost aggro? Your fault. What? Chanter died after mez break? Chanter's fault. Whoops, heal me. Monks? Rogues? Useless, we don't need them. Pally's? Rangers? Useless, we don't need them. Necro's? Druids? What're dey for? Eh? <br />
<br />
Wizard - MORE POWER!! Give me more power!!! I want bigger nukes! I want more mana!! Soup me up! Give me supercharging, nitrous, ether, amphetamines, speedballs, nitromethane, alcohol, turbocharging, rocket assist, MORE POWER!!!</div></div><hr />
