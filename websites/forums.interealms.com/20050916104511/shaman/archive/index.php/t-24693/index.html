[EDIT]<br />
NOTE: The link above no longer works. Blizz finally caught on and removed/renamed/moved the file. Leaving the link for the sake of posterity. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks man, Hope this works : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laguna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you have a horribly slow download rate from this?  Like say 20 hours of dowloading?  I have cinfigured my reuter and firewall the way Blizzard has suggested with no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ONLY 20 hours? Heh...from work it's telling me &quot;1 day, 15 hours&quot;. LOL<br />
<br />
Not sure what I'll get from home, but 20 hours was about right for the first Stress Test client back in early September.<br />
<br />
Remember...you're trying to download 2.5 GIGABYTES. Bittorrent works best when a lot of people are downloading, which may not be the case yet. Your speeds may increase as more people begin to grab the client.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anyone got this downloaded? It's probably useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's been confirmed by Blizzard that this is, indeed, the client for the next phase of beta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Valgoth, is this the stress test client, or open beta though?<br />
<br />
Only took me 3 and a half hours fo the first stress test, 1 day 8 hours on this one.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for goddamn fileplanet too.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />

It is. after this &quot;stress test&quot; there will be a patch and then open beta</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">100 meg downloaded out of 2.6 gig? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Finally got my fileplanet info. Their downloader is MUCH faster. I killed the Blizzard BT client download after and hour and only 57mb. After 15 minutes on the FP downloader I'm at 100mb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I hate you fileplanet, I hate you so much.<br />
<br />
Threw me a server error during the registration process, so now I'm in customer support limbo.  Yay.   I just want to set someone on fire right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here is an alternate torrent for those not wanting to use Blizzard's. I'm currently getting about 100K down from it. I can't vouch for the authenticity, but it was from the same person that posted the last working client download for the Closed Beta.</div></div><hr />

Where?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you have to start the dowload over again or did it add to what you already had?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been waiting for my auth info from fileplanet for about 5 hours now. nothing.<br />
<br />
I'm pissed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I get a 404 error. (Not found)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>MrWoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">yep I went with fp to still havent got e-mail, I wont use them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Patience folks. Patience. It took 1.5 hours after I subscribed to FP to actually be able to fill out the Stress Test application. It then took another 2 hours before I got the email with my account key.<br />
<br />
It took THREE hours for my wifes subscription to register so she could fill out the form and another FIVE hours after that to get the email with the account key.<br />
<br />
The processes behind the signups are working, just slowly. They (both Blizz and FP) have publicly acknowledged the overwhelming response has brought their registration/email/account creation processes, literally, to its knee's.<br />
<br />
You'll get through this. Trust me. You will. Be strong, and have patience. :)</div></div><hr />

Here's hoping &quot;overwhelming&quot; means tens of thousands, not just a few thousand!  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I waaaaaaant it.  I want it nooooooowwwwwww!  *grin*<br />
<br />
I never got the mail from fileplanet verifying my subscription, but was able to sign up for the beta finally this morning.  Now to find something to distract me till my key gets here.  *tap tap tap*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Meglo Maeneac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I signed up as well..<br />
<br />
After 5 minutes of the authenticating sceen I said &quot;forget this&quot; and gave it the three finger salute.<br />
<br />
When I went back to www.fileplanet.com, I clicked on login and it let me log-in / fill out the app just fine...</div></div><hr />
