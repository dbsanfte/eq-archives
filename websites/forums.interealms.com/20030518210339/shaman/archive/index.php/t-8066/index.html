<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>swampbutt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I am a 54th lev Troll Shaman on Povar who is working on the Epic. Did the spirit on Rathe Mountains and the Drunk in Freeport months ago. A little while later I did the tests of Patience and of Wisdom and spoke to the next spirit. I just went and did the test of Might and got boots. I then went and got the City of Mist reports and turned them in. I also grabbed the High Scale Icon on advise of another Shaman I was hunting with for the pages for later use (if indeed I do need it) I hit a bit of a stall because I didn't know too much about going about getting a group together for Ghiosk and figgured I would wait till I got word of a group going there. <br />
I was in the Hole the other day as part of a group helping out a Ranger finish up his epic. Once we were done there someone mentioned that some other Epic's involved that place and we might work on them while we were there. including the shaman quest. I hadn't read up that far in advance and didn't know evactly what to do and who to do it to, so I passed. One of the people on the raid told me that he skipped that part of the quest and several others just by doing the test of Wisdom over and over for the faction boosts when he got the Spear for his Shaman.<br />
So I spent the next few days farming woe and envy and the shield. Did the turn in about another ten or twelve times and finally got that magic message saying my faction could not get any better.<br />
The question is exactly where can I skip to? Can I skip Ghiosk? Can I skip Kirn? Can I skip Neh'Ashiir? Do I need to turn in the Idol at all?<br />
Or can I go right to Fear and get the scale, turn it into Rak, get the scale and turn it in for my Spear?<br />
Thanks in advance for the advise folks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it is that easy, but a lot of people consider it cheating.<br />
<br />
Really, do the Hole - it's a fun zone to raid, and there's a great feeling of satisfaction in getting the job done.<br />
<br />
But if you prefer mindless farming to doing the quest the way it was intended, you can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know of 2 people that did this. One got her epic and one did not.<br />
<br />
The guy that did not get epic did this after PoP came out, so take it as you will, but I do know they changed the way faction works with some quests now.<br />
<br />
Do it the way it was intended and everything will work fine. Try a shortcut, who knows? <br />
<br />
But if you get a group together to take out Rak and they find out he doesn't drop scale because you tried to shortcut.... good luck getting those people together again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you had the force to do the hole before, I'd do it again. If you loose your tear, no GM will replace it.<br />
<br />
I did my whole quest the right way and was glad I had the friends and guildmates to do so... it does make things a little less buggy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">if you did woe/envy till your maxed ally all you should have todo now is go to fear kill either fright or terror and get your tear from the child iskar. lvl 1 iskar broodling i think is the name she will spawn right where the golem dies, NO tear drops from dread just fright /terror then just need to go and spawn lord rak and hand him the tear <br />
<br />
ryoz:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>joebooracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya can go straight to the end..a shaman with epic must hand the tear in(not you),you loot the scale and give to the spirit for epic..but saying that..its a very soft option,and by reading some of your previous posts,i could see you doing it..dip****</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its your choice whether you short-cut it or not.<br />
<br />
I took the short-cut because I didn't want to bother my friends and drag them down to The Hole :)<br />
<br />
There wasn't the same sense of being a filthy, dirty cheater that I had when I used the Z-axis exploit for getting my rogues epic note pick-pocketed in Neriak. <br />
/grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I took the &quot;cheaters&quot; route if you wanna call it that.  Did everything through Lord Ghiosk, then started the faction work.  Did Lord Ghiosk again (he always seems to pop when we're trying for reavers for our druids/rangers), did the shield/envy/woe turn in about 5 times and I was max ally.  Got my tear, brought 20 or so of my closest friends to CoM, offed Rak using the fire pet trick, got my scale, did the last turnin and got my spear.<br />
<br />
On another note, I really don't see this as cheating, as it was VI who decided to make this entire quest based on faction.  Just because you take a different route to max ally faction doesn't mean you're a cheater, it just means that you care about your friends enough not to make them go with you on a 3 hour trek through the hole.  If VI didn't want this to be a pure faction quest, they should've required you to kill each mob on the way by getting a turnin that you actually need to do to progress.<br />

I did the faction trick, because honestly, it's not always a happy joyful fulfilling experience you all make it out to be, and leaves ya feeling like crap if you fail, but makes you much more powerful if you succeed,  by any means necessary (Aside from decieving actual PCs, I don't care if I lie to an NPC) =p<br />
<br />
I'm guessing your methods depend on your personality and game style.  In the end, it's no big deal, and by the time you read over the wakthrough a few times, you've soaked up the semi-absorbing storyline ;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
that the reason many &quot;cheat&quot;  because 90% of players dont like going on a hole raid-  it a real waste of players time.  Verant include it in epics just to waste OUR time.  So u want me to feel guilty about using a short cut.   get real .  i have no misconsceptions about the time consuming devices verant uses in the game to leech more money from us.<br />
<br />
I like the story line of our epic, just not the time sink that goes with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Listen,<br />
<br />
The other night we did Kirn with super overkill. . 3 groups of 53+.<br />
<br />
Make a lev 1 haffer rogue, bind in Paineel, go into Hole and advance to Yael/Nortlav area. . .If Yael and Nortlav aren't up do what we did.<br />
<br />
Have a Divine Aura group Paladins, Clerics, Necros, SK's (and anyone with the shiny brass idol) cast and jump into the Hole from Paineel.  They proceed to take out the 4 or so MOBs in the Pit and then the rest of the raid jumps into the Hole and gets ressed at bottom.<br />
<br />
It's only a 1% XP loss with the 96% res and we were standing in front of Kirn in 15 mins. . .<br />
<br />
Heck! It took longer to assemble the raid than to complete it.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hole is a fun single group get inside and slap around some poor mobs event nowadays.<br />
<br />
Most people that hate it have done it so long ago that they needed multiple groups or have never done it and are exaggerating from stories they have heard! :)<br />
<br />
The key is fast movement so you dont get caught in the respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Or... y'know... not ;).<br />
<br />
I'd rather have my guildies raiding HoT and Nameds than drag them to the Hole for my epic piece.. no one really likes the hole from what I hear.  I sorta thought of it as a courtesy; my 'cheating'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">A courtesy to whom, exactly?  The enchanters in your guild who have to hit Kindle in the room right next to Kirn?  Enchanters can't skip or chain any part of their epic, they have to go kill Kindle.  If it's &quot;too hard&quot; for your guild to get Kirn for you, sounds like all your guild enchanters will be SOL for their epic.<br />
<br />
Of course, you could combine some epic work on a hole trip.  Do Kirn, Kindle, the wretched guy for the ranger epic, not to mention the Scale keeper for red scales for bard/warrior epic.  Paladins and SKs need epic bits from the hole as well.  Lots of people would probably appreciate killing Yael for the rare quest bit to the Strength of the Elements quest.<br />
<br />
If your excuse is &quot;oh, I can't possibly go to the Hole because it would inconvenience MY GUILD&quot; that's pretty lame.  I'm sure you have plenty of guildmembers who need something from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have argued on many 'cheating' epic post, along side Gloriana. I dont think we'll ever make anyone who truly believes that what they do in their EPIC adventure to obtain the spear in any other way than how VI INTENDED it to be done, realize that yes...they cheated...period. Oh well though, to each his own....its human nature to justify something a person knows to be wrong...wouldn't be any reason to justify it over and over again if it were not. I think all the 'we were just clever' shaman should ban together on the big Spell petition to VI and just request that each shaman spawn into their EQ guildhouse at level 1 with their epic in hand...after all....they paid their 12$ and deserve it just as much as that magician who...wait...err...never mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Oh yea?!?!  <br />
<br />
Oh... okay... rather than trying to reason myself with you guys, I'm going to say this.<br />
<br />
My thinking...<br />
<br />
&quot;Gawd it'd be awesome if I got my epic, free 1k dmg, tons of stats and resists, and good ratio&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Bleh... The average Hole raid for just shammy epic takes 3 hours?  That's going to suck, going to be hard to set up a time where we can raid and I can be there too... (Hard to play during day times, too much lag/LDs)&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm... Shortcut?   Wonder if it still works...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Ahh.. kewl, didn't know all we needed was faction, and I can farm any time during the day and head straight to the good stuff!  Besides... guild would rather have epic shammy in one raid than 2-3... And my druid and ranger buds really need Jade Reavers...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Storyline?  Nah... I got that when I memorized the Wakthrough... Sense of accomplishment?  No thanks, I just want it ASAP so I can get leveling with my new clicky DoT quicker&quot;<br />
<br />
I feel bad that I sullied my reputation here, but I guess I was to honest and happy for myself that I found a quicker way to get epic.  I don't see anything really wrong with it, if it was something real, then I could see the point, but it's a collection of data that's dished out by a system that feeds Shamen their epics through Faction + Turn in checks.<br />
<br />
It sucks that Gloriana doesn't like me now, I really like the sig ;)<br />
<br />
And Evel... Chill woman!  You're over-doing it, This is not a &quot;I'm a god person for not cheating&quot; Vs. &quot;Stupid n00b that whines about everything&quot; discusion.  Believe it or not I'm mature when I need to be ;)... and *gasp* I've not met a person on EQ that has told me that they hate me or think I'm not worthy of my Shaman.<br />
<br />
I saw some real logic in Gloriana's post, and enlightened me to the Chanter and SK epic bits in The Hole that I didn't know about... she gave me facts, and now see that it would be a good idea to raid Hole if there are any classes that need epic bits from there.  Heck, she was even nice enough to tell me WHAT to do at the Hole raid :D.  Evel... your post made me feel as if you wanted to stereotype me as an elitist snobby brat =/.  That last sentance was totally unnecessary and seen by me as an insult to any Shaman that got their epic by skipping Kirn and possibly Neh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sorry bro...to have made you feel that way...if you had some insight to the multiple posts I engaged in with...forgot his name...about exactly what -defined- cheating...you'd understand my reply. Im glad for anyone to get what they want in this game and in this world...but Im also one that feels like you should call something for what it is...not justify and sugar coat. Im not trying to be holier than thou...or anything of the sort...I have just seen sooooo many reasons and justifications that try to steer the 'faction skip' method away from what it is...an exploit...that I always feel compelled to try to have the poster at least admit that, exploiting, whether its a bannable exploit or not...is exactly what they are doing. Trust me my friend, if you've read as my post on this subject as I youd understand where I get the idea the allot of shaman feel they are somehow 'owed' their epic upon creation.<br />

<br />
Rather than steer it away as an exploit, I know that it fits the description of one perfectly, and I'm not going to say &quot;We deserve it&quot; or &quot;It's Verant's fault&quot;.  <br />
<br />
It's an exploit that I'm using so I can get to duoing with Druids in PoN with my Epic as fast as I can ;).  Also, another thing to understand, I'm the 2nd oldest (16) of a family of 2 parents, 9 kids, with 4 of those children being incapable to fend for themselves, I find my self extremely busy during the day and find it hard to attend raids, so if there's any way to avoid one and still reap the reward, I'm all for it.  And before saying that I should drop EQ and focus on home issues, I've been the only person to disregard suicide in the current line-up of my family due to the family that I have in EQ, and the more power I have in EQ, the more power I have to help the only people I feel that care about me (save a few friends and my older bro).<br />

Im speechless truly...its so easy to misread into someone's words in an anonymous setting such as a message board. Knowing what I now know about your personal life, my thoughts go out to you my friend...take care of yourself in RL first and foremost...and in EQ don't let any of my convictions or anyone else's bring you down....no one is going to get banned for faction skipping the epic so in VI's eyes its passable, thus...my opinion or not...totally up to the player. <br />

<br />
Yeah I thought so ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I LOVE raiding the Hole.  I started soloing there in the few weeks leading up to my epic Hole raid (which I led) to get used to it, and had a blast.  I even got an IGS out of the soloing.<br />
<br />
We didn't get to Kirn on that raid, but we did get the ranger epic bit for three or four rangers on the way in.  I got Kirn on about my fifth Hole raid, and have since led many many Hole raids for other people.<br />
<br />
It is a fast moving, exciting raid.  You kill and move on fast or you get swamped by respawns.  It really is an excellent raiding zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I play a 44 shaman on FV (name's Klatcrane if you want to say hello). I've gathered a lot of pieces for my epic (almost all that is needed to be farmed) and I plan to get it the normal way at level 51 (well, I plan to stay leel 51 for long, can't wait till AA's). Of course, I will have my guildmates (in no way an uber guild, we're 37 in it, and average level must be 40, or something like that) and friends (I hope so as some of them are really uber for FV standards) to help me. But man, I just can't imagine how proud I will be to have it done the normal way (I was already really proud to have my Cani 2 done at level 39, with a little help on the yun powder, not for the tracking aspect as Yun shaman were really easy to find each time I went there, but man I died almost 10 times due to adds, so some friends came help me pull these buggers without adds). <br />
In fact, as I don't plan to be &quot;uberized&quot; anytime soon, I want the epic as I know it will be really usefull to allow me to go hunt where I want more easily (I don't know, but I'm sure the Spear can get rid of all these greenies add you can have during a fight) and I really like this kind of challenges.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">...hmmm here's another thought........<br />
<br />
You could 'finish' the Internet hahah...read -every- walk through ever created....and thats still not going to affect whether or not you can compile a competent group and kill Kirn, Rak, ect...<br />
<br />
<br />
People generally don't stumble upon the answers in EQ or life in general. Id say 99.9% of -everything- you or I have learned in life has been taught to you by someone else...who taught them...who taught them.... ;)<br />
<br />
Take the top guilds for example.....I guarantee you that the leaders and key people in those guilds share info with each other...that trickles down from people &quot;in the know&quot;. I would venture to say that quite a bit of what they know and what info they have was taken from said info trickling down the &quot;In the know&quot; pipeline. Note..I am -not- saying that everything they learn is from inside info...but allot is and if you think differently...your fooling yourself.<br />
<br />
Of course, as my example has already said, you could give every bit of inside EQ info to a group...and its -still- going to come down to their skills whether they make or break. In my opinion the hardest 'skill' in EQ to develop is team work. The top guilds in EQ got to where they are at through that one simple fact...they work exceptionally well as a team and as individuals.<br />
<br />
<br />
I guess my point is that the walkthrough argument is the weakest point in the debate....just my opinion :)</div></div><hr />

Is it just me, or is this Okotona person just begging and pleading for someone... ANYONE to pay attention to her/him?  Get some friends, take a weekend away from the game.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Like, I don't care if you don't like me because like I did it my way.  Like OMG check me out, I thought of new trikc!1!!  Like look at me some more and read what I have to say because it is super extra witty!  LOOK AT ME PLEASE!!1!&quot;<br />
<br />
If you didn't care what people think, you wouldn't continue posting over and over and over on the subject trying to defend your position.  So you faction skipped the epic? So did like 40% of the other epic'd shaman in EQ... you didn't find a new trick.<br />
<br />
I've been the only person to disregard suicide in the current line-up of my family due to the family that I have in EQ, and the more power I have in EQ, the more power I have to help the only people I feel that care about me (save a few friends and my older bro).  <br />
<br />
Your family cares about you above all else.  Realize that people in this game treat you like a chat room partner.  You are good to talk to when you are there, and you help them get &quot;phat lewts&quot; that they want by participating on raids, but the MAJORITY (not all) of people that you meet in this game, you will never see face to face in real life.  When this game is over you will go your seperate ways and when the dusts settles it is your real life friends and family that remain.  If you have serious issues with thoughts of suicide or you feel that someone in your family does, it is your responsibility to do something about it.  A video game will not fix it.  You relative power in Everquest has absolutely zero effect on your &quot;power&quot; in your real adult life.  You could have a full set of elemental armor, and VT loot in every other slot and you can still be a hopeless human being with no job, friends, or self-respect when you are not logged on.<br />

So then lets take a poll.  All those who did the Hole but had another shaman MQ the tear raise your hands.<br />
<br />
Yeah I thought so ... <br />
<br />
/raises hand</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Just trying to illustrate my point about people &quot;cheating&quot; to get the shaman epic.  As in, why even do the Hole at all if you're just going to get someone to MQ the tear for you anyway?  It's ok to skip Fear but not the Hole?  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">You can solo the reports depending on your gear, level and playing ability.<br />
<br />
I just finished doing the reports again solo on my second shaman.<br />
<br />
I did have a friend sometimes to ease the boredom of the specteral courier....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Slym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Level 49 Shaman<br />
<br />
Have Boots and have done the RM/WK quest about 6 times. I didn't turn in the gem because going to EJ is a pain. <br />
<br />
1) I finally did go there and con ally to the dog in the forrest. Should I continue faction until it says 'cant get any better&quot;? Or fo to the one in the lake and see if he answers me with the final quest?<br />
<br />
I will be doing it MQ....a friend with a 56 Shaman has a tear and has done the Ikon...still has the ring.... but hasnt played in 6 months and says he wont ever play again. <br />
<br />
His faction should be ok if we go to COM, turn in ring, loot book and turn it in...then turn in tear. Make the kill and Slym loots the final scale. (perhaps I shopuld play his Shaman on the Shield quest to max ally too and simply skip the ring turn in for him too?) <br />
<br />
2) You see, Slym is an alt for me. My main is a Cleric that the Guild cant seem to get along without.  (but we all know that the Shammie is far more fun to play!  :) )  Luckly we have lots of Members...most of them want their epics...including the Shamans. So even tho it would be easy, I don't think I can rightly ask even for 12 Members to go to the Hole for me....there are so many mains ahead of me. <br />
<br />
I see this as a single chance to do it without a lot of hassle for my Guild Members. (I'm sure they would do it for me but there are really so many other nice deserving Main characters who are more valuable to the Guild than a 49 alt.....  they always get the tear or we go to Fear and get a Chanter or Wizard piece and leave...no tear.)<br />
<br />
However...we do Reavers  for the fun of it... and if I'm there, they will also take out final Shaman mobs. <br />
<br />
3) I'm almost to level 50, is there any level restriction on getting the Spear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Our Spear of Fate or any other classes 'epic' is what each individual wants to make it......to some getting it as fast as possible is their thing, grats do what you gotta do to make that happen.....to some they relish doing the EPIC QUEST which is exactly what it says, a long quest requiring a number of subquest and killing some challenging mobs in order to achieve the end results.<br />
<br />
<br />
Neither point if view is wrong or right.<br />
<br />
It's your $'s you pay every month and your right to do things as you wish.<br />
<br />
The Spear of Fate was trivialized long ago when uberguildxxxx thought it would be amusing to provide a lvl 12? ( might have been younger)  twink shaman with an epic, just to 'rub it in' how easy it was to obtain.<br />
<br />
How is it possible to 'cheat' in this environment? Who are you cheating?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>tangurena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">The only reason I would loot another tear is to MQ it for someone: I know some who wiped out on the final battle (/rude bard song aggro). Lord knows how anyone could manage to sucker me back into Plane of Fear at any price though.<br />
<br />
The bit about getting your epic reimbursed when you transfer servers got stopped. I suspect the only possible way you could get one reimbursed now is when the epic has a faction reset that prevents you from ever re-doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Pasukun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Someone above said after PoP came out the faction shortcut no longer gives the scale.<br />
Is this absolute truth or the guy got just unlucky?<br />
I wanna know if I can still do the faction shortcut and complete the quest.<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Faction shortcut worked last week.<br />
<br />
What happens is that NOW any shaman completing their epic gets their facton reset to indifferent.<br />
<br />
If a shaman got their epic last year or whenever and is STILL Max Ally to Truespirit they can hand a tear in to Lord Rak.<br />
Or if YOU have the Tear and hand it in then you need to be Max Ally.<br />
<br />
Also whoever hands in the final quest piece MUST be Max Ally or no Epic.<br />
I have seen people screw this up BOTH ways. (Bye Bye TWO Iksar Child Tears because a shaman guildie didn't confirm 100% he WAS Max Ally.......GRRRR!).<br />
<br />
Just make 100% sure that you (and the person handing in the Iksar Tear - which may or may not also be you) are Max Ally Truespirit. This can be confirmed by doing one of the easier steps and getting the &quot;You faction with Truespirit cannot possibly get better&quot;.<br />
<br />
There we go :) now go get epic'd OMG.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Iranicus Spellbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Either route is fine whether you do it by raising your faction or whether you hit the hole and neh ashiir after. If people want to call that cheating then let them, but so is reading guides on how to complete your epic if you want to think about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I did the Hole recently with 3 groups, average level 56. We didn't need 3 groups, but that many people showed up. We did Jaeil for 4 rangers, the Ghost of Kindle for an enchanter, Kirn for me, and some named mob in the tower for a Karana quest. We also had an IGS drop.<br />
<br />
We didn't take any divine aura shortcuts, we just crawled on through. The whole thing took around 2 hours start to finish, and was enjoyed by all.<br />
<br />
I think more people are intimidated by the idea of the Hole than it actually justifies, particularly now in the PoP era. The trick to a good Hole raid is an experienced level 60+ puller who knows the zone well.<br />
<br />
I did consider doing the faction short cut (not MQing the tear, but skipping steps and factioning with woe/envy), since I don't like asking a raid to form just for me, but I wanted to do the quest properly. Plus, I realised that I could do each step solo, with a small group, or with a raid that has multiple purposes and benefits other people, not just me.<br />
<br />
Examples: rangers, enchanters, paladins, also need to go to The Hole for their epics (and they can't be MQd either). Druids and rangers need Jade Reavers from the City of Mist, magicians need Neh'Ashiir, enchanters need the Wraith of Jaxiom. All sorts of people need drops from Fear for their epics.<br />
<br />
For The Hole, I waited until several rangers had done the epic up to that point, encouraging them to do the first steps to get there, before I held my raid. We had 3 rangers from my guild and a guy who was waiting for a Hole raid to tag along with.<br />
<br />
In other words, it doesn't have to be selfish to do your epic the &quot;proper&quot; way - 4 rangers and 1 enchanter are a step closer to their own epics, which they wouldn't be if I hadn't run my Hole raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Sorry eqphreak, forgot I had posted in this thread before.....<br />
<br />
Just trying to illustrate my point about people &quot;cheating&quot; to get the shaman epic. As in, why even do the Hole at all if you're just going to get someone to MQ the tear for you anyway? <br />
<br />
Because:<br />
<br />
1) The Hole is a fun zone that looks neat.<br />
2) The tear had already been acquired, I helped on a PoF break-in but was unable to stay for the entire raid. Another Shaman looted the tear for MQ later, as she already had her epic.<br />
<br />
I did all other steps, even Neh, knowing I could just faction my way through the remainder of the quest. I certainly wasn't going to tell the other Shaman to destroy the tear because it would be &quot;cheating&quot; to receive an MQ.<br />
<br />
It's ok to skip Fear but not the Hole?<br />
<br />
Personally, I couldn't care less, its a video game and we've all &quot;cheated&quot; by using walkthroughs anyways. I will say that its a whole lot more fun to do the quest step by step than to turn in Woe and Envy a billion times. I only had to do it a few times and that was bad enough.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure whats worse, waiting for those two to repop or having to go back to God-awful EJ repeatedly to check faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I found the tear the easiest part to get, I went in with my friends once his guild had been in and killed the golems, and they left the iksar up for me , and I kille dit, now would you call that cheating? no I call it having friends.<br />
<br />
I have done the rest of quest properly, Im up to Hole, but I can never find anyone who is willing to go down to hole, I also personally am not looking forward to it, I find the hole plain boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Trabayre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I did the Hole - I loved it. I have hit Kirn three times now and picked up 'chanter, pally and ranja epic drops along the way. My guild went to Fear and two Tears dropped - three shammies at the same point in their epic, I lost the roll  :mad: So hell yeah - I will MQ the damn Tear. I hate Fear</div></div><hr />
