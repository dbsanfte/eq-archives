<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Somewhere-out-there I read that luclin spells drop like rain from the mobs in the Arx in sseru.  I have not read any spoilers on the quest for the arx key, so I don't know what is involved to get it, and I don't know how difficult the mobs in the arx are.<br />
<br />
1. Can anyone confirm that 58 - 60 luclin spells actually drop from the arx mobs?<br />
<br />
2. Is getting the key even a possiblity for a guild that is ~vindi capable?<br />
<br />
3. Can said guild kill the needed mobs that drop the spells or are they out of our league?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">belive the boss's to kill are similar to killing Dain.  Its been forever since I been there so I can't remember for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Boobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seru drop rates are only good for that stupid no rent crap, and Arx mobs are way to strong to want to *farm* spells from. Depending on what spells you are looking for ssra may be better.<br />
<br />
Also the shissar mystic, a rare spawn through second floor locked door on way to creator drops some nice shaman only spells, least nice if you wanna fill your spell book. Group Acumen and Primal Essence.</div></div><hr />
