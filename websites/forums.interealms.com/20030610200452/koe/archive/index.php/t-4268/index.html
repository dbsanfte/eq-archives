I hit the thing to bring the log in up and I get an illegal error. Is this normal? I don't have the CD's yet but would like to download the patch to get it out of the way. Is it just because the server is more than likely jammed with log ins?<br />
<br />
I can't even got the patch screen to come up :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Waran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wouldn't be so harsh about the servers not going up immediately.  We all knew it was going to take some time, and I hope everyone didn't honestly think it would be a flawless release.<br />
<br />
It isn't the end of the world that EQ isn't up guys, I'm sure they're working on it as fast as they can to get it running.<br />
<br />
Be patient</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This might be a direct x issuse<br />
<br />
go here and download the latests version  8.1<br />
<br />
http://www.microsoft.com/directx/homeuser/downloads/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have 8.1 downloaded already. I am not impatient at all. I just know that last time we had to change to directx 7 I had problems for a couple days and I am trying to determine if I am having problems again since I see that some people are actually getting to the patch screen.<br />
<br />
I didn't figure on playing EQ tonight and probably not even tomorrow but I just wanted to know if I am having problems or not so I can try and figure out what the problems are. :(<br />
<br />
Since I know nothing about computers I am relying on those that do here to give me ideas....please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am pretty sure it is not directx Mei.  I did get illegal operation error 2 or 3 times.  I've been able to patch a few files.  <br />
<br />
My suggestion is.<br />
<br />
Try to patch.  Retry.  Retry.  Reset.  Try to patch.  Retry.  Etc.  Very tedious I know.<br />
<br />
Edit:  if it was a directx issue I believe you would be crashing after server select screen or after / at character select screen.  From my experiences anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Try running the testserver.exe<br />
<br />
What is the exact error message you are getting?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I imagine the patch server is being slammed too.  I downloaded the updated Everquest.exe file that Sony recommended if you couldn't get the patcher to work -- no luck.  I am also getting the illegal operation errors a lot, but when I do get files to start to download I can get 1 or 2, then a message saying there was an IO error with my drive (in the blue patch window) that it is either full or I have no access rights to write to it.  Both of which are  untrue... so I don't know if that's a result of me losing contact with the patcher, or it's a poorly written patch program or what.<br />
<br />
I've also noticed that the last few days of having this new patch interface has caused my computer to slow down a LOT.  It takes about 5 times longer for the patcher to even start checking files and once it does it slows down my system so much to where I can't even play solitaire where before I could even browse the web while a patch was taking place.  I've got 512 mb of ram and 700 Mhz so it should be ok like it used to be a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
Not getting that part, but I guess I understand why I can't get the files to update.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Cidman Viciouss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I really think it is a bandwith issue atm. 40k people are trying to download from the server. This is just insane. <br />
<br />
/rude VI for this. They should have made this avail on the cd's for the expansion only. <br />
<br />
But everyone that logs in, must download these files. <br />
<br />
If there is this much problems, and we arent even in the game yet. Well just think what lies ahead <br />
<br />
Meia  did you try to connect to the test server?<br />
<br />
I can only brain storm right now. This is new to all of us, but I am trying to help.<br />
<br />
Also reboot to clear the case memory and try again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">ok I'm going to say a very computer stupid thing here. hehe<br />
<br />
Cid I don't even know how to get to the test server. I know your shaking your head and saying what a stupid woman but oh well I never had a need to go there soooo I never asked.<br />
<br />
No biggie I will wait until tomorrow and try and log in again and see what happens. Maybe I will be on line by the weekend hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Mei looking in your everquest directory<br />
<br />
default -  c:\program files\everquest\<br />
<br />
Sort the files by clicking VIEW until they're listed with their details.<br />
Now sort them by *.exe files.  If that doesn't make sense try to just find the *.exe files in \everquest\ there is about 5 of them and they all have the same &quot;everquest shield&quot; icon.  One of them is the test server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Something else to add.<br />
<br />
Before I got that IO error with one of the files.  I was later able to download that file with out an error.  So I wouldn't pay attention or worry about the IO error's.  Just thought I'd clarify.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've been away from my computer for a few days and hence, I didn't have a chance to download the new patcher before today.  Does anyone know if the EQ.exe file they recommend dowloading from the EQlive site is the way around this?</div></div><hr />
