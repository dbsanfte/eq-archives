<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a first idea, it would be nice to see which kind of heal the shaman community would like to have.<br />
<br />
I first introduced the same topic, but without the poll :/<br />
So I quoted the answers ;) ( there were 2 )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A group version of Tnargs, and a 'complete' heal equal to the druid's. Not a joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Please, I have not read requests for either a CH or a group fast heal on this board.<br />
<br />
There is an overwhelming request that we get a fast heal that is at least close to what the druids have.<br />
<br />
It would also be nice to see a meaningful increas in the per tic heal in our heal over time, but that is secondary IMHO to an upgraded fast heal.<br />
<br />
Shamans are built to fight a slow paced battle.  And we are good at it.<br />
However the content of the game is all becoming high speed.  Mobs mitigate slow often, and are half dead by the time I get malo and turgur on it anyways.  For shaman to to retain their usefulness I we need to be able to do something quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1750 tnargs upgrade for 525 mana. Sylvan Infusion would be 350 more HP healed for 25 more mana, quite a serious advantage still.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Beware what you ask for. If you get great heals, you will get assigned the main healer role and the most fun class in the game will quickly become as boring as druids and clerics are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
haha have you been through a kod taz trial  ?  ..... CLERICS ARE A MUST</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't reply , a 1700 heal will not save our healing capacity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">haha have you been through a kod taz trial  ?  ..... CLERICS ARE A MUST<br />
<br />
I dont think anyone said needed, i believe the word FUN was used.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty doubtful one strong fast heal will let shaman take the place of Druids and Clerics in the complete heal chain, or as the main healers in the party.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I stand by previous words of mine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Need a stronger HoT and a bigger Fast heal so we can maintain how we heal in previous situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/agree - however, please remember that even less of us will have access to the sweet GoD boss drops than have access to the sweet Time boss drops. Please don't lobby for a fix that less than 20% of the Level 65 Shamans will ever get to use. Please don't penalize the 65 Shaman who has been playing for years but doesn't want to (or can't due to RL) raid constantly. Healing may be less of a problem for us, but it is still a problem. I have never looted a Glyphed Rune Word thingy, but I have Blood of Saryrn, Ferine Avatar, Focus of the Seventh, Malos. and Quiescence scribed. But I'll probably never even see Breath of Trushar. :(<br />
<br />
At least with AAs and LDoN-bought spells, each of us can eventually accrue the needed points - or if they come from GoD ubers, please have them NOT NODROP so that we can maybe see them in the bazaar a year from now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I vote Tnarg's upgrade, but I'd rather have it do 1800 instead of 1700 or 1750. Still leaves plenty of room for Druids to have a healing advantage. I think we're behind enough in the healing department to warrant it.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'm tired of everyone cowing to the idea that we should be inferior to druids in healing. That's how we got where we are now in the first place. We are just as much of a priest class as druids are, but you want to short-change yourself once again? I say give us exactly the same healing as druids and restore us to being the priest we should be. Slow is not an excuse anymore. Cannibalize is not an excuse either. Two years ago, yes they were - but not today. And, if you dont want to be the main healer or part of a complete heal chain, well, I dont know what to tell ya - you picked a healer class. I guess you can just decline to do those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>lfclan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Im all for a Tnargs upgrade to 1750 or 1800  ONLY   if it is effected by our healing AAs and focus items... otherwise its just a small bandaid on a severed limb......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">One option is to fix this with itemization. In other words have a shaman only augment with increased healing 60-80% for Tnarg's Mending.  Where they put it depends on their aims, though I'd suggest as a common drop on trash mobs in the Barundi trials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I highly doubt they are going to add another spell for Shamans. If any changes happen you can bet they will take one of the GoD spells we got away and replace them with the new heal. I have the feeling it won't be the disease DoT, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Better Q and better tnarg, would do it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">since we have to make decisions on what we want to be upgraded, could a moderator stick it, for let s say 1 week, then we could do another poll to define the true stats of our heal ? ( Direct heal seems to make the majority )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Group Q.  Let the druids have the better direct single heal, let us be better in keeping groups alive in AoE situations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Beware what you ask for. If you get great heals, you will get assigned the main healer role and the most fun class in the game will quickly become as boring as druids and clerics are.<br />
<br />
The heal will balance us to where priests are curently. If the GoD heal over time was changed to a 1750pt 2 second cast tnargs upgrade then we would be able to heal in PoP tier3 (not all of tier3 but some of it) and be a little better at it normally in other places (i.e. ldon normal).<br />
<br />
Shamans aren't bad healers in normal ldon. If you are like me you didn't start filling a main healer role until you were level 65, so a break from 65 levels of playing a slower is enjoyable for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Potionpusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A new fast heal &amp; Q would be great!  What's irking me slightly is where to put the spells.  <br />
<br />
Tnarg's has yet to be enough for me in LDoN Hards (outside of chain casting it).  Every thread here I'm reading has people talking about GoD content only.<br />
<br />
As I'm starting into the GoD content, I'm still reminded of Teir 3 and greater PoP &amp; LDoN as even a backup healer.  Tnarg's simply isn't cutting it.  I would like to see any new &quot;blast&quot; heal or perhaps even a new heal over time land in the PoP or higher areas.<br />
<br />
Just my 2cp's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just think the game has progressed to burst DPS and burst healing.  We're never going to do fast damage but our healing per second has fallen too far behind the other two priest classes.  Somebody please check my math and assumptions below:<br />
<br />
Tnarg(Shaman) 1300 hp heal/5 seconds(cast and recast) = 260 HP/sec<br />
Nature's Infusion(Druid) 1750 hp/5 seconds = 350 HP/sec<br />
Supernatural Light(Cleric) 2750hp/5 seconds = 550 HP/sec<br />
<br />
If you factor AHA3(16%) and 20% healing focus shaman fall even further behind the pack:<br />
Shaman 1300+208+260=1768 or 353.6 HP/sec<br />
Druid 1750+280+350=2380 or 476 HP/sec<br />
Cleric 2750+440+550=3740 or 748 HP/sec<br />
<br />
and just for fun throw in the GoD spells:<br />
Shaman(no direct upgrade) 1300+208+260=1768 or 353.6 HP/sec<br />
Sylvan(Druid) 2100+336+420=2856 or 571.2 HP/sec<br />
Holy Light(Cleric) 3275+524+655=4454 or 890.8 HP/sec<br />
<br />
For a game where it is becoming increasingly mandatory to have a secondary healer in a group the shaman class is being left in the dust.  We will still be a desirable class when a secondary healer is not required because of slow.  That was the utility I always saw with my shaman is that I could fill two roles in a challenging environment.  I could slow and in a pinch I could supplement healing.  I just feel as a progress further I am slowly losing that edge that I once had.<br />
