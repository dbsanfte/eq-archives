<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, after 57.5 levels of shamany goodness, I'm within a week of getting my epic, and I'd love to live to see Rak go down.  Has anyone used a shiny brass idol to DA themselves before the turn-in?  Will that buy me enough time for the fire pets to get aggro and let me back out of his ae range, or will I likely train Rak on the party?<br />
<br />
I'll probably have an aego on me, putting me over 3khp, so even if I take one of his ae blasts, I can probably make it out alive.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More than likely, DA has the same trade restrictions as invisibilty does.  You probably won't be able to trade with it on.  I'd ask a cleric friend to try it with a merchant before you waste your idol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly I have seen this done 4 times.<br />
<br />
All 4 times the Shammy did not DA or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Also, all 4 times the Shammy lived through the transfer of agro and longer.<br />
<br />
Honestly if you are prepared to heal yourself you should be ok.  Also you may have the time to turn in and then DA if you feel like it.  If you have the melee ready as soon as the turn in is complete you may not have a problem.<br />
<br />
We did it with either a SK or a Monk and were able to have them take the agro and either take one for the team to set it up or FD and sick pets then have him get the heck out of there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I used CotH when I did my turn in.  I brought up the trade window with Rak, had the mage start casting, then I clicked trade.  He aggroed and then I got summoned out.  The pets took over after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Honestly its not that bad.  Just have some decent HP, 3K is tons.  Hand in have pets attack, back out and get healed...<br />
You are worrying too much about this, it isn't really THAT bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, I'm not really that worried, even if I die - was just a thought.   Thanks for the advice all.  It's very likely that there will be an epic cleric there, so a rez well be painless enough. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used a Shiny Brass Idol to Divine Aura, then did the tear trade.<br />
<br />
It worked the way you'd want it too: the effect lasted through the transfer and then when he started to hit me and do his AoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
What a great idea.  Wish I had thought of it. :p<br />
Kirn killed me when I got stunned twice in a row, and took another death to Rak. :o  Didn't really care though, as it was all worth it in the end! :D<br />
<br />
But good info for future Mystics seeking to avoid death!<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Have as much hp as you can get.  Get a Cel Heal (or simlilar type spell from cleric/shaman/necro) just before turn in and I'll almost guarantee you'll survive long enough for the pets to gain agro.  Just back away slowly to make sure agro is really gone after not being hit anymore and don't sit down for a few more rounds.<br />
<br />
Good idea on the Idol if you have one.  When else are ya going to use it? ;)  (j/k'ing, I know there's many uses for it)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>fudorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I went in and got mine at 53... buffed out to 2772 hp's.  And would have survived the encounter if not for a mage's pet trying to hide in my kilt.  Simply could not back around it, and wasn't about to go swimming (someone had conveniently pulled Rak outside for us earlier.)<br />
<br />
I think I took either 3 or 4 ae hits, and some dd melee, before I finally went down.  Had all resists buffed to over 100, which might be why I survived so many of the hits.  Was very much in a daze over just being in the encounter that I truthfully did not pay attention.<br />
<br />
Took my 90% rez with no issues (only cleric was 54), and watched the fire pets finish the last half of battle while clearing rez effects.<br />
<br />
And, while not listed actually listed as a 'requirement', the end fight can be done quite satisfactorily with 1 cleric, and 4-5 druids/shaman casting heals on the pets.  Can be done without the cleric, but death would really suck in that situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>buga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Use the force, his AE won't kill you. I survived 2 of his ae and still lived. With rak, always bring a cleric. CoM is a bad place, just be prepare. 1 death for the price of epic, i think is worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When I fought rak, his melee damn near killed me before his AE finally went off and finished me.  I was completely unbuffed, though.  Fully raid buffed, with some fire resist gear and buffs, you should be able to handle him fine.  Just turn in the tear and start healing yourself.  Wait until pets have aggroed for a few seconds, and then back off.  His AE is not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.  It is also a good idea to bind nearby, just in case you do die.  I would definately not want to miss the boss mob of my epic going down.<br />
<br />
As for the amount of healing capacity you need to take him down, we did it with a 52 cleric and myself (57 shaman at the time) as the only healers.  We did have KEI, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fudorf, I'm glad I'm not the only one that got trapped in a ring o' mage pets... same thing happened to me, so I figured I may as well just fight.<br />
<br />
I managed to survive and keep agro for a good while 'fore I finally died.  Never was able to back away through the pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for all the input.  I'll let y'all know how it goes...  Hopefully I'll be getting the new poker this week. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For anyone who's interested, it worked like a champ...  clicked on DA, did hand in and backed away after about 12 seconds.  Rak went down smoothly, and I took 0 dmg.  Got my new poker later in the evening.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Congrats :) Now go poke something with that shiny spear!</div></div><hr />
