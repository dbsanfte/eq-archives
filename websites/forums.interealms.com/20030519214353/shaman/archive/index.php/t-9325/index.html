I know, I know, you are all probably getting sick of these :)<br />
<br />
Where to go next with my gear?  I know I need a new bracer, but plan on doing the Coldain one.  Im not rich (have about 3.5k in the bank), and with all the PoP groups and/ or Luclin groups (no one going to Old World anymore), Im probably not going to get rich soon.  Plus, every spell level I seem to blow what little I have on my spells.<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Want to save for a ODS<br />
Cloak - Save for Heiro<br />
Belt - Think I should trade it for a spider fur? Wasnt sure about the loss of AC.<br />
Shield - Using it to replace lost wisdom while I try to find more/ better HP items.<br />
Face - Was a gift back when I was 30th level, and not real excited about spending 2k-ish for the CSS.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions that I may be overlooking? That dont require uber guilds or 20k plat?  Or should I just say hell with it all, and save my money for the malo/ torpor fund? <br />
<br />
Thanks for the input.<br />

<br />
On the matter of the belt, have a play with alt magelo profiles and perhaps see what happens when you bung your level up to 60 as then sta starts to mean a little more and see if the Chitinous or the Spider fur end up a better HP/AC balance for you, both are nice and cheap.<br />
<br />
Also take a look at Coldain Skin Gloves at 60, the sta on them ends up being more HP than shissar.<br />
<br />
Your plan for upgrades seems very solid and the veil isnt so bad to wear until you can afford something else.</div></div><hr />
