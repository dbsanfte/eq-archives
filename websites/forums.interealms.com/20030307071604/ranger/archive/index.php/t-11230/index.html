<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thehiddenranger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">xp groups whats going to raise our DPS the most in aa points I tend to do a cleric/ranger duo group and we don't have many probs with me running out of health unless its a bad pull so I'm not worryed about living longer i want to KILL faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vladimirr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, which skills do you have already?<br />
Where do you exp?<br />
What's your playstyle?<br />
<br />
If you exp on stuff that's bordering on light blue, Finishing Blow might be a valid option for you.<br />
<br />
If you exp on stuff that doesn't hit too hard and the cleric can tank, you can back up and use archery with EQ/AM3 for more damage.<br />
<br />
If you're exping on stuff that you simply melee, you may be better off with Ambidexterity.<br />
<br />
If you tend to use up a lot of mana, Mental Clarity/SpellCasting Fury might be a viable option.<br />
<br />
If you fight stuff that takes you low on health and find that your cleric has long med breaks after each fight, you might want to up your HP with Natural Durability or Physical Enhancement to decrease the number of complete heals.<br />
<br />
And so on...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RangerKeaianea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your primary concern is to kill faster duoing with a Cleric with NO outside buffs...<br />
<br />
Max the following:<br />
<br />
Innate Strength (unless your equipment and your STR buff maxes you already)<br />
Innate Dexterity (maximize procing potential)<br />
Combat Fury 3 (add melee critical hits, stacks with our ability to perform archery critical hits)<br />
Spell Casting Fury 3 (add chance to critical on nukes)<br />
Ambidexterity (increase offhand chance to hit)<br />
Double Riposte (adds a chance to riposte again after a successful first riposte)<br />
Archery Mastery 3 (increases damage dealt by archery)<br />
Endless Quiver (endless supply of any arrow in your ammo slot)<br />
<br />
These all contribute to maximizing damage output in some way, shape or form, regardless of how negligable they may seem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tolian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If what you want is to kill faster while duoing with a cleric, go for CF3, then Ambi.  The archery skills won't help you at all, cuz unless you plan on duoing giants or dragons, you won't be able to tank and still use a bow.  And sorry Kea, but I gotta disagree with you on spending pts for dex or str.  Total waste imo, cuz you will eventually start hitting 255 on them w/o any outside buffs.  Good luck to ya, cuz either way its a lot of pts, heh.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Barogio</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tolian, stats will be raising to 305 with Planar Power in PoP I believe, so wel'l all want maxxed STR to boost our ATK as much as possible.. though I admit, my STR will probably be there already as will most 60 rangers<br />
<br />
200str unbuffed + 100 from avatar + harnessing/focus easily gives the other 5 :)</div></div><hr />

LOL  While you may be able to hit 255 STR and DEX self buffed, not everyone can.  It all depends on what kind of gear you have and what kind of guild you are in, if any.  Unfortunately, the poster does not state either.  Therefore, we cannot assume he has uber gear or a primal.  We do not know his base STR, so cannot build a profile for him of purely STR based buyable gear.  Same goes with DEX.  The original poster only asked for how he could kill faster by imcreasing his AA skills.  I simply went down the line of our AA and made suggestions based on what CAN increase damage.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Realistically I would just get EQ/AM3 and Ambidex if you want to max your damage output. All the rest of the skills mentioned above is going to make at most 1% difference for a gigantic points expenditure Take a look at spell casting fury for instance. I parsed my damage output in Akheva one day and found that I did 5% of my damage from procs (65dd from CoF and 288dd from my weapon) and the rest from either melee/bow/damage shields (this was with 170 or 180ish dex). Now, CF3 costs 12 points, and increases your nuke damage by 7%. Compound 5% and 7% together and you get a whopping 0.35%. Do you really want to spend 12 points on 0.35% increase in damage output? You probably dont have a weapon that procs 288dd either in which case the improvement is going to be even more insignificant. Instead you could get a few hundreds hit points from ND3, or the really cool and fun ability Innate Camo,  or 10% damage avoidance. Think about it.... It's a waste of points pre 100 aa. The only time I can see it being useful is if you are in a guild that takes down emp and use those 600dd proccing weapons instead of serubane.<br />
<br />
Even with duoing with a healer you can still do a lot of damage with EQ/AM3 on non-giant/dragon mobs. For instance, in Akehva, lots of times, mobs will run towards me then stop to cast. Sometimes they stop to cast so much that by the time they reach the camp they are down to 50 or 60% life. Also endless quiver saves a bit of time in that you never have to summon arrows again and you can shoot then endlessly without a care.</div></div><hr />
