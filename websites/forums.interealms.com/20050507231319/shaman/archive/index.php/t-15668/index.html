<br />
Sitting on a horse is standing regen for HP.<br />
<br />
Iksar regen at 65 with 3 points in natural regen AA is 21 standing, 27 sitting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">why would u med on a horse and not have sitting regen on a horse?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">why would u med on a horse and not have sitting regen on a horse?<br />
<br />
Only SOE knows the answer to that question, I guess they thought it would be over powering. I don't even know if they intended mana regen to work the way it does on a horse.</div></div><hr />

It's just the way it is.<br />
he's correct, sitting mana regen on a horse but STANDING hp regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kajer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">forgot about magelo...the computer i mostly surf on is at work. and they restricted sites like magelo and stuff :P but i got around it now. guess i can go there. but rakji answered my question. and yes rakji is correct when you sit on a horse you are regenning hp like you are standing thats why i stated that. thanks for the help.<br />

<br />
If u med on a horse like your sitting then u should regen like it too and if it was a mistake by SOE then what would be the purpose of slow horses their no good for travel medding and casting is the only thing i use mine for</div></div><hr />
