Actually, with 5 new levels opening up, are we going to see level FIVE items coming out?  <br />
<br />
Will be interesting to see.<br />

Hmmm, going to 65 trivialized a lot of content too. That did not stop them. Besides, they could always revamp EXISTING content in the 90 or so zones that are totally EMPTY to take this change into account. <br />
<br />
Personally, I'd like to see more instanced content for groups and 36 man raids. I'm doing the PoP flagging process again, and man is it boring and time consuming. I want some fun content I can log in and DO. Not log in and waste a week going through some convoluted flagging process.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A lot of nice augments could be on this new vendor camp if it is one.  Sadly they will probly be slot THREE. there wont be 5 more lvls, they would have announced it, to drum up sales.  <br />
<br />
ID4 slot8&amp;7 wrist/hands would be sexy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">But isn't ID4 on that Takish belt? Sure it's not an aug but it's attainable, unlike MP4 outside of ornate or EP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love this arguement...:)<br />
In the same breath please note that when you lvled past lvl 6 you were forced to move out of your newbie zone, least I hope so.<br />
When you were lvl 20 wasn't that newbie zone a bit trivialized?<br />
When you dinged 50+ wasn't Guk just a tad bit trivialized?<br />
The game is about progression. If they stop the hamster tread mill whats the point...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, it is, but we are talking about Augmentations.  No overall augmentation is available that I can think of other than the lesser ones(Extended Blessing 4: 10% SH is all I can find).<br />
<br />
You have to get a specific focus, such as BA for dots, eci for cold, Solusek for fire, druzzil for magic, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The extra 5 levels is a rumour, please forgive me for perpetuating it, but it came from a friend I trust who heard it from someone who supposedly works for Sony.  While I trust my friend, this is definitely 3rd or 4rth-hand information at this time.<br />
<br />
Still, alot of people I know have filled up their 65 bar completely just in case based on the rumour.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm thinking that most of the runes like this will be Nedaria's landing AP bought with some possibly spread to the other camps.  This way they still give the overall focus affects(IH, ID, MP) without letting players outright buy 20% generic foci(most of the minor are 10-15%, or about half of the normal).</div></div><hr />

<br />
When they announced the list of features for Kunark, it included the level increase.<br />
<br />
When they announced the feature list for PoP it included the level increase.<br />
<br />
They have announced the feature list for GoD. It doesn't include a level increase.<br />
<br />
Conclusion : GoD almost certainly doesn't include a level increase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Extended Blessing and Detrimental focus are certainly NOT &quot;lesser&quot;<br />
ones.<br />
<br />
They are unique focus effects outside of a few rare raid items.<br />
But are not subject to &quot;generic ones&quot;<br />
<br />
Extended Blessing might only be 10% compared to the generic 15 on a valor shield.  However, it works on Heal over Times.  The generics do not.  ((even the 8th shawl doesnt)) so its not really &quot;lesser&quot; buff focus as much as it a &quot;different&quot; focus.<br />
<br />
Extended Detrimental effects things like Dots in a way different than burning affliction by making them last longer.  So it stacks with BA instead of being less than BA.  on top of that it works on debuffs.<br />
<br />
Outside of these augs, the only things similiar are:<br />
1 VT Item (Ben/Det)<br />
Coir Earring (Ben)<br />
Coir Shoulders (Det)<br />
Time Tier2 Mask (Ben)<br />
Time Tier2 Shoulder (Ben)<br />
Time Hammer of Hours (Det)<br />
Some Time BPs (det)<br />
<br />
might be one or two I'm missing but these arent &quot;weaker&quot; generic foci</div></div><hr />

<br />
I meant lesser for EB as to the %, regardless of what it affects.<br />
<br />
Detrimental foci was not in this &quot;lesser category&quot; I was using them to illustrate that there are not Overall foci 4, but specific ones for type of spell and/or resist.</div></div><hr />

Yep drops in chests in MMC hard adventures; finally a use for the chest line of spells :D<br />
And as a side bonus, its a all slot type augment, so it will augment darn near anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I've heard rumors of the expansion having the level cap increased.<br />
Something that kind of shoots down that idea is that historicly when new spells are being created, they are hitting the test server first, so we've had a chance to see and analyze the new spells before the expansion is even live.  This hasn't happened.  We've only seen the new AAs sorta.  I doubt that the expansion will raise the cap again.  I have a full 65 xp bar regardless, though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There won't be new levels, GoD is NOT a raid expansion, if they bump levels, they will overcrowd Time/Elementals even more since it would be trivial to get there. On some servers there are already 3+ guilds in Time. Imagine having 6+ guilds in Time.</div></div><hr />
