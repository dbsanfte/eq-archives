<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">can I anyone do a run down in PC on JB equipment?<br />
<br />
I was thinking of buying several pieces, and got my first, JB Arms, for 700pp...did I screw up lol?<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Helm, Arms, Gloves and Boots all cost between 500 and 800pp.  <br />
<br />
Legs and BP are much more expensive, how much more I have no idea.  Maybe 20k for legs and 25k for BP?  I dunno.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit:  lol forgot about the Bracer:  15k -20k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">25K for legs, 35K+ for bp on EMarr.<br />
<br />
Its more a question of actually finding the legs/bp.  If you have the cash and find one, make sure you get it cause you wont find another for a long time :)<br />
<br />
The bracer comes and goes, usually 10-15k on EMarr.  The other jb pieces (helm, arms, boots, gloves) half the time get sold to vendors.  Otherwise 500pp.  I usually tell my friends that get them in seb or kc to just sell it to a vendor for 300ish pp, or give it to a newbie shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The common pieces - head, boots, gloves, and arms sell for 500 - 1000pp on Saryn.  Every now and then you'll get some yahoo selling a piece for 1500-2000pp. <br />
<br />
This stuff is great vendor bait - I picked up my helm for around 400pp (don't remember exactly how much) off a vendor in Shadowheaven.<br />
<br />
Not sure on the high-end stuff, I haven't had the fortune of worrying about it :)<br />
<br />
JBBs seem ultra-rare, though. See tons of people buying and no one selling. Most offers are around 10-20k from what I have observed. I doubt it goes for less than 20k in any case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jaundice BP goes for about 45k on my server (SolRo).  I got lucky and traded an RBG I got in seb for the JB BP and 4k.  An excellent excellent deal.<br />
<br />
As for the legs.... about 20-25k on my server.  For about a week and a half I actually had that kind of cash and was looking for them, but no luck.  I want some really bad to complete my set :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">thanks for your help all!<br />

Joo be doing just fine.<br />
<br />
I would also get da JB Arms and JB Gloves....  JB has nice AC and is cheep.<br />
<br />
Another very smart investment if you solo a lot is an FBSS and a nice 2hb hammer.  The damage output can be amazing and will make a big differance on how fast you lvl.<br />
<br />
The damage caps on 2hb make noticble jumps at 20 30 and 40.  Before 20 a faster weapon then 2hb with a damage in the 9 to 11 range will give you more output then a big hammer.<br />
<br />
Overall your rack looks just fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, Ive done what many (maybe) shamans do..concentrated on piercing since our epic is piercing.  Goof thing is is that at level 15...piercing/attack/defense..all maxxed since Ive soloed 95% of the way.<br />
<br />
2HB...5 points lol!!<br />
<br />
So, given the support of this board..tonight Ill start hitting light blues with 2HB to move it up. God Im gonna miss that Clay Guardian shield lol<br />
<br />
can anyone suggest a 200-500pp 2HB?<br />
<br />
Thanks <br />
<br />
Me</div></div><hr />
