<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was anyone in there allready oor have any kind of information about sewers of dranik ? ( i dont mean dranik hollows )<br />
<br />
specially mob lvls, nameds, spelldroppers and so on  :D <br />
<br />
all i know is that the zone is next to the zone to bloodfield behind the murkgliders ukuns bats and rats  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went in there with an elemental group and its a little harder than a hard ldon.   Pathers abound and are very fast,  it's easy to wipe in here.  We were only there for about an hour, and the exp was really good.  Didn't see any named on track when we went in, and didn't think to look for odd named mobs like the ph's are in the other expeditions.  I would say bring a good group and a beefy tank if you go,  be ready to snare every single mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Graal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The main problem our group had is the multitude of chanter and shaman mobs.  Almost everything in the dungeon gets hasted so landing a slow or dispelling becomes critical.  Otherwise its just a step or 2 above the 68+ Hollows instances.  Mobs hit high 600's.  <br />
<br />
No obvious PH's that I could find.  Oh, and avoid the A instance.  B and C are much easier to pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">is the zone in safe ?<br />
<br />
where do i get the missions , i've only found the zone in for the sewers ?</div></div><hr />
