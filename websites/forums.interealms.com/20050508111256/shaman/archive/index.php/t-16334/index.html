65 chanter 62 monk 65 necro 58 sk 65 war and 65 shaman/... shaman is doing fine as main healer. good sign!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yah I got hit with one of those too. Really screwed us up (bad monk). <br />

Save chests and other items until after you finish your quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did it show up as a buff?<br />
Or, more to the point, will Radiant Cure work on it?  =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope just straight up drunkenness, we failed the adventure cause of it too, took too long waiting to sober up. so watch out for those barrells</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Swiftfisted</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">we hit a barrel tonight that made all of our stats 1 and decreased our mana pools by 50%.  Needed a combination of RC1 and RC3 to cure the bugger, and when it was cured, left us all at 80% health and 50% mana.  That sucked!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>steveo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">opened a chest tonite that gave us all 40% mana... was kinda helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I went through the one in everfrost last night successfully and i didnt see a single chest or barrel that was targetable? Is this normal? We didnt clear the dungeon though as we only needed to kill 59 mobs to win.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The monk in our group broke a frozen table, and cursed the entire group.  The curse made all of our spells 50% LONGER to cast.  Took 2 casts of remove curse to get rid of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We found two chests in the adventure I did last night. Rogue couldn't detect traps on either. Tried to open first one, all got dotted with a tough poison. Fortunately I have disinfecting aura up and cleared that. We tried again (well I did) thinking it wouldn't go off again and it did. oh well, cured that, healed up, forged on. Second chest had a blue smoke coming out of it. We tried to open it, I think we got sandblasted, a long lasting ac debuffer. Anyway, the fun far exceeded my expectations to be honest. We had a collection adventure, get 21 frozen sacks or something. We completed the adventure with 6 minutes to spare despite 2 double linkdeaths in between (tank/cleric 2 boxing). It was so much fun to have to push yourselves to move on with partial health/mana. This kind of risk/reward is invigorating to me, although I can see how more conservative players will react. To each their own.<br />
<br />
A couple of points that I noted to help make the adventure a success.<br />
<br />
1). When you get to the entrance of the adventure buff up/ fm/ fh before entering (if you have time). We all ran separately and the first one there entered. This started the clock. By the time we were all in we had lost 6 minutes.<br />
<br />
2) Figure out all the dross before hand. Roles/ML/etc. no time to do that and be efficient when in.<br />
<br />
3) MAKE SURE ML DOES NOT HAVE LOOT NO DROP CLICKED TO AUTOMATICALLY. Our one augmentation drop was looted by the ML before anyone knew about it. Hope it was an honest mistake...........<br />
<br />
4) Stay together and move quickly. Not rocket science but pulls of 3 mobs at once were common.<br />
<br />
5) Don't wait around for the perfect group. We had shaman, necro, beastlord, chanter, cleric, rogue. No problems at all without a pure tank.<br />
<br />
6) Get used to the lagfest in the wayfarers camps.<br />
<br />
Finally, I was peeved to log on, get invited to a group, then realize I had to do a quest before I could begin. Wasn't 21 bucks enough? lol. Once I stopped moaning it took 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my take, I think I am going to like this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think the drunk traps are probably mostly there *because* they can't be cured. It's an interesting idea though.<br />
<br />
Oh, and one point: you don't need to do the quest to get the Adventure Stone before you go into a dungeon - I didn't. You do need it to be able to port between adventure camps, though.</div></div><hr />

Ooh that is a point the griefers on TZ have found wonderful to use.  It's been a pk fest, with guilds taking up camping spots at the various Wayfarer spots.  While that is fine and good and in their right...there is one problem...some of these players have realized you can use the Magus ports to quickly get away and get on with your adventure.  Thus, last night....after waiting hours to get my group and adventure, I wait at the S Ro camp and receive a tell.<br />
<br />
Warrior : Alright....so how do we get to the camp?<br />
Me : Hail the Magus and tell him &quot; South Ro &quot;<br />
Warrior : He's telling me he's busy.<br />
Me : What?<br />
Warrior : He says he can't be bothered right now.<br />
<br />
Come to find out these same pk'ers had found a way to make it much harder on people not in range...simply move the Magus from his spot.  We ended up barely making it into the adventure before our 30min ran out because the rest of my group had to run from the PoK, through Innothule, to S Ro and the dungeon without sow because they kept getting pk'ed.<br />
<br />
Awesome time though...most people were civil, but on TZ, that's a rarity. We failed with a group of 4,  warrior, shaman, bst, and necro, but did get an earring with stats of ac 3 sta 7 wis 5 int 5 hp 15 mana 45 and some resists.  Nice replacement for my Earring of Twisted Leaves.  We received no points for our failure at the collection mission ( 20 Lost Momentos....took a wrong turn filled with mobs who didn't drop anything )</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ok I have tried to do my homework with the search command....I remember an old alchemy recipe that was supposed to cure drunkeness, but i cant find it now or any reference to it.<br />
<br />
This might just become a big seller if it works.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if it is still in the game and the ingredients, also can anyone confirm that it actually worked?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Opened a trap last night that hit us all with a 600dmg/tick dot.  Could be cured but I was healing like mad (on my ranger) and the cleric was OOM by the time we got it fixed.  Then the tank I was with walks over and touches the trap AGAIN and we all had it again, ARRGGGHHHHH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I found worked was to use the standard defense against an AOE:  Get around a corner.  That way ONE person gets hit with the nastiness and the rest are fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Kamorm: I remember rumours about such a potion existing, but I've never come across one in game or on any alchemy guide. I think it's all just rumours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kamorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for the response Kianor!<br />
<br />
Seems to me that one of the orginal vendor sold alchemy books contained that recipe and refered to the spell as a 'hangover cure'. <br />
<br />
This was back when there was only one alchemy vendor in the original 3 starting cities for shaman, back when you had to have a friend with the right faction to get some of the supplies needed because they were only sold in one place in norrath.<br />
<br />
Will check in halas for that book when i log in tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Apparently with a good alcohol tolerance the effects of that trap is minor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah, so now there's a *good* reason to get alcohol tolerance up? I was proud of the fact I'm a drunk! 200 alcohol tolerance for no better reason than I wanted to. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>RageDemon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">stat/hp/mana &quot;curse&quot; effects are curable with RC spells but the vision effects are not curable except by 'sweating it out'</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">my first guild actually required you to have 200 alcohol tolerance for roleplaying reasons :p</div></div><hr />
