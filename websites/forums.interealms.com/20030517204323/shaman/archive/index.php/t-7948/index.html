<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me what level you need to be to slow mobs in PoN or PoD?<br />
Would I be able to land slow at all in the Planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't know if you would be able to land a slow or not, but regardless, your too low level to be there. You would end up being a manna sponge for the healers, prolly draw aggro, and would get beat to a pulp when your slow is resisted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have high lvl friends to back you up (55+) and are not affraid to die its worth a try. At 52 a lot of mobs con Dark blue to Yellow to me, so you may have problems with resist due to lvl difference. It would probably work best if there was an enchanter to tash for you to help your slow stick. On the up side, with the huge xp bonus in the new Planes you won't stay 46 long. However, don't expect to find a pick up group in the planes. Most people will ignore anyone below 50 or atleast they do on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well my main char can hold taunt off anything, so I was just wondering if a 46 shammy had any chance to slow these mobs. Basically if I can slow 'em my bro and I can &quot;botsquad&quot; (tm) PoN or PoD.<br />
<br />
Thanks for replys, anymore info is welcome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found that slows in those planes generate a lot more aggro than elsewhere. You could try it but I think you're gonna find yourself &quot;Loading, Please Wait&quot; a lot.<br />
<br />
At 54 I still get a fair share of resists and aggro. Especially a resisted slow which means an immediate beating from the offended mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I tried a PoN group at 49,  half pick up/half guildies,  I was the lowest in the group with the others being 51 to 54.  It was a deathfest for us,  multiple pulls (beastlords should never pull), adds (pet hold will be one of my AAs), resists, etc.<br />
<br />
I was the only one not to die because I had the quickest feet and highest AC in the group.  I didn't have much trouble getting slow to stick on the trees but the birds were much more difficult and the spiders almost impossible.  <br />
<br />
At 46 you would be little more that a buffer and spot healer in my opinion but since you can't lose your corpse here permanently you have nothing to lose but time.   Give it a shot,  if it doesn't work out go back to your old spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mukguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I went to PoD last night and here are my findings.<br />
<br />
Me &gt; them :P<br />
<br />
I was not a drain on my groups mana, I didn't get aggro once and I didnt die. I got resisted on a few mobs but over all at 46 I was able to slow: Rats, goos, testsian flys and spiders.<br />
<br />
I will tell you this, we brought our own group, my bro 3 boxing and myself 2 boxing, I seriously doubt that at 46 you could get a pick up group.<br />
<br />
The reason I didnt get aggro, is because on my paladin, I stunned alot before I tried to slow, to gain aggro on the pally.<br />
<br />
I landed mini Malo then slowed, I also would land a poison dot and incapacitate.<br />
<br />
Dogdog went to town and helped a little when the paladin engaged.<br />
<br />
Thats about it, exp wasn't super great or anything for me at 46, but it was ok. Grouping with 2 lvl 61's and a lvl 60, I think they got the lion share of exp.</div></div><hr />
