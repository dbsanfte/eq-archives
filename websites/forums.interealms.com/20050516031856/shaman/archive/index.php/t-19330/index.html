<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Groxb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a question for other Shaman out there.  Do ya cast regeneration on other group members who obviously do not need it (basically, anyone except Shaman and Necromancers)?  This is looking at things before you get your group version, which then it becomes just as easy to cast the group version as it is for the single.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't and I don't understand why others do.  I can't stand it when tanks ask for it.  What is my reasoning?  Shaman and Necromancers use regeneration as a means to replenish their health without requiring a direct heal - therefore, a method to generate mana without large amounts of mana in return (just the mana cost of regeneration).  I specifically tell the Clerics/healers in my group not to heal me unless I am being attacked and under 50% life.  Tanks on the other hand are being healed every few seconds, so what's the point of the regeneration?  It's not going to save the Cleric any mana.  When the tank's health reaches a certain point, the Cleric is going to heal regardless of whether the tank has regeneration or not.  Regeneration isn't going to slow down the process of reaching this critical healing spot when mobs are hitting in the 200's per attack and he is only regenerating 5-25 HP every six seconds.  I am not talking about when the Cleric is meditating and the group is waiting, and even if I was, I would just toss a direct heal to those in need oppose to regeneration.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one like this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always use group regen whenever I do ldon. I usually do hard missions w/ cleric and group regen + divine arbitration is an extremely efficent way to heal.<br />
<br />
If I do easy missions as the only healer I rarely have to heal, I just slow/nuke and let regen do the most of the healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Regen isn't an amazing effect but it does help.  If a caster gets whacked once or twice, you can just ignore it and let the regen heal them.  Regen isn't going to save a tanks life, but it does make it a little bit easier to keep them healed if you aren't using CH.  Melee caught a riposte, or took some damage from a DS?  Regen will handle it.  I just cast blessing of replenishment while we're buffing before an adventure and it usually lasts for all or most of the adventure.  You'd be pretty surprised how much a significant amount of regen can help.  Blessing of replenishment, wind of marr, and characters that are getting close to the worn regen cap = very little healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Last night for the first time in one of my grps the MT clicked it off to free up a buff slot.  You're right, when a mob hits for 900, 25pts a tick doesn't do diddly.<br />
<br />
But its handy for everyone else in the party - helps with damage from AEs and DSs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Jinheim, your guild page is a freaking riot.<br />
<br />
Back to topic, though.  I'd say at least 60% of the time, regen is useless (outside of the cases mentioned above) - or, rather, makes so little difference that it has no discernable effect.  Much like agility.  Unless you're a necro or a shaman, I will treat a request for regen exactly as I would a request for agility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">This is looking at things before you get your group version <br />
<br />
Pre-group version, self and Necro only are the only people in a FULL group who should be receiving it. Maybe if you are trio'ing it may be worth it to counter healing on a caster who catches a little aggro, for example a wizard who overnukes in a trio, gets a round or two of damage and drops to 75% hp. Regen would make up that difference quite quickly without any expenditure. (I began writing about how Tnargs would be a waste of mana.... Tnargs is 63, group regen is 56, clever troll :P)<br />
<br />
Even when fighting a mob with an AE (Pre-56, pretty low number of mobs) I cant really justify the quite monstrous mana cost of single regenerating an entire group, made worse by the lack of extended AA's to improve its efficiency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Depending on the situations, if I have the spell up and xtra mana I'll hit the tanks with it, although I am normally somewhat wary to give it to tanks, cuz ones I give it to them they scream when it wears off(then they ask for a agi buff :/ ) I like to give it to casters for the same reason as mentioned above you can just ignore the heal and they'll heal up eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dalarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At 51, I start off an adventure with Chloro up on me, the tank, and the puller. If a melee besides the tank takes some riposte, I toss it on them. Then, when my mana goes to @#^$ from a lovely 6 resist pull, I keep Chloro up on me, and the MT as mana permits.<br />
<br />
Keeping chloro up on the MT makes sense to me, next to a shaman (cann) and a necro (lich) they will get the most use out of it since they are the one getting smacked all the time. A direct heal only gets him to 100% until the next smack. Regeneration on the MT increases the time needed between CHs (along with giving the cleric and I a small fudge factor with CH and a slow-resisting mob), which lessens the mana/minute expenditure of the cleric, which lets the cleric do other things besides sit on her ass, which makes for a happier, better adjusted cleric. Now when mobs are doing ridiculous DPS even after being slowed, then yes, it becomes a bit less useful, but by that time its a group spell so it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Group regen is always on. There are always at least 2 people who can benefit from it (regen seems to follow the group version costs the same as 2 casts of single for some reason) directly and like it was mentioned earlier, it takes care of that person who grabs aggro for a sec and takes a poke or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My druid had skipped buying Blessing of Replenishment for a long time, but LDoN changed that. Frequent largish pulls and the annoying traps means that everyone with an available buff slot actually gets something out of it.<br />
<br />
My wife plays a ranger and she'll actually throw heals on me when I'm pulling in LDoN (with my paladin that is); this will sometimes pull a mob or two off of me and bring them to her - which is good, actually. If she gets knocked down a bub or so of health, she'll regen it before the fight is over without a direct heal. Ditto for my druid who might get hit twice in a fight due to heal aggro.<br />
<br />
With single pulls in controlled situations (e.g., much of PoP), there's no reason to put regen on many party members, but LDoN makes it more valuable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">When I'm with a PU group, I use grp regen.  I say if you got a problem with buff slots, click it off.  It gives them the choice and it is an extremely effective form of heal even if it does very little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">When a 'chanter is around to dispense it, do you like doing exp or raid without KEI or C5? Of course not. Sure, we can do it. Probably better than many other classes. But it's not pleasant... we have to be more careful with our mana.<br />
<br />
In my experience, most melee (baring the masochist and the morons) don't like going without regen either when it available. No, 25HP/tick isn't likely top save the main tank... But again, it might. And it'll top off everyone while they don't have aggro without the actual healer having to spend mana for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It might just be my LDoN groups but people aren't dispelling the damage shields the mobs have because they die too fast. Which means the melee are getting eaten, not enough to need a heal but enough to be an annoyance. Because of that they get regen. But I have group regen so its just a matter of herding the cats into a space where they'll all be hit by the spell. Pre-group regen, though it was a ton of mana, I still tried to keep it up on anyone that was taking damage (ae, ds or the occasional riposte etc.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">with few exceptions, ie encounters where buff slots really max out and are at a premium.  I will always cast group regen on my group, whether it be a raid group or LDoN, regardless of the classes in my group.  I am a very big fan of regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I used to be a big fan of regen until lvl 60, and with pop I don't think too highly of it. Sure I will cast it but I don't think the effect it has is that major and seems like a waste of mana and effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always have regen on the group as well. Not so much for the tanks (though every little bit does help in the long run) but more for myself and the casters. When mobs are hitting for 900 or so, the cleric is focused on keeping the tanks alive, and though group heals are nice, regen goes a long way for the low hit point casters standing there in the bathrobes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Group replen is up all the time.  I am pretty much always with a bard for exp groups and between the 2 of us, our combined regen heals pretty much any incidental damage.  For example, in LDON hards, Divine Arbitration is often used to keep the puller from dying on the pull heh.   So we all take some small amount of damage.  Not really worthy of a heal, when regen will bring most of it back by the end of the fight.   I notice immediately when regen drops because group members health is lingering below 100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, on topic with single target regen, my answer is no.  I only regen me and the necro.  Takes too damn long and costs to much to regen a 6 man group.  I use to regen the MT every once in a while when I had the extra mana, but then when !@#$ hits the fan and I'm canni-ing back from near complete oom said MT never fails to /gsay regen down.  refresh please.<br />
<br />
Frankly, every &quot;buff down&quot; I hear makes me grow ten days older, and by current count I'm around 210 years old.  knowing that casting regen on the MT sparks the possibility of another &quot;buff down&quot; I don't even bother any more.  <br />
<br />
Might all change when I get group regen though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Regen is good.<br />
<br />
The single target versions are a bit mana intensive to maintain on an entire group (plus casting over and over and over is sucky), but the group versions are very nice.  Especialy when combined with a bard in the party.  It made it possible to ignore damage to anyone who wasnt taking direct hits from a mob... the ocasional riposte or ae or momentary agro just didnt matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">For single cast versions, you're right.  At lower levels, the duration and mana cost make it unfavorable for anyone not regularly getting beat on or using it for mana regen.<br />
<br />
However, don't underestimate the value of stacking group regen with other regen buffs.  I have been in LDoN groups as the main healer when we had bard regen, necro group lifetaps, Spiritual Domination and Spirit of the Wood all running and only had to heal maybe 3-4 times the whole adventure.<br />
<br />
Like FT, it all adds up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I use group replenishment a fair amount.<br />
<br />
If I'm main healer for group i always use group regen, makes our healing with Q ~8% more effective (people spend a lot of time/plat/aa to gain 8%..), and you get one canni4 every 36secs 'free'. Duration is acceptable too with SCRM.<br />
<br />
I always view regen like ft, over a single 40sec fight it make no difference, over an hour it adds up.<br />
<br />
25hp a tick, 250hp a min, 15000hp an hour. In a six man group, thats a potential 90khp/hour you heal just by keeping BoR up.<br />
<br />
It is your job as prime shaman to make sure your groupmates are constantly overwhelmed and off tanking so they can recieve the full benefit from your regen spells.. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I always keep group replen going because I want regen on me to go along with canni, it's cheap long term healing for incidental wounds, and some other classes benefit from regen for mana conversion (necros and anyone that's using mod rods).<br />
<br />
I will also occasionally put replen on damaged pets as it can be cheaper than any other kind of pet heal, particularly when pets aren't taking frequent damage OR if pets are being used for crowd control.  I'd rather use my easily replenished mana for heals and let a more DPS oriented class stick to doing damage rather than heal their pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Always up here as well, unless I get distracted and forget cause of &quot;FA plz&quot; tells :rolleyes:<br />
Its a nice amount of potential healing, the group version isnt that much mana really for the effect, and it helps mod rodding, riposte damage taking, knuckle dragging, no car driving clerics that like to get in teh face.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Damage shields, incidental damage, pullers, modrods, etc.  All these are reasons to keep group regen up, if possible.  If you have one melee and the rest of the group is casters (sans mage) dont bother.</div></div><hr />
