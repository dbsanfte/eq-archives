<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>faulcker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I partner with my roommate, a 61 sk with a bunch of AAs.<br />
<br />
Lately, we have been killing deep in the Dulak Caves killing the luggards.  It's okay ex, slow, but safe and never camped.<br />
<br />
We also crawl through the Torg mines near the Dulak entrance killing the miners in the back that are DB and sometimes the Bloodguards in the bridge room.<br />
<br />
We can usually get about a blue an hour, sometimes a bit more.  <br />
<br />
Any other places we can go?  We are quite an efficient duo since we've partnered for a long time.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just hit 59, and Ive been duoing with a SK that just hit 60 in PoV at the undead huts since I was 58 and he was 57.<br />
<br />
Mobs are yellow and red to me at 59 but are managable with slow/cripple.  Since I scribed Pox the fights just got easier.  With a SK I can stack Bane, pox, Ebolt and Plague on the skelly and not even have it look in my direction.<br />
<br />
Usually getting somewhere in the area of 1% ever kill, sometimes less.  AA is about 4% a kill.</div></div><hr />
