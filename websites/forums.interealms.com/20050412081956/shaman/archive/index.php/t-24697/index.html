World of Warcraft® Final Stress Test FAQ <br />
<br />
What is the final stress test? <br />
The final stress test is an additional phase of testing that the developers have deemed necessary in order to prepare the game for open beta. Those who play in the final stress test will be helping to finalize the game code so that it is ready for deployment in the open beta phase. <br />
<br />
Will I have full access to the World of Warcraft game? <br />
The version of the game in the final stress test will be very similar to the closed beta version, and will include nearly all of the content that will be in the game for the open beta. However, because the game is still being optimized, there may be some lag and performance issues. Please bear with us and remember that although you will be playing a version that seems very polished and complete, it is in fact a stress test and will not always play optimally. <br />
<br />
If I was in the first stress test beta, will I get to reuse my old account and characters? <br />
Because we are testing a new version of the game and account creation process, we will need you to create a new account and new characters to play in the final stress test. Additionally, because the final stress test is a new version of the game, all accounts and characters from the first stress test beta would have been incompatible with the final stress test and were thus deleted. <br />
<br />
Are you charging people to play the final stress test? <br />
Blizzard is not charging a fee to play the final stress test or the open beta. However, to help defray the costs associated with distributing a large number of files and to keep our focus on finalizing World of Warcraft, we have partnered with FilePlanet for the distribution of the final stress test client, which is only available to FilePlanet subscribers. Subscription to FilePlanet carries with it a nominal fee. <br />
<br />
Once the final stress test is over, will I be able to play in the open beta? <br />
If you participate in the final stress test, your account will automatically be carried over to the open beta. You do not need to take any action. Instead, when the final stress test ends, you will be able to continue playing by logging into the open beta servers. <br />
<br />
Will I get to carry my characters from the final stress test to the open beta? <br />
Yes. If you play in the final stress test, your characters and account will simply transfer to the open beta. <br />
<br />
Will you charge people to play the open beta? <br />
No, the World of Warcraft open beta is absolutely free. Blizzard is not charging a fee for you to play the open beta. <br />
<br />
What is the open beta? <br />
As World of Warcraft gets closer to completion, we will need to conduct one last phase of beta testing for final balancing and bug fixing. This phase of testing is the open beta. Many final aspects of the game are being implemented in their most complete form in the open beta, and we will need this time to test these elements as rigorously as possible to ensure that they are completed for the game’s launch. <br />
<br />
When does the World of Warcraft final stress test begin? <br />
The final stress test begins on November 1, 2004. <br />
<br />
How will I know if I get into the final stress test? <br />
You will be contacted by e-mail letting you know that you do indeed have a spot in the final stress test. <br />
<br />
How long will the final stress test last? <br />
The exact duration of the World of Warcraft final stress test is undetermined, but we expect that it will last for approximately five to seven days. <br />
<br />
Do I need to sign up for the final stress test before it starts? <br />
No, there are no early signups. When the final stress test begins, signups for it will open at the same time. <br />
<br />
Can I sign up for the stress test if I am not a FilePlanet subscriber? <br />
The final stress test is only available to FilePlanet subscribers. However, the open beta phase will begin shortly after the final stress test ends, and is available to anyone with an Internet connection. <br />
<br />
Will I be able to start playing right away? <br />
Yes. After you sign up, you will receive an email confirmation soon thereafter containing your authentication key and instructions for downloading the World of Warcraft client and creating an account. After you follow those steps and create an account, you can log into the game and begin playing. <br />
<br />
What do I do with my authentication key? <br />
Your authentication key is needed to verify your acceptance into the final stress test. You will be asked to provide this key during the account-creation process. <br />
<br />
Will I need to connect to the Internet to play? <br />
Yes, you need to connect to the Internet to take part in the World of Warcraft final stress test. <br />
<br />
Will there be a Mac version of the final stress test available? <br />
Yes. This final stress test is for both Mac and PC users. <br />
<br />
Who can participate in the final stress test and open beta test? <br />
The final stress test and open beta are available for players in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States. <br />
<br />
I’m having issues with the game – whom do I contact? <br />
Please use the support options located at www.worldofwarcraft.com/support. <br />
<br />
I’m having trouble with my authentication key. Whom do I contact? <br />

I tried to sign up but the damn form, after I click on &quot;SUBMIT&quot; takes me to YOU MUST BE A FILEPLANET MEMBER TO USE THIS FEATURE.  Well, dammit, I AM a fileplanet member...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Laguna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah i signed up for this and payed the 15 dollars.  I got an email confirmation but there is no direct link to where I can sign up or download WOW.  Whats worse is the customer support link is down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On their website there is a link, find the part of the website that has the newest files. I saw it there earlier today.<br />
<br />
BTW there is a Basic signup where its like 7 bux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I got it figured out.  Getting about 75kbps on the download.  Should finish late tonight.. I'm thinking 2-3am-ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm still having problems with Fileplanet. Signed up the wife and myself so we'd be guaranteed spots in the beta (stress and open), but it won't let me complete the actual stress test sign up for her now.<br />
<br />
This is really frustrating. Almost to the point of cancelling my fileplanet subscription and saying 'to hell with it'.</div></div><hr />

Everything seems to be getting hammered like crazy. Man FP is gonna make but also lose a lot of money cause ppl are having so many problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks, Divinator - signed up for $7.90 (x2) so now with any luck I'll be playing WoW all day tomorrow (other than voting, of course!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Laguna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Wondering if that file for the open beta test is the same as for the stress test. I'm still waiting for word back from planet file.  Anyone download the planet file version yet?  How long did it take and what is it called?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heh heh, people paying to play open Beta. Think I'll just buy the game.<br />
<br />

The client being distributed by Blizzard via BT and the client downloaded from FP are identical. Confirmed by Blizzard HERE.<br />
<br />
Grab whichever is easiest for you. I'm almost done with the FP download myself. The BT distribution I tried earlier in the evening last night was painfully slow. I don't mind paying for BANDWIDTH from fileplanet to download faster (which is all you're really paying for Faern :)). To each  his own. I'll be playing WoW for a good 3 weeks before you as will many others. Stay in the dark ages if you want bud. You get what you pay for I guess. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yar.  It's all about your level of desperation for this (or any new) game.  I'm fairly antsy to play something, and EQ just ain't doin it for me anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Definatly.<br />
<br />
Ive been bored at home with nothing to do. This will give me 3 weeks of WoW before release which is fine by me for 8 bux.</div></div><hr />
