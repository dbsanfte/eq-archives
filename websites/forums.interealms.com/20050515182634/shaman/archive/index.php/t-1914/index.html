<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarek Ravnos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Caster balancing isn't done, far from it in fact. We're very aware of it, and it's a priority of ours to finish. I understand that it's taking more time than players would like, and it's definately taking more time than I hoped to get it out to live servers.<br />
<br />
I see a lot of posts saying how easy caster balance would be to do, or &quot;here's one thing that would help us a lot and is quick to do!&quot;. Honestly, I wish that were true. I'd be very happy to have caster balance done and get on to the next improvements and additions to the game. <br />
<br />
The fact is though, while small changes for each class are pretty obvious and easy to do, the bigger picture has to be maintained all the time. I've learned from the process so far that it's not good to release things bit by bit - the average player wants to know the big picture for each change as it happens. How does this change affect me? What do other classes get out of it? Will my class see more changes? Is caster balancing done now? I get these questions every day, and see them posted on community boards all over when any small change is made.<br />
<br />
For example, we've got some plans to improve healing versatility for the priest classes. To do that correctly, all classes that can heal need to be looked at to see how they'll be impacted. Give one class a better heal and all the other healing classes look at how it affects them. The new heal spell may make perfect sense when looking at the class that got it, but any class that didn't get it has immediate concern about why they didn't also get it, how it makes them less wanted in a given situation, and how they now need something to make up for the other class getting a new heal. This means that before we can alter a single small part of healing, we need to have answers for players about the plans for healing across every class.<br />
<br />
This gets more complex because no class has just one single ability. So, say (hypothetically) that we add a better heal to druids. Clerics are immediately concerned because druids are now healing better- what do clerics get? Wizards grow concerned because now not only can druids nuke pretty well, they also can heal even better than previously, making them a potentially better deal for a group or raid looking for members. No matter how small a change is, it causes ripples throughout the game, the player base, and all the community message boards. When it comes to class balancing, no change is really a small change.<br />
<br />
So, on to the point - We're still working on caster balance, and intend to make the necessary improvements. We expect the additional changes to pets to be done soon, and then intend to focus on priests for a bit. We've been keeping up with the message boards and community feedback, so we've got a good handle on the concerns of various classes. Thanks for the continued interest and patience as we try to get this implemented in the best way possible.<br />

What does this mean for the shaman class?  What heals are ya'll expecting?  What heals do you need or want?  Are your heals simply inadequate pre 60?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">either a mini topor, or a 900point heal around the 54th level, and a cleric stackable AC buff. <br />
<br />
and of course rez/cheal/port/ice comet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Honestly, our heals are inadequate at 60 too.  Torpor is immensly powerful in group, but we can't heal out of group at all.  Slowed yard trash in Cazic Thule does enough damage that all we can do with chloroplast is keep people alive--barely.  385 just doesn't cut the mustard.<br />
<br />
60s REALLY need an out of group heal that does more than 385.  Lower levels need some review.  There are huge gaps in levels where we have no increases in healing ability.  We get greater healing at level 29.  We then get superior healing at 51.  Greater healing isn't a whole lot of use in the 40's . . . .<br />
<br />
Some mid-range heal would be good about level 39, if that isn't too unbalancing.<br />
<br />
High-end shaman desperately need an out of group heal.  Torpor is superlative for our mana recovery, and in group heals as it balances a very good healing spell with some bad effects (snare and slow).  However, the shaman class is much weaker on raids.  Our damage is excrable since our DoTs are almost ALWAYS resisted on raids (or we die if they aren't).  Few mobs seem to be susceptible to cold spells (and I think we have the lowest DD spell of any pure caster class), and torrent of poison has an obscene resist rate and is also AoE.  Basically, on raids (after buffing, of course), we debuff/slow, and then try to back-up heal with inadequate resources.<br />

I wonder if this is in reference to us as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't really agree on the need for better lower heals.  I functioned as the main healer for groups on a regular basis, and did good - all the way up to 51.  From 51 to 53, I was simply inadequate for the job - but, that was before they moved Superior Heal from 54 to 51.<br />
<br />
And even at 55+, Superior Heal still does more than Chloroblast - it just takes a bit longer to cast, and is a bit less mana efficient, so most people don't use it.<br />
<br />
Let me put it this way...  60th Shaman &amp; 58th Monk almost killed a Guardian Wurm, using Torpor &amp; Chloroblast for healing.  We got it down to about 5-10% before the healing aggro got too high &amp; it jumped me.  With me dead, my friend didn't last long.  If I had thought about keeping Root up, we might have done it.</div></div><hr />

*proofreadingkthxkrak*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, shamans rock.  We are probably one of the most powerfull soloers, although not the most efficient. We easilly find groups,  and can adapt to a few different rolls.  In raids, we are vital, but we don't scale past 3 shamans very well.   I think Verant has neglected us a bit lately because the problems with the class are miniscule compared to others.  So onto the problems.  Each rated with my view of the game impact on game play and impact on balancing (0 - 5)<br />
<br />
<br />
Out-of group healing:  1<br />
<br />
This fix is easy.  Restrict topor to being a GUILD only spell as opposed to group only.  I don't imagine this would be too dificult, and would not overpower topor.  It would make shamans scale on guild raids since we could be backup healers instead of strictly buff/debuff.<br />
<br />
Balancing concerns:  Druids and clerics may complain, but considering the side effects of topor are still very present, I don't imagine this would cause too much complaints.<br />
<br />
Alchemy/Port:  3<br />
Make alchemy prices reasonable.  Port potions should be priced at around 70-100pp a pop and there should be a few more destinations that are worth while.  Atleast 1 per continent.<br />
<br />
Alchemy/Clarity: 3<br />
Don't make clarity potions useless.  Keep the trivial rate high, but drop the price.  30pp for a clarity regen rate potion would make a market for these.   Saying that this would imbalance the game is garbage, considering it would still be more efficient both cost wise and mana regen wise to go buy C3 off of an enchanter before you go out.<br />
<br />
Alchemy/stat: 1<br />
Make stat potions desireable.  You could do almost anything here.  drop the price, remove the negative stats, whatever.<br />
<br />
If the above alchemy things are fixed, I could almost see a shaman putting AA Points into  alchemy.<br />
<br />
DOT Agro: 1<br />
<br />
The agro generated by dot's are rediculous.  If I cast 2 dots on amob, and do maybe 10% of the damage to the mobs health with 4 mele attacking it,  I will tank it all fight long.  This is regardless of when in the fight I apply the dots.   I don't really mind this, but if dot's generated less agro they could be used more efficiently.  Doesn't effect necros since they can FD.  Anyone else notice this?  <br />
<br />
AA Abilities:<br />
Our AA abilities are.... un-impressive.  A shaman with tons of AA abilities has very little that a freshly 60 shaman has.  If you look at ANY(1) other class, there DPS or Healing ablitlity goes up DRAMATICLY in some form or another.<br />
<br />
Rabid bear:  1<br />
Reduce refresh time on this so it leaves the realm of toy.<br />
<br />
Dot's:  3<br />
It would be nice to have SCR effect our dot's.  Make another ability if required.  This would make us significatly more efficient soloers.  Another change could be to increase the DPS of our dots by 5/10/15%<br />
<br />
Healing:  Don't remove Topor from quickbuff/SCR.<br />
<br />
<br />
New  AA Pet:  5<br />
This is more of my dream pet.  Will probably never get implemented....  I think it would be great if we could get a pet that had around  3k HP's, and all it did was taunt.  Sort of a crowd control pet.  Maybe proc something that was higly resisted just to generate agro.   It would be an awesome tool for the highend game, especially with all the new un-mezzable mobs out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, lunch is over.   Maybe I left the realm of reasonable....  What do you think?  Do you really see any of these abilities being un-balancing?  You think VI will do anything for us?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well if we get a better heal, all cleric will kill us hehe<br />
<br />
The only problem I see about our class (butI m prolly wrong) is how we stacking in raids. Beside buffing (not for every pull) and slowing (usually once per pull), there is nothing to do.. not even heal if the MT and the cleric do their jobs )<br />
<br />
so what is doing the 3rd shaman ? damage ? how ?<br />
3 way to do damage : Nuke, melee and dot..<br />
A better nuke ? what for ? poison and cold resisted way too much on luclin (and cold on velious lol). And I don't think it would be a good idea to get a fire/magic nuke. We are not wizards.<br />
Our nukes sucks, we all learn to live without anyway.<br />
<br />
A better DoT ? prolly great for soloing or xp group but I doubt in large raid it would works. The first shaman to land it will win and if the raid need to switch of target during the fight, be prepared to tank the doted mob or to heal your chanter )<br />
And except boss mob, mob usually die in less than 1 min anyway.. <br />
<br />
Melee? hmm I don't see how they could improve our damage output without giving us melee skills that would really makes us Gods (double attack ? raising melee skills and def skills ? riposte ? ).. Even rabid bear is not that great to improve our DPS meleeing (note that I'd really love meleeing better but..).<br />
Hehe even with chanter best haste, we can't beat a JBB if not resisted.. <br />
Or maybe a new line of spell call spirit of conan, self only, that gives 100% haste, double attack, crit, backstab, boost all  melee and def skills to 250 at 60 and last like 2 hours :D   <br />
<br />
I'd personally prefer seeing things fixed.. like the things that are pissing me :<br />
- primal essence.. I will never cast that spell but I want it in my book.<br />
- grow and shrink outdoor.<br />
- puppy buff that really worth casting it.<br />
- group cha that spell is too 00ber remove it from the game please !!! ;)<br />
- Malosini out of the drop table of the 60ish mobs<br />
- Avatar using a fishing grubb instead of an emerald.<br />
- primal avatar now summoning fishing grubbs because it was not fair to put our *cough* best stat buff with atk buff *cough* as a proc on a weapon ;) <br />
- alchemy improved with usefull or/and fun effect.<br />
- neg effect on potion removed on stat potion.<br />
- new graphics for bear form (for the 2 spells.. greater bear &gt;&gt; newbie bear form).<br />
- tribunal quest implemented (I feel 00ber with my summon hammer necklace !! woot ).<br />
- potion gate to shar val (poor kitty shammy).<br />
- UP shaman and cleric armor .. move that loot on gnoll in blackburrow please.. it will be better for the risk vs reward.<br />
- improved invisibility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Would it be too much to ask that 60 shamans get that 900pt heal the 60 druids get?<br />
<br />
How about making avatar componentless and add something to primal and ancient to distinguish them.  Maybe make primal 110 instead of 100?<br />
<br />
Group torpor?  Probably far too much to ask, but it would be in line with the other kinds of spells we get.  Hmmm... I really wonder if we'd use this much.<br />
<br />
A bigger woofie would be nice :)<br />
<br />
More gate potions cheaper would be nice, but Planes of Power promises more auto-ports than ever before.  This would make any gate potion, no matter where it went to, less saleable, and more for personal use.<br />
<br />
Just in case they were thinking about it, DON'T MAKE US FORAGE FOR COMPONENTS!  I'd rather spend time on my shaman than on my foraging twink.<br />
<br />
Primal Essence IS a miniavatar.  Make it a spell if you must, I guess, along with a group form version, too.  And not off the Itraer Vius, thanks.<br />
<br />
How about an class AA ability Fleet of Foot (give it to druids too if you feel like it) ... makes your cast sow effect a little bit faster.  Or a bunch faster, also applicable to group sow :)<br />
<br />
How about another class AA ability Fleet of Feet... run 6, in effect.<br />
<br />
How about a bear animation where you can tell from the inside if you're sitting or standing?  I don't really care what it looks like from the outside... just a perceptible change in vision height would do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Having Topor only group castable is stupid now. Verant really have no reason if you can just click it off. Heck, if the one or two ticks of being snared is enough to kill you then hopefully the 300-600 hps you get would be enough to save you.<br />
<br />
From around 40 to 52 greater heal couldn't cut it in chain pulling groups. For that I needed either a cleric, druid, enchanter or bard.  After that Regrowth sort of filled the void and I could keep up provided we weren't trying anything too hard. Never had a Fungi, but the Ikky BP kept me around Troll/Iksar level.<br />
<br />
I really want Alchemy fixed though. Sure I mightn't be uber and have to deal with sucky raid stacking. I'm in a small guild and not 60 so I spend most of my time on druid duty (stand, heal, med). I still really want Alchemy fixed.<br />
<br />
Port potions that didn't cost 250pp to buy would be nice. So would a semi-cheap self casting haste, and regen potions have the potential to make more money than anything else in the game (9 of 10 melees are twinked soloers).<br />
<br />
Mini-Torpor would be cool if it did something stupid like Blind the target (can't cast out of group anyway).<br />
<br />
- Beeg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The biggest problem that I see is on raids - we just can't get<br />
enough clerics. Post 60 the things you want to do virtually<br />
REQUIRE the Cleric complete heal circle technique. Don't have<br />
enough Clerics that showed up? Too bad, go play in the kiddie<br />
pool. This isn't class interdependance, it's a stranglehold. <br />
<br />
If Torpor was insta-cast, that would help. Still not as good as<br />
complete heal, with the hitpoints Warrior's have these days <br />
that's only half a complete heal, and it's over time. You'd still <br />
rather have a Cleric fill this role, but a Shaman would be good <br />
enough in a pinch. Also, if we could cast it outside of our group. <br />
It's a benificial buff - it can always be clicked off if the recipient <br />
doesn't like the snare effect. <br />
<br />
Spirit of Scaled Wolf upgrade - How about one with Cheatah<br />
speed? Not as fast as a Bard, but good enough to make<br />
traveling accross half a dozen zones reasonable for the casual<br />
player. You don't invite Bards to your group just for their traveling<br />
ability, do you? It would still fail if you cast or attack. Not over-<br />
powering, be a real convenience. <br />
<br />
Alchemy - the port potions needs a drastic price cut to be made<br />
affordable. Also, there aren't enough places they can port you<br />
to. The two on Antonica are in good spots, what about Kunark,<br />
Velious, and Luclin? I'd like to see a few on each continent, but<br />
don't bother if the price isn't going to come down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-Better heal around lvl 44 <br />
<br />
Also, what does it mean by making torpor guild? can only cast it on people in your guild? wouldnt that be worse, cept on raids?  I mean, to heal you could only group w/ guildies.<br />
Or does having a spell be 'guild' make it work on both guild AND group?</div></div><hr />

I kept Torpor on him constantly and we had 3 shamans (including me) chain chloroing him while he was defensive and were able to keep up with the damage, though it burned lots of mana.<br />
<br />
When his defensive faded, he died.  That was just RAMPAGE healing.  That's backup healing, exactly the type of healing we should be doing.  <br />
<br />
For healing on raids, its cleric or crap ;).<br />
<br />
I'd really like to see a lvl 60 heal like celestial elixer or a lvl 60 heal that took alot of mana but healed alot.  400 mana for 900 point heal would even be pretty freaking nice.  We need SOME way to backup heal effectively.</div></div><hr />

So what if it's a 1k+ heal; it's over time.  With warriors having 6-7kish HP these days and with how hard upper end mobs hit, how is a cleric going to cry about an improved heal for shamans?  CH is still the most powerful spell out there.  Make sure it's DL/CE friendly too, otherwise it'll make it half-way worthless on raids (when patch healing MT or whoever).<br />
<br />
Personally, I think clerics will praise something of this sort.  Like previous posts, clerics &quot;make or break&quot; a raid.  It'll ease up the pressure for clerics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I am ok with how shamans are now but there are some things that could be changed to make us a bit better:<br />
<br />
AA:<br />
<br />
1st group of skills are fine :) 2nd is so so and 3rd pretty much sucks except CannV. If Verant doesnt see us as a pet class why do we get a pet skill in the 3rd group???<br />
<br />
Spells:<br />
<br />
Avatar is messed up. Its just wrong that it is better to have it as proc than a real spell. The proc on the weapons should cost a diamond or something else that is not vendor buyable and the actual spell should have memming/recast lowered. I would almost accept it if they lowered the effect of the normal Avatar spell a bit and left PA and the procs at 100. Just make it so that I dont have a level 60 spell I never use :)<br />
<br />
Are we less of a pet class than a melee class like shadowknights? If not why dont we get a better pet at 60? The pet buff Spirit Quickening is annoying - slow to mem and short duration for very little effect.<br />
<br />
Malosi/Malosini checking against one of the resists they are intended to lower is not that smart. Maybe they could change it so that the spells are lure-type and adjust the fizzlerate so that over time it is still difficult to lower resists.<br />
<br />
Skills:<br />
<br />
Several alchemy potions like ports could definately do with a change.<br />
<br />
An increased cap in defense would be great too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm now saving for a JBB, and maybe I'll get round to completing my epic.  Thats a shame, because I'd much rather be a shaman than a self-propelled collection of right-clicky things.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">You have to keep in mind that they WANT class dependence, NOT independence. They have already mitigated dependence quite a bit, let's not make clerics totally useless other then rez biotches. If we get better healing, clerics should get something in return because pretty much all clerics can do is heal and rez. And I think you are asking for trouble if you ask them to mess with torpor, I guarentee if they change it from group only and/or remove adverse effects, they will make it take more mana. Maybe some of you don't care, personally I like the low mana cost. However they definately should remove the healing penalty. If they give us a better direct heal (which I am not opposed to), they will also have to give the Druids a Torpor like spell, nothing operates in a vacuum in EQ, or shouldn't. A better DD would be nice or stacking DOTs. Not something we need to have to make us viable however.<br />
<br />
Takk, I was using Torpor last night with apell reinforcement of 30% and it was lasting about 29-30 seconds so it is still working.<br />
<br />
Crusty, I am not sure what you mean when you say &quot;playing my shaman as I think it ought to be played: by casting slow, dots and tanking with my doggie accompanying me.&quot;. I do that all the time. Granted I do have my epic and a JBB but there are places where the JBB doesn't work or you need time to recover mana instead of wasting time for a JBB to fire off and in those situations I just DOT and canni/Torpor. Also, I didn't get JBB/Epic until 54+ so until then I used those methods all the time. I guess you have high expectations for efficiency? Hell I didn't get a fungi until 59, I would have been WAY more efficient if I had one but I still did fine.</div></div><hr />

Alchemy: this is the most broken crap I've seen in a while.  1-80 worthwhile doing.  Pays itself off and I like being able to make resist potions.  Past that.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Stackablity:  This IS my number one complaint.  2 Shamans cover everything in a raid pretty quick.  3 is almost always overkill.  Either a nuke that isnt' completely resisted in most zones or something of the like is in order.  I just want to HELP darn it.<br />

Also a level 60 direct heal for 900hp costing 400 mana with a 3.5 second cast time and 1.5 refresh would be great.   Though I think clerics need a 2000hp heal at 60 costing 400 mana with a 5second cast time and 1 refresh.  Would close the gap from DL to CH nicely.<br />

I know, but they still should get it. Maybe at level 44, but sometime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Personally I agree with Litch. I think they should give clerics a 3-4k heal that takes 6.4 sec and costs 325 mana at lvl 60. So that should satisfy there need for a class defining heal that is way more powerful and mana efficient than anything we could dream of.  With that done they could give shamans a lvl 57 620 hp heal that is slightly better mana ratio than SH with a useable cast time. I would be happy with that on the healing department.<br />
Also, clerics have virtually NO aa skills worth taking save for the standard AE buff and casting reinforecment. The 100% exp res should be a full time passive 99% res (rangers get endless quiver!) <br />
Other than that, i wouldnt mind a more powerful DD that isnt resisted by every damn mob in the game. what happened to the much rumored poison based DD that was going to be in the neighborhood of 800 points of damage? I dont want to be a druid but that weak ice DD is pretty much worthless. I have to plan ahead of time to start casting it since its a 7 sec cast time. make the poison a 6 sec cast and 300+ mana. How about a AE disease cloud so i can actually use insideous decay for something other than a debuff on AL to counter AE dispell. <br />
In the end i guess i really just want a better heal which means the clerics should get one to. I'd be happy then!</div></div><hr />

Um, invis potions are not stackable and cost money. They are a far cry from having the spell. Their tactical use is due to the instant cast time.<br />

I don't *trust* them more than my own spell persay, but I do carry a couple for sticky situations where freaking invis drops right as I'm in the middle of a big room of things that don't like me - I've always figured if I instantly hit teh invis potion I might be able to stop them from aggroing me - not sure if it works, but I carry a couple on me just in case, plus since my fiance is a cleric, I can give one to her if she has to do a CR or something where she needs invis... give it to her, cast invis, and then let her go... if (when) my invis fails, she can instantly re-invis with that.</div></div><hr />

say a warrior is tanking AoW and some shaman casts torpor on him.....it takes him a while probably to realize he's torpor'd and during that time he's slowed and loses precious taunt. the snare effect could also easily get other people killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">thing is, i barely need a cleric to back me up as it is, most places i can heal just fine, a cleric tagging along risks just nuking if low dmg mobs, mebbe a cheal once every 10 mins. at the same time we need large amounts of clerics for raids, and... very few shm's.<br />
<br />
we dont deserve much, hell, we're godly already, i can do cc/heals/speeds/dmg as well, if not quite up to the more specialized classes.<br />
<br />
i was duoing with a monk today, well equipped if not quite amongst the best, i was nearly up to his dmg on single pulls, outdid him by far if 2 mobs.(ok, i had kei, and i'm well equipped, but still)<br />
<br />
making us stack on raids is just.. hard. unless they add some new ability types(i cant think of any) or increase clerics utility from being just healer/rezzer(i dont count buffs as a utility as such, unless it's mana or hp regen/dmg output related).<br />
<br />
it wouldnt be fair to give us a mana efficient/low casting time higher heal, it would devastate druids, and lower clerics need in xp grps more(yes, give druids a better heal, then what? you're killing off clerics, give them better nukes? /wave wizards).<br />
<br />
i'm thinking more along the lines of a mebbe 1k hp heal, 8-9 sec casting time, 3-400 mana(yes, this would be a hefty penalty, but still viable for raids and in some specific xp grps) face it, on raids, we aint gonna save anyones ass if he gets aggro anyway, some dot/ae dmg, mebbe a few ripostes or a 1 sec aggro, clerics using rods etc is what we are more suited for, but cb just doesnt cut it.<br />
and torpor is too limited, no out of grp, no mt's and really really desperate if youre torporing a rogue :p<br />
<br />
<br />
this sound bad?<br />
<br />
oh, and fixing dot stackings will make about zero difference, theres still only 15 slots, they'd have to change that too for it to be of any real use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Suggestions from a 60th:<br />
<br />
1) Make the Healing Archtypes work with torpor without losing the quick buff component of torpor.<br />
<br />
2) Make Rabid Bear more useful.  Does it really unbalance shamans to make Rabid Bear perma?  It is not like you will do much more damage than with JBB/Winterstorm on normal mobs.  And at least for uber mobs, we can contribute with some damage.<br />
<br />
3) Give Shamans some melee Archtype/class skills.  Shamans were supposed to be melee like and they are a hybrid class.  Not necessarily to increased our attks, but how about to reflect our natural hardiness.  In reality, int casters can easily equal or surpass shamans in HP (let alone druid/cleric).  In roleplaying terms, shamans were supposed to be hardier etc.  This is reflected at 1st level when difference in stamina makes a difference, but not at 60th when +HP/stat items really determine everything.  For example, natural durability/mind body rejuvanation/etc.<br />
<br />
4) Pet Peeve: Dire Charm please.  Charm Animals was unintentionally nerfed a long time ago according to Verant.  We were promised some kind of replacement.  Seems silly that druids get dire charm and we dont.<br />
<br />
5) We need some kind of lure damage spell.  DOT/DD I don't care.  Shamans DO NOT stack well on raids.  Anything so we can help out a bit.  A DOT similar to Winged Death line but disesased based for cures.  I don't care if it does less damage or less mana efficient than our PoX line.  I just need something useful.  Lure based DD would be nice too :)<br />
<br />
6) PET.  Why give us pets anyway?  Our pets are extremely useful until the mid 50's till 60's.  Why?  Cause mobs of same level now have much high AC so our pet hardly touches them when you start reaching high levels.  Maybe a pet buff spell at 60th level would fix that which raised ATTK or a replacement pet.<br />
<br />
7) Out of group healing is messed up for shamans.  Hard to make torpor out of group because of negative effect.  So maybe make AA skill to get rid of torpor negative effects, make replacement spell, or just let us do it.  Is it unbalancing?  Not really.  Druids have better immediate heal spells.  Shamans have better Heal over Time (HoT?) spells .  Clerics equal or surpass them both in all aspects.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping they give uber mobs 2 buff tables: 1 debuffs 1 DoTs. Lets you put on 15 full dots and not interfere with debuffs of any kind. <br />
<br />
Problem with allowing say 2 of each DoT to stack is that you raise necromancers to godly status- not sure this would exactly be in the best interest of shamans.<br />

Personally, gear and spells are almost at a point of indifference to me. I'd like some flexibility is customizing my character, ie enchancing defensive skills or spell casting ability.<br />

Thats why I suggested that primal weapons and PA give a better effect than the regular spell. Then people with the primal weapons would still use that and some of the people without primal weapons has a chance of getting something almost as good. It just annoys me that there is a level 60 spell I actually have but never use.<br />

<br />
On the mob.. Shaman one cast malo as Shaman two cast Avatar on MA (unless he has primal of course).  Shaman one follows mage debuff message (malosini) with slow.  Shaman two does cripple I guess, even though it doesn’t appear to do much of anything.  Shaman one now applies spear dot and after a bit Bane.  Shaman two applies disease debuff and plague or pox (if he is one of the lucky few who have it).  One or both Shaman die.<br />
<br />
If you have a third Shaman you can put him/her in Cleric CoH grp and they can cast torpor should the Clerics need mod rods for mana.<br />
<br />
We do maybe 5 to 6 k damage to the mob.. And that is between all of the Shaman who are there.  Damn a wizard will do that with one cast and a single druid can do that easily with his dd spells and dots.<br />
<br />
1: Shaman was the only class that received no offensive increase with SoL.  I suspect it is the class that has seen the most decline in the number of people who play it, at level 60.  We need to be able to contribute to the damage done in a raid situation.  Give us decent  melee output (after all we are all of the large races).. give us stackable or more effective dots.. give us a new line of curse type spells.. I don’t care how just make it so we can help kill things in a raid situation.<br />
<br />
2: Alchemy is nothing but a joke.. Geeeeeesh, a bad joke at that.  All of our class defining spells are given away as weapon procs (avatar, shrink, slow) or as spells to other classes (slow, mala, cripple) with some minor reduction in the effectiveness.  Now,  you claim that giving us a mana regen potion, that would be useful, is somehow unbalancing.    Geeeesh you guys really do hate Shaman don’t you?<br />

Heals:<br />
Better ones would make me happy but not at the cost of nerfing Torpor. I dont see how they could give us a better heal and not nerf Torpor.<br />
<br />
DoTs/DD:<br />
Im tired of getting resisted by big mobs on these. Lower resists on these spells and maybe we could actually do some damage on a raid. And let DoTs from different people stack for crying out loud!<br />
<br />
Melee:<br />
Either a much lowered reuse time on Rabid Bear or increasing our melee skills in some form would be a great deal of fun. Not sure how practical it would be but I could live with no other changes if this happened.(Weird I think pure melee and hybrids are boring)<br />
<br />
Improved Invis:<br />
Invis has always worked fine for me. Rarely does it fail in a bad spot. But I dont invis alot of places either. The game is about risk and running through a nasty zone should not be without that risk. Shaman are a very self sustaining class and maybe this is a good limit on that.<br />
<br />
Avatar/Primals:<br />
I think the idea of Primal Avatar in the first place is if your guild can get Primal weapons then you can get the spell which doesnt cost the component. So for everyday grouping (at least on my server) this has no effect on me(I dont have PA). Be glad they proc Avatar if you are around them, that means you dont have to cast it on all of them and you get faster exp. No one groups with you just because of Avatar.<br />
<br />
I do think however that the recast time and duration of the spell should be changed. The cost of the component alone will keep you from casting it often anyway, unless of course you find a rich tank who is willing to pay for it to be cast every 6 minutes :) <br />
<br />
<br />
In the end it all comes down to VI having to balance an already powerful class. Normally balance sometimes means taking something away. If that happened we would scream &quot;Nerf!&quot; to high heaven and VI doesnt want to do that. It is going to be very hard to make us better and still keep us from becoming too powerful. <br />
<br />
Still I would love to see something more than Slow and back-up healing added to our raid abilities. Then maybe when a raid has 3+ Shaman, some dont feel like they are left with nothign to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pre-55 the only improvement needed is to remove the healing penalty. Adding better healing before then will even further trivialize the game.<br />
<br />
After 55, the AA skills need improving. Healing Adept should be 5%, 10%, 50%. Same for Healing Gift.<br />
<br />
Introduce an Ancient spell: Torpor without the negative effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Lind</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Originally posted by Blacklace <br />
thing is, i barely need a cleric to back me up as it is, most places i can heal just fine, a cleric tagging along risks just nuking if low dmg mobs, mebbe a cheal once every 10 mins. at the same time we need large amounts of clerics for raids, and... very few shm's.<br />
 <br />
Not that someone to torp the clerics chewing rods and someone to torp the magician making and chewing rods doesn't hurt.  Instant canni for everyone!  =)<br />
 <br />
we dont deserve much, hell, we're godly already, i can do cc/heals/speeds/dmg as well, if not quite up to the more specialized classes.<br />
 <br />
  Shamans are sick.  Even with FT and more manaregen spells and AA closing the gap slightly between the other classes and shamans for manaregen, shamans still come out way ahead.  Even if nukes are less efficient than wizards shamans can do them foreeeeeever.<br />
 <br />
i was duoing with a monk today, well equipped if not quite amongst the best, i was nearly up to his dmg on single pulls, outdid him by far if 2 mobs.(ok, i had kei, and i'm well equipped, but still)<br />
 <br />
  Druid/Wizards can sustain about 1/2 a primal monk's damage if they have excelent (FT or rend robe) equipment and are doing no healing.<br />
 <br />
making us stack on raids is just.. hard. unless they add some new ability types(i cant think of any) or increase clerics utility from being just healer/rezzer(i dont count buffs as a utility as such, unless it's mana or hp regen/dmg output related).<br />
 <br />
  On the high HP luclin mobs where fights last 15 minutes and resists tend to be low Icestrike's 96dps + high mana regen means you can lay out as much damage or at least similar damage as a wizard.  If torrent lands, woo!<br />
 <br />
it wouldnt be fair to give us a mana efficient/low casting time higher heal, it would devastate druids, and lower clerics need in xp grps more(yes, give druids a better heal, then what? you're killing off clerics, give them better nukes? /wave wizards).<br />
 <br />
  Kunark mobs hit for what, 200 was pretty crazy back then.  Now CT and Ssra mobs hit for 400.  Chloroblast/Nature's Touch/Divine Light/Remedy need an update.<br />
 <br />
  Druids are pretty much screwed.  Give them a ton more manaregen and lures, add cold to their Ro debuff, they're wizards that can cast SoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">To the guy who said raids can function without shamans, I'd really hate to see your raids, where melees miss 600+ hps each, rodding clerics/wizzies have no torpor, enchanters die over and over even after slows, and druids as the only secondary healer.<br />
<br />
You bring up Vindi as a target? All you need is 1 warrior, 1 monk/sk, 2-3 clerics, and ~15 of any class combo, even  15 mages will do. 36? Ha. Raids against 1 mob can function well with only warriors and clerics, nobody's &quot;needed&quot; except those two. Hell, if you've got enough clerics, even warriors aren't &quot;needed&quot;.<br />
<br />
The role of a support class is to make sure things go quickly and smoothly. Try to clear PoG for tunare, kill any slowable uber mob, clear flurries, fight to THO etc without shamans on the raid, then you will see how well raids go without shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Shaman AA sucks, but with good reason. Shaman were and still are an incredibly powerfull class with the only setback of stackability which isn't that bad anyway as there isn't exactly an overabundance of rading shamans on most occasions.<br />
<br />
Removing the penalty on heals shouldn't hurt clerics too bad.<br />
<br />
Giving some usefull class AA skill beyong can5 and quick buff might be nice but I can also understand if they don't. Nerfing shamans by giving us less usefull AA was warranted. But I would like more stuff here for amusement, such as reducing rabid bear reuse by a lot.<br />
<br />
Dogdog may be underpowered but he is an asset in many situations. What more can one ask? How much use are SK pets to SKs?<br />
<br />
Chloroblast may be inferior to Natures Touch and Topor has negative side effects unlike Natures Recovery. But that just provides variety, on a raid I can easily outheal any druid because of manaregen.<br />
<br />
Alchemy is way too expensive, it would be very nice if some more utility potions and such where usefull. I would like to have this revamped.<br />
<br />
I think most of the wish lists here are just begging either for nerfs or loss of versatility. Torpor is what it is and it is a great spell that provides variety to the games and requires tactics to use, leave it be.<br />
<br />
Fix alchemy and start working on a total pathing revamp of most zones and I'll be happy.<br />
<br />
As my own wish I'll add that I would like an AE malosi/malisement spell to match tirgirs insects. I dont' think it'd affect class balance much but it would be usefull. It should be about the same level at the AE slow and relatively as strong. I don't think it's needed but I would sure use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Snowfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">Things regarding healing that should be changed:<br />
<br />
Healing Issues (for those who want more healing)<br />
1.  Get rid of the healing penalty.  There is no need for it these days.  Use AA pts to get rid of it was just cruel.<br />
<br />
2.  Move Superior healing to either 39 or 44.  That still keeps it well behind clerics.  <br />
<br />
3.  Chloroblast moved to 53.<br />
<br />
4.  New healing spell perhaps as mentioned doing near 800-900 in a single tap.  Put it near 60.<br />
5.  Remove that damn snare/slow from Torpor since it is group only anyway. Originally it was not and was being used in PVP to screw people over so they made it group only.  Now remove the damn side effects so it has a good use.  I hate getting sworn at by tanks when I cast this on them even though it saves their lives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Offense(those that like to smite thy enemies):<br />
Shamans have not increased offensively (ie damage wise) since the release of Kunark.  That was 2 expansions ago.  Every other class has gained new DDs or DOTS.   We need something new to expand our capabilities here.<br />
<br />
1.  New DD would be nice.  Almost had one for SOL....<br />
2.  New DOTs (screw the Ancient Spells...never seen one yet...right they exist...only in VI's dreams) that is not an ultra rare drop.<br />
<br />
<br />
AA Skills:<br />
1.  Rabid bear should be 10-15 min timer, not 144 mins for 5 min use.  One skill I may acquire if I ever feel like it.<br />
2.  Alchemy Mastery....***?  Get rid of it please.  Alchemy broken, waste of PP and has no value beyond SOW potions (trivial at 37).<br />
3.  Pet hold here skill?  See #2.<br />
4.  Healing Crits?  Lol right since post 55 all you use is CB getting those crits is just sooo important.  Now if it worked on torpor per tick then I would be happy but does not.  /rude<br />
<br />
Well there are my 2cp on some changes.  I doubt we will see anything good for our class because VI has no clue on shamans anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">i was having a quick look at our dots: (quick calculation, feel free to doublecheck)<br />
19.3 dps pox<br />
39.2 dps bane<br />
26.9 dps bolt<br />
16.6 dps epic<br />
102 dps total(add another 10'ish for plague if you want)<br />
<br />
this would of course most likely get us summoned and killed before 2 mins have passed :), and is only theoretical(add casting times) but i can see one shm casting all these, and outdmging most any other class on luclin mobs(also assuming you aint heavily resisted).<br />
<br />
whats a wizards dps? 80's? so technically, we dont really need a dot upgrade :p a more dmg'ing nuke would be nice, but not a more manaeffective one :)<br />
<br />
and chanters have no dmg upgrades either(unless they got a new version of their dot of suck?)<br />
<br />
healing crits sure beats the 38!! extra hp you get from healing adept, heh such a mindless waste of points. crits are decently nice, the occasional 700ish heal for 150 mana doesnt hurt(when you actually use cb that is)<br />
<br />
lind: i'm just gonna assume you mostly agree with me except on details :p<br />
<br />
2 things i'd like as well is, ae malo something, and no targetlimitations on tirgirs(heh, ok that one may be just too godly, but then again, 1200 ae's from wizards are pretty godly too:)<br />
<br />
finally, yea right, a decent raid without shm HAH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The number one problem with balance in EQ is the multigroup raid. If you look at all the the posts concerning shaman balance the complaints all stem from how classes fit into a multigroup scenario. The fact is that breaking past the 6 player limit totally negates the need for the jack of all trades classes and makes them playable as second box &quot;buff mules&quot;. <br />
<br />
Think about it....why do you need a shaman or druid as backup healer when you can bring as many clerics as you need? Why do you need a druid or shaman as nuker/Dotter when you can bring as many wizards as you need? You need 1-3 shaman for buffing, slowing and malo. You need 1-3 chanters for tash and buffing. You need 1-2 druids for buffing and porting. All of these roles are limited enough that they can be played part time on a second box. Hybrids, Mages and necros are for the most part disposable. <br />
<br />
The easy way out for VI is to simply give everyone more healing. But I would like to see more RAID ability and specialization for both shaman and druid. Sadly because of the focus on mutliple groups the only way to balance casters is more DD damage. It is the only form of magic casters can do that stacks effectively allowing for more than one or two of each class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">I like the no-animation on bearform.  I can canni-dance without that annoying sit/stand animation.  If the line-of-sight change were instant that would be different..but the moving animation is just a time and processing waste.<br />
<br />
On the old MUD's clerics always had the BEST armor class buffs in the game, a Divine barrier with hp's that could be beaten down that mobs had a percent chance of ignoring every hit..fantastic for buffing newbies...clerics would be happier, and we could get a decent heal.<br />
<br />
What would be SO bad about shamaning being incremental? Is what a level 60 warrior so different from what a level 1 warrior does?<br />
<br />
If you want to complain..let's stick to the cleric/enchanter stranglehold on high-level encounters.  2 Hours lfg last night for the first time ever..I felt like a pally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ahem, dire charm?  We are not very good damage dealers, which is why monks solo so much better than we do (for xp) at 60.  Of course, I don't think we should be upgraded as solo damage dealers because we are such good defensive soloists. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I focus on what we can do...sick sick sick mana regen via mod rods and torpor.&quot;<br />
<br />
Being a twitch bitch sucks.  They need to make ways for necros to better use their own mana, rather than turning shamans and mages into twitch bitches too.  If being a spare gas tank for another class gets you off, more power to ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;oh, and fixing dot stackings will make about zero difference, theres still only 15 slots, they'd have to change that too for it to be of any real use&quot;<br />
<br />
Captain Obvious to the rescue!  That would, of course, have to be a part of making dot stacking work, and was discussed in the Hartsman thread I referenced.</div></div><hr />

Ideas;<br />
Push Torpor down to lvl 58, leave it as is with Negs and group only effects.<br />
<br />
New Healing spell at lvl 60 - castable on all BUT SELF - something like the 25% or a 50% heal idea tossed around.<br />
<br />
A different sort of debuff at 59 - maybe some sort of reverse Focus item that increases the time cast, fizzle rate or some such on caster mobs.  Or a different kind of melee debuff to allow more shaman to stack on raids.   After all, I see no 'balance' in requiring a cleric in EVERY group on a raid or in every XP group.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Few quick comments....<br />
<br />
<br />
Topor on anyone:<br />
<br />
Haha, yeah please do this.  I'm sure I won't cast<br />
topor on the next AE trainer... er puller I see, and <br />
I'm sure that 300hp of heal will save him from any<br />
damge the 30 mobs behind him might do.   Yeah <br />
sure he can just click it off but he has to notice <br />
that he has it very quickly.  Group wide and guild<br />
wide would make it viable for backup healing,<br />
and I'd be happy with it.<br />
<br />
AA ability to remove the snare on topor is a great<br />
Idea.  I think that would also make casting it on<br />
anyone acceptable.<br />
<br />
AA ability ala durability that gave us more HP's <br />
would probably be the most out of an AA ability I <br />
could ask for.  If they did that and decreased the<br />
refresh time on rabid bear, I would have no <br />
complaints with our AA abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As for healing balancing.  I think it would be fair<br />
in the name of balance to give us the mana <br />
efficient over time heal, and give druids the quick<br />
blast type heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">I dont want more heal upgrade.<br />
<br />
It's a trade-off.  I can cannidance, sow, slow, invis, solo, etc..  Cleric cant.  Yes, raid need them, not us, but they bloody deserve it after all those trade off.<br />
<br />
<br />
What can they actually do in a normal situation?<br />
Stun, Rez... wonderful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u79"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p79">First off Conaan was most likely trying to emphasize the point that many raid encounters are 'doable' with few or worst case no shamans.  His extreme example is likely intended only to shine a light on the raid stackability issue.<br />
<br />
It is patently obvious that the first shaman (full spell book) in a raiding force provides an incredible value proposition.  It is equally obvious that each subsequent shaman added to the raiding force is at best 1/2 as valuable as the first shaman, and adding more shamans at some point becomes counterproductive.<br />
<br />
Is a typical raid better off with a 4th level 60 shaman, or would most people trade that 60th shaman in for a 56th level rogue without batting an eye?<br />
<br />
My changes:<br />
<br />
1.)  Alchemy can and should be fixed.  No other class will be ticked off if our potions are available at a price that people are actually willing to pay for the effect.  This is an easy way to make shaman's happy without stepping on the toes of other classes.<br />
<br />
2.)  A slight pet upgrade at 59 or 60 would be welcome.<br />
<br />
3.)  Rabid Bear reuse time is absurd.<br />
<br />
4.)  Provide us a way to stack on raids -- and that means damage.  Either make rabid bear persistant so we can melee marginally well, or give us a decent DD spell that is landable on most encounters.<br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">Okay, now I know saying this goes against most Shamans wishes... but here you go..   I DON'T WANT ANY MORE HEALS.   I Like not being a good healer of Mana-Sink Melees.  I'm in a high end raiding guild and regularly work with a ROGUE who has over 6K buffed HP... I HATE healing.. it's pointless to use anything less than Cheal on ANYONE other than Int Casters anymore.    As it stands, when we're short on Clerics, Shamans get stuck in as healers for the Int Caster groups, or the SK/Paladin groups...  and when that happens.. I make the Paladins do the healing.<br />
<br />
   In the High end game... Shamans have ONE job on raids after the Buffing is done...   Malo/Slow/Cripple if all the chanters are dead.   If I have to worry about healing as well, debuffs can wear off without me knowing and then everyone dies.<br />
<br />
Melees do not want longer/better/targettable Torpors as it also snares and slows them.   The percent or the duration of the slow does not matter.. they know it reduces their haste below the max cap and that makes them cry... Especially Rogues trying to XP on raids.<br />
<br />
(mind you - the Snare Effect on Torpor is pure comedy when you slap it on your puller and watch them trudge back to camp with 8 frogloks pounding on them :)<br />
<br />
So please VI.. Don't give me bigger heals... I don't want to be a Druid.<br />
<br />
In addition, to the poster who I believe commented that our AA points are useless (Or next to it)<br />
<br />
Not to be mean, but just how many AA points and what skills do you have so far?<br />
<br />
Granted.. Run 3 seems almost useless except indoors.<br />
Regen 3 and Mental Clarity 3 on their own seem almost useless too.<br />
<br />
BUT...  <br />
Mass Group Buffing?  -  Thank God for this... AE focusing 50 people at a pop is doing wonders to combat shaman raiding burnout.<br />
Cann 5? - One word... Godly.<br />
Casting Reinforcement? - Yes, for 2 measly AA points I like 1500 pt Torpors.<br />
Casting Mastery? - Ask a Wizard.. with improved Specialization Checks and reduced Fizzles.. a 60 Wizard I know calculated he effectively has 18% MORE Mana.<br />
<br />
Granted...  Rabid Bear refreshes TOO slow, I agree and there are other AA skills we get that are pretty pointless ( Pet Mastery and Alchemy Mastery )  But seriously.. the right implementation of AA skills can vastly improve our effectiveness.<br />

i used to be, and yes i theres more than enough for 1 shm to do, but when you approach 3-4-5 theres getting kinda limited how much you can spread out and still pretend to have something to do without healing :)<br />
technically theres dmg, of which i do quite abit of when i have time, but the thing is, raiding guilds are too reliant on clerics for just about anything. having a measly 386 hp heal isnt all that amusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">Black, agreed re: DC on most raids, but it is a massive solo damage increase. I think that enchanters have similar stacking problems on raids, and they could surely use a more stackable raid skill--but only if it didn't increase their solo skill or xp-group ability, both of which are already quite high.   That's why I like dot stacking for shams and necros, because it helps them stack on raids, but does not increase their already adequate-or-better solo and xp group abilities.  Also I, too, could see Verant doing dot stacking half-assed had I not read otherwise and I did not mean to come off that sarcastically.<br />
<br />
I think your monks are lying to you though.  Well-equipped grandmasters have more than enough defense to solo xp mobs nonstop, and they have vastly higher dps over sustained periods.  An extraordinarily large percentage of the 100+ AA freaks are monks :)  <br />
<br />
We were the kings of lvl 60 soloing back when xp was irrelevant and all that mattered was loot and penis-measuring.  Now that xp is in play, it is much muddier, with many classes in the running.   Despite this, I suspect that our ability to &quot;trophy&quot; mobs is held against us in other areas.       <br />

they are at least trying to make other classes more useful, which i applaud :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">I would NOT ask from Verant a better heal for the shaman. However, I don't get WHY there is still the 10% healing penalty for shaman and druid heals? Even with removed penalty we would NOT be above the clerics, because clerics have 15% BONUS on every heal spell. So basically shamand and druids are 25% worse healers, and even with the removed penalty from them, we would STILL be below clerical healing abilities. Not to mention that our healing spells aint cutting ANYWHERE near cleric healing abilities. At lvl 39 clerics gets the Complete Heal, while we get Greater Heal at lvl 29 and next one is only at lvl 51 (Superior Heal).<br />
<br />
Verant should remove those stupid penalties, these have outlived their point and use already long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Atlet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Ok, I won't be asking for the world like some of these folks..<br />
<br />
1) Like others, Topor would be nice if we could cast on folks outside the group. <br />
<br />
2) Rabid Bear is damn fun, with shiss and my Aleje's Cerimonial Cudgle, Im cracking for 171 and alot double time cause we double attack, would be nice to use that skill more than once every 2 hours. <br />
<br />
3) Alchemy, the luclin potions A) cost too much and B) the fail rate sux big time. At 180 skill I almost spent 2.5k on Greater Elixir of Concentration. YEH RIGHT! Make us really want to make them potions, if they werent too much then mb.. just MAY BE!!  we would put a point or two into alchemy mastery but then again, we have been complaining bout alchemy from the onset and nothing has really changed.<br />
<br />
4) Avatar is fine, regular heals are fine, if ya want to give us a more powerfull heal, mb a 700pt heal would be nice. I can sit there in Uspiders in Velks with me and 3 rogues and 2 monks constantly training uspiders and am able to buff, speed, heal, and not to mention slow all the spiders, a greater heal really isnt that important but I guess could help. <br />
<br />
Side note, if ya folks were thinking bout either going for Canni 5 or not right away... GET IT!  It was the first Class skill I went for, I tell ya, it has saved my butt many a time, either in group or on a raid where all i was doing was healing. Nice to have a instant 1200 mana every 3 min. With Canni 5 I am never ever out of mana unless I am not paying attention. <br />
<br />
Thx =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Lots of good  ideas and equally as many crappy ones (improved invis ***?) I tend to agree with Isazo for the most part:<br />
<br />
1. Increase melee abilities, can be via AA, Increased caps or increased rabid bear duration/resue.  Or all the above.<br />
<br />
2.  Increase Raid stackability.<br />
<br />
3. Making alchemy a vaible skill would be nice.<br />
 <br />
4. Minor Pet upgrade at 59/60 and upgrade to the Pet buff<br />
<br />
Also I like to see changes to Scale of wolf and Spirt of Cheeta to make them more useful. <br />
<br />
Dont forget an upgrade to inner fire,  Woot!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">Actually... I'm one of three full time Shamans in my Guild.  <br />
<br />
Essentially.. I'm just happy with Shamans as we are...  Unlike a lot of other classes that seem to be groping for a place in EQ, we have a well defined role, we have skills and talents that truly are our own, and they are not overpowered, nor are they weak.<br />
<br />
I've played a Shaman for 2 years and I still enjoy the class.   I don't want to see VI tinker with it too much and wind up wrecking it.<br />
