<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Serizak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm up to the part of the 3 books of giz. I was wondering, if i did this, how much faction would I need to skip the hole, is there a way to do this?? It's easier to get my guild to help do the COM part, but the hole another story and I was wondering if there was a way to skip over it and still get an epic at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No enchanters in your guild need Kindle?  No rangers need that wretched guy?  Nobody wants to kill Yael for that shoulders quest?  No bards/warriors need a red scale from the Scalekeeper?  No SKs need a trip to the Hole for their epic bits?<br />
<br />
Not to mention, the last time I went to the Hole we got 2 sets of IGS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It IS possible to skip to the end of the epic quest and just turn in the tear and do the last fight.  You need to pretty much Max out your true spirit faction though.  Simply having ally isn't enought to generate aggro on the tear turn in, you need high ally standing, so would be best to max out faction before trying if you want to skip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Serizak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well the way it works so far is I'm like 5th in line for a shaman epic, so when I heard I could skip a part I thought I'd try it</div></div><hr />
