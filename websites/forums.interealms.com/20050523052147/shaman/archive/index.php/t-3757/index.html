Is it any good or do you get alot of lag?  I get my new dish today and I was wondering if anyone had any opinions on this.  Right now I'm using 56k connection because I can't get cable or dsl where I live waaaay out in the boonies.</div></div><hr />

I have the DirecWay 2-way Satellite broadband and I have to say I'm ambivalent.  I use it for web surfing and email, and that's about it.  For EQ or other internet games regular dial-up my only option for two reason...the much lower latency and DLS/cable modem is not available in my area.<br />
<br />
Satellite is fast for downloads, kinda like cable modem, but when it comes to playing games that NEED low latency such as EQ or QIII/UT/etc., it sucks.  Here's the reason why:  when you preform an action the signal has to travel to geosyncronous orbit (~22,400 miles) to the satellite, down to the Network ops center, to the internet, back to the ops center, up to the satellite again, and back to your computer.  Even 'tho light is pretty fast nowadays :) it still takes about half a second to do all that travelling.  My average ping including everything is about 800ms or 0.8 seconds. It makes EQ or FPSs almost unplayable for me due to the lag.<br />
<br />
I hope you can understand my rambling, I just woke up and that first cup of coffee is still working it's way into my bloodstream!<br />

&lt;edit for multiple grammar and spelling errors!&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rahvyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That is exactly what I thought the answer would be.  I read everything I could find on the websites about it and I came to the same conclusion.  I guess I will just have to wait until Sprint gets sick of the petitions we keep sending into them and they get off their butts to hook up our town with some highspeed connections.</div></div><hr />
