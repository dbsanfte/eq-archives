<br />
A quick one if I may :)<br />
<br />
Is Canni II MQ'able ?<br />
<br />
I have afriend who looted the greyish bone chips in KC, knowing that i wanted them and also knowing I wasnt online at the time!<br />
So my question is can we MQ the scroll or is it best to give him the droppable bits and take him to get the Shaman Powder or can i go get the powder and MQ with him ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Have him turn in the chips, and you turn in the other three pieces. You should get the scroll. I helped a friend not too long ago with this (I had the chips). It works :)<br />
<br />
Enjoy your canni 2!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes it is MQable. also the spell is Lore and Not No Drop from what i did yeterday for my cann 2 spell. Shaman Powder, Crushed Diamond Dust and Strange Ochre clay are drop able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes you can either MQ it with him, or give him the remaining 3 components and let him do the quest and give you the reward scroll. The bone chips is the only quest item that is NO DROP.<br />
<br />
Nzak, the spell scroll is not lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gagukuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks so much for the Celerity style speed on the replies :).<br />
Im off to TT now with my favourite tracker to get me some Yun Powder.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">did you find the Yun shaman? It seems to be one of the rarest mobs in the whole damn game, which is sorta **** for a lvl 39 spell.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's spawn rate is that nasty, its just that TT has two opposing factions at work, so as soon as it spawns it seems to die.<br />
<br />
Good luck getting it.<br />
<br />
I hate the Yun shaman, and I ain't even seen it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried for a couple days to find the Yun shaman in TT. I was tearing my hair out trying to find the little froggy and had a few close calls with the wanderers -- keep gate memmed at all times while looking for him because of the undead necros who will snare you.  Once in a while I'd go to the bazaar to find someone selling it but no luck.  I finally gave up on it thinking I'll have to live with canni1 when finally I saw somebody selling the shaman powder at the bazaar for 50pp. I would have gladly paid much more and my heart was thumping out of my chest as I was right clicking on the trader's name to find him  :)<br />
<br />
Canni2 is a godsend and worth all the effort in getting all the parts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You know I used to have no trouble finding the yun shaman frog, but I went to look for one again the past two days and there were NO FROGS of any kind to be found in that part of Trak's Teeth. But there were all these extra skeletons running around. Are they killing off the frogs now? If so, what a PITA.</div></div><hr />
