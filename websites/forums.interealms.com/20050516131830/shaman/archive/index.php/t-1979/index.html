<br />
YES the JBB is worth it!<br />
Average price across servers is 10-15k<br />
Yes Iksars get shafted cause they cant use it<br />
Yes you will use at 60.<br />
Fungi or JBB is debatable, just save up and pick one.<br />
No it is not likely you will find something to replace it, at least not for soloing purposes.<br />
<br />
Ways to solo with JBB:<br />
<br />
A. Root nuke<br />
1. Pull with slow<br />
2. Root<br />
3. Dot, JBB<br />
4. When root breaks, run away<br />
5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 til its dead<br />
<br />
B. Dog tank (good tactic for average AC shamans)<br />
1. Pull with slow<br />
2. Let pet taunt<br />
3. Cast low aggro dot (disease, epic)<br />
4. JBB nuke from afar<br />
5. When you get aggro it should be low anyway, so just kill it<br />
<br />
C. Shaman tank (good tactic for high AC shaman)<br />
1. Pull with slow<br />
2. Auto attack<br />
3. Stack dots<br />
4. JBB nuke<br />
5. Reapply dots as necessary/mana regen permits<br />
<br />
Tactics here are pretty much in order of your quality of gear. If you have 800 AC and a fungi tunic, use method C. If no fungi, use method B. If you are really bad at taking hits, use method A. As a 60 shaman, I use method C. It is the most efficient way to solo. Your mob kill rate and your mana recovery are at a good stable point.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, YES WE ARE ALL TIRED OF JBB QUESTIONS!!!!<br />
<br />
Any additional answers would make a great addition to this thread.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, for the love of god, stop with the repetitive questions and go back in the forum and look, or use search.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chances are if you put &quot;please stick this&quot; in a post, it will be ignored or even deleted.<br />
<br />
That aside, it would be nice to have a complete guide to the JBB as a pinned post, so people wont ask every five minutes.<br />
<br />
Your idea is good, but the tone is too harsh and the post reads as 'shut up'.  Its not a good image if a post such as this is pinned.<br />
<br />
<br />
if you could rewrite this post, w/ less &quot;additude&quot; to it, and in a more moderate tone, and include info on how you solo, or other people solo w/ JBB...then maybe =-)<br />
<br />
and im on saryrn too, send me a tell sometime:)(if you want to talk to a lowly mid 30s shammy that is ;P)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's my attempt at a little more complete (and newbie friendly) JBB guide.  I'm stealing liberally from Durnitol (love the name, btw!)...<br />
<br />
The JBB (Jaundiced Bone Bracer) (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=893) is considered one of the most powerful pieces of equipment a shaman can have- it is one of the &quot;big three&quot;- along with the epic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=748) and the  fungi tunic (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11737).  These three are so powerful because they provide mana-free damage output or mana-free healing.<br />
<br />
The JBB has a right-click (manaless) effect (&quot;Winters Roar&quot;- as our level 34 spell) which does 263 damage to the target.  This is a cold DD, so is obviously less effective against targets with high cold resistance.  The effect takes eight seconds to cast, and is relatively easy to channel through.  263 damage every 8 seconds provides a maximum sustained damage output of 32.875 damage per second.  This level of consistent damage output is not otherwise attainable until well into the end-game.  Chances are, the bracer will continue to be used up to and including level 60.  Between level 45 and the low 50's, the bracer makes solo'ing much easier.<br />
<br />
Like other Jaundiced Bone armor pieces, the effect will not start working until level 45.  Also, like other JB armor, Iksars cannot use it.  This is an item of contention among many iksars- as they believe they have been deprived of a game-altering piece of shaman equipment.  There are no other equally available shaman alternative which provide anywhere near this level of mana-free damage in the game (the epic would be an alternative, but because its affect is a DoT, it can be used in conjunction with the JBB, not as an alternative.)<br />
<br />
The JBB is a rare drop from Arch Duke Iatol (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=4957)  in the crypt in Old Sebilis.  It is also tradeable; and while prices tend to vary by server, expect to pay a sizable amount (most servers average around 10-15k, other go as high as 30k.)<br />

<br />

<br />
At Lvl 60 Fungi on Twink<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Very eloquent Bigguss.  Good tactical breakdown Durnitol.<br />
<br />
Now who is going to write the guide on 'How to get 15k to buy a JBB'  guide? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">bah you guys all have it way to easy being able to buy a JBB.  I think there are 3-4 on my server.  But my friend guildie has one for me now i just need to get it from him.  And I must say that i cant wait but.... JBB and fungi are definly not a must for a shaman, just makes our job easier.  and maybe sometime i get myself a fungi. so far only 1 has dropped.  and in case you are wondering i am level 59 now working on 60 and still not used any of the shaman 'staples' jbb or fungi.  not saying that i dotn want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">(1) Nuke with JBB<br />
(2) Swing big hammer (hoping for proc) or a big hit<br />
(3) Rinse repeat.</div></div><hr />
