<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im a glutton for punishment.  It has become increasingly obvious that shaman are not healers in current content, and actually stopped being healers sometime between Luclin and PoP.<br />
<br />
But anyway, I was comparing the heals that the priests (and I include shaman here from habit, and not from practice) get.  Here are my conclusions:<br />
<br />
Shaman (honorary mention)<br />
<br />
Daluda's Mending<br />
1550 healed<br />
490 mana<br />
Efficiency: 3.16<br />
<br />
Obkin's Mending<br />
1690 healed<br />
562 mana<br />
Efficiency: 3.00<br />
<br />
Net gain<br />
Obkin's heals ~9% more than Daluda's, with an efficiency loss of about 5%<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
<br />
Sylvan Infusion<br />
2100 healed<br />
550 mana<br />
Efficiency: 3.81<br />
<br />
Chlorotrope<br />
2275 healed<br />
625 mana<br />
Efficiency: 3.64<br />
<br />
Net gain<br />
Chlorotrope heals ~ 8% more than Sylvan Infusion, with an efficiency loss of about 4.5%<br />
<br />
Cleric<br />
<br />
Holy Light<br />
3275 healed<br />
650 mana<br />
Efficiency: 5.03<br />
<br />
Pious Light<br />
3770 healed<br />
750 mana<br />
Efficiency: 5.02<br />
<br />
Net Gain<br />
Pious Light heals ~ 12% more than Holy Light, with an efficiency loss of about .2% (yes, thats two tenths of a percent)<br />
<br />
Now, let us look at the healing %'s that Rytan and the guru's up at SOE said the priests will follow (100/64/47)<br />
<br />
Pious Light = 100%<br />
<br />
Chlorotrope = 60%<br />
<br />
Obkin's Mending = 44%<br />
<br />
Obviously they need to increase the healing power of Obkins to bring it into line with their proposed healing percentages.  Druids also need their heal upgraded (as much as it pains me to say it).<br />
<br />
If the Holy Percentages are going to stay 100/64/47, then:<br />
<br />
Clerics : Need nothing.  They are baseline here<br />
<br />
Druids : Amount healed needs to increase 137 HP, to 2412.  That takes it to 63.9% of cleric's Pious.  That changes the efficiency a bit, to 3.85, which is slightly more efficient than Sylvan Infusion.<br />
<br />
Shaman : Amount healed needs to increase 82 HP, to 1772.  That makes Obkins 47.002% as effective as Pious.  Efficiency changes to 3.15, which is almost as efficient as Daluda's Mending.<br />
<br />
I think I'm going to cross post this to Sonys boards as well, but this is what Ive found so far.  Interesting to  note that according to Lucy, Druids have another heal that has not yet been revealed.  Will be interesting to see how it stacks up, becuase if it increases healing power at all it encroches on the clerics holy and blessed 100%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1000x no.<br />
<br />
We can no longer settle for 47%.  We've heard 47% for so long now we are starting to believe it.  It's WRONG.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im not saying that the percentages are fair, or even realistic.  Im just saying that if SOE is going to stick with them then by God stick with them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And I'm saying that arguing based on those percentages is acceptance of them.</div></div><hr />
