<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Timreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone<br />
<br />
I was going to start a second character on my second account to 2 box. I was wondering what would be a good suggestion on the class to 2 box with. I don't want to use what lots of other people use as 2-box characters, like shaman+tank class. I wanted something not alot of other people do.<br />
<br />
Also does anyone else here 2 box? if so what class do you 2 box with? Thanks for any help and suggestions! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Timreck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh and I am level 62 and going to be power leveling off and on for a while until they can get exp together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xakris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am currently doing a BST/SHM combo. Works out really well IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShamanKitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I two box SHM/NECRO combo.  Necros and SKs are both good pals for Shaman, but if you PL them their skills will suck for awhile, which I'm sure you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went trough much thought, had a 58 monk, and finally decided to PL a bard, who is currently 50, and just needs trakanon to get the epic.<br />
<br />
There are a few reasons for this, main ones being: single pulls, charm, mana regen, and before someone starts talking crap, they get double attack as an AA at 61.<br />
<br />
I gave up on the monk for a simple reason: the equipment rrequired to have the maximum use from him is either too expensive or not reachable for an alt.<br />
<br />
As for people making a BST, i don't really understand: mages are better, and slow is already available for us. BST don't add anything to us, save dps, which other classes with more stack-abilities adds.<br />
I can understand the fun factor and easy PL tho, but not the high lvl use.<br />
<br />
I strongly believe bard might be the second best dual-box partner for a shaman, necro being first.<br />
<br />
Proove me otherwise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I definitely wouldnt say its the best, but I play a Rogue/Shaman combo.  Basically I picked a second class (already playing the shaman first) that I wanted to play, not because of their compatability or they are the 'best' together, though they do work fairly well together in most situations.  The nice thing is that the shaman basically gives any tank class everything they need and/or are missing to make them sucessful and fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xakris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well then, allow me to retort..<br />
<br />
Mage is not better, they are far less efficient. Mana dependancy means more downtime, BST needs very little mana for best effect. <br />
<br />
BST gets thier own line of mana/hp regen spells, which only make a shaman more effcient. Also 2 tanks for one toon. SHM buffs works excellent on both BST and pet. <br />
<br />
You mentioned fun factor and thats a biggie, but also ease of use. Takes far more effort and moving between boxes to get best results from either a Bard or Necro than a BST. Send pet in, begin melee w/ BST after intial DoTs/debuffs and switch to shaman. BST can hold aggro easily enough to allow shaman some room to work. <br />
<br />
High level use? In what manner are you speaking? As a solo 62 BST I could tank most 1st tier planar trash, it would be even easier w/ shaman buffs. DPS from BST and pet combined is quite adequate for most exp encounters. (First tier planes) DoT stacking is another advantage. <br />
<br />
I am sure there is something I am leaving out, but you should get my drift from this..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i duo-box a level 57 shaman/64 mage.  this combo is real good together.  Right now we are doing Droga/CT/hate/Tier 1 planes fairly easy.  The only thing holding me back from tier 2 exping is the level of my shaman and getting level 65 earth pet when i ding 65.  We have been doing punishers/enforcer alot lately.  We can clear 8 before repop with lack DPS being the only slowdown.  At 57 the shaman is lacking in healing ability and possible resist of slow scares me from trying much harder mobs.  Once my shaman hit 62 i think we can handle most things NP.  I grouped both mage and shaman in a PoV golemn group with 4 other guildies and shaman did pretty well.  Ranger pulled i would thru Mala on golemns on the way to the group and slow was never resisted.  I have just same into a level 54 cleric account that i will 3 box for some harder camps =).  I cant decide it i want to keep the cleric or make  an chanter for the third box.  Once shaman gets topor or Q healing should not be a problem with mage 1200 pet heal spell.   All in all mage/shaman duo is rock solid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>fifidong</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman + Rogue works fer me at the moment..<br />
<br />
Shaman tanks with root + slow + quiescence.<br />
Rogue backstab away..<br />
<br />
I hear Shaman + mage is great tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't want to use what lots of other people use as 2-box characters, like shaman+tank class. I wanted something not alot of other people do.<br />
<br />
Wizard.  Definitely something different and easy to handle.  Setup a few nuke hotkeys and even grouping or raiding won't be a problem.  Solo might be a little tough but wizards do get snares so it should help if you decide to dot kite a mob.<br />
<br />
I 2-box a necro and shaman myself.  It's a great combination but it does require alot of attention specially at the higher levels when Fear kiting becomes obsolete.  Unlike with a warrior, you just press auto-attack, mindlessly press taunt/kick and watch his hitpoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to do a lot of 2-boxing with a warrior (actually, I 3-box with a druid as the third).  Give the warrior a cheapo greatstaff of thunder for a stun proc and he does ok holding agro.  Of course, I think the proc starts working at level 55, so that's not going to do much good prior to that level.  Warriors are REALLY expensive to outfit if you're hung up on good gear like I am, so I wouldn't recommend that route.  And unless you've got a get-out-of-jail-free card (like my druid evac-bot), you'll end up dying quite a bit with the warrior, who can't gate or feign.  <br />
<br />
Shadowknights are a nice option - they hold agro nicely, have some nice inexpensive weapons, and are FAR superior to warriors in one critical area: they actually have a reason to level.  I've pretty much quit on my warrior because - how much better is a level 57 warrior than a level 56?  Not a whole lot.  There just isn't much incentive to get excited about leveling a pure melee class.  That same argument goes for my level 58 monk, who I haven't played in months.  It's just not very exciting to go up a level and get nothing but a craptacular discipline with a 72-minute reuse timer and 37 extra hp  :rolleyes:  At least a shadowknight has something of value to gain at each level - a few new spells.  I know that many of those spells aren't particularly valuable, but at least its something.  <br />
<br />
I haven't tried it personally, but I've heard that necros make excellent partners.  Two pets, exceptional dots, really good mana regen on both characters, both can gate, and the necro plugs some gaps in a shaman repertoire (snare, FD, undead CC, undead charm).  But I think it might be tough to 2-box if you're trying to fear-kite.  Others that have 2-boxed that combo are certainly better equipped to answer the concerns about how to manage that, though.  It certainly looks like a powerful combination to me.<br />
<br />
Monks are always a decent option, and are quite fun at lower levels.  A decently-equipped monk in the lower levels can really put out some damage.  But as they level, they get weaker and weaker unless you have access to elite no-drop gear, and they're horrendously expensive to outfit in the bazaar.  But, they make a very good 2-box partner, like the shadowknight, because melee is easier to handle on the second machine and both can feign death to escape bad situations.  And their mend ability and stonestance discipline can really help out in a pinch.  Plus, they get lots of wisdom from their druid/beastlord gear  :D  <br />
<br />
My current project is a mage.  I've read several times that the mage/shaman combo is quite powerful, so I'm playing a mage at the moment.  She's up to level 40 and is quite fun so far.  From the very excellent mage board http://www.magecompendium.com/, I've read that mage pets even at the highest levels make excellent tanks.  The level 65 earth pet Rathe's Son has, with proper focusing and buffs, over 7k hp, and he roots.  That makes for a pretty decent tank, especially given that he's disposable  :p  The air pets stun, which can be helpful when fighting caster mobs.  The water mob backstabs, if you want to tank with the shaman and let the pet get around behind.  The fire pet is quite effective at lower levels with its built-in fire damage shield.  Four types of pets, each with something different to offer, give you more flexibility in what you hunt.<br />
<br />
Mages also fill a shaman weakness - nuking power.  If you need to burn something down in a hurry, mages can do the trick.  They have a weakness in that their DD lines are all either fire or magic based (I believe), but both mages and shaman have the malo line to debuff resistances.  Mages have a very nice selection of rains and nukes to put the hurt on mobs in a very quick time.  And the very effective agro generated by stunning or rooting pets gives them the ability to do so, within reason.  If you want to tank with the shaman, we all know how to generate stupid amounts of agro with malo/slow/cripple/dot/dot/dot, which will let the mage burn to his heart's content  :D <br />
<br />
Throw in the mage summoned pet toys for dogdog and jabober and you've got some decent mana-free dps.  Admittedly, the best toys are from level 60+ spells, but you can summon proccing weapongs, masks with item haste that stack with our spell haste, full sets of pet armor, and a waist item with 500 hp.  Fully outfitting two pets with mage toys GREATLY increases their staying power, and helps a little with dps, too.  Don't forget the mage damage shields on whichever pet is taking the beating.<br />
<br />
Mages can regen mana quite effectively by using their reclaim energy spells, so downtime should be held to a minimum (only effective at higher levels, though).<br />
<br />
Mages can summon an impressive array of focus items all the way up to the burning affliction IV bracers.  They have spell haste, improved damage, reagent conservation, and burning affliction lines from 1 - 4, so you can maximize your casting power for both characters at ZERO cost.<br />
<br />
Another nice thing about mages is they're not too dependant on gear.  You can outfit a mage with decent bazaar gear for a fraction of a warrior or monk's tab.  <br />
<br />
As you can tell, I'm pretty excited about the mage/shaman combo.  It's a little weak in a few areas, but every 2-box combo has weaknesses.  All in all, I think it will make an excellent 2-box combination.<br />
<br />
Just for kicks, I'm also leveling up a cleric as the 3rd character, to hopefully keep dogdog and jabober alive a little longer and take the sting out of deaths.  Shaman/cleric hp buffs on two pets should make for some good meatshields, and the cleric pacifying will make pulls simpler, since crowd control is one of the major weaknesses of shaman/mage.<br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you choose, and remember, have fun.  If you don't like a combo, try something else.  There's so much variety in the classes, you're bound to find something you like.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">RE: 2 boxing a bard<br />
<br />
Do you find it difficult to do the more complex bard tasks like twisting while two boxed?   I am intrigued.  My crew is always needing more bards and I am getting disenchanted trying to duo with my monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have no clue, my bard is only 50 atm, i just either grouped, Pled or swarmed.<br />
<br />
I tried to twist DS, AE DD and I'd say unless you have 4 hands, it's impossible to twist songs efficiently.<br />
<br />
However, i don't intend to group or raid while dual boxing a bard, it's purely for dual boxing purposes, using charm/lull, mana regen, snare etc...<br />
<br />
When i want to get exp/aa at 60+, i will just group regularly, or swarm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Have to go with the mage myself. I Box with my shaman, either, a paladin, a monk or a magician, all are around the same level +- 2 lvls. <br />
<br />
BY FAR the easiest to get exp and mobs dead with is the magician.<br />
<br />
They each have their fun factor of course and advantages. The paladin has the &lt; downtime of the melees but the monk has the most dps and can pull in the really nasty spots easily.<br />
<br />
It all depends on what type you want to play that day really. Do you want to melee mainly? do you want to level quickly? or do a dungeon?<br />
<br />
One thing. A tank class is better when you are unsure of what you are gonna come up against. So I take my pally into new situations first, LoH, and root are your ticket outta there usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Mage option. I dunno about you folks, but I have met some Mages who must have had the super-duper AA ability &quot;Cast of Doom.&quot; These guys were nuking idiots. I was in an odd group (Ranger, Enchanter (me), Wizard, Mage, Mage) outside of PoV caves. Ranger would snare pull and the rest is history. (When I mentioned I wasn't doing much as an Enchanter they all laughed and said &quot;Don't worry - just mez the occasional add - we have the DPS&quot; which was true.)<br />
<br />
Mages were bragging about their &quot;crit nukes,&quot; etc. Of course periodically the Wizard would have to put them in their place - but still. Don't forget they get ModRods as well.<br />
<br />
I guess the best advice is go with what sounds FUN. <br />
<br />
Caveat: I have a 61 Monk. They are heavily equipment dependant, and quite frankly unless you have above average gear for them - they are no longer the  de facto  partner of choice for Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I duo with a Wizard partly because I wanted something different than a shaman. Also partly cause he was my first toon and so I decided to go back and level him past 14 when I switched to the shaman at first. <br />
<br />
The wizard is nice as you can easily two box it with out a lot of attention. Just stand up after the shaman has agro and hot key some rains. I don't think it's the most powerful but does add some nice DPS to a shaman soloing plus you get nice utility with evac and ports. I'm planning to play the wizard all by himself when he gets high enough for a break from shamaning. The few times I have grouped him it's been fun to just do damage and not have to be concened for buffs or heals. <br />
<br />
Sometimes it's fun to have shaman non-stop action but sometimes I prefer something a little less intensive. The couple of times I grouped the wizard I felt kind of wierd though. Just sit and blast. No canni. No slow on incoming. No back up healing the over aggroing nukers. No rebuffs.<br />
<br />
I'd think that the 'best' duo would depend on what you want to do. <br />
<br />
If you like to solo (especially for farming), then a toon that could solo pull and tank would be nice. SK, Monky, Pally<br />
<br />
If you like to group then the perfect group combos are good. Cleric or SK Pally (who can say no to a group that already has a slower and a healer or a slower/healer and tank?)<br />
<br />

Druids don't do anything good for us, they are lesser wizards with heavy heal capabilities. Duoing with a druid is less efficient than duoing with a melee, which is less efficient than duoing with a necro or a mage :)<br />
<br />
Basically, shaman have this: heals, slow, dots. Look for a partner who can complete the team and do totally different things, like damage, snare, tanking, taunting...<br />
<br />
As for plvling, if you make a caster, unless you have a druid/mage to DS your toon, be rdy for a long walk to 51. Melees go faster (somewhere along the line of 1 lvl per hour and half to lvl 51, that's my record with my bard, who has crappy DPS), and even faster with DS, as usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">As for plvling, if you make a caster, unless you have a druid/mage to DS your toon, be rdy for a long walk to 51.<br />
<br />
If he is making a Necro, then PLing with a Shaman is not that hard. Have the Necro tank for the pet for the first 30 levels, which will keep his melee (especially Defense) skills maxed. It gets a little easier when the Necro gets his DS - stick to fast hitting critters like the Needlites (sp?) in Echo Caverns. After 30, tanking gets a bit harder, but then you can just haste the Necro pet, slow the mob and watch the pet kill the mob while it's beating on the Shaman.<br />
<br />
However, I would really recommend spending some time getting used to playing a Necro without powerleveling. They have their own set of tools, including Lich spells and DD/DOT lifetaps that make juggling HP and mana fun and challenging. Figuring out how you can split mobs with snare/FD, pet control, DD/DOT efficiency, healing (!) and so on can take a while.</div></div><hr />
