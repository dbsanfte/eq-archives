<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering at what level a shaman can slow mobs in PoH fairly consitently. I am currently level 49 and went on a recent PoH raid. I was the only shaman present (for some reason) and couldn't land a single slow or Malosi. :mad: Well, I did slow ONE mob, but that was after an enchanter did his thing and it still took me several casts to land it. As the chanter couldn't afford to debuff mr consistently due to performing his other duties, I had to give up on slowing and just back-up heal, buff and occasionally jbb the mobs. Was I just too low-level? or did we need more chanters who could debuff more? This wasn't the best planned raid and many had to leave early, which is why there were so few shamans and enchanters. Any advice would be appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">49 is pretty low to be the main slower.  I remember having a hard time at 51, only landing maybe 30-40% with the first few slow tries.<br />
<br />
I havent been back to hate for a long time but I do remember the last time I was there, a 55ish shaman would land 80-90% first try on the first floor stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ahhh.... Thanks. I guess I'll just have to get some more levels before I go back to Hate as the slower. I wanna go back, but I want to be useful for more than just buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have slowed in hate at 52 and 53.   Except for the spite Golems, I was able to land a slow either on first shot, or right after Malo* (not sure what the name of current one is, they are all Malo to me).   If slow wouldn't land, I'd generally slap out Malo, land it just fine (enchie tashed by then since I called slow resisted) then slow.<br />

  Definately have a mage summon you a Aggro control earing though.   Priceless buggers.</div></div><hr />
