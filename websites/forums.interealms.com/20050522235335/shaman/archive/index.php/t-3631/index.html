<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is all this different kind of gears?  I'm at level 20 and about the only items I own, except for a spit full of various meats, I am wearing.  Please tell met that I will come across neat gear in the future.  I'm in the LOIO right now and nothing is dropping anything magical to wear or any neat magic weapons.  Where is all this magic coming from?  Where do I go to get it?  I have about 60pp and all this is going to go towards my 24 lvl spells.  Am I doomed from the start?  Have I missed something?  I think I am doing pretty well.  I don't die real often since I got sow.  Or is all this extra equipment going to be dropping off monsters when I move up in levels?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most of the &quot;good gear&quot; doesnt drop in outdoor zones but in dungeons. That is why you wont see much of it, if you hunt in LoIO.<br />
<br />
You dont say what you are wearing, but at your level you really dont have to worry about keeping different sets of equipment.<br />
<br />
Raid gear and resist gear are very situational and are something that first begins to matter, when you get near to the socalled &quot;Endgame&quot; where you go up against the different bossmobs that are spread around the world.<br />
<br />
At you level my advise to you would be to focus on getting xp and only buy gear if it is a direct upgrade of something you are wearing.<br />
<br />
In your mid to late 30's you should begin to consider doing the totemic armor (unless you are an Iksar that gets their own armor quests in Cabilis)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">&lt;-----i didn't own a single piece of resist gear until i was level 57 or somthing.<br />
<br />
now at 60 i have diffeent resist gear for different stuff...HP gear...AC gear...many many different weapons.<br />
<br />
at lvl 20~ concentrate on beating the mobs brains in...not what your wearing.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sometime around the 30s I started wearing more and more AC/HP stuff and less Wis stuff and so I used to carry those extra +wis items if I needed the bigger mana pool.  (Breaking a spawn, was gonna have to do a lot of healing) but eventually noticed I rarely put the wis stuff back on so I gave it to a friends drood.<br />
<br />
In the 50s I started collecting resist items because my guild started organizing for different dragon raids where we needed it.  I've now got a back just to carry around resist stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks alot guys.  I don't feel so bad now.  I'll just keep on bashing those mobs and slowing in groups.  I guess it really doesn't matter what gear you have as long as you survive and are an asset to the group you are in.  So far it seems that people enjoy having me in a group because I am there when the cleric gets low on mana.  I usually after slowing the mob guard the healers and casters when they draw agro.  A couple of spirit strikes and a few bashes seems to turn them on me till the tanks can get agro back.  As a troll I can take a pretty good beating and just regen when the puller is out gathering up more baddies. The forum here has really helped out alot with tips.</div></div><hr />
