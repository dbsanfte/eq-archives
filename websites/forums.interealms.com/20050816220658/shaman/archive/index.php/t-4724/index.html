<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for a quick estimate on how much damage people have heard clerics doing with YalupV and hammers.<br />
<br />
I know the merits of the bonuses have been discussed... but I don't think anyone has actually given any numbers on how effective those spells actually are.<br />
<br />
I've only managed to dig up one parse which was around 25-30 DPS.<br />
<br />
With the mana cost for YalupV being bought down to 10... that makes it around 7-8 mana a tick.<br />
<br />
Accurate? Yes no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've heard that the new Hammer and Yaulp5 make Clerics too effective melee - and this was from a mid-50s cleric.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleric dots can't get any worse than they are really ;)<br />
<br />
Tests I've seen is roughly 30-40 dps. Mind you, this is on undead, and includes nuking.<br />
<br />
Cleric had gone up to PoH, and used Mark of Retribution (15 pt ds), summoned hammer, had some item haste I believe, summoned a pet, and used root / epitaph of life (750 damage over 30 sec) / judgement to make up for what he / pet weren't doing.<br />
<br />
Rough numbers were:<br />
Melee DPS: 5-10<br />
Proc DPS: 12-17<br />
MoR DPS: ~8-10<br />
<br />
And dot / nuke made up for the rest.<br />
<br />
Being a cleric, I can't wait til wednesday ;)</div></div><hr />
