<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got a question about Spell Casting Fury and Fury of Magic... and yes I did a search and couldn't find the answer with normal search terms.<br />
<br />
SCF1 = 33% increase to damage on crit.<br />
SCF2 = 66%<br />
SCF3 = 100%<br />
<br />
Is FoM1 supposed to be 133%? FoM2 166%? FoM3 200%?<br />
<br />
A wizard friend tells me that's how it works for them. If so, why am I only critting for 1850(Velium Strike; 925 x2) with FoM1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">From what I have read... both CF and FoM merely increase the chance of a crit... All of your crits will be twice the regular damage of the spell. This is just a guess seeing as I have neither ability.<br />
<br />
  If thats not the case then CF increases damage and then FoM increases chance. Just a guess............<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beliael: With SCF1 I can confirm you do 33% extra damage. Using torrent of poison crits hit for 720, compared to 540 for the standard rain. A similar result is obtained with direct nukes.<br />
<br />
Crits are also very few and far between. All in all, SCF 1 is not very worthwhile. That is not to say SCF 2 or 3 isn't any good though :) I believe that higher levels both increase the damage and the frequency.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid I can't comment on FoM1, beyond suggesting that either a) its broken or b) it only increases the frequency of the crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I have SCF3 and FoM1. SCF does go in order of 33%, 66% and 100%. FoM1 does not seem to do anything. I don't seem to crit any more than I did before, nor do I crit for more than double.<br />
<br />
Also, with SCF1, I rarely crit a nuke. With SCF2, I started seeing crits every once in a while. With SCF3, I crit all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have SCF3 / FOM1.<br />
<br />
SCF1 = 33<br />
SCF2 = 66<br />
SCF3 = 100<br />
<br />
FOM1 does NOT increase damage, but does increase frequency of crits.  I suspect that it follows the same progression as SCF1/SCF2/SCF3 for frequency (so if it were 2, 5, and 7 precent increased chance to crit with SCF1, SCF2, and SCF3 I suspect that FOM1, FOM2, and FOM3 would equate to a total of 9, 12, and 14 percent chance to crit).<br />
<br />
I decided that at FOM1 I am currently critting often enough to satisfy myself.  I decided to go back and do ND1/ND2/ND3 and HG1/HG2/HG3.  I may also get RC2 before going back to the crit-machine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tytann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HAHA, I like the first line.  :p <br />
<br />
<br />
and yes I did a search and couldn't find the answer with normal search terms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fury of Magic 3 is worth every single point.  You crit alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCF1 = +33% damage; 2% to crit hit<br />
SCF2 = +33% or +66% damage ; 5% to crit hit<br />
SCF3 = +33% or +66% or +100% damage ; 7% to crit hit<br />
FoM3 = same damage as SCF3 but add about extra 5% crit rate<br />
<br />
that mean with SCF3 you still hit +33% sometime, but max is +100%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman:<br />
<br />
I think you are incorrect.  With SCF2, you never crit for &lt; 66%.  When you crit, you ALWAYS crit for +66%.  Likewise with SCF3.  It is definitely not 33, 66, or 100.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think Shamam is confused by the fact that the percentage can be added to partially successful nukes as well. I have had crits on Velium Strike for 90 damage. What this means is that it was actually a 45 damage nuke that critted.</div></div><hr />
