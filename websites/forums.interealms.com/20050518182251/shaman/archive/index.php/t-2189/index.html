<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Taken from Castersrealm:<br />
<br />
<br />
A number of new spell effects for Caster Focus items have been added to the spell data file on Test.<br />
<br />
The effects of these are only guessed at by our members on the Casters Realm team but the new effects do show some interesting potential for new caster items.<br />
<br />
Note that these are only on Test Server and may change before going live.<br />
<br />
Reagent Conservation - Percent chance to not use a component on spells. <br />
Extended Enhancement - Percent increase on duration of buffs. <br />
Improved Damage - Percent increase on DD spells. <br />
Spell Haste - Percent reduction on casting time of dd's, heal's). <br />
Mana Preservation - Percent reduction in mana cost of dd's, heal's). <br />
Improved Healing - Percent increase in amount healed. <br />
Extended Range - Percent increase in spell range to target. <br />
Summoning Haste - Percent reduction in time of summoned objects (non-undead pets only). <br />
Summoning Efficiency - Percent reduction in mana cost of summoned items (non-undead pets only). <br />
Enhancement Haste - Percent reduction in casting of buff spells. <br />
Affliction Efficiency - Percent reduction in mana cost of dots. <br />
Extended Affliction - Percent increase in duration of dot's, more ticks, same damage per tick as prior, more total damage. <br />
Reanimation Haste - Percent reduction time in casting undead pets (undead pets only). <br />
Reanimation Efficiency - Percent reduction in mana cost of undead pets (undead pets only <br />
<br />
Woot!  Extra ticks on Epic, Pox, or Bane would be great!  Finally something gud for Shaman...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
Especially the extended dot damage...that will be sooo nice.<br />
<br />
That is if we can actually land the dots :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">extra tick of curse of the spirits would be pretty strong <br />

probly be nerfed for splurt dots</div></div><hr />

This should be cool... can't wait till these items make it live.<br />

Of course it'll probably be a pain to get any of them :o</div></div><hr />

I'm just hoping these are on something other than summoned items. Be nice to have caster loots that are worthwhile for more than flowing thought.</div></div><hr />

OMG!<br />
you mean we don't have to be in melee range for our epic to land?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I just hope they are adding these effects to items already in game, rather than make us all find new equip to get these effects. Sorta like the melee upgrade months ago when tons of weapons were enhanced. <br />
<br />
My guess is that they will make us work for it, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ROFL, good call. From EQCasters:<br />
<br />
Here is a list of items currently known from the Test Server as reported on Graffes:<br />
<br />
Polished Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency I <br />
Bracelet of Woven Grass - Spell Haste I <br />
Golden Efreeti Boots - Enchancement Haste II <br />
Damask Robe - Extended Enhancement I <br />
Ring of Goblin Lords - Affliction Haste I <br />
Green Silken Drape - Affliction Haste II <br />
Moonstone Ring - Extended Range II <br />
Batskull Earring - Reagent Conservation I <br />
Runed Mithril Bracers - Reagent Conservation III <br />
Azure Sleeves - Improved Damage I <br />
Turtle Shell Helm - Improved Healing I <br />
Sarnak Arcane Fetish - Improved Healing II <br />
Chipped Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency II <br />
Savant's Cap - Reagent Conservation II</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hrm wonder if it is like the other focus items where they only need to be worn at the time of the cast i think i could tolerate putting on a Chipped bone bracelet for long enough to get my DoTs off /grin<br />
<br />
Ssarahh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Extended duration on dots? Comon! =P<br />
How many times does your dot last through the whole fight? Unless soloing...<br />
<br />
With poxx it might not even last the fight out solo if they have increased duration. What they SHOULD do is increase the damage every tick. DD spells works at once and usually get the full effect from this, Increased duration does not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tailen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like this. :)  Finally something for the dots, even our fuzzy four legged one is getting some changes!<br />
<br />
Lol, I'm kind of glad I've been too lazy to upgrade my equipment, I'm still wearing  a Chipped Bone Bracelet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">From what i could tell from this Graffe's thread (http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessageRange?topicID=17056.topic&amp;start=1&amp;stop=25) there are limits on the level of the spell casted.<br />
<br />
Level I is up to 20.<br />
Level II is up to 44.<br />
Level III is up to 60.<br />
<br />
So a chipped bone bracelet wouldn't even affect e-bolt.<br />
Sounds a bit like anti-reverse twinking, if that makes sense, heh.<br />
Have to wait for the second round of items with the higher level effects if you are casting level 44+ spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Okay, I know this is just test, but this doesn't make much sense:<br />
<br />
Sarnak Arcane Fetish - Improved Healing II<br />
<br />
1.  Healing II is level 44 and the Sarnak Arcane Fetish drops in Chardok, pretty much a level 50+ dungeon<br />
2.  Sarnak arcane fetish is an INT CASTER item, glad to know they'll get a lot of use out of that healing bonus<br />
<br />
Wait...&quot;Improved Healing - Percent increase in amount healed...&quot; does that mean the person wearing the sarnak arcane fetish would get bonuses on all heals cast on him/her?<br />
<br />
I'm so confused!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah a few of those made me go: say whu?<br />
Turtle shell helm Improved Healing I...An item of choice for the average priest?<br />
Runed Mithril Bracers - Reagent Conservation III...Look for your local 60 cleric getting back to that old skool look.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, hopefully we'll see the 3rd rank of Focus items on higher end armor, like Wolf Callers, Rune Crafters, Spirit Callers, and Spirit Weavers. Would be nice to have something on my Wolf Caller's boots besides the oh-so-handy Extinguish Fatigue effect with the 5 second cast time. :P<br />
<br />
I'm also curious to see if there is any difference between items of a particular rank. For instance, will some Rank III Extended Affliction items have a greater percentage to the time they extend the DOT than others, or will it be uniform across the board?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am curious to see if ToV items or SS/KD quest items got changed as well. Time will tell. Finally a change to look forward too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, a lot of those items are decent at lower levels - except for an overly twinked server.  And even then, not every 50+ person is going to be in a big guild, or play enough to get the &quot;normal&quot; gear that you read about - because most of the posters are from the bigger guilds.  Heck, one of my guild clerics (50+) commented that she still wears RMB's; of course, she plays a bit sporadically.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Heh, maybe they'll put the level 3 stuff back on Hate and Fear armor.  Wont' I kick myself for just deleting my Rune Etched Gloves and Arms? ;/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">was looking at some of the items that these focus items are on.<br />
<br />
Its mostly low end stuff.<br />
<br />
Savants caps, RMBs, Grass bracelets, PBBs.  That kinda thing.  At level 47 I think the only thing on that list that I still have on my shaman is RMBs (I have a pair).  So unless they start making some higher end items with the same/enhanced effects.  Its going to be rather dry for the shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh.  My RMBs have Reagent Conservation II.  Hooray (sarcasm).  My supplies of bat wings and fish scales, thanks you immensely.  Though I can see it being a huge boost to Clerics and components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So they are going to put these effects on all those items?  Is that what i&quot;m gathering?  <br />
<br />
<br />
Man, poor 30-40 camps.  I can see hordes of 50+'s rushing over to grab some of these.. though I have to admit I'd like a CBB if it's going to do that too.. just hotswap it then put it back..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Mabye the sarnak arcane fetish is for Magician pet heal?</div></div><hr />

I seriously doubt they will put these effects on regular armor sets, at least until the Planes of Power armor anyway.<br />

Chipped Bone Bracelet - Affliction Efficiency II <br />
<br />
a 100-200 pp item giving an extra tick on all lower level dots?  I dont believe that will last long if it ever leaves test.  <br />
<br />
likewise improved healing wont turn us into clerics. They may very well just add a chance at a higher healing (+3%, 6%, 9%) like AA points do.<br />
<br />
more likely they will give +5% to +30% chance of a bonus tick or a chance of percentage increase. I envision people putting together sets of dot armor/healing toys, nuking etc, with a total improvement of being able to cast near the next higher spell circle.  It would make alot of sense for each armor piece to add a cumulative percentage increase chance.  Then they can add a benefit to several thousand items and not change the game tremendously in reality, while claiming CASTER BALANCING!!!!  <br />
<br />
Is this the caster balance they promised?  (the 2nd wave after pets?)  if it is, and we will all have to start carrying 2-3 of some armor peices to get certain swap out effects, I wont be happy.<br />

Now we can all watch our AC drop by 250, hp drop by 400, and mana drop by 400 just so we can wear these sucky focus items.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't Affliction efficiency reduces mana cost.  Extended affliction increases duration</div></div><hr />
