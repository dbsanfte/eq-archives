<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">does it stack with the increased buff duration aa? anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have tested it with the duration aaxp skill and the 8th shawl they both stack with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Feeldary</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">how long ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharidann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">48 sec base. then adds 15 and 15 so 30% more .. i.e. max : <br />
62,4 sec :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Viken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Zephyr of Brell adds 20% and SCR3 adds 30% which means total +50% = a maximum of 72 seconds.<br />
<br />
BTW Zephyr of Brell is limited to buffs with at least 48s duration. I wonder if Guardian of the Forest was designed with this in mind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lonetree</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What exactly does this do? chang you into a wolf? does it work both indoors and out doors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>khalysta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It is wolf form that works indoors and out while giving increased atk and a bard like haste. Atk and haste goes up with each level you buy.  Its an ok aa but does have problems while raiding you lose your shrink which sucks.  It also tends to aggro in places like pov things that dont normally aggro on you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have this AA, I wish they'd get rid of the damn illusion on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suineko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Please stop telling them to get rid of the illusion. Some of us bought it solely FOR the illusion. Having it, however, kicks bootie for the additional ATK if you're using archery... no idea how useful it is with melee, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Elwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The illusion is purely cosmetic. Some people may like the illusion because they like looking like a wolf for a few moments, but functionally speaking it is impractical due to sight problems, shrink removal, and faction issues. In fact, the side-effect of the illusion and faction portion of Greater Wolf Form being dispelled when it wears off is GREAT in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I know from your posts here that you like being a dog in game, Suineko. Consider that the majority of players in EQ find wolf form just as annoying as I do, and/or only bought this AA for the functional side of it: ATK and Haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Leiker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Elwin - that is excactly why they should NOT remove the illusion. I can live with 48 secs once in a while, and stay pretty wood elf the rest of time while in wolffom.<br />
<br />
This disc is great for allowing wolfform atk, while not getting sea sick after a whole night.<br />
<br />
The LoS for me is no biggie, since I am always levi'ed - just a matter of habbit i guess. And the Shrink you mention - potions aren't too expensive if you're friends with a Shammy ... else, shammies and warriors are usually available, if you're a place shrink is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianwan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The side effects of the illusion has actually banned this AA from some of our raids, haveing X number of non agro mobs agro on you when you hit this AA, then agro on all the bards for singing songs that hit you or the clerics / druids / shamans / whatnot for healing or buffing you while these mobs agro is a HUGE pain in the ass. Besides the haste portion doesnt stack with and is smaller than what any of our bards can give and thus it wont take hold more often than not. imo a pretty worthless AA.<br />
<br />
PS. Leiker if you want to have wolfform atk like you describe theres lots of ways around gettin the ATK without the illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Azarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i have already started my feedback spam on this disc, and for the removal of the illusion.  the illusion is more trouble then it is worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gunjin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The faction issues with the illusion on this ability are pure nonesense and need to be addressed, I could care one whit if i look like a wolf or no but haveing an aa ability with a 15 min recycle be unusable in certain zones due to the faction issues is unaceptable in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Amen. I've been /feedbacking them once a night for awhile now. Kinda silly we're still paying for the sins of unrest and wolf form being non agro. There is no logical reason for wolf form to be KOS but many other illusions aren't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>ArafysAragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I personally depise wolf form myself. I can't stand the lunging, that and I never know whether I am sitting or standing... that and people constantly think I'm a druid.. I hate that. But with the lunging, I always end up *in* the mob I am fighting it tends to make combat positioning difficult at times.  I'm glad it's bugged : ) Now I'd get it just to wipe the wolf illusion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">*puts his hand in Arafys's pants*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ArafysAragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Bah wrong board Alexzander.  : )<br />
<br />
If I tried that script here, Sunmoon'd have my guts for garters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Alexzander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Your pm box would probably be full from offers too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">additional side effect with countermands logic all toghether.<br />
<br />
Encounters are requireing increasing amounts of people to defeat, sometimes in small places, this means shrink is almost a requirement. <br />
I have regretted every moment of this AA skill because of faction and because it cancels shrink, not to mention bard songs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ruvane Hammerfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'd *still* rather change into a big black cat...:).<br />
<br />
Actually, the reasons given are why I have spent aa's on Ferocity and Fury of the Ages....I'm glad I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Dathom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">on long raids like clearing of VT, the wolf form is nothing but annoying since if you want to use it every 15mins over 6 hrs, you go through 2 and half shrink potions from FG.......unless you luck out and have a shrinker in your group...<br />
<br />
I would be all for keeping the illusion if Verant would make shrinking items work within /raid ....that way you wouldn't have to be grouped to shrink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Shrink seems to be holding for me when wolf form wears off.. maybe my client is bugged.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>efvil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Does it stack with avatar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Yes.  Use Lucy to check all stacking issues.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I wish verant would address the aggro issues with any kind of illusion in general.  To many zones make you KoS as soon as you use Wolf form or GotF, which is really unfortunate for, if nothing else, the atk raises that we lose not being able to use wolf form.<br />
<br />
I rarely melee these days, so the lunging of wolf form really doesn't bother me.  And since, with KEI and any FT items, I rarely sit anymore.  If I &quot;could&quot; I would be wolf form whenver possible.  Unfortunately, its just not possible in many zones these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I got guardian of the forest last night, and did a test on it... found something very interesting.<br />
<br />
First of all, notice that lucy has guardian of the forest listed as a level 1 ranger spell.<br />
<br />
Went to the bazaar, and bought a set of bear hide boots (5 ac, eff: Extended Enhancement 1).  Put on boots, and hit the guardian of the forest button...<br />
<br />
&quot;Your Bear-hide Boots sparkles.&quot;<br />
<br />
For 50 pp I got a 15 percent increase on the duration of Guardian of the Forest :)</div></div><hr />

Nice work.. :)</div></div><hr />

Yes you have tow atch where you use it but what ranger who has it doesn't know what zones they areKOS to in WF?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And without further ado, VI will have that fixed in a giffy.  I swear they learn more from message boards about what they don't want happening in game than anywhere else.  Will admit I never thought of it though.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Oh yah, I only use this this disc when I am exping, providing no where like PoS where it will get me killed from adds, or when using TS on raids.  I can't afford shrink potions for hours and hours of raiding each night, and most of the time peeps get upset having to shrink me every 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Thornwhistler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Fairly sure the focus is intended Rotane.  SK's can use azure sleeves to boost their HT in the same manner (at least using aa ht's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>logolas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">does anyone know how much of a haste and atk increase this gives each upgrade?...and another question...does the haste on this breach the haste cap?<br />
<br />
Logolas SilverSword, 64 Warder of TS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">About the only use I see for this skill is if you regularly group with shrink-happy shaman in EXP groups, then this could be used a shrink killer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lanilya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I like the attack it gives. And the haste. I use it when I need a damage boost (about 20% dps increase at lvl 3). When would you need damage boost?<br />
<br />
- On bossmobs - this stacks with TS disc<br />
- On trials for timed kills<br />
<br />
I am happy I bought it. And i didnt mention the fact it allows wolfform without the illusion, so PoS frogs and guards leave you in peace.<br />
