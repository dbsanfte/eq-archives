Elder Crashem<br />
<br />
For people's info, my skills to date are:<br />
<br />
RUNSPEED 3<br />
REGEN 3 (verant nerfed by troll double regen ACK)<br />
MC 3<br />
SC Reinforcement 1<br />
Canni 5<br />
Rabid Bear<br />
<br />
Any other skills worth getting in Class?  Trying to decide to go back and max out SC Reinforcement and get Class version or get SC Mastery to save some mana.<br />
<br />
BTW, I am on a PvP server so at some point I will get SC Fury which is such a waste.  Well, I got like 14 points in about a week so I can spare the points.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm not yet.  I will get to them eventually.  I am an uber guild and with my normal equipment, my resists are at the point of dimishing returns.  Any ideas on more useful skills.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Channeling focus Crashem, no question about it.<br />
<br />
Think about it, what classes do you have most trouble vs in pvp?<br />
<br />
Melees im guessing.<br />
<br />
Extra chance of regaining concentration means you get an edge on melees. Also get hold of the +10% channeling boots from Grieg.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hmm great advice<br />
<br />
(btw hate you bobino and your 97 aa points.  Oh well I was out of the game for like 9 months when luclin came out).<br />
<br />
Here is my thinking:<br />
<br />
MGB:  I am in uber guild and we do a lot of raiding.  But the clerics and enchanters always whine when I cast MGB focus.  So I would be getting MGB for group stamina or chrisma or sow ack.<br />
<br />
Channelling:  Primarily looting for help in PvE at the minute.  I definitely plan on getting channeling but not yet.<br />
<br />
So it comes down to the following:<br />
<br />
Go for SC Reinforcement or SC Mastery.<br />
<br />
Torpors lasting longer and other buffs too seem nice, but my initial thought is that SC Mastery will save me more mana.  Any thoughts on mana savings from SC Mastery.  I currently invested one point into each of them.  So which do you guys think is more useful in PvE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">MGB is a necessary evil as far as Clerics and Chanters go...if they don't like it tell them to go suck a snake egg. ;) All they need to do is reapply their own buff, it really isn't a big deal.  Certainly no worse than the totally clueless Druids who insist on casting SoE on anything that freaking moves.<br />
<br />
I'm at 33 AA points now, have done Cann 5 and MGB, and am trying to figure out what to do next.  I will definitely try to get Quick Buff in there somewhere, as well as SC, but I want the Elder title ASAP.  Seems the best I can do is 25 or 26 points in Class given the ones I've already chosen.  One  or two extra isn't too bad I guess.<br />
