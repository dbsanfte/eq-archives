<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shambul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok here it is.I have win95 and that is not EQ compatable anymore from what boards say.My pc is archaic to say the least it is already maxxed on mem ram and grfx.I am not sure if there will be enough space to have Win98 and still have enough space to play EQ (.<br />
<br />
Other problem is real bad,My work is cutting down to 4 days a week starting this week WOOFUCKING HOO(and we will be closed down from Dec 22 to Jan2 for the holidays to save some money MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS employees.<br />
<br />
I will not sit at home for almost 2 weeks and not be able to play EQ and if I am not able to play from home then I will be canceling my acnt dropping IP and reverting back to my cheapy local only phone line this will save my family over 60 bucks a month.There is no reason to pay this if I cant play EQ at home and being restricted to only playing 3 or 4 days a week at Bearans house will just frustrate me even more.<br />
<br />
So the next week or so will make my decision known till then I will see you guys only when I am at Bearans house and I will have fun with you guys in SoL.<br />

<br />
Hope you can get something sorted out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a feeling there will be a lot of customers who choose to quit EQ rather than go buy hundreds of dollars of computer expansions.<br />
<br />
I'm very sorry to hear this, and I wish you all the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">good point J, <br />
<br />
I think VI has known this for months but waited to sell SoL and let people find out the hard way that 30% or more cant play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Umm Why not just upgrade to Win98?<br />
<br />
I think I can help out with that if you don't have the bucks to pickup a copy.<br />
<br />
I upgraded my old POS Win95 system to Win98 in expectation of this issue and it has been working great, pre-SOL at least.<br />
<br />
I'll know Friday (hopefully) whether this system continues to work well (it will not however show any of the new graphics, I will have them on my primary system though.)<br />
<br />
Hope to see you all online Friday night,  if any of you still have problems please post em.  We have some good minds here to help you through the problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zelfani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Great idea Moe!! Try it Sham and see if it works.. good luck!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Upgrading to Win98 should not be that big a deal as long as you can find a copy that someone is not using any more. I am curious about your system specs. How fast a chip, how much memory, and what graphics card. Last night I loaded SoL on Harry's pc and it was running awful. It had 128mb ram and a Voodoo3 2000 card. Constant disk access whenever you turned or went t a new section just like the old EQ on 64mb ram. I took a 128mb chip from my pc and put in his, turned off textures, and turned down texture quality.  It runs fine now. I have not tested yet what would make it run better at 128 but I am sure turning everything down would make it work ok.</div></div><hr />

I know it's a pain but just upgrading your Motherboard and CPU woudn't be too expensive for a AMD 550Mhz with MB is around 150 or less which isnt bad.  Check your local pc shops or pricewatch.com</div></div><hr />
