<br />
I assume that the more faction you get, the more items are revealed on the faction merchant npc's, assuming that you are able to buy an item to use that does that.<br />
<br />
Or... maybe its strictly faction based. Reach x faction level, get Y benefit.</div></div><hr />

The 5 from OoW were barely enough to cover the new buffs (and PoP clickies), hopefully this round will actually let me wear every buff I want, with Heal Over Times, and not lose things to AEs.</div></div><hr />

It put it under my general tab (was already purchased automatically) with a description of &quot;Your devotion to Dark Reign grants you increased statistics.&quot;  The NPC also said &quot;If you ever betray the Dark Reign we can take this gift away.&quot;  The AA seems to have increased my stats by 10 points each.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;hr&gt;Prathun-Dev wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Congrats on being among the first to find the quest AA in Dragons of Norrath!&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Similar to the single group Proving Ground Trial AA, you receive it automatically and at no cost for progressing through the storyline quest.  &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;DIV&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;<br />
