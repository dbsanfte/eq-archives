<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got very lucky today on a nice drop and bought myself a JBB!  WOOOT!  Im level 49, not twinked and having a hell of a time gettin equipment.  This is going to make the going much easier than before I would imagine :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">grats :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe too right it will, grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grats :) im waiting to ding 45 to be able to use mine, but that darn CS has gotten me kinda addicted again, so havent been leveling up enough(instead of playing EQ as usual, i was up till 3 scrimming w/ champs of second best league in cs :X)<br />

<br />
Also, you say you have a hell of a time gettin stuff, but damn, i think your equip is pretty damn nice,  900+AC, and 1700HP at 49? yeah, thats nice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hell I'm only about 850ac and 1300hp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">make a baseless assumption that he's talking about buffed hp/ac.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's especially baseless since he explicitly says unbuffed. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Arc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">ac is said as unbuffed, for Hp its not mentioned so...<br />
But 914 ac at 49 without twink sounds doubtful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, he could be an uber trader :)<br />
<br />
i had a necro friend who had 200int by level 10, by sitting in NFP all day(NFP bieng saryrns auction place)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i never claimed to have read the entire post carefully :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not twinked one bit.  At level 16 I got a goblin gaz-somethingorother-ring in LOIO and sold it to someone for 6k (to a really really nice, uber person, I had no idea it was worth anything at all).  At level 34 I sat in paldual caverens for 2 weeks farming nothing but the bandit loot for plat.  After this plat I sat in EC for almost a week buying and selling, ended up with some VERY nice gear at level 35 or so.  At level 44 I killed hill giants until my eyes bleed.  Took a break for a week to power level a port whore on another account.  Ported for 6 days making almost 3k-4k per day doing nothing but running to all way zones and porting.  Just got lucky on a dragon raid 2 days ago and sold something for a HELL of a lot of money.  Finished up with my buying and selling just last night.  Im sorry I was mistaken about my hp, they are 1529 unbuffed, I couldnt remember last night and didnt want to log back into EQ just to check.  My ac is mostly from maxing my defense and wearing some really good stuff :)<br />
<br />
If I could figure out how to work magelo correctly (sorry im dumb) I would post my equipment.<br />
<br />
So to all the sceptics, I tell you, Im being honest.</div></div><hr />
