My real point to this is lately journalists have been trying to show the &quot;real&quot; Bush and his blunders but the fact is every president has made their blunders... They are after all... only human.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, clinton didn't almost kill himself with a pretzal:)  Clinton made mistakes, just as bush is.  I think the great majority of the country is fine with both of them and thinks they did an OK job.  There seems to be two small, but rabidly vocal minoritys that attack either bush or clintion when either of them come up.<br />
