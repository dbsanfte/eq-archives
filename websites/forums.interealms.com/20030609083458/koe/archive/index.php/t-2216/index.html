<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a reminder that the Tuesday crew will be headed out for Nurga. We will setup and meet at the FM/LoIO zone on the FM side at 645 CST and procede to Nurga. Alternatively, you may meet us inside the Nurga entrance at 7 CST. <br />
<br />
The main body of this group is 29 and 30, but some as low as 25 have come. <br />
<br />
A reminder is to bring some Bloodstones for our clerics.  <br />
<br />
Look for Calon/Klydon or Griss/Bearan<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing everyone there.. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did get in one of the groups later and got some EXP and some loot ..Thanks again</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Darkcast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am very sorry Evilidiol could not make it last night. Our power went out an hour before the raid :( I would love to group with you all and get to know as many of you as I can! I am currently PLing my shadowknight alot, and to my joy he has leveled very fast. However I have a level 29 wizard who can't get a group to save his soul, if it ok I would love to join you all next week (Power company willing lol) with my wizard named Zapster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yep, yep.. great to see you all and to meet a lot of new faces..<br />
<br />
Part of the function of our little get together is to give us all some practice at our chosen classes.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to seeing you all next week.. :)<br />
<br />
The Zapster is also welcome as we seem to be a bit short on porters and it will become important down the road. We are looking to do Dalnir soon and it is handy to have porters there.. :)</div></div><hr />
