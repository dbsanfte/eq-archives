<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i know it's probably been said before, but i'm feeling especially cranky about it right now.<br />
<br />
i can *not* get groups to lvl up to 70, i've been stuck in 66 for weeks. People on my server just don't want shamans in their xp groups, They go for chanters for the extra CC/haste/mana regen, or beastlords for the extra dps/mana regen, or both (usually both).  The only thing that gets me groups is the fact that i have an extra stackable hp buff (focus)... and that doesn't usually even get me groups, it just gets me people sending tells asking me to come buff their group for plat. <br />
<br />
For example, the other day i'm in WoS:<br />
<br />
You say out of character, 'lvl 66 shm LFG~'<br />
Randombeastlord_01 tells you, 'hey man, if i give you plat can you come cast fo7 on my group?'<br />
<br />
i think it's lame that the only time i ever get offered a group is if there's *no* beastlords and *no* chanters lfg.  I actually had a group yell at me the other night cause when i was ready to log, i tried inviting another shaman to replace me. They were like &quot;*** no, get the beastlord!~!&quot; <br />
<br />
Since i'm on stromm, where approximately 50% of the total population is beastlords, i'm pretty much screwed 95% of the time, unless i want to solo, but grinding xp solo makes my eyes bleed :\<br />

I know how that goes and the best answer is to make your own groups.  If you start doing that and you get a response from somebody saying something along the lines of, &quot;Group with a shaman?  Sorry, I'm looking to group with a beastlord or enchanter, thanks&quot;, then let us know here and I'll eat my left sock :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">as much as i HATE to admit it, i tend to pick up group a lot.  I HATE pickup groups....<br />
i have a serverwide chat set up with 10-12ish of my close friends, several of them 2-4 box.  i try very hard to get groups with them or their guildies (as most of them are on the top guilds of the my server, so i know the people i am with wont durrrrr out on me.)  Still, people have different raid and play times so i tend to pickup group.  when i go LFG I get tells NONSTOP for WoS (i F-ing hate that zone, and turn them down constantly...)<br />
<br />
i think the key to getting pick up groups is: set your own groups up, play a lot, make sure you are remebmered, and be flexable.<br />
it sounds stupid but,<br />
1)if you set up your own group you are assured a spot in the group.<br />
2)the more you play the more people you meet/meet you.<br />
3)if people remember you as a good shaman they will actively look for YOU before other people when setting groups up.<br />
4)be willing to try new things with pickups. people remeber who they were with when they try new stuff.<br />
<br />
honestly this stuff matters.  i have pick-up grouped through 200ish Ldons, prolly 60 levels, and 300ish AAs.  especially with less than uber guilds, they notice when: everyone + pets are buffed, everything gets slowed and agro doesn't get pulled half way across a room, the cleric or chanter don't die (cuz you heal,) you CC, you off tank, ect.  When you play a good and attentive shaman!<br />
<br />
you may not have put your &quot;pick up group time in&quot; so to speak.  best thing to do is to start groups and get to know the people who play a lot and lfg a lot.  you get to see a lot of the same people and they will start to rememeber you.  trust me, eventually, you will lfg for a much shorter amount of time.<br />
<br />
btw- if i were any other class i would much rather have a chanter or BL in the group over a shaman.  most people really aren't that smart though.  they still think of shaman as velious dragon soloers lol =p ooooo aaaaa<br />
<br />
edit- this post made me feel like someone's grandfather talking...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear ya, and couldn't agree more. I've just about given up on groups in the last few weeks, and as much as I hate it I've been solo grinding. It sucks, to say the least.  :(   <br />
<br />
I think I might start putting together groups made up completely of shaman, since a lot of us seem to have this problm. If I can find enough online, that is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
believe it or not i've got a prtty aweful story from the other day.<br />
<br />
i was sitting lfg for a while, when i get a tell from someone:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, want to join a group for a tipt or vxed run?&quot;<br />
<br />
now, since i need both of those trials, they're good exp, and there's good loot, i said &quot;hell yes&quot; and the guy said &quot;awesome now all we need is an enchanter.&quot;<br />
<br />
i started running there, and when i almost got there i got another tell from the guy:<br />
<br />
&quot;sorry bro, we got a chanter and s/he said we don't need a shaman&quot; so i couldn't join the group anymore.<br />
<br />
true story, i've since been informed that the guy was making it up (though i don't know why), but needless to say, i was pretty bummed/pissed that night.<br />
<br />
edit: more to add..<br />
<br />
i can't play that much anymore since rl has sort of taken over, so when i play, i usually only have a couple hours here and there once or twice a week.  So grouping w/ the same people frequently gets kinda tough.  And i certainly play my class well, nobody disputes that, but the fact is, a mediocre beastlord in an xp group is still usually better than a well-played shaman, especially if you throw in a chanter.  You end up with a 65% slow, the best haste in the game, a solid dps class with the beastlord, and if you have a ranger/druid, the chanter can possibly charm and you have UBER dps... not to mention the 25mana/tick the whole group will get from their mana buffs... it just kinda leaves shm's out in the cold.<br />
<br />
I still (after 5 years) don't understand why chanters get the best haste buffs... for what our class is, it seems like we should get it, or at least get some new unique buffs that people actually want/need. The 7% avoidance buff seems like a step in the right direction, but i don't think it'll make shamans a staple class for xp groups, since if 7% avoidance makes or breaks your group, it's probably not a very good xp group to begin with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>geneshami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yea, seems like the only advantage shamans (in high level OoW zones) have over enchie/BST combo is our spot heals.  But in this case, only time we should be spot healing is on emergency overpulls and such, which we're too busy trying to slow first, so the realistically the spot heals never happen.<br />
<br />
On the buff side, I think the buff stats are pretty insignificant compared to the significantly faster haste (not to mention KEI, CC and other stuff, scarecrow form thingy) the enchie can provide and the DPS from the BST (slows should be the same, since they're migitated anyways).<br />
<br />
Comparing head to head, supposedly if you have other required classes in group already (Tank, Cleric, puller...)  How would a SHM/[any other class] compare to Enchie/BST combo for the overall effectiveness of the group??  I really can't think of one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yea, i think if we had a faster casting heal that would help quite a bit.. it doesn't seem appropriate (to me, anyways) that paladins make 10x better spot healers than shm's do. They're tanks and we're a &quot;priest&quot; class.. i mean c'mon get serious!  I'm still stuck with tnargs, so maybe GoD had a fast-cast spot heal that i just don't have, but all i know is that tnarg's doesn't always cut the mustard, and i can't get the new oow heal spell unless i get xp groups, so we're catch 22'd there as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Fukkem. Go solo to 70!<br />
<br />
Sorry, that probably wasn't the answer that you wanted to hear. I feel your frustration. <br />
<br />
It amazes me that people get so anal about wanting this class and that class but not the other class. To me its about the player, not the class. In many situations any 6 classes can get the job done. In OoW if you have a tank class a heal class and a slow class, any other 3 classes will get the job done just fine. A friend of mine boxes Warrior/cleric - he always hooks me up with a group and then we get any 3 classes to make up numbers - and that works really well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well all I can say is, I have never noticed your problem.  Saying that I do have times when I have to sit hours lfg, but thats becuase im on a very small server (VS).<br />
<br />
But why do people say we are not DPS, we can lay some down if needed, and keep it constant.  An example of this is that I can always make sure a mob has 6 dots on a mob, and then start casting rains on them.  Now if I decide to make a pet aswell that also helps.<br />
<br />
Imo we can offtank better than Bsts and we can CC maybe not as good as enchanter but at least we can still do it.  The good thing about shammys is we can do a little bit of everything, when needed but it seems most people seem to forget that.<br />
<br />
If I was you I would just make groups, there not that hard really, im sure you will always find 5 people lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe if dot damage were displayed for all and sundry to see, along with Criticals in parentheses the myth about us not adding any to group dps would be dispelled.<br />
<br />
When bane, anathema, and BoS crit in one tick thats a big bunch of damage, but only we know we did it. Everyone else prob thinks what a weak mob or what a great tank we have. We are losing kudos because none is seeing the impact that we are making on the mob.<br />
<br />
I too have trouble getting a pick up group unless i make it.<br />
<br />
Luckily i have a mage friend and SK buddy and we trio all sorts of fun places. If not for them though I would struggle to actually get a group at all each time I log in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I buff, I slow, I dot, I nuke, I root, I heal ... I might not be the best at all of them, but dammit how many other classes can do all of that, still swing a weapon, tank a mob and have a pet? <br />

How the heck can you devote 6 spell gems to dots, plus have time to actually cast them all vs an average exp group mob?  Seems like I'm usually lucky to get 1-2 going, and usually anything longer than Bane goes to waste.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can always make sure a mob has 6 dots on a mob, and then start casting rains on them.<br />
<br />
Let's look more closely at what you are saying...<br />
<br />
I am assuming that you are malos'ing and slowing before you start dotting.  If you are using Malos and Turgur's that is 5 seconds for Malos + 2.25 seconds for all spells to refresh, then 3 seconds for Turgur's + 2.25 seconds for all spells to refresh.  So before you can start casting any DoT's, the mob has been in camp for 12.5 seconds at least.  Now, you also would have to already have Bane and Anathema memmed before the fight starts because of their 24 second recast time, and you would also have to have at least one more spell slot devoted to swapping the other 4 dot's in and out.  (I am hoping you are keeping Cannibalize, heal, HoT, and Root memmed as well)  This would also assume that you have 9th spell slot AA.<br />
<br />
So, we are 12.5 seconds into the fight and you start casting DoT's<br />
<br />
Anathema (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4094&amp;source=Live)<br />
5.25 second casting time, 24 second recast<br />
(20 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Bane (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live)<br />
5.5 second casting time, 24 second recast<br />
(27.75 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3396&amp;source=Live)<br />
5.7 second casting time, 2.25 second recast<br />
(35.7 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Breath of Ultor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3394&amp;source=Live)<br />
6.1 second casting time, 2.25 second recast<br />
(44.05 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulous (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1591&amp;source=Live)<br />
5 second casting time, 2.25 second recast<br />
(51.3 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Anathema is about to wear off...if the mob isn't already dead<br />
Bane of Nife (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1590&amp;source=Live)<br />
5 second casting time, 2.25 second recast<br />
(58.55 seconds into fight)<br />
<br />
Anathema has worn off, and most likely Bane will wear off in the next few seconds.  You have used 3520 mana so far, and you haven't cast a single rain spell.  Also, how many normal experience mobs live longer than 60 seconds? <br />
<br />
Can you give more detail in how you accomplish this every single pull and manage to not get aggro or go OOM?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Six dots on every single mob? I don't believe it, unless you're not nearly chain pulling. I tried like hell to get six dots cooking on the construct of nightmares, and I never could, one would wear off before the sixth started to do any damage.<br />
<br />
You can get six dots on A mob, possibly even eight, but it takes a lot of planning. If you had Epic 1.0, Bone of Bertox and Pox Pants, you could lead off with the longest duration ones and work down: <br />
<br />
Spell (clicky) - cast (secs), duration (mins/tics)<br />
Breath of Ultor -  6.1s, 2.6m<br />
Rotting Bile (Bone of Bertoxxulous - range) - 10s, 2.1m<br />
Pox of Bertoxxulous (Rosrak's Greaves - legs) - 4s, 1.8m<br />
Curse of the Spirits (Spear of Fate - primary) - 10s, 1.4m<br />
 - you're now about half a minute into the fight -<br />
Blood of Saryrn - 5.7s, 7t<br />
Bane of Nife - 5s, 7t<br />
Bane - 5.5s, 5t<br />
and maybe even Anathema - 5.25s, 5t; might get one tic in before Blood of Saryn wore off. And the long dots are just about to start fading, too. If the mob is still alive. But then, you'd have to be grouped with five Clerics on a short pause cheal chain by this point, so the mob probably is still alive. :D<br />
<br />
Easier to do with detrimental casting haste and extended affliction focii. But still, you'd be a one-trick pony with all those slots for dots (and debuffs) (and slow).<br />
<br />
I'm needed for one thing and one thing only in challenging content: slow. Add malos if it's a caster-oriented vs melee-orientee group. There's other stuff they like and want, but not need. Don't kid yourself. But I'm appreciated for my versatility when the excrement hits the ventalator; if I had nothing but malos, slow, and a bunch of dots memmed, after the first wipe I might get a rez, but not an invitation to stay. And yes, a base 1300 heal is teh sux in this day and age, but it still saves a life from time to time.<br />
<br />
But yeah. It's possible on the occasional mob, but not every 90 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, you really got me thinking on this; with a properly debuffed mob, it's just possible to do this; assumes Affliction Haste IV (33% casting time reduction) and Chronoburn (25% duration extension) and no fizzles or resists:<br />

You theoretically get NINE seconds during which, if everything went off perfectly, 14 dots are in effect at one time on one mob cast by one mighty Shaman. I guess you could get 15, maybe, if you swapped spells earlier, but I don't feel like re-calculating all that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
should be noted that i seem to have developed a personal fanclub consistent of a few SKs, so i rarely have aggro issues to deal with.</div></div><hr />

Monk etc pulls.<br />
<br />
Cast Malos<br />
Use TA<br />
Right click Ele legs.<br />
Ultor<br />
Blood of Saryn<br />
Bane<br />
and then ancient poision spell (i forgot name)<br />
Then rain spell<br />
<br />
Sorry 5 dots, nearly right.  But anyway this was in WoS, and PoF at tables, the group was not best for the DPS, and I always make sure I have bor, it helps.<br />
<br />
It generally uses about 2 bubs of mana. I have about a 7.1K mana and I use the AA canni, and ancient canni from GoD.<br />

I never said I dont get aggro, unless im generally with an SK. <br />
<br />
Anyway I was wrong on the number of dots, unless I decide to mem another one and I prob could get 6 in. But it also depends on what order you cast them in to make sure they dont ware off before all are in.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">well I can honestly say that most EXp groups I am in never have this fantasitly short kill times that every one mentions. sure my groups may suck but well no one always gets the perfict groups and I feel I am one of thouse peeps that make it in to the &quot;everone else&quot; groups and places all the time. My normal combat goes like:<br />
<br />
Slow on incoming (depending on place and relitive level have as much as a 85 percent chance of punching it through)<br />
Sini neck (again same or greater chance then slow)<br />
<br />
so normaly by the time the mob has been engaged for 6 secs its already debuffed. I have AE4, specaled in conjer, and SMC3 so mana is not a issiue with next bit.<br />
<br />
bane<br />
blood<br />
anthem<br />
bane of nife (depends on take)<br />
bone of bertoxx and spear when I think the group does not kill fast enough and just to waiste time<br />
<br />
most times yes I will miss a tick off my last posion dot cast, so it may not be as mana efficant but by the time they are ready to pull I all ready have my mana back. after most times fighting I will assuse how needed malos is and drop it if needed. have 9 gems canni, Q, and slow all have there perment spots but that is it everything else depends on what the group needs. no i dont normal have a healing spell up becouse i am not focused that way and thats how I played my self since I was started. Yeps I melee while doing this so that IF i pull aggro the mob dont move and tank can just take it back (and hay pile driver with a ruj posion aug (125) normaly will get 6 to 8 procs a fight plues a max hit of 126 I figure that I do a easy 2k in melee damage and another k in procs on top of my dot damage and dog. Nope not most eficant but its more fun then sitting on heals.<br />
<br />
Now on boss mobs I normal run a total of 8 to 9 mobs (debuff slots not used a lot by guild) with it consisting of breath, Pox, spear and bone (just for time spacers), blood, bane, BoN, athem, and one other depending on mob but normal its the 3rd highest curse or disease so I life a little longer (if I had ASoN that would go here and swap for BoN).<br />
