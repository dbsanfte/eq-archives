<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya, <br />
<br />
Couple questions about Vindi ... perhaps ya'll could help me out, particularly some of you loggers and parsers (Wildaar!).<br />
<br />
1. Damage Taken: What is his max hit vs. a tank with defensive activated? What sort of DPS does he put out based on your parsed logs?<br />
<br />
2. He's got about 130k HP right? I've read in some places that he's got 100k. In other places that he's got 130k.<br />
<br />
3. Damage Output: If you've got a 60 monk who averages about 65dps with tstaff / epic vs. a soulbinder... what does he average vs. Vindi? Or another way to look at it is, what should we multiply tank DPS by for Vindi? .9? .8? .7?<br />
<br />
<br />
Anybody got any logs (from the MT tank perspective) they could attach for parsing?<br />
<br />
Thanks ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Max hit is 700. He quad hits and rampages fairly often. You can cripple him, but not slow. Max hit on a defensive tank is like 390 or so.<br />
<br />
I don't parse stuff, so I can't help you on the silly dps questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Jing, <br />
<br />
Thanks for the info. I'm not sure why the DPS question is silly, however. If we want to take him down with the smallest possible force (there's no feeling of satisfaction in zerging something) then that DPS number is critical to coming up with a strategy that will work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gosh, all rather scientific.<br />
<br />
Practice on Velketor a bit, he's more forgiving when refining tactics, tho I dont know if he's casting nastier spells since the last patch.<br />
<br />
Edit: cos I hit enter too soon, wally</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I didn't mean to be insulting, so I apologize. I just don't play the game all that scientifically. I slow things, I buff people, I heal. I don't care too much about numbers :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wasn't insulted, just curious why you chose to call the question silly. ;) I realize that most guilds that have massive zerg forces don't give a hoot for numbers when they have overwhelming odds... But most competitions are boring if one side is so strong that it shouldn't lose. In Starcraft terms, that's a comp stomp, and I always found it incredibly boring.<br />
<br />
If I did know Vindi's DPS (from parsed logs), I could figure out an optimal timing between CH. If I have the timing between CH, I know the amount of time that we can run the fight before clerics are OOM. Given a set amount of time before OOM, I can now add DPS (via melee) until we get to the point where clerics run OOM just after melee damage = vindi health.<br />
<br />
In other words... I'm trying to understand where the red line should cross the yellow line in the graph below... the end goal being defeat of vindi with the smallest possible numbef of people.<br />
<br />
If you don't like to think about these things, fine. I'm not forcing you to. But calling them &quot;silly&quot; is a value judgement on your part. Just because someone doesn't play the game the way you do doesn't make it silly.<br />
<br />
At any rate... the graph below assumes average melee DPS of 35 and 12 cheals per cleric before oom. It's conservative because it doesn't take into account KEI, bard mana song or twitching. It also doesn't take into account spell-based damage.<br />
<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.scienceofwar.net/images/vindi_fight2.gif&quot;&gt;<br />
<br />
scenario 1: 10 melee, 3 clerics = wipe<br />
<br />
scenario 2: 12 melee, 4 clerics = wipe<br />
<br />
scenario 3: 14 melee, 5 clerics = technical wipe, but probable win if caster damage can make up the small difference<br />
<br />
scenario 4: 16 melee, 6 clerics = overkill<br />
<br />
All assuming average melee dps of 35 per melee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This really does not make any sense at all b/c the fight cannot be parsed/based just on pure DPS. DPS can give you an idea about what you need to put out to take him down in a given amt of time or a goal to aim for etc. DPS does not show battle conditions like Stuns, to far away people getting killed etc etc.<br />
<br />
It is like any new encounter. You start with 50 people and get wiped 5 times till you learn it. Pretty soon you are doing it with 25 people with 0 wipe outs.<br />
<br />
I think currently it only takes us about 3 groups to take out vindi and is quite boring actually.  The hardest part about vindi is pulling him and positioning... we don't even position him anymore we just fight em out in the open like any other giant.<br />
<br />
Another thing you mention is about clerics running OOM... You have heard of Mod Rods haven't you? The only time I a cleric should run OOM is if they get hit with a mana drain spell like Aaryonar and Cevalak have in NToV etc. Even then though you can recover from those with practice.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your fight, not trying to be to harsh :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
DPS doesn't mean much for a CH chain. <br />
You have to base your calculation on the max damage he can dish out per round, not the average DPS you get via a parsed set of a data. Only thing you should want to know, which you probably have to test yourself, is the delay between his attacks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know about mod rods, haha. Thanks. =) I don't want to cloud the model with mod rod, twitching, KEI assumptions. I'd tweak that later. All that that would really do is up the number of cheals per cleric which is set at 12 right now (very conservative).<br />
<br />
Also, I did take into account stuns and people too far away. 35 dps per melee average is *conservative* based on my knowledge of the melee available to me. Got a few in the 60s, got a few in the 50s, and the bulk are in the 40s in terms of DPS (average level is about 55-56). However, I don't know what sort of AC vindi has... maybe 65dps on normal mobs is 50 on Vindi? Which really just gets back to question #3 in my first post.<br />
<br />
It's a thought exercise people, have some fun with it. ;)<br />

<br />
<br />
Giac, either one would do fine. If I knew his average DPS (let's just say it's 900), then a CH every 4 seconds on a main tank with 5200 HP may be too fast, especially if there's a celestial elixer on the tank at all times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Your chart fails to take into account his rampage.  5 people taking a siwng or 2 for up to 700 points each every few seconds (10?)  Clerics or back up healers need to cover that.  Also any nukers you have add a ton of damage.<br />
<br />
That being said...<br />
<br />
My guild has done him with about 20 strong people a couple times.  Give us 24 and we will drop him easy.  But, we have our tanks well equiped and our clerics have been a part of so many vindi kills that they know what to expect and when to heal.<br />
<br />
I gather from your orignal post that you have never done him since you don't know what he hits for or how many people you need there to kill him.  If you and your guild are going to try him for the first time I would not try him with any less than 35 or 40.  It is way easier to find what classes you need less than others for certain kills after you have done it a few times.<br />
<br />
If this game has taught us nothing else, it has taught us that you cannot rely on sustained dps, healing ratios, aggro on MTs...or anything else.  If you try to kill with the minimun it is sort of a game of luck.  A few bad rolls on your MT and you are screwed.  Clerics on the rampage list getting low health aggro, and you are screwed.<br />
<br />
just my opinion from my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chtiz, <br />
<br />
I've been on two successful vindi kills myself. Unfortunately, they were both zerg kills (50 level 60s) and you don't learn a lot in that sort of environment.<br />
<br />
My guild *has* attempted him, but the pullers never got him single, so obviously none of the attempts were successful. His guards aren't that strong, but combined with Vindi, they suck. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are already dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Chtiz, <br />
<br />
When ya'll take him with 20 people, what is your average melee DPS? I assume you've got 3 clerics in cheal rotation? How many seconds between each cheal?<br />
<br />
PS, Chtiz, we're not &quot;already dead&quot; as you put it if we add more melee. It's simply a longer fight requiring both more clerics and more melee. That is the point of the chart. <br />
<br />
If he's got 130k hp, then 16 melee at 560 combined DPS will take 3.9 minutes to drop him. That's a long time and risky considering all that can (and according to Murphy) will go wrong. With 16 melee and 6 clerics (4.8 minutes of complete heal rotation, conservatively) it should be do-able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have never parsed the fight to be honest.  Our MT is full ToV/NToV.  Melee have primal and assorted NToV/Luclin weapons.  Sometimes we DC a giant.  Honestly couldnt tell ya.<br />
<br />
I have always looked at Vindi as the perfect training mob.  Learn your MT system on him and you can move on to harder mobs.  Him being unslowable helps the training.  Aggro management, CH rotations, MT ability....none better to learn on than Vindi simply because it is an easy mob with a fast respawn in an easy CR location.<br />
<br />
<br />
oh ya CH rotation...umm.  I think it is 5 or 6 seconds?  I dunno.  I pull him then hit him a lot, thats my job :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Follow-up for Chtiz -- <br />
<br />
Where do you typically pull him to and fight him? On two attempts, the monk / sk pull team thought they had him solo, then as soon as the fight began his guards warped right on top of us. I'm thinking that you MUST pull and kill his guards first...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am not trying to sound like a dick, you asked for info so I am trying to give it.  I dont think that sup 50 melee are anything but lag against vindi.  They cant take the hits if they get on the rampage list, it will scatter your aggro if they lose to much health.  You are better off with 5 level 60 melee of any class than you are with 20 level 45 melee...that is why I say you are already dead.<br />
<br />
Maybe I misunderstood?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah, you did misunderstand. I was talking about DPS, not level. No biggie. =)<br />
<br />
Got a few in the 60s, got a few in the 50s, and the bulk are in the 40s<br />
<br />
Those numbers are DPS, not levels. =) The average level in question here is approximately 55. MT is level 60 with about 5200 HP raid-buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's an interesting exercise but in reality I don't think it's so easy to quantify. I guess the only thing I could add from practical experience is that if your MT dies early, you are all dead. The most successful takedown we had was when we killed him before defensive wore off. It can get messy switching tanks if you are not practiced at it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Down the arena ramp on the right side.  Left side works just as well and I have seen people fight him in the middle of the arena.  Doesnt really matter where you fight him.  We usually push him into a corner cause we are too lazy to try to control push. :p<br />
<br />
<br />
As for pulling.  We pull whatever we get first whether it be Vindi or his guards.  If you get Vindi before the guards then when the tagger gets Vindi to the raid they need to FD and stay down till the original tagger can verify that aggro is off pets when tagger stands.<br />
<br />
They are his pets and will stay aggroed on you till they reset at spawn point, but for some reason do not aggro the raid force....prolly just too far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ahh -- I think that may have been it. The tagger was DEFINITELY standing up before the pets were reset.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">His guards are very easy to kill actually. Just have 2 groups for both of them, once slowed they are easy for a pallie/sk to tank and a shaman to heal. Vindi's dead well before the guards, then it's just mop up time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Bring a happy druid along with your raid and you can give them something to do that they should have lots of practice at while also making it so that you dont even have to think about pulling vindi solo. Pull him and his guards, have a druid kite them around and snare the two guards, tag vindi, kill vindi, then kill guards. Pretty simple if you are wanting to do it with as small of a force as possible and you might not have the extra people available to tank mez stuff. The one bad thing about fighting Vindi and his guards at the same time is that if someone lags and the MT gets down into that low hp frenzy range, he could wind up getting summoned around between the three mobs and killed. Depending on if you there with bare bones crew or whatnot, that could be the beginning of a wipeout for ya.</div></div><hr />

Why do you have to camp out after the guards are dead?  Does killing the guards somehow create aggro with Vindi and make it hard for MT to get aggro?

I dont know where people get the idea that Vindi's guards MUST be dead or tanked to pull vindi...it simply is not true.<br />
<br />
I couldnt tell you how many times we have killed vindi without ever pulling his guards...it is all luck of the draw, whatever comes first solo is the one that dies.  If that is vindi, grats us, we dont bother witht he guards.</div></div><hr />

Try taking the whole context of what I was replying to not just what was written dork.<br />
<br />
He said he was having problems with the guards warping on to them.. thus the obvious conclusion would be to kill them BEFORE vendi. <br />
<br />
No one ever said they MUST be killed (besides him).<br />
<br />
Isn't it also annoying to quote someone whos thread is just right above the one being quoted? Learn some board prose.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He very definetely does rampage.<br />
<br />
Soupy, I don't know if you know it, but Vind's gaurds are actually pets. If you attack them, it aggros the master (Vindicator), and if you attack Vind, it aggros his pets. You can't split them with FD or atone or anything like that.<br />
<br />
The way we get Vind solo is this. Clear arena as fast as possible start to finish. We sometimes do it twice if Kallis and the 2 prots are up, as they slow us down a bit too much. After arena is clear, a monk with sow or run 3 pulls Derakor and kites him around the arena (use the snare item from FG for added aggro). The raid at this point is all hiding on a side wall so Vind doesn't aggro while being kited. The monk runs him around and a shaman casts slow on a guard as it runs by. This usually gets the guard away from Vindicator. Do that to both guards and kill, then bring Vind. However, this usually results in the shaman being on rampage list. So I recommend camping out real fast after you pull the second guard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Chtiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Did you read the whole thread?  The issue of the guards warping was resolved before your 'Ding Ding...' comment was made by you.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hey its interesting to see how people go about this, tactics are a little different from everyone. We have a monk tag team pull pets down to the arena ramp, kill, camp out (we've had Vindi arrive unannounced before), move up ramp and fight Vindi in arena.<br />
<br />
Be a bit boring if everyone did things exactly the same way, wouldnt it? <br />
<br />
I would still strongly reccommend a few successful kills of Velketor if you havent already before Vindi, Soupy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've pulled him a few times, and beat him a few times, and wiped to him a few times, so I'll stick my head in and share a few thoughts....<br />
<br />
1) he does definitely rampage, max hit is 700 non-defensive<br />
2) he can be single pulled by a single skilled FD puller<br />
3) it's easier to warp-pull through the ice wall with 2 or more pullers<br />
4) don't set up camp too close to the vindi spot or you'll be warped upon. his aggro range is rather large.<br />
5) we usually fight him in the corner/hallway to the right just after you go through the first 4 see-invis giants. that's far away from his pets and spawn-spot, so no warping hopefully<br />
6) i'll look at logs later when i get home to give you the DPS my monk does on him if you still want to calculate the number of melees needed<br />
7) for CH rotation, you must use worst case scenario. you also want some safety there, for example to catch a fizzled CH. that would be 4x700 per round non-defensive (does the MT get rampaged as well, or only the 4 below him on the hate list? I'll have to ask). so you're looking at 2800 dmg per round (I don't think i have parses with his hits on others on, so can't check his delay, sorry) or 4x390 per round defensive = 1560 per round. tank should have about 6k hp? i'm not familiar with warrior HP sorry... so he'll stand 4 rounds in defensive.<br />
8) if you can, use aggro enhancers on your MT. we found imp form to be very beneficial (non-ogre warlords reporting they were not able to be stunned, not sure how much truth or myth this is). warrior epic seens to taunt really well btw.<br />
9) he can be pulled to WL zone as well, but you need a larger force for that, and it's not really worth the effort.<br />
10) i think that's all for now, if you have any more questions that I didn't cover, feel free to ask ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Jendain, <br />
<br />
Just a couple follow-up questions for ya...<br />
<br />
<br />
 i'll look at logs later when i get home to give you the DPS my monk does on him if you still want to calculate the number of melees needed <br />
<br />
<br />
If you can tell me your DPS vs. Vindi and your DPS vs. a soulbinder when you're equipped with about the same gear, that will give me some idea of his AC. That's what I'm kinda asking about. <br />
<br />
<br />
7) for CH rotation, you must use worst case scenario. you also want some safety there, for example to catch a fizzled CH. that would be 4x700 per round non-defensive (does the MT get rampaged as well, or only the 4 below him on the hate list? I'll have to ask). so you're looking at 2800 dmg per round (I don't think i have parses with his hits on others on, so can't check his delay, sorry) or 4x390 per round defensive = 1560 per round. tank should have about 6k hp? i'm not familiar with warrior HP sorry... so he'll stand 4 rounds in defensive. <br />
<br />

But, how fast is a Vindi round? &quot;Real fast&quot; is all that people are saying... I think that it would be more accurate to simply get his average DPS on a disc defensive tank, nudge that up for safety's sake, and calculate a CH rotation from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I don't have any soulbinder logs unfortunately, but guess i could go find one in an unused place to parse for an hour or so ...<br />
on shrooms in fungus i do 60 to 80 dps depending on luck / slows<br />
on derakor the vindicator i did 60 dps, in 3 seperate logs each.<br />
for comparison, on cazic thule in pof i did about 45 dps (hi knockback ...)<br />
doomshade about 60 dps<br />
rumblecrush about 40 dps (***??)<br />
<br />
so derakor AC is about &quot;normal&quot; i'd say.<br />
<br />
can't give you numbers on his delay unfortunately, i don't have others hits running in those logs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">ergh, so much spoiler info makes the raid a bit too scientific and well bland for my liking.<br />
<br />
Try it <br />
Die/ Win<br />
Use more/ less people</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not trying to come up with a sure victory -- I'm trying to figure out if a small but growing guild can do mobs that are way harder than guilds of this size and maturity typically do. I'm trying to move us up the learning curve faster. The idea is to pack *more* challenge into our play hours, not less. If you find challenge bland, well... that's your prerogative, I reckon.<br />
 <br />
<br />
And don't assume we haven't tried. You also seem to assume that the key variable is the number of people when you say &quot;try more/less people.&quot; I've seen 50-person Vindi raids fail, and we've learned that some people on this thread have done him with 18. Obviously number of participants is not at all what it's about after a certain point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Just a tad but of info on topic.  My guild generally kills him with between 24-28 people.  our MT is around 6300hp i think,  our clerics are on a 4 second CH rotation, 4 clerics i think.  One of the things that we do that i like is have a 5th cleric if avaible, and the druids, heal people who are getting rampaged, melee shout if getting rampaged and they get healed, very effective.  and our dps varries, we never seem to have any rogues on. fastes we have killed was before defensive ran out, but we had a lot of people on that time, last time i think took about 5 min maybe =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Soupy, I don't think that's at all what Spiritbinder was saying. Challenge is one thing, calculating dmg per second, mob  AC, mob HP and other stats is completely different. That's the part Spiritbinder finds boring. Frankly, so do I. It has nothing to do with challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Agreed on the more people thing<br />
<br />
For example, Cazic Thule. We started off wiv 65 peeps. As the 1st and 2nd attempt failed, people had to leave beacuse of the time it was (1am i think) for work. With less people, the lag settled a little and suddenly everything was working and we nailed him.<br />
<br />
More people doesnt necessarily increase chance of winning, refined tactics however do. This does NOT include using parses and logs, it can be made my human judgement. However parses and logs make it very accurate and are good for SOME people to do. <br />
<br />
Its like ice cream. Some people like choclate, some like strawberry. In the end it all ends up in the same place :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Youre gonna lose the 1st few times you try him - thats all there is too it.  Use those practice runs to figure all this stuff out.  Your priorities should be:<br />
1) figure out a spot to fight (preferably 1 that has easy cr)<br />
2) pulling solo (theres multiple tactics for this, kiting, fd pulling, off tank the guards, etc) <br />
3) keep the main tank alive longer than 4 seconds :D (this varies based on tank hps, cleric connections, level, skill of player, etc, so there is no &quot;magic&quot; number that someone can tell you - start the ch chain fast &amp; slow it down is the best advice I can give you.  We use 4 seconds for vindi - I think thats pretty standard on vindi btw)<br />
4) mob positioning - we use an awesome spot where vindi gets his side wedged up against a wall &amp; &amp; everyone can hit him from behind np &amp; mt never has to move.  I've seen other people put the mt in a corner, seen other people just move him around in a circle the whole time - find what works for you.<br />
<br />
Before you can worry about actually killing him, you gotta figure out the other 4 things &amp; a spreadsheet aint gonna help you answer every question up there - you gotta go up &amp; take your lumps like everyone else before you did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Your model is incredibly inadequate.  Rampage healing is incredibly important vs Vindicator if you want to kill him &quot;without zerging.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shamans and druids cannot keep up with vindi's rampage damage unless you have massive amounts of them.  You'll need a cleric to help heal the rampage tank.<br />
<br />
Also, lvl 55s are fairly worthless vs vindicator.  The clerics don't have enough mana.  The melees don't hit hard enough.  The casters can't land their spells as well and don't have the mana pools.<br />
<br />
When we kill Vindi we usually have ~30 people, not because we need 30 but because it's a fun fight so atleast that many will show up.  We do a 4 second cheal cycle.  Our 2 maintanks are ~7k hp.  We could porbably get away with 5 second cycle.. but why?  With mod2 your clerics are never going to go OOM before vindicator is dead even if you have crappy DPS and if your cheal cycle is faster then if someone hits a lag spike and is late on a cheal, your tank won't be as likely to die.<br />
<br />
Just keep trying vindi.  It'll take a while, but learning is part of the fun. <br />
<br />
The rampage is a BIG part of the fight.  Dont underestimate it.</div></div><hr />
