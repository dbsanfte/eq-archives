<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems as if there is some dispute as to Shaman and how much DPS we actually put out in GoD.  And how much of an inbalance there would be if our dps was to be raised in one way or another. <br />
 What it really comes down to is,  How much DPS should a shaman be putting out compaired to the rest of their utilites. <br />
<br />
Well, if you figure in our utilities (Smaller spot heals, mitigated slow, other misc. debuffs), in comparison to other slowing classes with there utilities and dps .........(PoTime equiped of course)<br />
<br />
Lets just say mob lives for 36 seconds (average life of a GoD mob)<br />
<br />
{BL = mitigated slow, mana buffs} = around 180 dps (with pet) <br />
<br />
{Chanter = mana buff, mitigated slow, Mez (best crowd control)} = around 85dps(1550x2)<br />
<br />
{dru = Great spot heals, buff/mana(PoTN), Misc utilities(snare, etc)} = about 125 dps(2232x2)<br />
<br />
{Bard = Songs that are about 80% effective to most of the above} = 140 dps ?<br />
<br />
I figured PoTime equip. with a good amount of AAs = 20% increase in overall effectiveness<br />
<br />
By the look of things, I say we should be some where around 100 dps, seeing the way other classes compair to us. <br />
Lets see.....<br />
<br />
Pet = 30-35 dps (assuming you give your pet 2 weapons with all the buffs)<br />
Dots = 55 dps (bane &gt;our fastest dot - average time after debuffs = 4 ticks, with 20% increase in power, 504 a tick)<br />
<br />
That would make shaman put out an average of 85-90 dps.  It is a little dissapointing.   Perhaps if, somehow there was time for 1 extra tick on our dot.  That would then bring us to 100-105 dps.  But that would mean the npc would have to live for about 50 seconds. (malos 5 seconds - shaman stick 3 seconds - bane 5.5 seconds - 5 ticks 36 seconds)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. my #s might not be 100% accurate, but it does give a good idea of how things are looking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry, the enchanter figure is way off.  Group with one that charms a Pooka(Imp looking mob) in Tipt.  If you malos+slow, the mob you are fighting will be at 50% or less before slow hits.  See if you can get a VS off before 5%.  Almost not even worth slowing...not even worth doing much of anything but being an FA bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sorry, the enchanter charm is limited to few mobs now (at least in KoD).  And I do not consider Charming as an Enchanter dps, It is more of a group tactic, due to the fact that EVERYONE else in group must sacrafice dps and other contributions to make the Charm work without wipeing from that tactic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You aren't &quot;sacrificing&quot; anything when you get a boost in dps that is greater than your entire party combined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Look,  the backup healer (dru/shaman) Must keep an eye on the chanter and pet the entire time, or the chanter will almost instantly splat.  dru = spot heals the chanter and usually snares the pet.  Shaman = malos the pet (almost a must for charm stability), spot heals chanter,  buffs pet.  Cleric = spot heals mt and chanter, stuns pet when breaks.  Other melee classed in group =  tanks until recharmed.  <br />
The rest of the time, other classes in group helps out with crowd control since chanter already has his/her hands full.  Not to mention the added risk.<br />
<br />
It is a team effort, hence &quot;group tactic&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Or, you can simply have a paladin baby sit and stun when charm breaks. Which is what we did, while we had a warrior on tanking duty.  Without the pet we had to do more healing and the mobs took quite a bit longer to die than with.  A team that revolves around pet charming is not hard to put together and you don't have to have a snarer and you only need a spot healer for when charm breaks, or if you have someone tanking using two 1h weapons.<br />
<br />
And as far as &quot;group tactics&quot; is concerened: what's your point?  You aren't going to solo/duo/trio in GoD trials.  I'm not concerned with my dps right now as much as my healing, which seems to be in the process of adjustment.  Am I complacent? No, but I don't expect the world handed to me either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">According to you all you need is a trio.<br />
you said cleric, pally, enchanter.  Right ?<br />
<br />
In all fairness though, my point is charm will not work all that well unless the whole group works together, which DOES mean the loss of dps from people in the group, and the awareness that things can get ugly very fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then whats the point of making this a group encounter ?<br />
i see what used is saying, but from you i just see &quot;blah blah blah enchanters do nothing blah blah blah&quot;<br />
i've seen enchanters solo BoT mini's, you try and do that. then when you can, quit, because you just made an enchanter.<br />
<br />
you don't lose that much dps for what you get to charm ... its insane, have you ever played Arcanum or Fallout ? pooka = dog, end of storie, hes so good in damage and melee, he makes encounters boring and onesided.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">personally i always saw a shaman as a reasonable dps class, not monk, ranger, beast, wiz,mage etc , but more than a warrior,pal,sk,enc without pet and cleric. so basically around the middle. at the moment in a group and raid (except the slightly longer fights) we are last.<br />
<br />
what i would like is 2 fold, 1 is our pet dps to be u/g to about 80 dps on the all mobs (we have a pet lets make it useable), but not be much tougher hp,ac wise ie not  help much with solo, it wont tank.<br />
and learn from beast dd, 1400 ish dd with 30 sec recast. works out about 46 dps, total 126 dps.(which is about druid without dc and doesnt take into account crits which will make druids higher) now on longer fights we will do alot more, but their isn`t that many of those now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly i have thought about this alot and have narrowed it down to 2 things i want, but dont think ill get.<br />
<br />
Increase slightly in power to our top nukes or a new set of them. And give us either a pet proc spell or probably more appropriate a item/items or AA in the game that will let me summon weapons for puppy that have effects on them like a 150ish nuke on it or even utility procs like snare. I only see 1 opposition to this and that is the BST's, but consideringt hey are our hybrid and already have everyting we have in some form or another and more, i cant really see any ground for them on it. I mean their buffs for pets would blow us away still.<br />
<br />
This will make puppy useful a a viable source of DPS and will release us from our dependancy on mages for pet weapons. I mean whats the first thing you do when you know your going for somethign that puppy will be around for ? You find a mage and hound them for weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
So summonable weapons comparable to mage weapons for shaman only from either a AA/item click or spell.<br />
<br />
Slight upgrade on nukes.<br />
<br />
<br />
That will bring our DPS into a range where it should be in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">why make it a summonable weapon? why not a spell that makes our pets duel wield and proc a dd? (maybe a spell that cast on our pets and gives them 2 weapons and haste)  to be honest i cant see them given us a spell to summon weapons, possibly a item, that vemom claw proc for our pets might be good? course all balance to give about 80 dps, unless it the only u/g then 120 ish<br />
<br />
And i would like a focus effect that affect our pets:) these all ways our pet can be improved but needing the higher end game to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yea, but honestly i think i like my idea about weapons better. This wya the draw back is its still a pain compare dto BST and mages, but you can give us different weapons.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine stun weapons and DD weapons and Snare weapons ?  All of these we can already get and give to puppy very easily. It just smooths out life for us and helps us add utility ( stun and snare pet ) and DPS ( nuke proc ) to the game. I dont know if its very shaman like though, need to mill it over a lil.<br />
<br />
Maybe there is a way to incorperate some sorta spirutal proc...  I dunno, need to think about it some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wonder if I could convince all of you who want to lobby for a dps increase to bear in mind the plight of your shaman brothers and sisters on the pvp servers. Make such a dps increase useful in a high resist environment as well as the pve department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Giving us more ways to have our oh-a-riposte-i'm-dead-pets do a little more damage is not the way to go in my opinion.<br />
<br />
A slight upgrade on our nukes and a -100 resist adjustment on bane so I will not have to worry about the recast time as much will both put us about where we should be in groups and help our raid stackability somewhat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, selective reading would not be the best way to understand what someone is saying.   I said in GoD,  not in BoT.  I also said nothing about &quot;Enchanters doing nothing&quot;.  If you read what I was saying, I had explained that Enchanter charming in GoD requires different tactics, to where the whole group needs to work around the pet, so the enchanter and the whole group for that matter doesnt die right when charm breaks.<br />
<br />
You loose dps from other group members to gain alot more from charm, at the expense of increased risk.<br />
<br />
That is really what it comes down to.   Some groups dont prefer the added risk, some do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DoTs are not going to cut it in GoD imho.  In many PoP and LDoN encounters, even Bane never finishes.  If we got a fast DoT that did all its damange in two or at most three ticks it might be worth looking at, otherwise, we should be looking at a DD type spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">LoL, That is exactly why I sugested our DoTs get looked at, for that exact reason.<br />
With AA and PoTime gear we get;<br />
<br />
Bane = total of 7 ticks<br />
Blood = a total of 9 ticks <br />
<br />
Generally all that our dots can do is 3 - 4 ticks, after debuffing the mob</div></div><hr />

Druids out-DoT us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If shaman dps is increased, however, it should be done passively, through our pets (ya ya, turning us into beastlords, but it's the most logical way  ;P ).  The reason for this is it will not unbalance shamans in old world content compared to new world content.<br />
<br />
Introduce a new 65 pet spell which is significantly better than the 61 pet, a pet that innately dual wields, hits for a max of 70 instead of 60, but has substantially more hp and has an innate 50DD proc.  Given we can dex buff pets to the moon, we can make dogdog II proc like wild.  That introduces the potential for an increase in dps without making it guaranteed, and does not unbalance the class in relation to other pet classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Druids out-DoT us.<br />
<br />
<br />
No one out-DoTs us over an extended period of time, not even necros.  (They may be able to stack more in short periods, but they'll lose mana).  <br />
<br />
On a fast-dying mob, then, sure, whatever.. but dots aren't good there anyway.<br />
<br />
A necro can't sustain 175dps worth of DoTs with 0 mana loss... a Time-geared shaman can.  And a druid, even with orb, is well behind.<br />
<br />
Shaman is still the absolute master of sustainable DoT damage.  All it would take for us to rock is to find mobs with lots of hps.  (Still don't understand why GoD wasn't designed with more red cons with 2x the hps... xp would be similar since they're red, but DoTs would work better).<br />
<br />
chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">In all honesty, I seriously doubt the devs would give us a better pet.   According to every other class, and the way the devs did not put shaman on ANY of the pet enhancing focus effects, Shaman are not considered a &quot;true&quot; pet class (even though we seem to fit almost every discription of one).   So the 35 dps that our pet puts out now should just be considered a pluse.</div></div><hr />

That sucker parses 20 dps with everything(including 2 weapons and FA) during a complete LDoN adventure. If you don't believe it, parse it yourself.</div></div><hr />

Not in GoD, you won't.<br />
Druids do not have to debuff MOBs to land their DoTs.<br />
Druid DoTs only have a fraction of the sggro our DoTs have.<br />
You have, at the very most, time to cast one DoT that runs fully. Your second spell might still be worth casting but will not run for full duration.<br />
<br />
So druids can often just cast one DoT, have it land without debuffs and have it run full duration because they cast it early.<br />
<br />
A shaman will have to cast malos first, essentially doubling his mana cost and taking away at least one tick of DoT damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
No one out-DoTs us over an extended period of time, not even necros.  (They may be able to stack more in short periods, but they'll lose mana).  <br />
How many &quot;extended periods of time&quot; have oyu seen in GOD so far?<br />
<br />
On a fast-dying mob, then, sure, whatever.. but dots aren't good there anyway.<br />
DoTs are worth it when they run full duration or close. Druids can cast their DoTs a lot earlier due to superior resist modifiers and less aggro. Druids can pretty much DoT once per MOB unless you have a charm pet.<br />
<br />
A necro can't sustain 175dps worth of DoTs with 0 mana loss... a Time-geared shaman can.  And a druid, even with orb, is well behind.<br />
A group buffed necromancer regains about 130ish mana per tick. He needs to do about 850 damage per tick before focuses to reach 175 DPS.<br />
Blood of Thule + Night Fire + Night's Beckon takes about 51 + 38 + 35 = 124 mana per tick and does an unfocused 890 damage. Night's Beckon will also more then offset Liching damage.<br />
These spells have resist modifiers between -50 and -200 and only one of them has counters of any kind (Blood of Thule = 9 poison counters). Aggro is going to be minimal and resists few. The necromancer also has mana left over to FD every now and then.<br />
<br />
Shaman is still the absolute master of sustainable DoT damage.  All it would take for us to rock is to find mobs with lots of hps.  (Still don't understand why GoD wasn't designed with more red cons with 2x the hps... xp would be similar since they're red, but DoTs would work better).<br />
Exactly - these fights do not exist. Not that two times the HPs would do it. Ten times would be a lot better for us. And even then we draw a ton of aggro and barely outdamage necromancers (if we outdamage them at all).<br />
That hardly makes us the &quot;absolute masters of sustainable DoT damage&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Are you kidding, Chifari? Are you honestly saying a Shaman stacking DoTs will not run out of mana while a Necro will? Should've saved that one for the 1st april.<br />
<br />
That's not even factoring in the outrageous resist rate of Shaman DoTs.</div></div><hr />

13 dps with fos only in pov =( pet = ass.. <br />
<br />
and if a druid casts his nuke every 10 seconds thats 150 dps alone and they do it much more than that.. dunno how you came up with your numbers..<br />
<br />
I sometimes wish that they would nerf our dots so some of the soloers could do a decent job (or just stop giving us new dots) so that lame excuse of our all powerful super mana efficient dot that does 10k daman for only 200 mana and takes 30 minutes to run it's course would be taken out of the picture. <br />
<br />
resist rates on dots are retarded to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids regularly cast 2 nukes per mob, at least that is what i have seen in the KoD trials. That is how i came up with those numbers. you also have to consider the mana a druid uses.  You figure an average of 2 nukes and 1 spot heal which = 1410 mana per mob.  I seriously doubt they would want to waist all of their mana in 5 min by spam casting their DD.<br />
<br />
And as far as your 13 dps pet, I have never personally seen my pet as low as that, at least not with 2 weapons, SLtW, and FoS.  For me it has always been in between 30-35 dps.<br />
Well considering you still go to PoV, you probably have no clue about GoD, which this whole thread is about</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">AA's is the craziest people!<br />
<br />
Let's see, we have a ton of AA that are alchemy, rabid-bear, and pet-related.  Wow, talk about useful AA. <br />
<br />
Although pet use is situational and they die so easy even when it's appropriate to use them, I do have to reluctantly say that there is a certain sense to them making our pets better, if only to bring them in line with what seems to be &quot;the vision&quot; for shamans these days.  All those pet AA's for our junky pets?  Seems pointless.<br />
<br />
Maybe if they made our pets worth having, then that too-large number of pet-related AA would mean something.  How many are there?  (shudder)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying I want them to try to balance us by giving us some crummy upgrade to a really crummy pet, who is only situationally used anyway and dies real quickly, real easily, when he IS used.<br />
<br />
But I guess it at least makes their &quot;vision&quot; on what pets are supposed to mean a little more coherent than it seems now.  Now, it frankly seems like they just couldn't or wouldn't come up with enough AA that anyone would actually want to bother getting -- like they REALLY didn't think at all about our AA in GoD(and much of it before GoD) and REALLY couldn't care less.  It's baffling how crummy a big chunk of our AA are -- about as close to worthless as they can be, really.<br />
<br />
Frankly, in today's fast-paced game, DD's seem to be the way to go, especially since we have to slow and/or malos and/or malosinia and/or face a resist or two on debuffs(and then maybe pop some heals around) before we can even THINK about doing DPS.   All on mobs that don't last a minute, but have a pretty good chance of killing people before they go.<br />
<br />
I've always defined shaman DPS in terms of DOTs in my mind, but it looks like the game has been radically steered away from that model, so unless they give us DOTs that function about as fast as DD's -- someone mentioned DOTs that take 3 ticks -- then giving us more slow DOTs or making us have slightly higher damage on DOTs that don't last for more than a couple/few ticks isn't going to help.<br />
<br />
Basically, considering our time problems before doing DPS, we need something fast -- better DD's.  As it is, our DD's are such garbage that I often find my group better served if I just spend my time canni'ing and topping everyone off with a HOT.  My DPS with DD's (and I have the first three DD AA's) is just pretty crummy at this point.<br />
<br />
Perhaps our rains, though they take a while to land, could be a sort of substitute for better DOTs, but they'd have to lower the resists a LOT.  In tough times, I'm hard pressed to cast spells that take a while to do their damage, and spend a fair percentage of time bouncing off instead of landing in the first place.</div></div><hr />

no.  just have the bard put the pet on a tab buffer.  he can hit the hotkey and have the pet mezzed for recharming inside 3 seconds.  no danger whatsoever</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everyone always seems to have an easy explanation as to how to take control of the situation when pet breaks.  But the truth of the matter is, most wipes occur with a charmed pet, when the pet breaks as add mobs come into camp.  So then you have 3+ hard hitting mobs in camp, and no type of mob control, since the chanter is occupied with remakeing the pet.  Yes, charm is nice, and if things go perfect you can finish the trial in about half the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Dots are reporting per tick now correct?<br />
<br />
What about changing mana cost to only spend the mana on each tick.?<br />
<br />
So instead of Bane getting full mana for 2/3rds duration we only pay for how many ticks run?<br />
<br />
Then we could Bane again for the last two ticks. And not worry about wasting the mana?<br />
<br />
You could even take away the duration aspect of it and allow us to keep the dot on for however long we wish to pay the mana cost. Taking away the tediousness of the casting time and missed ticks of damage on longer fights. And stacking a couple disease dots then a bane would be viable. On boss mobs. Allowing us to do what we are good at long term damage.<br />
<br />
What do folks think? Of an idea like that to allow the flavor of our class as rotters to coincide with the direction of the game into twitchdom?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">That's a very interesting idea...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I think that would be very cool, althought it wouldn't directly address any problem with low DPS.  It would be more about mana management.  With how crappy canni 4 is for today's fast-paced game, I think our mana management is VERY overrated as it is, so we could use some help.  Spending hours in a frenzy of cannibalizing is not exactly fun or challenging, just very aggravating.<br />
<br />
Your idea sounds cool, and would be at least some moderate way to help mana management, but I don't think it would do much on the DPS front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I am in agreement.  I could care less how much mana I waist from my dot, as long as the dps is there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">No Silver, I don't think it would work or go over too well.<br />
<br />
First of all, spells don't drain your mana constantly, you cast them and it drains the mana. It's like that in all D&amp;D style games. Therefore, just by that reason alone, the idea is not going to work.<br />
<br />
Let's look at it from a necro's point of view, shall we?<br />
<br />
Necro x loads up 4 DoTs, and has Lich up so is constantly regaining mana at an insane pace while aggro kiting. Now, I don't know how many DoTs necros use at the higher end when they aggro kite, but for the sake of this discussion, four is the number.<br />
<br />
Now, making DoTs drain mana per tick would ocmpletely **** up the way a lot of people play the game. Especially necros. Can you imagine a necro running around with Lich on, but still losing mana, because (s)he has DoTs on the mob? I know I can't, and it would suck for them. It would not only suck for them, but for all classes that use DoTs.<br />
<br />
DoTs draining mana per tick would completely **** up balance, and the way that spells work [in general]. It goes against everything (which is not always a bad thing, but in this case, it is), all the rules of spellcasting.<br />
<br />
It was an innovative, creative, new idea, but it won't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Wouldn't have to work that way on non-shamans, or on every dot even.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">A new Dot line. Shaman only.<br />
<br />
Disease based.<br />
<br />
Cast once on the mob. 500 a tick. But Each tick soaks a proper amount of mana. Till we cut it off or the mob is dead. Then no more ticks. Crits possible. Say 3 second cast time.  Medium aggro. (Less than poisen pretty please)<br />
<br />
We would be useful, even wanted in short and long duration fights. Because we put the spell on and do not have to worry about the recast or wearing off. And can continue to do what we need to do in the fast fights.<br />
<br />
Anyways just an idea.<br />
<br />
I really dont want a nuke. Because the shaman have always been a poor nuking class. This would address the flavor of the class while allowing for some customability, Especially if there were multiple spells in the line. Or even a heal spell of that nature.<br />
<br />
again just tossing out an idea or three.<br />

Fury of magic v. dot crit aa...<br />
Greater availability of focus items directed at nukes...<br />

Less agro than dots...<br />
<br />
Since they won't cater to us and stick to the original design of the class, base what you want for shamans around what it seems they're willing to give...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Druids regularly cast 2 nukes per mob, at least that is what i have seen in the KoD trials. That is how i came up with those numbers. you also have to consider the mana a druid uses.  You figure an average of 2 nukes and 1 spot heal which = 1410 mana per mob.  I seriously doubt they would want to waist all of their mana in 5 min by spam casting their DD.<br />
<br />
And as far as your 13 dps pet, I have never personally seen my pet as low as that, at least not with 2 weapons, SLtW, and FoS.  For me it has always been in between 30-35 dps.<br />
Well considering you still go to PoV, you probably have no clue about GoD, which this whole thread is about<br />
<br />
More elitest crap if the shaman pet only 15 to 20 in pov it sure as heck wont do 35 in any GoD zone so the only conclusion is one of you is full of it. Everyone used to say it was 25 DPS now its 35 pretty soon it will be 45. Please quit dreaming you might get 30 to 35 every once in a while but our pet sucks. He is nothing but a bad dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Do me a favor then, turn your pet hits on.  then add up the total amount of damage it does in the amount of time it attacks.   Why say everyone is full of it when you can find out for yourself.   <br />
You want me to spam what my pet does on these boards?  I can fill up about 2 pages of my pet parsing adding up about a total of 30-35 dps.<br />
Just say the word ..................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">due to the fact that EVERYONE else in group must sacrafice dps and other contributions to make the Charm work without wipeing from that tactic.<br />
That &quot;sacrifice&quot; will result in a pet that can parse up to 3000+ dps.<br />
Yes you read that right.<br />
Three thousand.<br />
I've never seen a group with an average dps of 500 dps per member ever.<br />
And as for it being difficult, it's not.<br />
Even without snare, I played an enchanter through all of Vxed doing the charm thing without the use of snare, and ended up dying one single time from it.<br />
With snare, it's a joke.<br />
With snare, it's like saying it's hard for a shaman to kill a golem in pov.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">That is great, everyone is happy for you i am sure.  But the fact is, your 3k dps could not be achieved successfully the entire way threw without help from the group.  I am sure wizzys and druids dont need any help from the group when they nuke do they ?  And those Vxed and tipt trials can be done with any matter of classes, charm is the fastest but can also be the most risk.  It is when you go past those trials is when you will see how useless charm is.  I seriously wouldnt depend on charm too much if you are planning on moveing past those 2 trials.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you stop pressing the canni hotkey while you torpor/Q (it seems to be broken with stoicisim though)? I'm losing HP while I gain it, but it doesn't matter. Can't see how it could be a problem for a Necro with mana.<br />
<br />
EQ has gone way beyond anything in *D&amp;D already - How many snakes kick? How many mobs summon?<br />
<br />
I just can't see it affecting game balance that much either - we'd probably end up with a chance to resist on every tick too, like we have with rains per wave.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">If the spell would constantly drain mana, of course there would have to be a way to turn it off or the spell would be impossible to control without the mob dying or you zoning or logging or something.<br />
<br />
So assume there were some way to turn off the DOT.  Perhaps it could show up as an icon, the way bards have icons for their songs.  Then you could just click the icon off to regulate your mana usage, just like you can presently click off most other icons in the game(SK aura's being some of the exceptions -- aura of hate, aura of pain, etc.).<br />
<br />
It wouldn't take anything remarkable in the way of intelligence to click off an icon, even for a necro. (kidding!)  <br />
<br />
As ideas go, it's kind of a cool one.  It sounds like too much coding and something too radical for Sony to actually try, but there's nothing inherently undoable about it.<br />
<br />
You don't want the mana drain?  Click off the spell!  Or just don't use it in the first place.  Both alternatives easily mastered even by an EQ player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">The problem is that if you dot something and then zone, you have lost your ownership of the dot. The dot is now untagged. This is a commonly used strat in pvp to turn your dots into full damaging pve tagged dots btw ;).<br />
<br />
Even the necro drain dots, bond of death for example, work this way. The spell sets up one icon on the necro and one on the target. These two icons are totally unrelated. Dispell/click off one, and the other will still keep pumping. <br />
<br />
There may be some way for SOE to link the two effects together, but I doubt it. Especially a link that would work across zonelines. Even if it did work, how do you take the zoning time into account? On my old computer it took as much as 5 minutes to zone. Then what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Well  easiest way to do it is make sure you have LoS. If you lose LoS the Dot stops ticking. Both on the monster and on you. Call it Curse of the Heyokah or something.<br />
<br />
Not saying that this is the best way or anything. But doable? Yeah. And it would be a new way at looking at shaman damage while keeping in the spirit of lore of the game. I really dont want to be a nuker, but I would like to be effective. And shaman have been about layered fuctionality for years. Effective once we get started. But we are not flash in the pan players that have all sizzle and no substance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Just making Bane unresistable would make me happy in the DoT department. It is a mana drain, it aggroes like mad but it is decent damage and pretty fast.<br />
<br />
And I do not feel guilty for taking up a debuff slot with it.<br />
<br />
But with the current resist check and recast time it is a liability.</div></div><hr />
