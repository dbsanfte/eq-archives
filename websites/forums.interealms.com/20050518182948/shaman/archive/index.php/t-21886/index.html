<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why Focus items make certain classes more out of balance.. <br />
<br />
Rytan_EQ example of Healing between the classes..  <br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 2750<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 1750<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 1300<br />
<br />
Comparatively for HP/Second:<br />
Supernal Light: 100%<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 64%<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 47%<br />
<br />
These values were put in to maintain balance between the three healing classes. I don't agree with the numbers, but they still work for the example.<br />
<br />
AA's shared between all three classes<br />
<br />
Advance healing Adept level 3 = 19% more healing <br />
<br />
Focus Items obtainable by all three classes<br />
<br />
40% healing Focus = random 1 - 40% more healing<br />
<br />
Apply the numbers to Rytan_EQ Formula.. <br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 3300 - 4373<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 2100 - 2783<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 1560 - 2067<br />
<br />
Apply Differences the increase focus items and AA's make.  <br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 550 - 1623<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 350 - 1033<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 260- 767<br />
<br />
(For the same risk/reward the other classes put in to obtain the items)   <br />
<br />
Clerics receive full 100% reward for there AA and focus items.. <br />
Druids receive 64% reward for there AA and focus items<br />
Shamans receive 47% reward for there AA and focus Items..   <br />
<br />
How is that balanced??  Shamans put in the same effort and get 47% of the award that clerics get. Did they grind longer for there AA? Did they raid more for there equipment?  <br />
<br />
This applies to Direct Damage Spells as well, did that wizard, druid, and mage grind harder and raid more? Shamans put the same amount of effort in and get a fraction of the reward the other classes get. <br />
<br />
This is a continuing trend and it needs to stop. As each expansion and spell upgrade roles out it puts the shaman class farther and farther behind. How do you correct the trend? Simple..<br />
<br />
Change all Focus items to work different...<br />
<br />
Healing Focus (20%) gets changed to increase healed amount from 1 to 400 * (1 - (level of spell/65). <br />
Healing Focus (40%) gets changed to increase healed amount from 1 to 800 * (1 - (level of spell/65). <br />
Advance healing Adept level 3 (19% healing) incease heal 400pts per heal * (1 - (level of spell/65).    <br />
<br />
Now every class gets the same reward for there AA's and Focus Items, OMG ITS BALANCED!<br />
<br />
<br />
Rytan, Brenlo, Random SOE Developer, what I'm asking for is to reward shamans for grinding AA's and raiding for gear the same way you award the other classes. Is that too much to ask?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are wrong, everyone is getting the same amount of increase as the other.  Each are getting between 20% and 59% more than their heal does unfocused.  They all get the same exact same amount of increase.  You can't compare the hp's healed (like you are trying to do)<br />
<br />
40% increase is a 40% increase.  Thats exactly what you get.  Giving the same amount of HP increase, as you suggest, would mean one class would get a vastly different % increase as another class.  Adding a flat 1000 HP onto a heal simply based on its level would mean Shaman would get a 77% increase on Tnarg's while Clerics would get a 36% increase on Supernal Light.  How is that fair?  In fact its stupid to call it a 40% focus item if it doesn't even do 40%.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem isn't focus items.  The problem is the %'s they use for our base heals:<br />
<br />
Cleric: 100%<br />
Druid: 64%<br />
Shaman: 47%<br />
<br />
They need to get rid of this stupid notion that druids should for some reason heal better than shaman.  Yes, Clerics should always heal better than both of us, but there is no valid reason that Druids are some special class that should get far better heals than us.   They need to tighten up the differences between the classes so you aren't so required to have a cleric for anything you want to do.<br />
<br />
Should be:<br />
<br />
Cleric: 100%<br />
Druid: 75%<br />
Shaman: 75%<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a joke that our best heal won't even heal 20% of my buffed HP.  By the end of GoD that number will be nearer to 10%.   I should not have to cast my heal 10 freaking times just to heal myself to full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are wrong, everyone is getting the same amount of increase as the other.<br />
<br />
Apply Differences the increase focus items and AA's make.  <br />
<br />
Supernal Light: 550 - 1623<br />
Nature’s Infusion: 350 - 1033<br />
Tnarg’s Mending: 260- 767<br />
<br />
It's not the same amount of increase, Shaman's bust the butt grinding and rading and they get a 767 heal increase compared to other classes 1623 for doing the same amount of risk. <br />
<br />
These are not the same... When did 1623 = 767?  Basing everything off percentages, is where the problem starts with.  They need to base everything off a fixed amount.  Clerics best heal regardless of expansion will heal 500 more hps then shamans. Now the balance is preserved. Its FIXED it will never change.  <br />
<br />
Slow should not be based off Percentage. Shaman slow will increase a monsters delay by 50.  Beastlords by 35. Maintain the fixed difference in delay by 15... not by 5%. Now as spells get more powerful for all classes everyone goes up in relative power the same. <br />
<br />
Why do you think they got special Pal/SK weapons with wicked dmg/dly ratio? Cause they used % scale, then they try to fix it giving PAL/SK better weapons to close that gap. It's a band-aid fix, thats going to keep popping up expansion after expansion. Then they change the band-aid with new weapons with better delay/damage ratio for pal/sk.  <br />
<br />
The second percentages get applied it doesn't scale to maintain balance in power between classes. And that problem gets escalated with focus items. As I have shown. <br />
<br />
SOE and company, needs to stop thinking in percentages and start thinking in fixed amounts. Once they change there thinking philosphy EQ there will be balanced and balance will be maitained.. <br />
<br />
Now, SOE has done this with Damage Shield.. Magician damage shields are normally 5 pts higher then druids and guess what in the omens its 5 pts higher again.. its not percentage based.. Balance is preserved..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, as stated before, the weakness in healing is something that's inherent. If our heals were equal to clerics to begin with, then healing focii would give us the same upgrades they do for clerics.<br />
<br />
We simply don't get the best effect out of focii because of how we are BEFORE they're applied. Focus effects have the same % effect across the board whether you're a level 9 Shadow Knight or a level 65 +700 AA wizard.<br />
<br />
Mana Preservation, for instance, doesn't save us from having enormous casting costs.<br />
Extended Enhancement doesn't help us a whole lot because a lot of our buffs have short durations, compared to those of some other classes.<br />
And then there was the Extended Affliction nerf. They need to refine that and bring it back, keeping Burning Affliction a separate ability.</div></div><hr />

I grind for 12 AA. Get Healing Adept 3.<br />
<br />
My 1300 heal has increased to 1430. An Increase of 130.<br />
<br />
Cleric's Supernal light 2750 has increased to 3025. An Increase of 275<br />
Druid's Nature’s Infusion: 1750 has increased to 1925. An Increase of 175.<br />
<br />
Okay now. For the SAME 12 AA. I get an increase of 130 on my heal. Druids and Clerics get MORE. Thus WIDENING the gap between healing classes.<br />
<br />
Now. He is suggesting that for the SAME 12 AA that we all get, Healing adept 3 should add a CONSTANT amount. Like 300 or something. Now we all get the same benefit from the same amount of work.<br />
<br />
The poster understands how focus effects and AA's work. He is trying to suggest reform for how they work because it's unfair for a class like ours. Clerics using 6 AA get the SAME benefit as us using 12 AA...Not really fair at all now is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i of course have not posted on the spell thread, because you are supposed to be polite there.  <br />

get you heads out of your asses folks, Sony does not give a ****.<br />
<br />
logical, well thought out, parsed, coherent, fact based, polite posts; do not get you a damn thing.<br />

the &quot;cure&quot; for shaman is to turn us into a BoT class, live with it or end billing.  <br />

<br />
I have a more serious question though. If this is applied to DDs, then surely it would disadvantage high damage spells relative to low damge spells, because of the fixed addition? Fixed 400 dmg would turn our level 1 nuke into a 400+ dmg dd, making it much more efficient than any of our other nukes for example. The same thing probably would apply to heals I would think. Just blast away with chloroblast, it costs nothing to cast and will heal allmost as well.<br />
<br />
So do you see the issues this will raise?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">yeah cause an 800 point chrolorblast would be so effective...<br />

the lvl 1 nuke thing is pretty funny though, but for shaman that would still rock, we would finally have a nuke with a reasonable casting cost/time for decent damage.</div></div><hr />

- Shaman require more focus effects then any other class in the game.<br />
- Shaman spend a lot of time casting cannibalize which does not benefit from any focus effects.<br />

<br />
<br />
As many have said above shamans healing problems is % ....47% is unacceptable. There is no.. and i mean no reason for a druid to heal better than us let alone a difference of like 20 %. in its current state for a shaman to be wanted for higher end game you would need all 3 priest classes in 1 group so shaman could twiddle their thumbs while the druid and cleric heal.</div></div><hr />

HA3 is a 10% increase in your healing.  Each of the increases you posted is 10% of the base heal, that is the same reward for the same work. Yes the gab is widening, it is doing so because of the base healing ratio. <br />
<br />
SoE is so fixated on Slow and how &quot;Powerful&quot; it makes shaman. News flash 70% slow, increasing mana regen by 14 - 18 a tick, and Dire charm is not as &quot;Powerful&quot; as a 75% slow and 47% of a cleric's heal according to SoE.<br />

 we need all of these foci (or higher)to be considered a GOOD shaman.<br />
<br />
1. mana pres 4 <br />
2. spell haste foci, detrimental and beneficial <br />
3. buff extension foci<br />
4. improved healing foci<br />
<br />
<br />
for #1, our spells cost HUGE ammounts of mana, more so than any other class, ever had to chain slow ? you'll usually be oom befor it lands.<br />
<br />
#2 our spells are very long to cast. nukes, heals, debuffs, they take precious time to cast, time we could spend chaining our inefficient heals.<br />
<br />
#3 ferine avatar, Q need i say more ?<br />
<br />
#4 tnargs, its crap but its all 70% of playing shaman will ever see. anythig that can improve this however slight it maybe , is worth getting.<br />

unfortunately i have to agree with tug here, fixed amounts wouldnt really work as focus are at the moment.<br />
<br />
however that said % never work equally. 5% of 1000000 is a lot more than 5% of 10000. it still 5% but the first one is 50000, the second 500. the first one still is 100 time more than the raise of the second. and if something was designed to work with the first increase? the second will not have a chance, depsite them both being 5%.<br />
<br />
so if this was pay say, and tax went up 10000, for all, the second guy is ****ed but the first guy can handle it easy?<br />
however normaly tax is on what you can do and earn, eq isnt it bases it on what the best classes can do.<br />
<br />
this is the basic unfairness in eq.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">AlynaRN certainly has a point, but there is more to consider.<br />
<br />
Regarding AAs you have to look at the whole picture(tm) of all AAs. The question is not 'Do healing AAs give different benefits to different healer classes?' or not.<br />
<br />
The questions are:<br />
- Can all classes get a similar increase in effectivity and power via AAs?<br />
- Does this similar increase in power require a similar effort/amount of AAs?<br />
<br />
= Are AAs in itself balanced for all classes?<br />
<br />
Equal AAs don't have to give the same benefits to different classes, as long as all AAs together give all characters a relatively equal toolset and improvement.<br />
<br />
Still for shamans and their craptastic AAs the answer is no to those questions.</div></div><hr />

Forgot one very important one, Extended Range. Shaman are one of the very, very few classes that actually cast on the mobs as they are INC. In fact, the sooner (i.e. farther away) they can cast on the mob, the better it is for the group.</div></div><hr />

The % is the same but because clerics and druids inherent healing is better they recive alot more from it. You can say it is fair because the % is the same but in real healing power its much better for them.</div></div><hr />

This is true in one sense, but on the other hand, % is really the only way to make such abilities work. <br />
<br />
Once again, I will say it, and I hate to sound like a broken record here, but I think AA is the answer. Give Shamans anotehr AA they can work toward that will bring them MUCH closer to a Druids healing. Make it expensive, like the DPS one I have already mentioned, so Shaman have to make a CHOICE which way to take their character, toward Healing or toward a bigger nuke. Then, Murtak can play the Shaman he wants to play and I can play the shaman I want to play. <br />
<br />
The more I think about this, the more I REALLY see this as the solution to everything we are bitching about. In fact, I think I will starrt a new thread and hope Rytan and Brenlo read it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Jaradis is right and this is a dead argument.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I think that Alyn has a valid point.<br />
<br />
A mob's max hit is not based on a percentage of your healer's base heal.  It is a fixed amount.  The number of hit points you heal is what is important, not the ratio of your focused heal to your base one.  Also consider that when SoE designs new content, they keep max focused heals in mind (if they didn't, healing would be trivial with max focused heals).<br />
<br />
Sony has gotten in trouble before with perfectly scaling abilities being overpowered and magnifying class balance problems (see: slows, complete heal, defensive).  Focus effects that scale raise the same problems.  Then again, focus items that add a fixed amount also raise problems.  The core issue is that EQ was never designed with focus effects in mind.  We get the shaft coming and going because the 2 weak abilities we have (damage and healing) get increased by a percentage from focus effects, therefore we get the lowest absolute increase in these skills.  On the other hand, the one thing that we are best at (slow, by a little) gets reduced by a percentage via mitigation, thereby giving us the largest absolute decrease in that skill. <br />
<br />
Now, I think that Jaradis is right that the main problem is that our base heals are so pitiful.  But even if that was fixed, powerful focus items could put us back behind the 8-ball.  Focus effects magnify the difference now.  They will still magnify a smaller difference.  But SoE could design content where that difference matters, which would be bad for us.<br />

<br />
The 100/60/45 ratio is the problem, not everyone getting a percentage increase. Make that ratio 100/80/70 and a lot of problems will disappear. Adding fixed amounts to heals will only produce more problems somewhere in the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, this argument is extremely flawed.  It has nothing to do with the focus and has everything to do with the base heals, as others have said.  The base heals are unbalanced, not the focus items' effects.<br />
<br />
We require more focus effects to bring us closer to other classes, assuming the other classes do not get focus items, they have the same ability to get these focus effects and therefore it does not improve the situation.  However, these focus items do allow Shaman to become better able to take a role in healing(but not enough in my opinion).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">FFS...just roll a cleric and shut up.  Give up the ability to SoW, invis, debuff, slow, and everything else that you bring to a table as a shaman.  Of course we won't see the same level of benefit from AAs and focii on healing. HEALING IS NOT OUR PRIMARY ABILITY.  Clerics should see more benefit.  The % increases are fair and they do work.  I am of the opinion that our spells should heal more HP than they currently do, but am not deluded enough to think that we should be able to heal as well or gain the same amount of increases as a cleric.</div></div><hr />

I would agree with you healing is not our main focus. But something has to be done because slow is becoming less efective all the time. The only focus effect that helps slow is to speed to casting time. Sow is a joke now, run 5 anyone. I can buy invis, debuff is still good but chanters do it almost as well at least for magic and I believe they do it faster. I aggree with you % is fair but the shaman as a class is quick becoming obsolite. I hope it gets fixed but give what we have heard I am not counting on it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok the ratio is 100/80, like you want.  For simplicity's sake, say clerics heal 100 dps and we heal 80 dps.  We have a deficit of 20 hps.  Mobs are designed to be challenging, so they do 100dps, but maybe we can hang with hard work and make up that 20 dps difference.<br />
<br />
Both get a focus item that multiplies heals by fifty.<br />
<br />
clerics now can heal 5,000 dps.  We can heal 4,000 dps.  Mobs designed to be challenging do 5,000 dps.  Good luck making up for that 1,000 dps healing deficit.<br />
<br />
Both your example and mine are extreme examples.  The basic point is that extreme percentage increases and extreme flat rate increases are both bad ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Percentage increases for AA's is the correct way to do things.  Static increases just don't work.  Whether you like it or not, that will never be changed, IMO.  I think you disagree with the main premise that the balance is disproportional, which many of us will agree with, but trying to push for this change will just make us look like we don't understand the issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yeah, I agree that this is not the kind of thing we should be making a stink about now (or ever probably, unless the focus effects get ridiculously huge in the future).  It's like being in a room with a fly buzzing around and an elephant sitting on your chest.  We should get the elephant (base ratios) off and then we can decide if it is worth it to swat the fly or just let it be.</div></div><hr />

But that 1000 DPS difference is just as easy or just as hard to make up for as the 20 DPS difference. It will take just as many heals per seconds to bridge that gap as it did pre-focus items.<br />
<br />
With static increases the ratio changes.</div></div><hr />

While I do agree with Jaradis, I'm also glad that I'm not part of the chain CH cycle on raids.  I want more healing, but I really don't want that role in raids.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">If we follow that line of thought with the logic used by some individuals who shall remain nameless, then our best heal is likely to wind up being Inner Fire<br />
<br />
It would depend on what you were using it for. If you are spamming the MA during named fights (I often do this to myself, so I know what happens) you usually run out of mana long before the fight is over. In any situation where you needed to spam heals for an extended period chloroblast would have a clear advantage, being a little faster on one hand and much more mana efficient using your scheme on the other. You would be getting a ~1600 heal with a 3s (less with spell haste) cast time, for 175 mana (less with mana saving aa/foci).<br />
<br />
Inner fire would mean basically mana free down-time healing. It would make Q obselete. Doing the sort of thing you have suggested would result in inordinate power being allocated to low level spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
SoE is so fixated on Slow and how &quot;Powerful&quot; it makes shaman. News flash 70% slow, increasing mana regen by 14 - 18 a tick, and Dire charm is not as &quot;Powerful&quot; as a 75% slow and 47% of a cleric's heal according to SoE.<br />

<br />
the problem is still this retarded notion that druids should out heal shaman, they bring enough to the table that slow isnt nearly as powerful by itself to warrent this huge gap. big nukes, big dots, snare, track, evac, pets in some places, the only thing shaman bring besides slow is crappy heals crappy dps and crappy buffs. explain to me again why shaman should heal for so much less than druids?</div></div><hr />

Your shaman's gear is far from optimal, you don't have SCM according to your magelo either.  Most shamans can also duck out of blasthealing if they see a CH has hit just in front of them.</div></div><hr />

It's the same % but that is not fair, it shouldn't be. The ratios should not be like that to begin with that is the root of the problem.</div></div><hr />

Think people on this thread are making the usual mistake and the above poster has it right.<br />
<br />
You get the same %increase from Foci as other classes but you dont get the same PTS increase as other classes because your base pts that the 10% is based on are lower to start off with.<br />
<br />
Off the wall example.<br />
<br />
Earn $100 a week get a 20% rise.<br />
Earn $1000 a week get %5 rise.<br />
<br />
Which would you rather have :)<br />
