<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Munkh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 20, and am curious if I can get better (more) exp in which of the following places.<br />
<br />
Paludal Caverns<br />
High Hold Keep<br />
LDoN adventures<br />
<br />
Please enlighten me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">LDoN is great exp, but you won't get groups as fast, so it's slower.<br />
<br />
Stay in PC for a few more levels (until 24), then go to HHK until 33 or so, then go to DSP/OT for groups until you can do DL until 50. only then start LDoNs between PoJ groups. IMHO, Ldon isn't worth it before then. You don't get good points, until you're higher level. You don't get enough groups, until you're higher level. Also keep in mind, LDoN is slightly less exp than PoP groups, but you do get points, so it's a bit of a trade-off. I get more AA exp in BoT than LDoN, but I get points for goodies in LDoN. See? tradeoff. Thats why if you're just more interested in exp, go the route I pointed out.</div></div><hr />
