<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aammon Aammonite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone out there using a Radeon 8500ish vid card.  Thinking about picking one up.  If you are could I inquire what processor type/speed and how does EQ perform with it.   Money is kinda tight.   Any thoughts orfeelings out there please share.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">8500LE card runs less than a $100 and will outperform a geforce3 so it's a great deal.  I personally have not used one in eq but eq seems nvidia optimized to me, so might get better eq performance with an nvidia card. (but not other games)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have a radeon 7200, it runs pretty well, but in high polygon areas it drags a good bit (bazaar is really bad).  SOE has done a bit of optimizing for nvidia cards and drivers, if you primarily play EQ and not other games, you'd probably be better off going nvidia.  The GeForce 4400ti series is pretty good, and runs anywhere from $150 to $250 depending on ram and who made the board.  I think some of the earlier gf4's might be a little cheaper, though obviously won't perform as well.</div></div><hr />
