I was just wondering if you guys will be looking after Shaman's in WoW? I have some friends that are curious as to class forums for certain classes in World of Warcraft, Shaman being one of the most asked about. Will you be hosting them? Or know of anywhere I could send them to?<br />
<br />
*edited - I think my question is being misunderstood. What I am trying to find out is, will you be hosting the class forums for Shaman's that play WoW?*<br />

i got all my grammar right, i just don't like the 'shift' key.  it comes from a lifetime (or seems like one) of coding in c.  :)<br />
<br />
despite all the uproar concerning rogues and warlocks, i was referring to the attempted pluralization of the word 'shaman'.<br />
<br />
i haven't a clue what class i'm going to play.  if i stay true to eq form, i'll pick a class that everyone seems to think is overpowered, but is really broken, you know, like shamans.</div></div><hr />

sorry for the incoming grammar thread hijack, but how is changing shamans to the posessive form, shaman's,  make a funny?</div></div><hr />

But Orcs are much cooler than Ogres! Ever since I first saw a Crushbone Orc I wanted to play one.</div></div><hr />

Bleah, orcs are scurvy.  Now if they had goblins as a playable race...<br />
<br />
:edit:<br />
<br />
To answer the original question, I obviously can't speak for the mods or anyone else, but I'd be very surprised if they started hosting a WoW shaman forum.  There just doesn't seem to be a lot of common ground between the two different interpretations of the class.</div></div><hr />

Imperfection is imperfection and when you feel the need to place yourself above other people and point out mistakes as insignificant as that, then you better make your your perfect in every respect ;)<br />
<br />
Just razzing ya. I love slaping the grammer police is all.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The idea of having to be perfect in order to point out imperfections is at best invalid.<br />
<br />
If what you suggest was true then there would be no film critics, no literature critics, music critics or any critics of any sort, since I really doubt, anyone would be qualified to critic Mozart, Picasso, Shakespeare, etc....<br />
<br />
Also it is not inconsistent or hypocritical to point out imperfections or mistakes and doing so in an imperfect manner. The fact that one may point out a mistake in an imperfect way, does not change the fact that the mistake was made in the first place, and just because the person who pointed it out made a mistake themselves, does not reduce, alleviate or excuse the original mistake, in any form or shape however  insignificant the mistake may be. It just means that the person who pointed out the mistake is also viable to receive criticism as he already did, but not in the hypocrisy of the statement.<br />
<br />
I have heard that argument over and over again, as if to reduce the credibility of the poster, and it is ludicrous. <br />
<br />
To be fair anyone who discredits any argument or line of thought on grammatical mistakes alone is no better than the person who criticizes the former individual. Simply stated grammatical errors happen, and we can freely point them out, but they do not make a point any less valid or the person who points them out is no less correct by making mistakes themselves.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase Freud in a weird way, making a grammatical mistake is just that…A grammatical mistake. No truth or moral value is attached to grammar or syntax.<br />
<br />

Ok, you are free to take Tylenol now.<br />

Thankyou for your reply. If you decide to go ahead with it I will inform my members. Not sure the the moderator comment was for me or not, but I'm actually just curious of where to direct my members atm as I would be rather busy running the class forum for Warlocks (Warlocks Den)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I saw that shamans were the only class to get rez in WoW ... I'll find another class to play, although chain lightning looks very cool.  So far, from descriptions, I like druids and even mages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I saw that shamans were the only class to get rez in WoW ...<br />
<br />
Not sure where you found this info, but it isn't correct.  Shamans, Priests, Warlocks, Paladins, and Druids can all rez with varying degrees of ability.  I highly doubt they'd make shamans the only rezzing class, since the shaman class is only available to the Horde faction...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Last I looked at it was about 4 months ago, thought it was the blizzard forums or only-wow.  They are the only two sources I really check out, oh, and an article on gamespy once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Found some links for you... :)<br />
<br />
Here's a link (http://www.battle.net/forums/wow/thread.aspx?FN=wow-general&amp;T=1249675&amp;P=1&amp;ReplyCount=500#post1249675) with a dev talking about priest/druid/paladin rezzing in the context of death penalties:<br />
<br />
Oh wait, what about Priest/Pali/Druid ressurection skills? Do they summon the ghost closer or something?<br />
No, resurrection spells may be cast on a player’s active corpse. The receiving player may then choose to accept the resurrection, which will re-incorporate them on top of their corpse with full gear, but with resurrection sickness.<br />
<br />
Can a player be rezzed by a shaman or druid at the spot where they died or do they automatically appear at a bindstone as a ghost?<br />
When you die, you will appear at the nearest graveyard, but your corpse remains a valid target for resurrection spells. <br />
<br />
Warlocks will be able to make &quot;soulstones&quot; to rez with also... having trouble finding an &quot;official&quot; link atm but  here's one (http://www.worldofwar.net/characters/warlock/index.php) from www.worldofwar.net.<br />
<br />
edit: to the original poster, www.worldofwar.net will have class forums for each class (probably not until beta starts though), and it's overall a decent community.  If the Crucible doesn't make a forum for WoW, you could check out over there.</div></div><hr />
