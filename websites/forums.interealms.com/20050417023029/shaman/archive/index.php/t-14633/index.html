<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">there is one side affect . . . I'll get to that in a moment.  At 54, I was recently gifted a JBB from a guildmate.  I was quite happy, and have found it's pretty nifty in many situations, but I'm glad I never paid &quot;uber&quot; plat for one because it's not really necessary.  I digress.  OK, so I've been soloing the elementals in Nadox, sometimes the other mobs there but nothing really special.  Well, I move back to Dulak because I want to save some cash for a focus item.  Boats are camped, as usual, so I move over to the Oceancrasher dock area and begin to pull anything in site.  Mobs in this area are all still dark blue to me. :)  Well, about 3 hours l have gotten decent, not great, but decent xp with little or no risk.  However, when I jump back to sell off, I realize I have 1 blue diamond, 1 diamond, 1 mith amulet, 2 fire opals, and a saphire.  Not too mention being full of 5pp weapons after ditching all those shivs (except for 2 for my pet next time out), and an average of 4pp cash per mob.  So, I walk away with about 1k+pp in three hours, good xp, and am smiling all the way to the bank . . . literally.  Needless to say, I'll be here till I'm 55. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Falcon08</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is still a pretty good spot at 55 although some stuff is LB. Your 55 pet rips through the stuff with only a slow on them and one or 2 blasts of the JBB. I am currently using this spot when I can not get Dandolak camp.<br />
<br />
It is also good if you want to do a few AA's. I decided to hold at 55 and get run speed 3 and regen 3. I reckon I can get 40 to 50% of a aa in a KEI (depends on if it is extended or not) and like you said 1kpp in loot.<br />
<br />
The other day I soloed there for the length of my KEI. Was pulling in 2 and tanking one myself I had so much mana. Walked out with 3 blue diamonds, 3 diamonds and opal bracelet and a fire emrald as well as the obligatory weapons, cash and meat (for the illusion potions). I even dinged an AA without noticing.<br />
<br />
Dulak is a very good zone for the soloing shaman if you can find a good camp spot. Now if only I could get the soulstripper camp.</div></div><hr />
