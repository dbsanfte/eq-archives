<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been around EQ for a long time, though I never got too serious about it. Ive played EQ for stretches, Ive played other games for stretches. The one reason I keep coming back to EQ is because it is so deep. I like being able to group and I also enjoy soloing, though I often feel forced into some actions, like grouping, even when groups arent available or break up quickly.<br />
<br />
 Dont get me wrong, though, soloing too much definately is boring, but I enjoy having the option. By far the most fun I have in EQ is when I am in a good group, yet I still value being able to solo when I want to be alone. Why should there be a conflict? There is, soloing is like masterbation, everyone does it, yet nobody likes to talk about it.<br />
<br />
 Ive felt for a long time that due to some vision or other, Verant/Sony have been forcing people into certain actions, whether or not their players enjoy it. To a certain degree, a game design must distinguish itself as unique and create a game experience all its own. There also comes a time when a design will begin to get a life of its own, especially true in MMORPGs. Yet, in the end, you have to make the players happy.<br />
<br />
 Instead of balancing the classes yet again, by taking something from there and adding it to there to form some patchwork of gameplay, take it from a different perspective. Everquest is the best game out there, but it needs new life, new players. If your tailoring the classes yet again to conform to the high end encounters, your giving new people no reason to come here. The last several expansions have tailored to the uber guilds at the neglect of most other sections of the player base. LDoN was a step in the right direction, but the other expansions went in the uber direction. <br />
<br />
 I love the old world zones, there is so much to explore. I spend hours and hours in Kunark, I just love it. Kunark was an awesome expansion that had a little for everyone, new and veteran. Lets have another Kunark like expansion, that actually draws people into exploring again. We definately need new people in this game. I want more people to be swept up with the desire to explore again, and take risks!<br />
<br />
 A little side note here- take away losing a level from death... how in the world can this still be in the game??? Aside from some hardcore people, who really wants this? Having a death penatly adds to the game, but death post 51 is just enough to beat any adventure/risk/exploring instincts out of me. I remember wanting to exploring Dragon Necropolis one time, just because it sounded like a cool thing to do. Wanna know how many people thought that was cool? Can use say empty zone? The risk of dying without a rez scares everyone away, and rightfully so. Getting killed without a rez and its time to grind for the next 2 days to get back where you were. Screw them, I went anyway and had a dragon pop right ontop of me! It happened pretty fast... I think it was a dragon... anyway you know I didnt get a rez, but lets move on.<br />
<br />
 If I were the captain of this ship, I would rather see my ship be destroyed in battle, rather than rust in place. I would try to bring in new people and bring the old people back. I would make EQ an adventure/exploring game again! Theres money in that, ask Blizzard. Ya, SOE is scratching their butts trying to figure out which orafice their heads are in, try to figure out why Blizzard is so much better than them. Its about fun! Imagine that! <br />
<br />
 I would take the emphasis away from uber guilds and uber encounters. Dont you all think there are already enough raid encounters in the game? If your characters are too uber and need new content just to have fun, well Im far to jealous to care what you think ;) Seriously, roll a new untwinked character and start over and do stuff you likely have never done, or its been years since youve done it. <br />
<br />
 Revamp Kunark, add a new race... do something other than watch the ship sink! If you log on and have plenty of time to group, give this person some viable options. If you log on and cant find a group, give this person some viable options in soloing/questing. Solo is not a bad word. If many of the people compaining about things today had a viable solo option to escape to once in awhile, maybe their group problems wouldnt seem so grave.<br />
<br />
 I have a feeling that these new class balancing changes coming soon will finally put the nails in EQs coffin, because they are not addressing the core problems. If you do nothing but cater to the hardcore elements, well... just change the name of the game to Shadow Bane and cut your subscibers down another two-thirds. Also, this new expansion seems to be all fluff and will only rust the hull more. /rant off<br />
<br />
 If you can find a coherent point in this, bring it to my attention :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I first started playing EQ back in March of 1999, the attractive part of EQ was the fact that it was a challenging game.<br />
<br />
The big problem as I see it with EQ is that it is now way too easy. I don't want to see Everquest become another Ultima Online.<br />
<br />
You used to lose a bubble and a half of exp when you died when the game first started, and you had zero hope of a res of any kind because clerics hadn't reached the level where they had an exp res. You can bet that people paid much more attention in groups back then.<br />
<br />
Today it is a completely different story. Exp loss isn't even a concern to most people, because there is so much content with large exp gains, and also because the equipment available today is I am sure, way way beyond what the original creators of Everquest ever imagined. <br />
<br />
I myself believe that when a game is made too easy, people become bored with it and quit playing. There simply isn't any challenge to it.<br />
<br />
This is the reason I enjoy the game the most when I encounter challenging content, ie... guild level raid content, or pushing myself to do 'stupid' things, like trying to solo extremely difficult mobs. These are examples of what keeps me interested in Everquest, the challenges. When the game loses this aspect, is probably the time I will lose interest.<br />
<br />
As an example: While I enjoy the ability to travel quickly to areas with respect to guild activities, I think you lose the immersion in the game with these features. The game just doesn't feel the same. You just don't see nearly as much of the game when you are able to travel this easily.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong here though. There needs to be some availability to ease travel, EQ is just too huge a game to not have it, but I think there is entirely too much.<br />
<br />
I don't think making the game easier is the answer to bringing in and retaining players to Everquest. I believe that SoE needs to get back to creating interesting, challenging content for all players. Raising level caps, adding features which require large amounts of exp grinding and so on, although 'challenging' in a sense, causes quite a bit of frustration for the most part.<br />
<br />
IMO the continued success of Everquest will be tied mostly to the creation of content that will be enjoyable, not frustrating. This won't be easy for SoE though. It will take careful design and thorough QC to pull it off. Rushed expansions won't help. I'd rather wait longer for well thought out and designed expansions. Make the content challenging without the mindless exp grinding.<br />
<br />
One idea: Instead of tying character advancement to grinding, create quests that are similar to (but not as difficult as) epic quests which grant characters additional abilities and so on. Make the journey to aquire the abilities, spells interesting, instead of requiring you to group for hours grinding out exp or killing the same mobs over and over in order to gain additional equipment and spells. Expand on that task system they introduced.<br />
<br />
I'd love to once again have the sense of excitement and anticipation I had when I first started playing Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I agree that it would be great to see another Kunark/Velious-style expansion, but it would require more than a few months to crank out something with that much detail.  LoY pretty much set the pattern for more recent expansions where SOE bundles minimal game content around some must-have features.  Sadly, I think the days of big expansions are done and if we do get another &quot;whopper&quot; expansion, you know SOE will just toss another insta-port into PoK to make the journey to new lands as interesting as changing channels on TV. <br />
<br />
Everquest's basic game has been dumbed down tremendously and eliminating the death penalty at this point would just sap a little more integrity right out of the game.  Getting your corpse and even exp back after death has never been easier really.  You have PoK to port you anywhere, PCs who can summon corpses, PCs who can give you a 96% resurrection, no corpse rot, and a universal GY.  I can die in a frikkin GFay tree-fort and be bound in Paineel and not break a sweat or spend more than a few minutes getting my corpse back.<br />
<br />
If you get rid of the &quot;uber encounters&quot; you lose some of the depth of the game.  Raid-level encounters can be tons of fun and writing this aspect out of future expansions just makes for more mediocre expansions with no real point.  Why do you think LoY is so poorly thought of? :p <br />
<br />
OoW, while not perfect, is a pretty decent example of what can be done to make an expansion for most everyone and signals a move away from the horribly one-sided GoD and PoP models.  I hope SOE continues down this road with future releases.</div></div><hr />

They could change it so you had an XP &quot;debt&quot; of some kind, rather than losing a level, but I expect it would be exploited.</div></div><hr />

The added a zone called Shadowrest.  Once your corpse has sat around unclaimed for too long, it is automatically transported (with the gear on it) to this zone where you can retrieve the items.  I'm not sure how loing it takes, I belive it's equivalent to the old Rot timer (i.e. instead of your corpse disappearing after 7 days, it goes to Shadowrest for a vacation and some Tecquila)<br />
<br />
I know there is a NPC in the Plane of Knowledge that will teleport you to Shadowrest.  Just hail him and follow the text.  As I recall, he's roughly under the long bridge that leads to the Library, not far from the main bank.</div></div><hr />

This is hardly what i would call a universal GY though.<br />
Yer your corpse pops here after 7 days but this in maybe only a very very very small way helps CR's.<br />
Who after all is after a raid etc wipe going to  say &quot;oh never mind about the CR we just need to wait 7 days&quot;.<br />

interesting.<br />
<br />
I should make a thread asking what else I've missed. :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If your tailoring the classes yet again to conform to the high end encounters, your giving new people no reason to come here.<br />
<br />
The first thing the devs are looking into is class balancing in group situations.  Raiding comes after that.<br />
<br />
In terms of the content, it certainly is a hard act to balance between upper end content, and single group explorable content.  Personally, I'm torn.  I like raiding with my guild, but on off nights.. I'm thinking to myself, what is their really to do?  Well, there are about a million things to do (finish my epic, up a tradeskill, level my alts, farm, get a wos or mpg or riftseekers group and get some runes, etc..), but it feels somewhat similar to what I've done before.   Its just new graphics.  I don't feel like I'm exploring anything.<br />
<br />
It would be nice if they just had an expansion that was all for groups.  Just a massive set of zones, with millions of little quests and camp spots, and things to farm, etc..  Then, they could have a second expansion a short time later that just unlocked some raid doors off the existing zones.<br />
<br />
I agree that EQ needs to get that sense of 'adventure' and 'questing' back.  Truthfully, I think they need more dungeons to accomplish that.  There is zero risk outdoors with soe, sow, bard speed etc, but put someone in a narrow, no mount, no sow dungeon, with the promise of good loot around the bend, and you'll see some white knuckles as people clench their mouse in anticipation.<br />
<br />
But, we can all see what ldon did.  Nada.  Loot was lame, encounters were cookie cutter and easy.<br />
<br />
They need massive, non instanced dungeons, with random named placement imo.  Chardok size and bigger, dark scary, and no camp spots, except for a few 'royalty' type mobs that are raid mobs.  You'd have to crawl thru the dungeon to find named, it would really be an adventure.<br />
<br />
But then again.. people would whine, &quot;its such a pain in the arse when you die in uber dungeon X, corpse runs are horrendous, yada yada.&quot;<br />
<br />
Dunno.  I guess one of the things that made EQ popular was its strict reliance on 'realism'.  By that, I mean, boat travel, long runs, hard corpse runs, long camps for rare items, etc..  Before PoP, before the conveniances we have today, like cookie cutter instanced dungeons, etc.. EQ was VERY popular.  Its still popular today, but no more so than it was when the game was much more difficult to play.  <br />
<br />
I guess, while it would cut out the probably sizable chunk of new players that like the game 'easier', I think it would be healthier for <br />
EQ to avoid making the game any more user friendly.  Let EQ be known as &quot;the hardcore mmorpg&quot;.  Everything else is for 13 year olds and wimps:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd have to agree. Although making things easier has its benefits, it's a double edged sword; there needs to be challenge too.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of an expansion where all the mobs actually work as a team against you, so that it takes a lot more effort to exp group, but at the same time it's doable with 1 group. This would require you to do more than turn on autoattack and alt tab out to keep reading a forum or something, it would require that white knuckled teamwork that I remember when trying to camp the FBSS in guk when I was a newbie. Or trying to camp a fungi at 55. Now I can only get that white knuckled thrill soloing or raiding - I want it back while grouping :)<br />
<br />
Since kills would take longer, the experience modifier would be increased to compensate. One kill might take you 15 minutes but you would get an easy 25 or 30% AA from it. Or tune it according to what is the norm now - I've been away and since I got back only been doing regular experience to get 70 so I don't know how long a normal AA takes these days.<br />
<br />
I don't mind sow and mount but if they are allowed then the dungeon needs to be tuned to take that into account. I also don't really like dark zones, I prefer brighter zones (Some of my best memories involve eastern wastes!), but that's really a trivial difference.<br />
<br />
Most of all, it should be an expansion where you can gear yourself to an anguish level via quests that are AT MOST one groupable, mostly soloable - but not something that you can just go complete overnight either, there should be real effort behind it, and not just &quot;go hand this note to so and so&quot;, but rather far more involved quests.<br />
<br />
There should also be raid content where you don't need to put that effort into it to get loot either. In other words there should be more than one path to uberness, and it shouldn't require 70 people.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I think that they need to stop upgrading gear, and also stop upgrading mobs. Add more strategy to it instead. Raid encounters shouldn't be the same each time anymore. They should be a team effort without requiring even more people. Instead of focusing on making one mob more powerful, they should focus on making several weak mobs a team. It's not that hard to write artificial intelligence to handle that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with most of the things posted here so I'll try not to rehash the same points. The one thing I'm not sure anyone here would agree with me about is the new expansion and how much I'm looking forward to it though. I reactivated both of my accounts the day I saw the web site for it, and not because of the cheesy new features but because it had the word 'dragons' in it. I have to be honest, it sold me - I want a fantasy game, something with a half decent storyline that I can follow and hopefully some decent quests.<br />
<br />
Speaking of quests, to the person that suggested a quest orientated expansion, I think this should be the norm, although I still think they should include new raid content too. The ONLY thing I can think of that has survived nearly 9 expansions now are the quests! Look how many people are still coming up the ranks and working on those epic 1.0 quests - I helped a shaman get his hole piece just yesterday and did the cleric epic mob in the burning woods last week. I don't understand why Sony hasn't seen this? I can't think of a better time in EQ than when I finally completed my epic 1.0. I was working on my Epic 1.5 before I closed my accounts and I look forward to continuing it now. My Canni II quest took me ages the first time around (I did it a few more times after to make some money). The Blood of Nadox quest and Stoicism quests in LoY were ok too. Other quests of note I can think of were my VP key (I'd sooner be doing another one of those than endlessly grinding exp in the same spot for months) and VT key. All of them gave me a great sense of achievement when completed.<br />
<br />
Other than the Epic 1.5's, I'm struggling to think of a single quest post-Luclin that I can work on without the help of a raid force of other people (ala PoP progression and BiC).<br />
<br />
Something else I'd like to see ..... a new town!! Other than PoK there has been nowhere I can look around for something to do post-luclin, and even then PoK was just full of carbon copies of your home town npc's! LoY, LDoN, GoD, OoW ... nadda. It's just been zone fulls of exp mobs and it gets old, fast.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah I'd like a whole lot more quests I can do, just something other than exp grinding would be enough to keep my accounts active this time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In regards to Shadowrest/corpse summoning, it sounds like the new DoN Guild Hall is going to make it just that much easier to grab a corpse risk-free.  Not sure if this is something you will only be able to use while in raid, but can it get any easier? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jarcey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree w/alot of whats been said here. I took an 8 month brk from the game, just came back too it around christmas time.<br />
My real life friends are the ones that got me interested in EQ. Every day at work we would be in the brk room and they would be talking about this and that. Being a gamer and loving rpg's. I was hooked the first day one of my friends let me start a character on his account. Three real life friends and me would group together and just explore endlessly. Help each other w/quest's, gear and spells. <br />
They have all since moved on to WoW. The main reason is to explore and do quest's. Of course friend that let me make my first EQ character had me come over to check out WoW. I of course played a shaman, and in about 3 hrs had him gear'd up and working on lvl 6. I solo'd but they main way I was gettin exp was doing quest's. Plus I got gear. The whole time I was playing WoW I was thinking I sure hope the devs and the higher ups at SoE are seeing what Blizzard has done and that next expansion will get EQ back to what it is that everyone loved/s.</div></div><hr />

Why oh why do people confuse difficult with &quot;time consuming pain in the ass&quot; ?.<br />
<br />
Please name me something that is difficult in EQ that cant be overcome by investing a bit of time.(no youre not allowed to say get Rytan to look at Shaman spells with an open mind.Thats not difficult thats impossible :)).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;Difficult&quot; and &quot;time consuming pain in the ass&quot; are TOTALLY a matter of perspective.  Most key quests in EQ can easily fall under both categories.  VT key in Luclin's heyday for example, has hours upon hours of mindless &quot;pain in the ass&quot; camping finalized by what was a fairly &quot;difficult&quot; or tricksy encounter that often required overcoming a &quot;difficult&quot; cockblock or two as well.<br />
<br />
Some things that are trivial now, like CR, were a real bugger in the past, but they made playing/grouping in certain spots that much more exciting.  I wouldn't call it &quot;walking uphill in 6ft of snow on our hands backwards&quot;, but trying to get to a corpse nekkid when you died at the foot of some giant tree NPC in WK with insane aggro range that bested you by ~30 levels before there was such a thing as /corpsedrag, was slightly challenging.  The same situation today just wouldn't have the same flavor. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Wulfbane, perhaps you'd like to describe something that is difficult but won't be considered 'a pain in the arse' by some?  I doubt there are very many things like that.  For instance, take the VT keys above.  Some (maybe most:), would say that VT keys were merely a pain.  For me, I like fishing (IRL).  Sitting there mindlessly, casting over and over.  Its the patience thats the challenge.  Willing yourself to keep trying.  (Test of patience, shaman epic 1.0 hehe).  <br />
<br />
A corpse run, while annoying, did provide a real sense of consequences if you screwed up.  And exp penalty made you think twice about running into a room &quot;just to see what would happen&quot; hehe.<br />
<br />
Sure, and encounter can be difficult in the sense that it takes real skill, or takes a bit of fore planning to pull off.  Thats one type of difficult.  <br />
<br />
But where does skill come from?  Practice makes perfect.  Knowing your character, having tried and failed before and learned from it.<br />
<br />
And what is planning, except a time sink?<br />
<br />
There really are no situations that you can call &quot;difficult&quot; in a game that are not overcome by time investments.  You are correct sir:)  But those time investments come in many forms, both directly related to the encounter, and in preparation from the encounter.<br />
<br />
I think what most people really want who say things like &quot;stop being the old grouch saying 'in my day we had to up hill both ways...'&quot; is this:<br />
<br />
They want a game that is based purely on intuition.  Not on aquired skill, not on aquired knowledge.  They want to walk in, fresh off the street, and have the game 'make sense'.  <br />
<br />
Whether you choose to invest your time ahead of time, in planning and skill building, or after the fact, in a corpse run or making up experience due to death... is entirely up to you.  The point is, a time investment is always something tied to a difficult encounter.<br />
<br />
On one hand, we have folks more inclined to fire up an xbox type game, jump in for 30 minutes, have everything 'make sense', get some sense of advancement, and go to bed.<br />
<br />
On another hand, we have folks that read about the zones, talk about the game with friends, plan in game, set times, prepare by trying similar encounters, gear up, level up, then try that one advancement fulfilling encounter.<br />
<br />
It has NOTHING to do with &quot;I had to walk up hill both ways, you should also&quot;.  It has NOTHING to do what you call 'pointless' timesinks.  Its just about the level of realism that makes a game seem engrossing to you.  <br />
<br />
Personally, EQ has felt more and more 'fake' to me.  I don't feel as immersed as I used to, and the majority of that I attribute to the little 'convieniance' factors that are now present.  PoP teleport books, instanced cookie cutter dungeons, maps, graveyard zone, etc....  these detract from what I consider engrossing.  They detract from what I consider roleplaying.  But thats just me. And yes, I can choose to avoid using some of those features from time to time, and I do so.<br />
<br />
I think whats so hard about this whole situation, and why its debated so often, is the 'feeling' that EQ had when it first came out, was, and still is, hard to define.  <br />
<br />
What made EQ feel so engrossing, where now, it seems shallower?  My vote is the combination of all the 'enhancements' like ldon, maps, portal books, etc...  have diluted that sense of realism.  You might disagree with that assesment.  Fair enough.  But I don't think it is fair to label anyone expressing regret about all the &quot;lame&quot; changes that EQ has gone through as someone confusing difficult with 'pain in the arse'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Styantiss Sarnakslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have to say Im impressed with everyones replies. Im not saying that raid content should be cut out, but rather a little for everyone, which is why I brought up Kunark. Lets have a new city, that is not open to all, but at the same time allow for only moderately time consuming faction work to get into the city. No PoK stones to this new contenent, just a boat. Make sure there are many bind points, though. Lets have a new race, make them centaurs! I love centaurs! Make the lands a massive desert, full of forboding and adventure. Something completely new!<br />
<br />
 Also, I wasnt for lessening the death penalty, but rather just eliminate losing a level. Also, maybe if Shadow Rest recieved corpses after only a few hours, that would encourage some real risk taking and adventure.<br />
<br />
 When I was growing up in Kunark the first time, alot of the time when I wanted to explore, I had to do it alone. I went into a zone I wanted to explore and I soloed and looked around. This type of exploring should be rewarded too! Give an xp bonus for solo kills, after all, soloing is much riskier for most classes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Quoting just the bits I mean to address:<br />
<br />
 Look how many people are still coming up the ranks and working on those epic 1.0 quests - I helped a shaman get his hole piece just yesterday and did the cleric epic mob in the burning woods last week. I don't understand why Sony hasn't seen this? <br />
<br />
Other than the Epic 1.5's, I'm struggling to think of a single quest post-Luclin that I can work on without the help of a raid force of other people (ala PoP progression and BiC).<br />
<br />
Something else I'd like to see ..... a new town!! Other than PoK there has been nowhere I can look around for something to do post-luclin, and even then PoK was just full of carbon copies of your home town npc's! LoY, LDoN, GoD, OoW ... nadda. It's just been zone fulls of exp mobs and it gets old, fast.<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah I'd like a whole lot more quests I can do, just something other than exp grinding would be enough to keep my accounts active this time.<br />
<br />
First, people still do the epic 1s for their quality as items relative to the ease of getting them.  You lemme know when you next spend a month working on chanter, paladin, magician, shadowknight epics.  Clerics will ALWAYS be doing theirs, becuase it clicks a 600mana spell with a 30sec recast, mana free and in 10sec.  Shamans will always do theirs, just because it's that damned easy.  Many other classes will also do em because they're precursors to the 1.5s, which are also WAY outta whack, far far too good for what's needed to get em.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, dude, you need to get out more in EQ.  PoP progression was a guild activity, but it was also a guild scale goal!  Notice that there wasn't even a reward for that &quot;quest&quot;, which pegs it as a keying exercise.  Getting access to Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, or Vex Thal weren't &quot;quests&quot; that individuals could do, either.  PoP still included plenty of character- and group-scale quests.  Both The Binden Concerrentia and the Aid Grimel tradeskill quests were pretty great, and entirely doable with one group.  (admittedly, Aid Grimel should have had more of it's intermediate steps before sol ro flag, but whatcha gonna do?)<br />
<br />
BiC was just one of the Gates quests.  And even BiC only requires one raid (Rondo, done frequently as a pick-up thing) to get to the 100hp-level augment!  The rest is one-group work, and spins off a good neck and a great belt as side rewards, not to mention the loot collected along the way, since almost all of the work is done is good exp areas!<br />
<br />
There are lots of other Gates quests.  Most of them start in the -city zone- of Abysmal Sea. (addressing another complaint)<br />
<br />
Omens of War is loaded with quests, too.  Great items, with excellent foci &amp; stats.  The suit of quest armor plus those other pieces would gear a motivated shaman well past Vex Thal level, and set you up to work on looting out the higher end zones of MPG &amp; RSS.  Talk about places to not just exp grind, there's great loot for a goal-oriented hunt.  lol, talk about a quest. #1: gather people #2: get enough stuff for them to camp what you want for you #3: actually get to the mob you want and kill it enough for your item :)  Talking about a week's effort to claim your reward :p  Oh and yes, meanwhile, you'll get really good exp.  damn.<br />
<br />
I don't think you're ever going to see the quests that involve solo farming two green-con bigots in Rathe Mountians again, or spending 5-6 weeks running around in East Wastes while doggie solos walruses behind you.  There were so many complaints about good quests sending people to places they didn't want to go that Sony has &quot;learned it's lesson&quot;, so quests from now on will be in exp areas.  I'd further expect that any quest with a great reward in the future is likely to include at least a small raid encounter as it's climax, in the 12-18 player range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">EQ has always been easy there has never been anything difficult about EQ.<br />
Why oh why do people confuse difficult with &quot;time consuming pain in the ass&quot; ?.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Please name me something that is difficult in EQ that cant be overcome by investing a bit of time.(no youre not allowed to say get Rytan to look at Shaman spells with an open mind.Thats not difficult thats impossible :)).<br />
<br />
Wulfbane<br />
<br />
EQ was not always easy. You want to know easy? Go check out WoW. Now there is an easy (and because of that, boring to me) game. I don't confuse difficult with &quot;time consuming pain in the ass&quot;<br />
<br />
Some people can put more time into the game than others, therefore making it easier for them to complete things which require time to be put in.<br />
<br />
However, time consumption and difficulty are not proportionate to each other in everything in EQ. There are some things that are very easy, but take much time, and some things that are difficult, that take little time.<br />
<br />
EQ today is much easier in all aspects. Time consumption can be applied to many different instances of play, but let's look at three of the bigger parts of Everquest in that respect:<br />
<br />
1. Exp grinding<br />
2. Questing<br />
3. Group or Guild level raids<br />
<br />
Which one would you rather do with your time in EQ? I would say it depends on who the question is put to, but for me, I enjoy raid content and interesting quests over exp grinding.<br />
<br />
Which of the above are easier now compared to when EQ first started.<br />
<br />
1. Definitley easier. Bonus exp zones make exp grinding much easier.<br />
2. Definitley easier. Travel options make questing much easier.<br />
3. Definitley easier. Guild raid tools, Group buffs with long durations make raids much easier, but not always easy.<br />
<br />
Equipment improvements, spells, AA and so on make all three of the above easier, and those are in much greater abundance now than when EQ first started. So yes, EQ is indeed a much easier game now.<br />
<br />
Your &quot;when i were a lad we used to have to walk uphill in 6ft of snow on our hands backwards&quot; comment... <br />
<br />
/shrug. Describe the changes in EQ since March of 1999 how you will, but it is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Oooh, I love centaurs too!<br />
<br />
If they ever started a faerie/pixie or centaur race - I'd re-roll in a second.<br />
<br />
Same here.  <br />
<br />
Or... what about an entire series of zones that are underwater? Full fledged underwater towns, with Siren's as a playable race maybe?  To go on land, you'd need enduring breath hehe:)<br />
<br />
Or, what about an entire zone, like the size of western wastes, but its one huge mountain.  Underneath is a labyrinth of tunnels, and possible a couple cities.  Its a new set of dwarfs, but they are highly evil or something with blue skin like dark elves.  Above ground is the Centuar tribes who live on the mountain and are at war with the evil dwarves.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I think a second piece of EQ's &quot;lost feeling&quot; is the divergance from more traditional fantasy themes.  The whole alien-looking GoD Oow models are kinda lame imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Everquest has become a collection of encounters, loosly tied together by ports and other niceties that make the game faster and easier to progress.<br />
<br />
It used to be &quot;you are in our world now&quot; they should really change the tagling to be &quot;you have died again please insert another quarter to continue&quot;<br />
<br />
A timesink to me has been always a out of game or artificial feeling hinderance to progress. EQ of the current age has gone way over to the Arcady, game style rather than the more immersive, consistant feel of a true RPG. <br />
<br />
Wow might have cartoony graphics, and a style of graphics that lends itself to some jokes or graphic snop sneering. But the game is built around a world once again. As for being easy. Individual fights can be easy yes. But if you are only pulling one at a time and so completly min maxing your risk factor then you only have yourself to blame. try visiting level appropriate instances Like Uldaman In the mid to high 40's Or Deadmines at level 18ish, or Gnomeregan at level 29- 34ish.  Or the scarlet monastary at 35 to 40 ish. <br />
<br />
Easy it isn't when you go after challenging content. It is really simple to min/max your way through WoW if you only care about advancement and not fun or challange. So I guess it is easy that way. But it is pretty damn easy to slam dunk on the 7 foot kiddy court against 10 year olds as well, when you should be on the real courts. <br />
<br />
People who claim WoW is so damn easy are full of themselves. Play the game for entertainment and challange and go to the harder places. Stop ganking the npc's like they were a level 20 when you are level 60 and you might find it has a bit more teeth to it, but that might be a little too diffacult to actually look for places without spoilers or someone holding your damn hands.<br />
<br />
Wow does not have the timesinks that are so immersion destroying like EQ has had for years now. I guess it makes it an easy game to actually have fun 99% of the time rather than waiting for the point when the so called &quot;fun&quot; can start. After enough people are on of course. And the boxxers have gotten the army of clerics up and running and equipped. <br />
<br />
And no I do not hate EQ. I loved it for many years. But somewhere along the way EQ got tired or innovating and entertaining and instead started the pandering and placating. <br />
<br />
I am saddened by what EQ as become. A shadow of it's true glory when the dew was fresh and adventure ruled in the far north of Halas.<br />

<br />
i myself am a WoW convert. i loved eq from the first time i played. i had been playing computer games for years i would buy a game and get sick of it in a week or 2 then i found EQ and got totally sucked into it. it was the game i had been looking for for all them years but never knew it was sitting their on the shelf waiting for me to pick it up. when i first started playing EQ i was laid off , construction is a good job to have if you like to take time off, so i had the time to put into the game. so i took my shaman and soloed or duoed all the way to 55-60 and that imho was the best part of the game because at around 60 i started doing the guild thing and we started doing  pop progression. then all of the sudden the game went from logging on to have fun to ....well work it became a job.<br />
<br />
i still love the idea of EQ but what i found was that after a point you had to make a choice and that was either devote every off hour you are not working or sleeping to the game to get anywhere or be happy with medeocraty. you may ask is WoW any better in the later part of the game and that i can't answer i have only had it a little over a month and dont have one toon over level 20 but i have once again found what it was that sucked me into EQ when i first started playing it. and that is no matter if i have 1 hour or 6 hours to play i can get on and actualy feel like i got something done when i log off. i do not mind something that is hard a game has to be challanging to have a lasting value. and i do not mind something being time consuming where i have a problem is when the time you have to put in has to be all in one chunk. i would rather log on 1 hour a night for 6 nights than be forced to be logged on 6 hours in one night.<br />
<br />
EQ was once a great game for everyone somewhere along the way they lost sight of that and focused on only one aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

An Idea I think would really be great for us Veteran players who do not want to see EQ die. Why not make an Old School server? One where just Kunark &amp; Velious are the only expansions that are activated?<br />
<br />
Of course with how the game is hurting from WoW and EQ2, I doubt sony will be opening up another server for us, in fact I think they talking about consolidating em.<br />
<br />
Also I would like to see Gnolls as a playable race... we have cats already lets bring out the dogs. I came up with 3-4 Pages of information that can be used in creating a Gnoll playable class, just cannot figure out which forum on the Sony site is the correct spot to post them.<br />
<br />
I think if all of us vet players would continue to ask sony for an Old School Server they might, though Sony is a money hungry corp (mass pushing of xpansions) so whatever we decide we prolly gotta make it profitable to sony in some way (Maybe put the free trial people on this server only?)</div></div><hr />

It's not a change people will petition for or beg for, but it would be noticed and those zones would get much more use.<br />
<br />
While some complain about the dumbing down of the game, EQ death penalty even with the graveyards is still much harsher than competitor games, it just makes it not a complete PITA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">TOTALLY hijacking this thread, suck it:<br />
<br />
Playable Gnolls would be far more interesting than fairies &amp; centaurs. They already have a base city in Blackburrow, they just have to add a few vendors.  <br />
<br />
I think the fringe races would be interesting.  Any race with a face and an in-game community would be &quot;fair game&quot; with limited classes, making their cultures more defined, too.  Like Blackburrow Gnolls being warrior/rogue/shaman only, Centaurs being Paladin/Ranger only.  Faeries (*gag*) Enc/Cle.  Brownies War/Dru, HOLGRESH (innate lev ftw) in the classes holgresh already are, mag/wiz.  Othmir are just war &amp; cle atm, but ranger would probably be a fine addition, since they clearly have society members whose whole life is Foraging..  <br />
<br />
Those fringe peoples would fit really nicely in a niche that mmorpg's haven't used yet, the &quot;unlocked&quot; playability that console games have, as opposed to locked content.  Like, if on your account you beat Velious (Vulak, AoW, &amp; Tunare) then you get to make Othimir or Snowfang Gnoll or Coldain or Pirate Gnome (*ARR*) characters.  For Luclin (Seru and AHR), you'd get to make Grimlings or Shissar (little shissar, not full-size) or [those little red aliens in Scarlet Desert].  For Kunark there are Sarnak and Frogloks (not Guktans. old-style, hometown Swamp of No Hope).<br />
<br />
A number of races could also, or alternately, be &quot;opened&quot; via a quest.  Like, you free a prisoner from captivity in Blackburrow (triggered event at the end of the quest so mobs are a little tougher and can't be finished at level eight), and for freeing the prisoner, you get to make a gnoll character, who represents the gnoll you just freed :)  A quest with the Othimir might earn you a devoted follower who leaves the village to apprentice as an adventurer.  You get him as a pet when you finish the quest, but when you zone him off or camp out, you get to create the character that he turns into.  Harder quests for rarer races would start you out at higher level.  There are gnoll pups in Antonica as low as level 1, but there are no Othimir anywhere below level 28.  The lowest level Shissar I could find is level 44.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sony could turn off every server tomorrow and somebody else would pick up the license.  There may not be any new content, but * somebody * will keep the servers chugging along.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't easy. It can be time consuming (Kill X to get Y drops), and by time consuming I mean 45 minutes, but there are no 24 hour camps. The worst thing about WoW right now is server stability and lag.  That is due in no small part to the huge amount of folks playing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ehh personally the worst thing about WoW isn't the server stabilty -- to me such technical issues are inevtiable and no big deal. It's the massive downtime from running in slow motion across unnecessarily big zones (I play a Tauren, in case you want to know exactly what I'm referencing). I'm sorry but I can fully understand people liking WoW but it really does have a lot of artificial built in downtime, more than EQ2 or DAoC IMO.</div></div><hr />

Othmir should be warrior and DRUID, the healer / forager class.  Plus they have a circle in their zone for druids to port back to.<br />
<br />
But as you point out, it would be very hard to be a level 1 in Velious.  <br />
<br />
If your account has a character level 60 or above, you can start another character as a level 30 othmir?<br />

<br />
<br />
Well..Most of the Uber guilds are falling apart as those uber players have gotten bored with broken high end content and many have moved to other games. On my server I have seen the few extremely rooted, high end guilds, fall apart when EQ2 and WoW and Lk2 came out and they have not recovered. <br />
<br />
SOE has forgotten the meaning of the word &quot;fun&quot; and once that concept goes, the game gets very stale. I have been playing for 5 years now, have seen NO marketing on sonys part for EQ nor any real new concepts established since LDoN. The direction EQ is going now with DoN coming, all I see is a rehashing of the 'same old - same old'. Sony needs to seriously look at games like WoW and see why so many are running to it....  go to any gaming store and ask a clerk about EQ or EQ2 and than ask about WoW (if for the rare chance the clerk doesn't immediately respond with something about WoW) and you will see what I am saying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 MMORPGs dont get people once and they are stuck. Most people drift between games. SOE just needs to freshen their perspective and the game, and people will come back. I dont think it will ever reach its high point again, but a stable middle ground surely can be found.<br />
<br />
 I dont think making the game easier would make it better, but some tweaking is needed. Like I said before, there is no reason to lose levels anymore, thats just not conducive to enjoyment. I would also like to see Shadow Rest respawn corpses alot quicker, I think this would allow people to take risks and explore areas they might not otherwise.<br />
<br />
 At the same time, SOE needs to realize that most people are not in uber guilds. Lets make content everyone can use and not save the really good stuff for a select few.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off Sony does have to balance expansions with at least 3 mindsets involved.  1 Raiders, 2 Non-raiders who play a lot, 3 Casuals.<br />
<br />
Since Ldon there have been two expansions Gates of Discord which is definitely for raiders and OOW which is in my opinion for everyone.<br />
<br />
Not much can be said to defend GoD from being for the ubers though a few Non-raiders did make it into KT and Ikkinz.  OOW on the other hand is relativley easy to get a pickup group in (as a slower) for WoS or MPG (I am not high enough level to get them in RS yet).  Also if you want to solo at 65 you can solo Murkgliders in NC with root/rot and have a chance at the very rare off trash drops of Drakescale Shield and a belt which I forget the name of.  On top of that the tier 1 armor is very nice, I got burning affliction 5 boots, and a mana regen 2 regen 2 bracer.  OOW admitedly has some seriously incredible stuff in Anguish that blows away anything we get but it still has some very nice upgrades for casual players.</div></div><hr />

Hmm tell me please how a LVL 65 group who arent Ele equipped (bare in mind GoD was before lvl 70 etc)(assusming non ele as you state &quot;casuals&quot;) are supposed to deal with some of these &quot;trash&quot; mobs ?.<br />
Oh wait you say they dont summon and are rootable so perhaps you were hinting these same people should solo them ?<br />
Maybe now post OoW lvl 70 new spells etc yes but before hmmm.<br />
GoD zones were emminently doable but trials no.<br />

A guild group had tried pre-OOW with pre-elem pre-VT gear.  They beated one sewers trial and continuously farmed sewers expedition.  They don't even have a cleric, just a druid and shaman healing a warrior.  They do died a lot and even eat several non-rezzed deaths a night in the first few tries.  But after a few tries (most whiners will just stop after first or second try), they got the hang of it.<br />

Its up to you to believe it.  But it has been done and can be done.</div></div><hr />

Excellent point. But SoE likes to destroy old content by adding new one they can make money from.<br />
<br />
A better word for &quot;Expansions&quot; would be &quot;Replacements&quot; since every other new expansion completely replace the old zones if you want to advance further.</div></div><hr />

I would have to see the group make-up and gear before I buy this.  Pre-VT, Pre-Elemental, Pre-OOW would mean bazaar/ldon gear right?  You are saying a bazaar gear tank with no cleric was ok with just druid/shaman (btw, this is without the new shaman heal too).  I would have to see the gear of these people to buy that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The sewer trials have different difficulties. And they were adjusted to be easier after GoD was out a few months. I can believe thata good group of bazaar equipped lvl 65s can beat the easier sewer trials. Main problem are the few unslowable stone guys, but I heard that they were changed too and they made them slowable (can anyone confirm this?).<br />
I don't see a bazaar geared group to get into KT though, except when they are very lucky and are fine with wiping numerous times in Tipt and Vexd.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">A dedicated group who had farmed LDON could do GoD up to KT and perhaps even ikkinz1.  By farmed I mean complete set of the 1492 armor.  That armor when fully augmented was between ornate and elemental in quality, and was very good ac (especially for plate).  Heck the AC of the everfrost chain bp is greater then the riftseekers named drop (though I would prefer the riftseekers).  If a regular group had farmed LDON and other 1 group options for gear, and had sufficent AA, they could start doing GoD trials for improvements and after farming some of the lower levels do Tipt (especially if they had a pooka for DPS).  <br />
GoD was PRIMARILY for raiders without a doubt, but hard core non-raiders also got some nice gear. Casuals on the other hand would have been SoL (and I am not talking Luclin here)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">The &quot;hardest&quot; part of flagging for KodTaz is beating Kyv Heartstriker Jhiru, don't you agree?  Mr. Heartstriker dies with zero fuss to three characters, no shenanegans involved.  One or two rangers, one or two chanters.  Don't need gear, don't need healing, just pull, Weaponshield, put pet(s) on.  If you have two enchanters, only one disc is needed. if you have one enchanter, two discs are needed.  Any two war/ber/rog/bard/monk can sub for a ranger.<br />
<br />
There isn't anything to charm once you're in KodTaz, but it's not packed with Kyv Heartstriker Jhirus, now is it? :)<br />
<br />
GoD had some content locked away from unguilded players, specifically Qvic and Txevu.  The large majority of zones were fully available, though.  Perhaps this is an error of perspective?  GoD was quite a small expansion geographically, so even the large % of content that was open seems limiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">GoD was horrible on casual, non-raiding guilds/players.<br />
<br />
Sure it had some content, but I thought it was horrible for them as well it was horrible for the raiders. <br />
<br />
In short, GoD was horrible when released.  It's better now.  The tuning was appropriate and the extra levels help folks out a lot.  <br />
<br />
My group won Tipt our first pass through with mostly VT/ornate type gear.  I guess we're raiders, but certainly at the bottom end of that.  <br />
<br />
Other guild groups didn't fare so well, and lots of folks have failed over and over.  Since then, I've been in about 4 failed attempts.  Haven't tried lately, so I would think the levels and gear would make a big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You won, but people that suck lost, so the content is to blame?  I think you folks are confusing &quot;challenging&quot; with &quot;uber-only&quot;</div></div><hr />

Heh just got to love really insightful posts like this one.<br />
<br />
Did you ever actually do GoD without EP gear ?<br />
<br />
If you think its challenging for Time flagged people how do you think it is for &quot;casual&quot; players ?.<br />

Wulf, no offense, but Tipt and Vxed got solved, and no EP gear was required. Chanter, Ranger, win. Thats it. In Vxed, it was totally possible to sit at the FIRST landing and pull til you reached 50, then have a bard run-song play and just go for it. You could run and hail and die, with the lingering effect of the song. <br />
<br />
As for Tipt, I know a guy that was totally unguilded until he joined my guild. But he had something like 30 successful Tipt runs, because he knew how to win it. Its not the difficulty, its the strategy. Chanter, Ranger, win. Thats all. He was in KT long before many GUILDED people on my sever, including MOST of my guild, and even had a few Ikky 1-group Trials under his belt. Wearing ornate + LDoN stuff, unguilded, with no raid gear at all.<br />
<br />
Too many people were committed to thinking INSIDE the box in Tipt. Tanks wanna tank. Healers wanna heal. DPS wants to DPS. Sorry, THATS what made it &quot;hard&quot;, people wanting to do it &quot;their&quot; way. <br />
<br />
Chanter, ranger, win, everyone else just stand around, not kidding. Sure, shaman can malos, clerics can heal the pet (between pulls), tanks can run up and hit it when its running away, wizards can nuke it at near dead, whatever. Even with the charm changes, still didnt matter. Learn the triggers, learn how to support the pet, and let it win for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDITED NOTE: Not trying to say that Gates (when can we stop reffering to this expansion as GoD, sheesh) was GOOD for the non-raider, it sucked. But hey, guess what, it sucked for mid-level raiders too, VT range people. It was even prety damn sucky for ME, EP flaggged when Gates came out, but lost something like 19 Tipts because my groups refused to think outside the box. <br />
<br />
This guy I mentioned above, hes a shaman, he joined my guild in November wearing his LDoN stuff and his ornate and acouple KT/Tipt items etc, and now buffs about 300 hps more than me. Know why? 5 PG single-group trial items, wearing NO raid level gear whatsoever. That stuff is Quarm+ quality. Has shield, face, range, shoulders, and back items from those trials. And he got them all without picking up more than 1 or 2 &quot;lower end&quot; common raid items, like a bracer from T1. <br />
<br />
Takes effort, takes time, but these things CAN be accomplished if you set your mind to it. But when you already count yourself out because your gear isnt as good as Joe-Raider, well your already beat. Half full Wulfy, half full.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Blazz you sir, are my hero.<br />
<br />
Anyway, problem with centaurs are... mounts. You cant make them always mounted because then what about people who payed 10k+ on theirs? But if they arn't always mounted, how can centaur casters get the mana regen and faster speeds(if you pay for a faster horse that is)?<br />
<br />
I say take another greek mythological being and use Satyrs. Imagine the fun of a Satyr bard.<br />
<br />
Anyway, if they were to make gnolls a playable race it should be the splitpaw gnolls because SK is far enough away from Qeynos. Having the blackburrow golls so close to surefall and qeynos when they are sure to be KoS with wandering guards would just be a bitch for the low levels.</div></div><hr />

Im not saying it was undoable.<br />
Just very akward and not as easy as Brohg makes out.<br />
I still think the Charm method was a workaround by players and was not the way it was meant to be done hence the charm nerf.<br />
And yes i know it sucked for everyone apart from Brohg apparently.<br />

100% agree with you Blazz some of the stuff dropping in MPG Trials is almost criminal.(Though not won anything yet :()<br />
Though in your friends case this is probably more to do with him being a Shaman ie a needed class in MPG.Cant honestly see too many Bazaar geared tanks getting a group in MPG Trials .<br />
Most of the trials ive done the tank runs at around 12-14k HP im not used to grouping with this sort of tank and the diff is amazing.<br />
This is the big difference between Gates (:)) and OoW ive done quite a few MPG Trials pick up groups but you know how many Gates trials pickup groups ive done ?. 1.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yes it does Blazz and this is what i personally love about OoW compared to previous few expansions.<br />
It will take me for example 10 times as long as you to get the same gear (pre Anguish) but I can get it and i DONT have to change my playstyle.<br />
I can still log on for 3-4 hours ever 2-3 days and i know i can (if i want) end up with gear raid equivalent.<br />
OoW has for me personally saved EQ for the above reason.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The story Blazz told is extremely similar to my own.  I flagged while an app to my current, and only ever, guild.  I never looted elemental armor, and only looted my three PoTime items after being done with KodTaz.  When I flagged through Vxed &amp; Tipt, I was wearing a mix of solo quest gear, LDoN 1492 (2 bits), Ornate (just sleeves), and items from pickup raids on Vex Thal (I keyed up w/o a guild) &amp; Seru &amp; BoT (also, keyed w/o guild) towers.<br />
<br />
My profile is http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=272430 , click on the &quot;Before Silent Resurgence&quot; version to see exactly what I was wearing when I flagged through TipT &amp; Vxed.<br />
<br />
Cool true story: on a pickup raid, way before Vxed/Tipt, to get my BoT helm, I tanked Brynju Thunderclap down from 40% myself.  Three clerics let all the tanks die, then two of those clerics died with them, along with a few others (nec, dru, other shm, ranger off the top of my head).  I healed myself for the remainder, with the one surviving cleric backing me up, while a ranger, a monk and a magician finished killing the bastard.  Quite exciting, and very rewarding to win the Cap from that guy :)<br />
<br />
I'm up to MPG one-group face/neck/ear/belt/sec/shoulder now, with the prim banked.  I'm very much looking forward to finishing my set with back &amp; finger &amp; ranged &amp; augment :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right, this I agree with.  Gates sucked on release, and it's just wrong to suggest it was good for non raiders.  I understand it sucked even more for raiders, and so many raiding or part-time raiding guilds just stayed in POP.  Like my VT/elemental raiding guild.  <br />
<br />
It offered some upgrades sure, but it wasn't really playable.  I never saw an expansion that was such a ghost town after its release.  <br />
<br />
I like Tipt.  Vxed is pretty boring, mostly because folks just sit in one spot until the very end.  <br />
<br />
Gates real problem for me is that it's ugly.  The mobs are ugly (and stupid-looking), the zones are ugly (and boring) and the colors are ugly.  It just doesn't look good.  And the lore was totally uninteresting.</div></div><hr />
