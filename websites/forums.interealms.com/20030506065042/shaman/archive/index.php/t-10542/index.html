My pull spot is a ledge on the north wall of the zone, very near the water to the east. Spiders path nearby, but not close enough to aggro, and if you look out to the south/southwest you can see the roamers path nearby. The adds are a problem, but invis and careful pulling will get you far. Haven't tried the larvae as I'm only interested in the goos, good luck :)<br />

I've tried that, and they keep getting 20% of their health back whenever they are in flee mode... happened 5 times then I gave up... and no, they weren't healed, or healing themselves =p...<br />
<br />
Any way I can avoid this?  Good post btw</div></div><hr />

Keep em rooted and follow them if you can if they resist til you can reroot. Some mobs if you let them run away dont go anyplace, Some warp to spawn spot and these warp a bit and get a chunck of health back and come back to eat you. <br />

   I was killing the verti flies solo. Had to learn their running path and see what my safe distance to let them run to was and vary from there (as i followed with pet and me hitting it). Where i was they would run down the wall to a certain spot than turn and go towards the water. IF they get into water have to be in water to root again also. <br />
     Havent killed the tet flies (hunting wise been aggroed by each kind)  so i dont know the spots for that as well but i have killed each kind and they all seem to do the warp get health back trick so keep em sorta close if you can even when running. Ive had them do it when they just get out of what would be aggro range so not always a big range.</div></div><hr />

/cry... I want my epic....</div></div><hr />

Just need to get rid of my fear of being close to a Lightworm, not knowing if it's going to attack or flee ;)<br />
<br />
WOOOT!  I CAN SOLO!!!</div></div><hr />

The named larva that drops the quest pieces for CoD are further back from the fly pulling area. I don’t see a way to single pull these guys. There are allot of rats in the area that always agro when you pull the named larva. You can try going to the back wall but I am sure you will still get adds.</div></div><hr />
