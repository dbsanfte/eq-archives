<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman PVP,<br />
<br />
I tried searching on this 'duel' got useless hits, 'duel guide' got none and 'pvp' is only three chars so I devided to post a request.<br />
<br />
Can someone please link me some info on Shaman PVP, I know a little and know we are damn good but due to a change in gaming style, (as a result of time to play being cut) I have decided some PVP Duels would be fun and would like to get some tips.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
Barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I made a rather long post on shaman vs necro pvp about a year ago. However, since the change of the resists system and the new AA's and spells, that has changed a bit.<br />
<br />
Before anyone can give you any good tips, we'd need to know:<br />
<br />
1) your and your opponents level.<br />
2) the class on your opponent.<br />
3) your gear level (most importantly resists and what instaclicks/potions/toys you have). Magelo would help.<br />
4) if you have any AA's, then which.<br />
<br />
This is too big of a subject to just answer in broad terms.</div></div><hr />

Here is my Magelo :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">your magic resist is too low, you want at least 160 MR..but if you are dueling 65's i suggest at least 200mr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Go fool around with it for a while and then come back with some real questions.  I suggest PvPing in the arena with all comers.  Try two or more at once to get a grip on your skill level.  <br />
With melees, strip their buffs first and then Malicious decay them.  Then see if you can Virulent Paralysis root them, disease slow them, and disease dot the snot outta them.  If you can do that, you can win.  Rangers are a special case, I'd just recommend standing near a wall to avoid arrows.  Melee paladins for the most part, with a potion-derived DS on yourself and Quiescence at all times.  Heal yourself mostly when fighting an SK, and strip his self buffs as much as u can.  Disease slow and let the pet do the work.  Dogdog is our greatest asset vs. most melees.  <br />
I'd recommend keeping the pet spell memmed too so if Fido gets waxed, you can make another one to harrass them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My standard pvp spell line up is:<br />
<br />
1) Blinding Luminance - fast, use for crowd control and because being blind sucks.<br />
2) Malos<br />
3) Turgur's Insects - pvp server so we dont generally fight in the arena.<br />
4) Quiessence<br />
5) Tnarg's Mending<br />
6) Scourge of Nife<br />
7) Blood of Saryn<br />
8) Petrifying Earth<br />
<br />
Always always go poison.  Why? Because you only have to debuff once, and the dots are *way* faster.  Malos will debuff both MR and PR, but not DR.<br />
<br />
Use radiant cure.  Get it.<br />
<br />
Use spiritcall to interrupt casters.  This is handy for a number of reasons - you can kill clerics if they can't heal themselves.  Ditto for paladins.  Casters can't dish damage, etc, etc.  Spiritcall lasts 1 minute so time it well.<br />
<br />
Max damage shield is handy also - DS potion and 2nd chardok ring alone is a big ds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've said it before and I'll say it again...  the game isn't balanced for PvP...   Shammy's aren't near the top of the heap when is comes to this skill. Our DPS are just plain too low...  If you really want PvP, you should move to DAoC or SB, which are specifically balanced for this activity.  Otherwise, you'll always be at a bit of a disadvantage PvP'ing in our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Couldn't be more wrong final.   There's 3 classes that can kill us in high end pvp.  Wizards w/ manaburn, SKs w/ DT, and Necros w/ lifeburn.   <br />
<br />
PvP on EQ &gt; no pvp on EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ is one of the most fun pvp games I've ever played. It combines the 'skill' of quake style reflexes, strategic/tactical thinking and well preparedness. Most of all it allows total freedom of movement, which is more than i can say of some of the competitors that claim to be pvp focused. EQ has the potential to become an extremely good pvp game if the people in charge would sit down and create a server where the spells/gear/resists/ruleset was balanced, and the game was centered around pvp. They got it halfright with SZ, but that's it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">With all the changes.. you could say that with Spirit Call aka &quot;Dogburn&quot; we are right up there with other classes in pvp... pre49 though i have to admit we suck in pvp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>blazzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">shammys have 2 useful spells in pvp, gate and heal, pitty they dont get anyone killed. shammys are only good at pvping people who have crappy gear. if u come up against anyone with uber gear , u get alot of resists even after debuffing. if u wanna pvp, quit the shammy class like i will be doing!!! do some play testing, cast a dot on yourself. u will be surprised  how many resists u get with very little resists. i have had times where i have unloaded 5x full manna on people for no effect on the other person and yes they were debuffed and i used both of my dots. the higher u get in the game the more imune shammys become in  pvp. this is a big problem on SZ as alot of people are quitting the shammy class so they are able to pvp on a pvp server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Special Ed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I always try to land my debuff (malos line) first.  I like to use the blind spell to disorient people and then try to root them.  From there I will use my poison dots and keep them blinded and rooted if possible.  It is nice to slow melles.  One of my favorite tactics is to slow and root casters and then melle them to death.  It really depends on how your spells land.  I dispells help a lot too.  Our instant click sow boots are good if you get dispelled (i would imagine at least, i dont have them.)  Get some pumice for extra dispells.  I am sorta lowbie on my shaman so im not sure how this would help for higher levels.  I do know that a lot of the people i end up fighting are  twinked and buffed.  I like to dump dispells and pumice on them to get rid of that pesky virtue/c3.  Then you have a better chance to kill them and avoid being killed.</div></div><hr />
