<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, am I doing this right? I pull mob with slow back to parked pet.<br />
Summon horse, and chain jbb while the mob hits me. Sometimes I apply DoTs to speed up the fight. I that how you guys solo even near 60? Or what do i need to do differently? I do not attack so i can med on horse while i do jbb thing. Is this right?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>glydor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its not necessarily right or wrong, alot of the time it depends on yer equip and how it works for you and how you like to do it. Post a magelo so we can have some kind of idea of your hp and mana pool. What I would usually do first off is turn of all luclin models (old school better baby) so you dont have to stare at the horse head, and you still run at normal sow speed. That will save you time in having to cast the horse on you while the mob is otw to your position. Just keep pet hasted, and sometimes regen depending on the mob's slowed dps. I would personally not tank the mob and keep it rooted while you jbb. If you can land poison dot without too much aggro use that, otherwise right after you land slow disease dot it root then sic pet, and commence jbb ownage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never owned a JBB so I can't relate on that level. Typical solo fight though is:<br />
<br />
1. Pull with slow or malosini first then slow on incoming, depends on mob's resists.<br />
2. Sick alpha pet on mob and root so I can sit down to med if inside.<br />
3. Let pet build up some aggro and BoN. If root breaks and you get aggro then reapply root. Malosini if not already on high PR mobs.<br />
4. Med while pet and dot kill mob, reapply dot if needed.<br />
5. /yawn and pull another :)<br />
<br />
I also turn off horse and luclin graphics, can't stand them anyway. With no horse graphic you can also duck to interrupt spellcasting easily.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What sort of &quot;high end&quot; are we talking here? I can't efficiently tank the mobs in Tactics when I solo, so I've gotta fall back on Root/Dotting methods.<br />
<br />
I usually pull with Malo, run it back to my camp, then cast: Petrifying Earth, Malosinia, Turgur's, Insid Decay, Breath of Ultor, Epic, Blood of Saryn, re-apply Root. Rinse and repeat the dots and roots until it's dead, Cann5/Torpor/KM as you need to.<br />
<br />
Works well until you encounter one of the mitigating Death Knights that resists one too many roots.<br />
<br />
Pre-60 I'd usually just pull with Turgur's and use the epic + dog to do the damage. Most mobs I could out-regen, or end up taking very little damage in the end. Usually hasted myself and the dog and worked up some melee skills while I was at it, for something to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh forgot to mention that if you do join in to melee with puppy make sure you get on the opposite side so that puppy is hitting the mob from the back. Mobs can't dodge, block or riposte from the back so that gives puppy an extra edge. If you can't get aggro then just root and step in mobs face.</div></div><hr />
