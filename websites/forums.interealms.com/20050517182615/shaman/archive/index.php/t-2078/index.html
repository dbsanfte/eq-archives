<br />
Murphys Laws of War<br />
<br />
Friendly fire - isn't. <br />
Recoilless rifles - aren't. <br />
Suppressive fires - won't. <br />
You are not Superman; Marines and fighter pilots take note. <br />
A sucking chest wound is Nature's way of telling you to slow down. <br />
If it's stupid but it works, it isn't stupid. <br />
Try to look unimportant; the enemy may be low on ammo and not want to waste a bullet on you. <br />
If at first you don't succeed, call in an air strike. <br />
If you are forward of your position, your artillery will fall short. <br />
Never share a foxhole with anyone braver than yourself. <br />
Never go to bed with anyone crazier than yourself. <br />
Never forget that your weapon was made by the lowest bidder. <br />
If your attack is going really well, it's an ambush. <br />
The enemy diversion you're ignoring is their main attack. <br />
The enemy invariably attacks on two occasions: <br />
when they're ready. <br />
No OPLAN ever survives initial contact. <br />
There is no such thing as a perfect plan. <br />
Five second fuses always burn three seconds. <br />
There is no such thing as an atheist in a foxhole. <br />
A retreating enemy is probably just falling back and regrouping.<br />
Or else they're trying to suck you into a serious ambush! <br />
The important things are always simple; the simple are always hard. <br />
The easy way is always mined. <br />
Teamwork is essential; it gives the enemy other people to shoot at. <br />
Don't look conspicuous; it draws fire. For this reason, it is not at all uncommon for aircraft carriers to be known as bomb magnets. <br />
Never draw fire; it irritates everyone around you. <br />
If you are short of everything but the enemy, you are in the combat zone. <br />
When you have secured the area, make sure the enemy knows it too. <br />
Incoming fire has the right of way. <br />
No combat ready unit has ever passed inspection. <br />
No inspection ready unit has ever passed combat. <br />
If the enemy is within range, so are you. <br />
The only thing more accurate than incoming enemy fire is incoming friendly fire. <br />
Things which must be shipped together as a set, aren't. <br />
Things that must work together, can't be carried to the field that way. <br />
Radios will fail as soon as you need fire support. <br />
Radar tends to fail at night and in bad weather, and especially during both.) <br />
Anything you do can get you killed, including nothing. <br />
Make it too tough for the enemy to get in, and you won't be able to get out. <br />
Tracers work both ways. <br />
If you take more than your fair share of objectives, you will get more than your fair share of objectives to take. <br />
When both sides are convinced they're about to lose, they're both right. <br />
Professional soldiers are predictable; the world is full of dangerous amateurs. <br />
Military Intelligence is a contradiction. <br />
Fortify your front; you'll get your rear shot up. <br />
Weather ain't neutral. <br />
If you can't remember, the Claymore is pointed toward you. <br />
Air defense motto: shoot 'em down; sort 'em out on the ground. <br />
'Flies high, it dies; low and slow, it'll go. <br />
The Cavalry doesn't always come to the rescue. <br />
Napalm is an area support weapon. <br />
Mines are equal opportunity weapons. <br />
B-52s are the ultimate close support weapon. <br />
Sniper's motto: reach out and touch someone. <br />
Killing for peace is like screwing for virginity. <br />
The one item you need is always in short supply. <br />
Interchangeable parts aren't. <br />
It's not the one with your name on it; it's the one addressed &quot;to whom it may concern&quot; you've got to think about. <br />
When in doubt, empty your magazine. <br />
The side with the simplest uniforms wins. <br />
Combat will occur on the ground between two adjoining maps. <br />
If the Platoon Sergeant can see you, so can the enemy. <br />
Never stand when you can sit, never sit when you can lie down, never stay awake when you can sleep. <br />
The most dangerous thing in the world is a Second Lieutenant with a map and a compass. <br />
Exceptions prove the rule, and destroy the battle plan. <br />
Everything always works in your HQ, everything always fails in the Colonel's HQ. <br />
The enemy never watches until you make a mistake. <br />
One enemy soldier is never enough, but two is entirely too many. <br />
A clean (and dry) set of BDU's is a magnet for mud and rain. <br />
The worse the weather, the more you are required to be out in it. <br />
Whenever you have plenty of ammo, you never miss. Whenever you are low on ammo, you can't hit the broad side of a barn. <br />
The more a weapon costs, the farther you will have to send it away to be repaired. <br />
The complexity of a weapon is inversely proportional to the IQ of the weapon's operator. <br />
Field experience is something you don't get until just after you need it. <br />
No matter which way you have to march, its always uphill. <br />
If enough data is collected, a board of inquiry can prove anything. <br />
For every action, there is an equal and opposite criticism. (in boot camp) <br />
Air strikes always overshoot the target, artillery always falls short. <br />
When reviewing the radio frequencies that you just wrote down, the most important ones are always illegible. <br />
Those who hesitate under fire usually do not end up KIA or WIA. <br />
The tough part about being an officer is that the troops don't know what they want, but they know for certain what they don't want. <br />
To steal information from a person is called plagiarism. To steal information from the enemy is called gathering intelligence. <br />
The weapon that usually jams when you need it the most is the M60. <br />
The perfect officer for the job will transfer in the day after that billet is filled by someone else. <br />
When you have sufficient supplies &amp; ammo, the enemy takes 2 weeks to attack. When you are low on supplies &amp; ammo the enemy decides to attack that night. <br />
The newest and least experienced soldier will usually win the Medal of Honor. <br />
A Purple Heart just proves that were you smart enough to think of a plan, stupid enough to try it, and lucky enough to survive. <br />
Murphy was a grunt. <br />
Beer Math: 2 beers times 37 men equals 49 cases. <br />
Body count Math: 3 guerrillas plus 1 probable plus 2 pigs equals 37 enemies killed in action. <br />
The bursting radius of a hand grenade is always one foot greater than your jumping range. <br />
All-weather close air support doesn't work in bad weather. <br />
The combat worth of a unit is inversely proportional to the smartness of its outfit and appearance. <br />
The crucial round is a dud. <br />
Every command which can be misunderstood, will be. <br />
There is no such place as a convenient foxhole. <br />
Don't ever be the first, don't ever be the last and don't ever volunteer to do anything. <br />
If your positions are firmly set and you are prepared to take the enemy assault on, he will bypass you. <br />
If your ambush is properly set, the enemy won't walk into it. <br />
If your flank march is going well, the enemy expects you to outflank him. <br />
Density of fire increases proportionally to the curiousness of the target. <br />
Odd objects attract fire - never lurk behind one. <br />
The more stupid the leader is, the more important missions he is ordered to carry out. <br />
The self-importance of a superior is inversely proportional to his position in the hierarchy (as is his deviousness and mischievousness). <br />
There is always a way, and it usually doesn't work. <br />
Success occurs when no one is looking, failure occurs when the General is watching. <br />
The enemy never monitors your radio frequency until you broadcast on an unsecured channel. <br />
Whenever you drop your equipment in a fire-fight, your ammo and grenades always fall the farthest away, and your canteen always lands at your feet. <br />
As soon as you are served hot chow in the field, it rains. <br />
Never tell the Platoon Sergeant you have nothing to do. <br />
The seriousness of a wound (in a fire-fight) is inversely proportional to the distance to any form of cover. <br />
Walking point = sniper bait. <br />
Your bivouac for the night is the spot where you got tired of marching that day. <br />
If only one solution can be found for a field problem, then it is usually a stupid solution. <br />
No battle plan ever survives contact with the enemy. <br />
The most dangerous thing in the combat zone is an officer with a map. <br />
The problem with taking the easy way out is that the enemy has already mined it. <br />
The buddy system is essential to your survival; it gives the enemy somebody else to shoot at. <br />
The further you are in advance of your own positions, the more likely your artillery will shoot short. <br />
If your advance is going well, you are walking into an ambush. <br />
The quartermaster has only two sizes, too large and too small. <br />
If you really need an officer in a hurry, take a nap. <br />
The only time suppressive fire works is when it is used on abandoned positions. <br />
There is nothing more satisfying that having someone take a shot at you, and miss. <br />
Don't be conspicuous. In the combat zone, it draws fire. Out of the combat zone, it draws sergeants.  <br />
All or any of the above combined. <br />
Avoid loud noises, there are few silent killers in a combat zone. <br />
Never screw over a buddy; you'll never know when he could save your life. <br />
Never expect any rations; the only rations that will be on time and won't be short is the ration of ****. <br />
Respect all religions in a combat zone, take no chances on where you may go if killed. <br />
A half filled canteens a beacon for a full loaded enemy weapon. <br />
When in a fire fight, kill as many as you can, the one you miss may not miss tomorrow. <br />
It is a physical impossibility to carry too much ammo. <br />
If you survive an ambush, something's wrong. <br />
General Whoozis' last words (as his aides tried to get him to get his head down): &quot;Oh, don't be silly! They couldn't hit an elephant at this dist- --&quot; <br />
If the you can see the flashes from the enemies' guns in battle, he can see yours too. <br />
Flashlights, lighters and matches don't just illuminate the surrounding area; they illuminate you too. <br />
Just because you have nearly impenetrable body armor and a hard-ass Kevlar helmet, doesn't mean you don't have exposed areas. <br />
There are few times when the enemy can't hear you: When he's dead, you're dead, or both.<br />
Addendum: When he's not there, when you're not there, or both. <br />
Never cover a dead body with your own in hopes of looking like you're one of the casualties. Even using his cadaver is a stretch to avoid being shot &quot;just in case.&quot; <br />
You're only better than your enemy if you kill him first. <br />
Complain about the rations all you want, but just remember; they could very well be your last meal. <br />
Never underestimate the ability of the brass to foul things up. <br />
You have two mortal enemies in combat; the opposing side and your own rear services. <br />
You think the enemy has better artillery support and the enemy thinks yours is better; you're both right. <br />
Three things you will never see in combat; hot chow, hot showers, and an uninterrupted night's sleep. <br />
&quot;Live&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; are mutually exclusive terms.<br />
 Once you are in the fight it is way too late to wonder if this is a good<br />
idea. <br />
NEVER get into a fight without more ammunition that the other guy. <br />
Cover your Buddy, so he can be around to cover for you. <br />
Decisions made by someone over your head will seldom be in your best interest. <br />
Sometimes, being good and lucky still is not enough. <br />
If the rear echelon troops are really happy, the front line troops probably do not have what they need. <br />
If you are wearing body armor they will probably miss that part. <br />
Happiness is a belt fed weapon. <br />
Having all your body parts intact and functioning at the end of the day beats the alternative... <br />
If you are allergic to lead it is best to avoid a war zone. <br />
Hot garrison chow is better than hot C-rations which, in turn, are better than cold C-rations, which are better than no food at all. All of these, however, are preferable to cold rice balls even if they do have little pieces of fish in them. <br />
A free fire zone has nothing to do with economics. <br />
Medals are OK, but having your body and all your friends in one piece at the end of the day is better. <br />
Being shot hurts. <br />
Thousands of Veterans earned medals for bravery every day. A few were even awarded. <br />
There is only one rule in war: When you win, you get to make up the rules. <br />
C-4 can make a dull day fun. <br />
There is no such thing as a fair fight -- only ones where you win or lose. <br />
If you win the battle you are entitled to the spoils. If you lose you don't care. <br />
Nobody cares what you did yesterday or what you are going to do tomorrow. What is important is what you are doing -- NOW -- to solve our problem. <br />
Always make sure someone has a can opener. <br />
Prayer may not help . . . but it can't hurt. <br />
Flying is better than walking. Walking is better than running. Running is better than crawling. All of these, however, are better than extraction by a Med-Evac even if it is, technically, a form of flying. <br />
If everyone does not come home none of the rest of us can ever fully come home either. <br />
Carrying any weapon that you weren't issued (e.g, an AK) in combat is Not A Good Idea!<br />
A combat vet will know the sound of an unfamiliar weapon in an instant and will point and shoot.<br />
Not only that, AKs use green tracers which mean &quot;shoot 'em all and let God sort them out&quot;.<br />
As has been noted, &quot;Friendly fire isn't!&quot;</div></div><hr />
