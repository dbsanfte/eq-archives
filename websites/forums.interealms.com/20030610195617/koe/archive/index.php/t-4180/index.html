<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Craigy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To get &quot;The Key to Veeshan&quot; you need to get 3 *COMPLETED* Medallion's, and Trakanon's Tooth. What I mean by *COMPLETED* is there is 3 *pieces of medallion* to make 1 completed 1.<br />
<br />
First Medallion -<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Medallion of Jarsath -<br />
Run , fly, skip, twirl around in circles, how ever you would like to get there, but get into *Swamp of No Hope*. Run to the loc of *+52, +2935*. There should be a *bag* on the ground, simply pick it up. Walla!!! first *piece of medallion* is done! (If the bag is not there, the bag is 6 to 8 hour repop)<br />
<br />
Next head to Firiona Vie to kill an NPC by the name of an Ancient Jarsath. AJ is low 40's pretty easy for a caster but tough for a melee type to kill cause this NPC is a monk. He is a rare spawn. The best way to get him to spawn is to kill all the drovlogs (cant spell but you get the picture) you run into in the zone. To detect his spawn simply bring a cleric with you and have the cleric sense the dead now and again. AJ is the only undead creature in the zone besides Velk's Pet. Once AJ is killed you have your second PIECE of the medallion.<br />
<br />
The third and final piece can be found on a Bloodgill Marauder in the Lake of Ill Omen. He spawns at the entrance to the underwater ruins in the middle of the lake (under water). He is lvl 40 even. The spawn time is 8 hours or so. When he does spawn simply pull him to the shore and kill him...(much easyer on land) and loot the last PIECE of medallion.<br />
<br />
Your last step is to take all 3 pieces back to an NPC named Xiblin (Gnome holding a shovel) on the chessboard island in Timorous Deep and he will piece the medallion for you to make the Medallion of Jarsath.<br />
WOOT!!!! Your 1/4th done with VP Key!!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The Medallion of Obulus-<br />
<br />
First, go to chardox or find someone in gulid with an extra Burnished Wooden Stave. Once you have a *Burnishing Wooden Stave* run to Warslilks Woods. Find an Iskar named Sselot. He is on a small island north of the zone. He is an Iksar so you may be KoS! If so have a chanter/bard come with you to CHARM him DO NOT !!!!MEZ!! (Lelwen charmed him for me since I was KoS, thanks Lelwen)while charmed simply give him the Stave and in return he gives you a *PIECE of Medallion* if your not KoS simply just walk up and give him the Stave. This NPC is an odd ball, you can blast his butt with dots, dd's, etc and he won't come running after you. So enchanters or bards don't be afraid of being argoed if your charm did resist, he has low mr it seems like too. Charming should not be a problem.<br />
<br />
Second go to the Dreadlands. Go to the loc of +2251, -5142. There will be *a plaguebone skeleton* or the *Rotted Skeleton*.<br />
The *a plaguebone skeleton* is the PH of *Rotted Skeleton*. This guy DOES NOT wonder around, he stays put at that exact location. His repop time is 7 min 57 seconds.  Once you slay him loot the PIECE of medallion.<br />
<br />
Third you must kill an NPC by the name of Pained Soul in Trakanon's Teeth. He is a fixed spawn and spawns near the ramp to Seb. He spawns in the doorway to a broken building. His PH's are a Spectral Champion and another Spectral Keeper that casts dd spells (WEAK ONE's). Keep killing the PH's until the *Pained Soul*. After killing him loot the PIECE of Medallion. I think VI named this guy the Pained Soul, because he's really a pain in the BUTT to get to pop.<br />
<br />
Head to Burning Woods and find an NPC named Slixen Klex. His location is -681.59 -1120.76. He is lvl 50 and is indifferent to both good and evil races. Give him the 3 PIECES of medallion and he pieces them together to form the Medallion of Obulus.<br />
WAHOOOO!! Your 50 % done with VP KEY!!!!!!!!!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
The Medallion of the Kylong-<br />
<br />
The first piece can be obtained via the Niblik's Gem quest in Chardock. You must find a Ruby and a Black Saphire (both i looted off mobs in Seb.) and give both gems to her. Shes kinda far in Chardock so bring a good group with ya. Best way to find her is to print a map of Chardock im not sure of the loc. <br />
<br />
The second piece can be found laying on the ground upstairs in the library of Kaesora. Be careful when you go visible here if you attempt to do it solo as mobs will attack you from downstairs in the library. I recomend a map for this part too make sure you have invis and IVU handy on your treck down to the library.<br />
<br />
The third and final piece can be found on an NPC by the name of Verix Kylox who spawns in Karnor's Castle. Be sure to bring a decent group for this one also.<br />
<br />
After getting the 3 PIECES of the medallion head to Lake of Ill Omen and find an NPC by the name of Professor Akabao in a tower. Give him the 3 PIECES of the medallion and he will piece them together and creat the Medallion of the Kylong.<br />
WOWOWOWOWOWOW! Your ALMOST done!!! WOOOOOOOT!<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Trakanon-<br />
Kill Trakanon and loot *Trakanon's Teeth*. Bring the Medallions of Kylong, Obulus, Jarsath, and Trakanon's Teeth to Emporer Ganak. <br />
<br />
What do ya know, you got your key to VP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
<br />
<br />
