<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering what the best way to raise faction with Skyshrine was so that I could do this quest. I am currently level 44 (almost 45) and would like to do this quest but have not hunted much in Velious, so I am confused about faction issues. I don't mind putting in some time raising the necessary faction, but I'd like to make the best use of my time as possible. Any advice or hints would be greatly appreciated. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you're the right level to hunt Drakkel dire wolves in GD.  This will raise SS faction and lower Kael faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the tip, Gloriana. Now, gotta haul my butt over to GD and start wolf hunting. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Have you checked any CoV mobs for faction Donar? I started out dubious to CoV iirc, was along time ago though.  Gloriana's suggestion is great to as these are good for your level and have the needed faction adjust for you.<br />
<br />
Im having a hard time remembering as it was all so long ago, but Im thinking that alls you need is dubious faction to do the quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Umelia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got my faction by following druid &lt;faction&gt; quad kiters and droping the level 19 AE Disease spell on em. or the level 1 Burst of Flame. of course you could just rum up and poke thier mob for the faction. Ask if you want but no one really mind the help finishing off a mob. Just make it clear your not gonna KS em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want to kill stuff yourself and get a little xp out of it, the GD fort &gt; all, grab a small group and flatten the place, if you want easy faction for little effort or just havent got the resources to do the GD fort for whatever reason, lurk around at the WL/Kael zone and suck the occasional cov faction there, if you see an arena raid forming (The manor just doesnt seem to help much for cov at all) ask politely if you can tag along for the faction hits, if they agree, get burst of flame up and keep your target inline with the MA.<br />
<br />
On a side note, is it me or was the Hammerfal quest reward somewhat tuned?  I did the run 3 times the othernight to see if I could repatch my cov to ally after a few Yeldema etc attempts without resorting to GD, it didnt budge my faction but I did end up with 3 out of 3 bracers =)  Considering it took me a lifetime to get my first bracer I'd say thats either a LOT of luck or a bit of a change =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmmmm... I haven't actually checked any CoV mobs yet to see how they /con, so I'll have to try that. Depending on how that goes, I'll either hunt the wolves or go to GD fort, depending on circumstances. Thanks everyone for your suggestions/information. heh heh I only hope I can get the kind of luck Sebazy had. ;)</div></div><hr />
