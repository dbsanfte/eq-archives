As reported by MMORPG.com. <br />
<br />
SOE announced today from the E3 show that they will soon be introducing price reductions on some of their expansions as well as a new one year plan that will include all 7 expansions for one price. Here is the official press release:<br />
<br />
LOS ANGELES, CA - May 12 2004 - Sony Online Entertainment Inc. (SOE), a worldwide leader in massively multiplayer online gaming, today announced new pricing for its three most recent EverQuest&#65533; expansions. Additionally, EverQuest fans will soon be able to purchase a one year subscription to the game and download all seven current expansions for the low price of $119.95.<br />
<br />
Beginning today, players will be able to purchase the three most recent EverQuest expansions, EverQuest: Legacy of Ykesha&amp;, EverQuest: Lost Dungeons of Norrath and EverQuest: Gates of Discord at newly reduced prices. Ykesha suggested retail price will be $14.99, while Lost Dungeons of Norrath and Gates of Discord will each carry a suggested retail price and digital download price of $19.99. All three products can be purchased either via digital download from Sony Online Entertainment or at retail.<br />
<br />
Sony Online Entertainment has also announced plans to add a new incentive program for all new one year subscriptions to EverQuest. Starting soon, EverQuest players who purchase a full year subscription to the game will be able to download all seven expansions for the game (from the first expansion EverQuest: Ruins of Kunark&#65533;, through the most recently released, EverQuest: Gates of Discord) directly from SOE for no additional cost. Soon, one year subscribers will need only the original EverQuest game to access the thousands of hours of gameplay found within the enormous 3D fantasy world of EverQuest.</div></div><hr />

An added $15 reduction on GoD may actually persuade me to pick up 2 copies of it, but Biggie Sizing my combo at Wendy's is still a close 2nd.<br />
<br />
Sounds pretty desparate to pull people into EQ to replace the many that have left already.  Just doesn't make sense, if they realized that all they had to do was fix the game and quit throwing useless expansions at us we would be happy...for at least a few months anyway.<br />

Exactly what I was thinking.</div></div><hr />

LDoN was preordered as well, and intuition scored again with a great expansion.  I still have not bought Gates, and with today's release from E3, I think I'm doing pretty well with my intuition :)  $20 isn't bad to throw down for it I don't think.</div></div><hr />

... and those who bought Gates 3 months ago for $30 and wasted their money, got screwed by the pooch...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not completely wasted, If you waited till now to buy gates you misseed out on the Alchemy skillup &quot;screw-up&quot; which is now nerfed. But if you havn't bought Gates by now, I'm thinking the reason isn't the price. I'd suggest that by the sounds comming from our high level shaman unless you're done farming Quarm you might not want to bother either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I gave up trying to understand SOE pricing when they gave away a useful n in-game premium to people who bought the packaged version of LoY but not to the folks who downloaded it.  You have to believe that the profits were FAR higher for the downloaded version.   Why would they want to encourage people to buy the packaged version?<br />
<br />
So who is the target for the new downloaded full version?  I have to think that it is us - the current players.  Or previous players renewing their accounts.<br />
<br />
I suspect that there are very few true newbies to EQ any more that were not dragged in by one of the regular players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind this whole reduced pricing, its very smart marketing. People pay for a year, then they can go play whatever the hell they want too, WoW, CoH, who cares, they got the monthy fee's thats all that counts. <br />
<br />
However, the quoted statement bothers me a LOT (not you Tig, the point of it). Maps and bigger bank are worth the 20 bucks, but they SHOULD have been FREE. I mean, come on, 20 bucks for in-game features? What next? Got a Human Monk and wanna see in the dark? Tack an extra 2 bucks a month on for Ultravision!<br />
<br />
Maps and bigger bank w/ shared slots had nothing to do with LoY. They were game enhancments that just HAPPENED to be ready when it shipped, so SOE bundled them in and &quot;sold&quot; LoY w/ &quot;Cool new features&quot;! <br />
<br />
Thats crap, IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't own LoY or GoD = $50 in my pocket.  And never missed anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Free download with a year sub? Hmm....<br />
<br />
12.95 per month X 12 months: $155.40<br />
GoD &amp; LoY = 19.99 + 29.99 = $49.98<br />
Total for me: $205.38<br />
<br />
All that for $120 ?   Might be worth doing...especially if GoD actually turns into a non-abortion.</div></div><hr />

I agree completely.  Sadly, SOE didn't agree and charged us $30 for what was, at the mid 40s, a useful spell, a useful raid spell, a whopping 3 zones that I really cared about because they had to do with the spell quests, frogs as PCs (bastages!), trolls ousted from their homes (BASTAGES!!!), and features that should have been part of the game anyway.  Without the features, LoY had some useful stuff, but for the most part was not worth the money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">. . . but for the most part was not worth the money.<br />
<br />
Well, I wasnt lvl 60 when it came out, so it was awesome for me. I got to get decent XP while camping loot that was fresh and sold VERY well. Some of the loot in Nadox is still halfway decent, Steelwrapped legs and arms, etc etc. There are also a couple fun quests related to these zones, but they arent lvl 65 stuff. Its a great expasion for people under lvl 60 who actually want to PLAY the GAME and not just XP their faces off, farm a million pp and head to the bazaar to shop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wow Blazz, I actually find myself agreeing with you  :)   LoYs only fault was the lack of high-end raid content.  Christ, this expansion was made for Shamans.  Mobs with a gaggle of HPs, but hit like a Gnome.  Hate's Fury does leave a bit to be desired unless you bring a group, but Nadox and Dulaks are a goldmine for people grinding thru their 50s.<br />
<br />
I always thought that GoD was payback for LoY.  If SOE can charge Ubahs for LoY, I guess they felt they could charge casual players for GoD.  Just something to think about anyway.<br />

Best part about Nadox is nothing runs. Nothing. Even the &quot;live&quot; side. Shamans dream. <br />
<br />
LoY is what it is. It was a medium level expansion, with mid-range raid content (couple fun events in Togrins Mines with decent loot, Hates Fury too, even Nadox). In order to attract the high-end players, they HAD to dangle a carrot. In this case, Maps and Bigger bank.<br />
<br />
Gates' biggest problem is that it didnt dangle a carrot to the casual player. Heck it BARELY dangled a carrot to the mid-level 65 Raider people like myself. I have no Gates spells. I havent completed Tipt or Vexd. I am not KT flagged. <br />
<br />
OoW is an appealing expansion to all. I am quite sure it will have PLENTY of casual content. All the casual content that is &quot;missing&quot; from Gates. I have a feeling that is why they are shoving it out the door so fast. I also think that there will be another mini-expansion coming before the end of the year, probably some LDoN thing. If SOE knows ONE THING about EQ, its how to make money with it. Just keep that carrot a LITTLE BIT out of the players reach, and they will pay and pay and pay. I think this, more than anything, was the reason for boxxing up Gates and shipping it out all FUBAR. The highest end people had not only caught the carrot, they were making Carrot Cake, Carrot Stew, and any other thiing you can do with carrots.<br />

OK all you pervs, no comments please!</div></div><hr />

Changing your tune on Gates?  :p Over a month before it launched I was wondering what was the hook for the casual player (e.g. PoK books in PoP).  Months after launch there's still nothing and as an added bonus, my shaman is useless as well, casual or not.<br />
<br />

<br />
What makes you think this?  I haven't read anything about it whatsoever.  Is there a link or something?  And don't point me to the SOE marketing site, the same one that said Gates was for 50 and up and that PoP had 18 playable zones...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The retail game industry is a strange and arcane thing.  I'm sure the reason they offered the premium was to encourage game retailers to carry the product, and to feature it prominently in the store.<br />
<br />
Any industry in which the publishers have to pay to get their products on the shelves and in the advertising circulars is going to be a little weird.  Games are weirder than most.<br />
<br />
My guess is that SOE doesn't expect to make their money on the box, they make most of it on the subscriptions.  So they don't really care which way you get your expansion as long as you get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bought LoY (was already level 65) and regreted it.<br />
Nothing much there for me. <br />
<br />
Held off on Gates until I heard what there was in it<br />
for Shamans. I'm very hapy I haven't bought that <br />
one. <br />
<br />
Whatever this new one is, I won't be buying it until<br />
people start raving about how it addresses our<br />
concerns. <br />
<br />
Yearly subscription? No thanks. I don't know if I'll<br />
still want to be paying to play this game for that<br />
long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Release an ungodly number of expansions and then offer the whole thing for free if you pony up a years worth of money?<br />
<br />
They must be afraid of something.  Then again, maybe my britches are too tight, and I'm being a pessimist.  I guess we'll have to wait and see /shrug</div></div><hr />
