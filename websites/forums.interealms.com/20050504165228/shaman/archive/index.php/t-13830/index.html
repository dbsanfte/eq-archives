This is today's patch message from test supposedly. Pay specific attention to item number 2. All I can say is hell ya. <br />
<br />
May 22nd, 2003 <br />
------------------------- <br />
<br />
- New Camera - We've added a new camera mode to the game. You can only enter it from first person mode. Using the mouse wheel you can zoom the camera out into what is, basically, a chase camera. You can use the mouse wheel to determine the distance of the camera from your character, or to zoom back into first person mode. When in the chase mode, mouselook turns the character and camera together. <br />
<br />
- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster of the DoT as it is done. <br />
<br />
- Pathing Tuning - Fleeing NPCs should now run further away. Previously they would stop running somewhat short of spell range. NPCs will also avoid water whenever possible (except for fish...). Jumping off high cliffs is a less attractive option for NPCs now as well. Please continue to keep your eyes open for pathing issues, we appreciate the help you've given us so far. <br />
<br />
- Summoning Spells - Summoning spells will now work with something on the cursor, but will stop working and warn the player when attempting to cast with 11 items on the cursor. <br />
<br />
- Character Select Crash - Using the arrow keys to try to change the selected character with no characters on the account was causing people to crash out of the game. That's fixed. <br />
<br />
- GMotD - We've fixed a problem with Guild Message of the Day that was causing all the players in the guild to crash under certain circumstances. <br />
<br />
- Newbie Starting Locations - We've modified all locations where new characters start to make them a bit more convenient for the new player. If you start a new character, please take a moment to look around and see if you are in a reasonable starting location (you should be near your guild master) and not someplace odd, like under the world or in Vox's lair. <br />
<br />
- Guild Window: &quot;Last On&quot; Time - The last on time displayed in the guild window was not being properly updated until the first the player zoned. It should be correct all the time now. <br />
<br />
- Pets - Many pets were displaying a square under their name in parenthesis. They won't do that anymore.</div></div><hr />

After playing on test for 5 mins to check out the new spell memming function, I can honestly say this is one of THE most irritating things ever.  I use my mousewheel to scroll in and out of maps and up and down chat windows and stuff.  If you accidentally do it outside of any window you suddenly drop into a 3rd person view and the only thing you can do to get back is hit F9.  Please oh please let there be a way to turn this off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a nerf because as it is now you can only have one summoned item on your cursor (sans Mage summon spells that summon multiple items at once), but it never stops you from casting more. For example to practice my conjuration I summoned black bread after black bread never bothering to put it anywhere. Each black bread basically poofed after another took it's place. With this new 'feature' it won't poof, they will stack under each other until you have 11 under your cursor. At which time you'll have to do something all that black bread before you can summon another. It will slow down the skill up for conjuration unless of course you're going to DoT something. Anyway I think that's what he ment by it being a nerf. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yah the NG frogs . . . certain ones do summon, are sowed, and run to the jail when they get away.  I've lost people there and died that way myself back when i hunted that zone. <br />
<br />
The DoT reporting thing sounds like it needs a filter to turn it off.  I can see that getting extremely annoying when soloing with root/rot, and stacking the 6 DoTs I usually stack.  Curse, Breath, Pox, BoS, Ancient: Scourge of Nife, and Bane.</div></div><hr />

Hmm , if your talking about NG in Seb i have to agree ive never seen a summoning frig there either, i though a mob had to be 55+ to summon anyway. Ive lived in seb many times and camped every inch of it i believe, ive never had a frog summon me in that area.</div></div><hr />

IMO the new camera should have been in since day one. I just wish you could &quot;locK&quot; it so after you get it just the way you like it wouldnt move when you're not in the chat window and use your wheel.</div></div><hr />

Just needs to be 51+<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My ranger always used the firefly globe spell to practice conjuration. It's lore, so you just summon one, place it in inventory, and keep casting. You get the 'duplicate lore items not allowed' message, but you also get skill-ups.</div></div><hr />

The nerf of keypad conjuration practice. <br />
<br />
<br />
Trust me.. This is better than what it has been for the last 3 weeks or so.  Just got done working up conjuration on my cleric last week.  You could only summon ONE item at a time.  If you left it on the cursor and tried to summon another, you would get &quot;you cannot summon an item while you are holding something&quot;.<br />
<br />
At least this way, you can do 11 at a time..  Course I summoned 650 loaves of bread one at a time and dropped them in my inventory before the change.. /sigh<br />
<br />

Tailfang in shar vahl summons, he's level 5.<br />
<br />
The defenders in the hollowshade war summon. They are like 35. <br />
<br />
I'm sure theres more too.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Last week I FINALLY got NG all to myself and killed everything all the way down to the Golem.  Well I pulled the golem at the top of the pyramid and had him down to where he was running away .. straight off the cliff into the water below.  Well I rooted him (kneejerk reaction) and ended up getting summoned just below NG in the water.  I was so mad I just gated out, having only had the camp for 1 cycle :(<br />
<br />
Of course it's completely off-topic but I had to talk about it, I should have just let my pet finish it off arg ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">- Reporting Damage Over Time - Damage over Time (DoT) done to NPCs will now be reported to the caster of the DoT as it is done.<br />
<br />
Is anyone else worried about this?  The last thing I want to see is two extra lines of spam (I usually use Epic and Bane) every six seconds.  Please, someone on test tell me that it only reports the damage when the DoT runs out, and not every tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's every tick.  It's been /feedbacked many times that it needs to be able to be turned off &amp;/or sent to another window to prevent excessive spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">There's a screen shot and log on the necro board. The damage is reported per tick. Since necro's tend to stack more DoT's it's a bit of a spamfest, but still less than melee spam. Several necro's have suggested a single summary line when the spell ends. Although on the positive side the effects of splurt (a progressive DoT) and EA items are being revealed since we have per tick reporting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'm curious to see how much damage our epic does, I'll have to try this out tonight.  I'm surprised that soe didn't think to have a filter put in specifically for this.  Filtering in general needs to be worked on imo.  I don't think it would be overkill to have a filter for just about everything.  Maybe there is already, it might take some mods outside of the game to work...</div></div><hr />

Before luclin the limit on summoning mobs was 51+.<br />
<br />
You are correct though, there are many luclin mobs that summon and are lower then 51.</div></div><hr />

Actually (just 'cause I feel like being pedantic) Kunark has a lvl 40ish Goblin in FM that summons - up on top of one of the mountain peaks where there's a few statues. I bumped into him at 50, he quads for 180ish from memory, and summons.  Put quite a damper on my game that day, although the &quot;run away&quot;, &quot;You have been summoned&quot; messages heading for the DL zone were quite amusing.</div></div><hr />
