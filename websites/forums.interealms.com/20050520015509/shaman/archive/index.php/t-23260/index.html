<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day while waiting for a group one of the tanks asked me what I thought of the Halas meat pies.. I scratched my head, came up with some sort of viable response but honestly I didnt have a clue..Ive never used them on any of my toons..  I dont think Ive ever used anysort of food enhancement.  Ive asked a few folks about them, but where should I put the pies in my inventory slot, should I put them in a pack, do I have to eat them to get the extra stats?  Any info would be welcome..Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You just put them in your food spot as long as it is before anything else. I keep them in a WR bag since there almost 10 stones. THey are pretty cheap I got about 300 of them not too long ago from someone who used them as skill ups for 1pp each.. they average 3-5pp each.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just leave them in your inventory, they have to be the top food in the list.. so if you have a bag of food make sure they are at the top of the bag and you will receive the benefits from it. Its good to keep other food on you as well, eat till you are full that way you wont eat your stat food and waste it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Halas 10 Pound (they actually weigh 7.0 each) Meat Pies are a 226 Baking trivial.<br />
<br />
They add 5 to DEX, STA, and AGI and 30 to Health.  Combine them with a Kaladim Constitutional and you've got about a EH 1.5 Leadership AA for free.<br />
<br />
But yeah, Stat Food + Tribute + Leadership for more hit points, saves, et al.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, so..In my 8 slot inventory say the top left is for food..I put a bag there and fill it up with Halas meat pies, I will then get the benifits?  also if slot one top left if for food, where would I have to put a bag of the Taelosian Black Mountain Mint tea to get the effects of that at the same time?  slots are like this to make it easy for me..<br />
<br />
1.Bag of meat pies.  2. Bag of the tea<br />
3.bag of stuff          4. bag of stuff<br />
5.bag of stuff          6. empty (for the big pick ups)<br />
7.bag of stuff          8. bag of stuff<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that how I should have my inventory set up?  Im not sure If I can reap the rewards of both, but was very curriuos..I could get a +5 to many stats this way...Again, thanks for the help.<br />

<br />
Of the eight slots I have available, yes, the number 2 is the top right slot..its just how I numbered them..So, in order for me to get the full effect of both the pies and the tea, Id have my one food bag set up like this..<br />
Bag -8 slot bag<br />
[halas meat pie(20) [food]<br />
[tea(so)]               [food]<br />
[food]                   [food]<br />
[food]                   [food]<br />
<br />
And that bag would go in my top left slot of my general inventory?  I suppose once i buy them I will be able to check the stats..I hope this works, I have a ranger who could use a Wis and Dex buff...I figue I fill one full bag of this stuff and I should be good to go for a month or so..Im suprised I didnt think of this earlier..Thanks for the help..</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I also got IM3 when I first started working on aa's. I was using a mount all the time and it really made a difference in food consumption. I think the Misty Thicket Picnic (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=9662) has better stats for a casting class, and is only slightly more expensive in bazaar. The best stats on food I've seen is the Bristlebanes Party Platter (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=29781) which is part of the Aid Grimel tradeskilling quest. Unfortunately its nodrop so you have to make your own.<br />
<br />
Here's some cut 'n pastes from EQTraders (http://www.eqtraders.com) on durations of various foods:<br />
<br />
<br />
There are currently 7 different classes of food and drink. Each of the classes has a specific &quot;BASE&quot; RL time if consumed normally. The times can vary during game play based on your character class, race, and if you have a mount.<br />
<br />
The Classes and BASE RL times are (food / drink) ...<br />
Snack / Whistle Wetter - 15 minutes<br />
Meal / Drink - 30 minutes<br />
Hearty / Refreshing - 60 minutes<br />
Banquet / Lasting - 90 minutes<br />
Feast / Flowing - 120 minutes<br />
Enduring / Enduring - 150 minutes<br />
Miraculous / Miraculous - 180 minutes<br />
<br />
Force-feeding (consumption by right clicking on the item to eat or drink), according to Abscor, cuts these times in half.<br />
<br />
Some of the variations (which I have not received confirmation on yet) ...<br />
Halfling race - requires twice as often (ex. meal / drink = 15 minutes)<br />
Monk class - requires half as often (ex. meal / drink = 60 minutes)<br />
Character with a mount present - requires twice as often (ex. meal / drink = 15 minutes)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Back in October, I tested the durations of several foods. Here is a summary of what I posted back then (seems to have been lost /shrug).<br />
<br />
Race and class didn't make a difference. (Vah Shir and Halflings don't eat any faster than humans- although, I never tried a monk. You can't trust that anti-furry-feet propaganda.)<br />
<br />
Activity level made no difference (Someone swimming while encumbered ate as slowly as someone sitting down).<br />
<br />
Zones did make a diffference- the one I found for sure was that drinks where consumed in half the time in Oasis of Marr.<br />
<br />
Not all foods within a category have the same duration- each category seems to be a range, not an exact value.<br />
<br />
Vegetables (Snack) 12 min (4 hr game time)<br />
Vegetable Pie (Meal) 24 min (8 hr game time)<br />
Rations (Meal) 36 min (12 hr game time)<br />
Summoned: Black Bread (Meal) 36 min (12 hr game time)<br />
Iron Ration (Hearty meal) 1 hr<br />
Ohabah Truffles (Miraculous Meal) 2 hr 48 min (2 day 8 hr game time)<br />
Someone noted that muffins (meal) lasted exactly half as long rations<br />
Halas 10 lb meat pie (Miraculous meal) 3 hr 12 min (2 days 16 hr game time)<br />
Misty Thicket Picnic (Miraculous meal) 4 hr 48 min (4 days game time)<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottle of Milk (Drink) 18 min (6 hour game time)<br />
Water Flask (Drink) 36 min (12 hr game time)<br />
Pod of Water (Drink) 38 min (12 hr 40 min game time)<br />
Qeynos Afternoon Tea (Enduring Drink) 3 hr 24 min (2 days 20 hr game time)<br />

<br />
Interesting since I thought one of the Vah Shir racial penalties (besides stinky when wet fur) was an increased (50%) metabolism</div></div><hr />

Seems contradicting  :confused: . If food consumption wasn't changed somewhere between those two statements of course(?).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I always have a stack of MTP's and a stack of Telosian Tea in slots 1 and 2 of my first backpack.  Since I rarely use my mount anymore, it takes me about 2 weeks to run through a stack of them both.  I keep some fishrolls and water on me as well, just in case.<br />
<br />
I never saw the attraction of force feeding yourself.  Its too much of a pain in the ass for me to have to remember to eat some rations every 20 minutes.  Id rather not be bothered with it for 14 days and then drop about 200 plat on new food.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Sorry gus didnt mean to add confusion. For the life of me i couldnt remember if the game took food from bag 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or takes it 1 3, 5, 7 down the left side column. Think when i do use stat food i split it in the same bag was why i wasnt sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It takes food in the same order that it picks up items, so just right-click to pick stuff up or buy from a vendor and see where it goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Seems contradicting  :confused: . If food consumption wasn't changed somewhere between those two statements of course(?).<br />
<br />
You're right, I just grabbed some quotes from eqtraders that seemed relevant. I couldn't find a definitive statement on food consumption and racial/class characteristics, but I guess the relationship between the different levels of food and drink are the same for all races and classes even if the numbers are different.....miraculous meals last longer than snacks for everyone.<br />
<br />
I used to force feed to prevent the stat food and drink from being consumed, now it's too much trouble, so I buy stacks of MTPs and QATs to support my local tradeskiller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Im sooo confused now as to the placement of the food itself... Im pretty sure the food can go in a sack in the top left slot, but in the sack do they go in the top left for food and top right for drink or..Top left for food and the one immediatly below it for drink..Im probably overnuking this, but I noticed that when I put both item in my sack my stats went up, so I guess I did something right.. I even went and gave the same chow to my ranger, hey a plus 10 to dex and wis and str and some stamina is sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yep they dont have to be in a slot put them in a bag. Also pretty sure put your drink in the 3rd bag (2nd one down on left). When i loot stuff my bags fill up that way first up . Per your diagram 1, 3, 5, 7 than down the 2nd column 2, 4, 6, 8. So believe food in 1 and drink in 3 should give you stats.<br />
<br />
Can test if it you want. Put your food in bag 3 with no food in bag 1. Shold see stats. Than put a cheap snack food in your first bag and your stats should go down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">[QUOTE='Shilzah']Bag -8 slot bag<br />
[halas meat pie(20) [food]<br />
[tea(so)] [food]<br />
[food] [food]<br />
[food] [food]<br />
<br />
And that bag would go in my top left slot of my general inventory? QUOTE]<br />
Yes that will work perfectly.  Here's why:<br />
<br />
I'm 99% certain the games works from top to bottom then left to right when it comes to food consumption:<br />
1  5<br />
2  6<br />
3  7<br />
4  8<br />
<br />
This is true both for your inventory slots, and then again for items within containers in those inventory slots.  If you have a 10-slot container it's:<br />
1  6<br />
2  7<br />
3  8<br />
4  9<br />
5  10<br />
<br />
You can put your food and drink anywhere, and you will still get the stat bonuses for it.  You could put it in slots 9 and 10 of a ten slot container that's in your 8th inventory slot, and you would still get the stat boosts.  However, if any other food or drink is ahead (say you forage a root and drop it in a bag in inventory slot 4) you will get the stat boosts of that item instead (which for a root is absolutely nothing).  So if you want to be certain of getting the stat boosts, just put your food and drink in slots 1 and 2 of a bag in inventory slot 1 (it doesn't matter whether the food or drink comes first).<br />
<br />
As others have pointed out, you can save money by buying rations and milk or some other cheap food and drink, putting them in an inventory slot, right-click eating/drinking them until you are full, and then moving them back in to your inventory somewhere behind your stat food.  This way they won't contribute their (non-existant) stat bonuses, but they will prevent you from consuming your expensive stat food.  However, with Halas meat pies selling as cheap as they do now, I don't even bother with force-feeding anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You guys really ought to know the inventory order by now. General inventory slot order is down then across. Container inventory slot order is across then down. Opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Nytmare is right about the Inventory order. But your food/drink does not have to be in any certian slot. You will get the benifits(if any) of the FIRST food and the FIRST drink the game finds in your bags, starting from the top left and going down, then top right and down.<br />
 One thing I was wondering about, why do some people keep whole bags of Food/Drink on hand. You travel through POK/Bazaar at least every couple of RL days, so restocking is easy. I carry 1 or 2 stacks of each food/drink, kept in the top of my top left bag. I find that carrying a bag each of food/water would cut WAY into your loot carrying ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I carrier one bag of food and one bag of drink at all times.  I normally don't go in the bazaar at all.  I might swing through there 1 time every couple weeks.  As far as the loot carrying ability I never run out of room.  If I do a collection in Ldon the only thing I will loot is the collection pieces, high value drops, and named drops.  If someone else wants to loot the other stuff so be it but to me its really not worth the effort then again alot of groups don't let me be ML.  With the named drops I usualy turn that in for tribute points so no selling in the bazaar for that either.  If your worried about weight there are bags for that.  At 5.5k a bag you can buy leatherfoot sacks that are 10slot giant 100% weight reduction and not lore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It's easy; just take any one bag, and put stat food in the top left column and stat drink in the top right. Then put crap food to force (if you have the patience for that) under the stat food, and ditto for the crap drink. Just be careful if you loot any food or drink that it's placed below the stat stuff.</div></div><hr />
