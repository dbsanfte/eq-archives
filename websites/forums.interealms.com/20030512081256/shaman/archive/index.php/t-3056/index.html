<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bustyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Help!<br />
<br />
I come from a mid-sized 50+ guild.  The officers have decided that one of the next things for us to do is Halls of Testing.  I am the only shaman that comes to all raids, and I'm level 60.  I don't have malo yet..... And seeing as it sold for 82k last night (the only copy I have seen for sale in months) I don't see myself getting it anytime soon.<br />
<br />
What I need to know is this... Is it even possible to slow stuff in HoT without Malo?  I have talked to some people from other guilds that have gone, and they all tell me slow is key, and that they thought malo was needed, but as they weren't shaman, they weren't sure.  The best debuffing I will get would be Tash and Occlude.  Is there any chance slow will land?  Or after a couple resists am I just gonna get crushed and take the whole raid down with me?  ;)  I need to tell the other officers what to expect if we try it without malo, and without slow (if it won't land without malo).<br />
<br />
Anyone who has been there, please tell me your experiences.  Even if you have malo, how easy do they slow?  I would greatly appreciate it!  I'm very stressed out that the whole guild is waiting on me and one spell so we can go on this raid.  I would love to hear that I will be able to slow them anyway, but if not I need to know before we go sacrificing all my friends.  :)  THANKS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I can't tell you from a shaman's perspective as mine is only 53 right now, but my guild has been doing HoT for a while now and I think it would be extremely hard without malo/mala from our mages/shm.  The only other thing you might wanna try is bard tash + enc tash + OOS and then malosini, but I don't know what kind of mage power or even just other shm power (not 0, but 58+ with malosini) to try and debuff.  Another option might be Plague of Insects.  It's only 25% slow, but better than nothing to start with while ppl are debuffing.  Other than that, go for it, you never know how well you're gonna do till you try.  The other thing you guys might wanna try to do is score a couple Kunark dragons if you can to try and get malo...might even land a copy of avatar or torpor (don't know if you need or not, but they can't hurt ;) ) or maybe try doing Emp Chottal in OS, guild crypt groups for guild funds can be very productive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bustyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh yeah maybe I should clarify classes... we have a 56 mage so no Mala, we have a 55 chanter so whatever tash they have, and we have a 59 bard for Occlusion.  There is one 58 shaman hydra who occasionally comes on raids.  Other than him, I am the only shaman.  We have killed a few dragons in WW, but even then I think I only landed slow on 2 of 7 or 8.  Never got Malosini to land.  <br />
<br />
PS yes I need torpor and avatar too... and several 58 and 59 spells also.  Yay for shaman spell drops!  ;)  I guess since I have focus and group focus they keep me around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carthage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">at 60 i was able to slow some mobs without malo (did have mala and a 60 chanter) but it took me, on average, about 3 tries per successful slow... <br />
Malo seems to be key here. Once a shaman with it arrived everything became much easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haggus of Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am in tha same boat you are in (and on the same server).  I am level 60 and do not have Malo yet.  With the way my bank is now it would have been very tough to compete with 82k.<br />
<br />
To answer your question...<br />
<br />
I was not able to slow the HoT mobs with Turgur's until we had a mage with Mala attend our raids.  With Mala, Tash and OOS, slows usually landed first cast.  <br />
<br />
Without Mala, I am able to land PoI (after ID) on the wurms and some of the drakes but never Turgurs.  <br />
<br />
The number of mobs you can kill in a session in HoT increases a ton once you get the Malx caster.  Not only because the clerics spend less mana after slow has landed, but also because the nukers spells are landing for full damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haggus of Saryrn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In addition, get your enchanter to level 57.  New tash spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hail,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information presented here.<br />
I'm not YET in this position, but it is looming on the horizon. :p<br />
<br />
I'm the ONLY 50+ shaman in my guild (at 54 now), and my guildleader wants to start trying HoT soon.  So I'll be solo-grinding to 55 as fast as I can.  (I figure 1-2 week's worth of solid effort, as I don't have as much time to devote as I'd like, and I'm also the guild's premier potter, and everyone is screaming for POTC parts...)<br />
<br />
We aren't a large guild, but our tactics are fairly good imo, and we have some solid friends and allies that we join forces with when needed.  We regularly do 1-2 group Fear/Hate raids with good success, farming BD's and armour.  HoT is a whole other level of difficulty I'm sure though...<br />
<br />
We have 2 56 mages, one 60 ench (ahhh, KEI! :D), and another 51 ench that play regularly.<br />
<br />
Is there any hope for us with me at 55 slowing in HoT?<br />
<br />
All comments appreciated,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Read up....<br />
<br />
No malo/mala, no slow.<br />
<br />
Malo/a + tash is the minimum debuff for some mobs. Even then it can take a couple of casts. Mal/o + tash + occlusion is recommended.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you are level 60, and you have an enchanter tashing and you manage to get malosini to land it is possible to get slow to land (i have done it before i got my malo spell). I would not recomend it though. If you find yourself in that position concentrate on casting malosini after the chanter calls tash. If you get malosini to land then go ahead and try to slow. If you cant get malosini to land don't bother to try to slow. Malosini overwrites malo so if you do get malosini to land you have just as much chance of landing that slow then you would have if malo/malosini was cast. Oh and shimmering drakes can only be disease slowed (plague of insects).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I was 56 when we started going to HoT.  We just recently finished and are now slaughtering dragons :)<br />
<br />
Our usual tactic was to have the puller bring it in and the MT start gaining agro.  After agro is established, raid leader calls in melee.  The enchanter cast Recant Magic (I think) 3 times and then calls for Malx.  She then tashes, mage/shaman mala/malo, and bard OoS.  I usually tried 2 to 3 times to get Malosini to stick before trying to slow...mage can help with that too.  I, and the enchanter, just keep trying to slow until it lands. <br />
<br />
My advice to go heavy exp whenever you are not in HoT.  Level &gt;&gt;&gt; all.<br />
<br />
Oh, and make sure you have resist gear.  Fire and Cold.  You can hide behind a corner to avoid most of the AE, but while you are casting on the mob you have to have line of sight...that means you can be hit by AE.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">With Tash and OOS in, you stand a good chance of landing Malosini... (If I had to quantify &quot;good chance&quot; -- maybe 50%?). If you land malosini, you can land slow.<br />
<br />
You can chain cast Malosini without getting aggro, from what I've noticed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bustyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ok Chulain I'll keep exping.... but my bar is full 60... when am I gonna ding 61?  ;)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice all.  I'm hoping we can wait for mala/malo caster before we try, if not I have a couple things to try.  I appreciate you all taking the time to answer.  I feel like a total newb at the higher end mobs.  But thankfully our guild is learning together.<br />
<br />
When they finally make me go, I'll let you know how it turns out.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hehe, oops :)  After reading your post and the replies, for some reason I thought you were 55...sorry about that.<br />
<br />
I was there at 60 without Malo, though we had a mage with Mala.  Same thing still applies though...try Malosini a few times first, then just go for it.  If the mob got under 1/3 health and slow hadn't landed, I just gave up and started healing (if I still had any mana).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Best MR debuffing is:<br />
Malo/Mala + Tash (both unresistable, and stack, order not important)<br />
OOS (unresistable bard song)<br />
Bard, weilding tash stick/orb and procing (bard procs will stack)<br />
Bard, weilding the other tash stick/orb and procing (order matters here, must be done after first one, and I don't recall which is which)<br />
Malosini (overwrites Malo and Mala, is better, but often need Malo or Mala to be able to land Malosini)<br />
<br />
At this point, MR is reduced to super low levels, and slow will likely land fairly easily.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a 60 shaman or mage, you need your bard to do OOS, chanter Tash, and try to have your bard weild a tash stick and land a proc.  Then chain Malosini til it lands (remember that mages have Malosini also), then try to slow.  If you subscribe to one of the superstition theories (charisma or wisdom affects success), get buffed.<br />
<br />
I was in ToV West before level 60, and even with Malo in (from someone else, of course), I couldn't land slow more than 20% of the time.  Level matters a ton for resists, and the mobs in HoT are going to be significantly higher than you, on average.<br />
<br />
For the shaman, level 60 is the best damned upgrade in the game.  Even without Malo, your resist rate will drop a ton just by getting the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>brett_sc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&quot;I have talked to some people from other guilds that have gone, and they all tell me slow is key....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Is there any chance slow will land? Or after a couple resists am I just gonna get crushed and take the whole raid down with me?&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
My old guild didnt have a 55+ shaman, and until i joined, they didnt have a warrior that played consistantly.<br />
<br />
Every raid we did we had an SK tank (so no defensive), and only had a shaman maybe 1 in 10 raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Depending on your number of healers and mana regen, you'll kill a bit slower, and if things go bad you'd be more likely to wipe (unslowed add or mob attacking casters is a lot worse than if they were slowed), but slow being necessary? Nope.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about getting agro and causing problems, just make sure you stick near the MA while trying to slow, then if you get agro, the mob isnt going to move much. Or just use an SK. The ONLY person who could get agro from out SK was a 60 ranger, and he'd only have agro for 2-3 seconds, then he'd need a rez :p<br />
<br />
There is absolutely NO reason to wait on Malo before doing HoT.</div></div><hr />

Its possible without it, but nasty and slow going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>zooilogical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've spent some time in HoT , almost have boots of silent striding now, but anyways I can only tell ya how I do it. Generally I'm grouped with the other shamans if there are any, basically I will malo mob upon engagement, the chanter has orders to tash after malo, malo is a longer cast , gives MA time to establish agro, after its tashed if it is red con I will apply malosini before slowing , otherwise if its yellow or white I will apply slow promply. Slowing mobs quickly is key to success in 99 percent of high end encounters. With this strat have been able to fight 4 drake/racnar/wyvern type mobs at the same time with 3 groups and have no fatalities. Only things that won't take a Turgurs are of course the gross druid drakes, Glimmer and Shimmer drakes, Plague of Insects does work on these tho. Dozekar the Cursed is pretty easy to slow also , we usually send in a ranger to weaponshield while we tash malo and slow , and then the tanks charge. Even tho he quads for 900s once he's slowed I usualy don't die.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Went to HoT today for the first time. Level 58 shaman. Had 60 Mage and Chanter on the raid. <br />
<br />
After Tash and Mala I would go stand under the big wurm ones and chain cast Malosini until I was OOM or it landed then Turgur's. This usually worked but sometimes I asked the chanter to slow instead. The mage left and that was the end of my slowing, I couldnt land a malosini and couldnt land a slow, tried the disease one a couple of times (it does work) and then that was end of the raid. Only one wipeout, first pull :)</div></div><hr />

As such your guilds should be looking to get to the point which they can field a shaman with malo for any event the guild performs.<br />

/wave chu - pity the zone dropped for the sont bash :/<br />

Kland's a big softie really - you can kill him without slow, wizzies.. and it's not that hard work..</div></div><hr />

This is the easiest camp to get this spell. Though a very boring camp, just keep killing Guardians. One good group can take them down if slowed. Actually before the cleric arrived Myself (60 shammy), 60 Warrior and a 56 Monk took down one a couple of weeks ago that popped on us. What a frickin rush. Since getting Malo I haven't been to HoT, but can't wait to go now. I was able to slow mobs in HoT without it, but lots of resists. Still can't slow the end Mob in the Kael chanter house, but now I can Malo him and land cripple. =P<br />
<br />
Well, back to the Guardians, cuz I know one of those bad boys has my damn Torpor spell. Come on Torpor DROP now. Once I get torpor it's off to WW to solo dragons. :)<br />

<br />
Hmmm... maybe I should ask this on a bard board but here goes...<br />
<br />
I thought one tash would overwrite another if it was more of a debuff, but I guess that's not correct.  Can the Journeyman's Walking Stick still have stack with chanter tash no matter what class procs it?  If so, it might pay to give the Jstick to a class that can use that has Double Attack to get it proc'd faster?  Orb of Tishan I can see saying bard for, since only bards and robes can use that one... but a lot of classes can swing a Jstick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ziorina1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The tash proc of a Journeyman's Walking Stick will only stack with enchanter cast tash if it is a bard that procs it.  It has to do with the screwed up coding for bards -- their songs are coded to stack with those from any class, and procs are treated the same way.<br />
<br />
Along the same lines, maximizing damage shields involves bards stacking some extra DSes on top of mage/druid and shaman (potion) ones (in addition to the song-based damage shields).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Thanks Z.  I have a 51 bard that I raid with here and there so I'm familiar with the DS stacking.  The tash stacking is new to me... guess I'm a n00b. :)<br />
<br />
Appreciate the info.  Can't help thinking it's a bug that they'd fix if they could, but bard coding so fubar they probably won't bother. ;)</div></div><hr />
