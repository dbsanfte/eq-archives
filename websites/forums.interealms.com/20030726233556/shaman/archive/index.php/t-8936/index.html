<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nebmai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, on good ol' Prexus, it's nearly impossible to get the standard XP camps at the hours I play.  Here's the places that aren't available:<br />
<br />
1)  HHK<br />
2)  Seafuries<br />
3)  IG's<br />
4)  CoM Temple<br />
<br />
I've tried the following zones, but they weren't good for me for various reasons:<br />
1)  Scarlet Desert (too many HP's on mobs)<br />
2)  BW (heavily camped on my server)<br />
3)  The Hole (Mobs were too magic resistant)<br />
<br />
I'm a level 50 Troll Shaman,  have JBB, no epic, no horse.  Are there any other suggestions for places to go?  I've scoured the boards, and so far the only other recommendation I've seen is Neriak 3rd gate--but those dissappeared after the caster changes a few months back.  Please advise!  Looking for XP, loot could matter less.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try soloing ghoul lord's room in Lower Guk it is possible, but I am not sure until you get to 51 and get new slow/root.  Experience is good and lord drops mask to help you get your wood elf mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A couple options...<br />
<br />
Echo caverns can still be good experiance at 50 in the Taskmaster Room (both the outer room and where the TM actually spawns).  The TM has insane poison and disease resists  so no dots, but with dogdog you can still probably solo it.  If not, any damage partner should work.<br />
<br />
I solo'd through 50 on the gnomes in Echo.  After zoning in from SH, the first tunnel on the right leads to the Gnomes of Above and Below.  At 50 you can single pull the guards in the front with slow.  Buff dogdgo with HoS, chloro and alacrity and he can tank them if you don't feel like it.  With dogdog damage all I needed to use was Venom of the Snake, i didn't even need the 49 dots.  After the first two, go up and to the left after the first room are 2 more guards near a blanket that hangs from the ceiling.  Pull them the same way.  Don't pull from inside the backmost room with the kings because you don't always get singles.  Polyanna is a cleric and very annoying, the Kings are pretty darn tough and one is unrootable.  In the first room around the fire you can single pull the &quot;Guildmaster&quot; (don't remember the rest of the name) from inside the little tent with slow.  He is often buffed with a damage shield from the others around the fire tho (I never bothered with them).<br />
<br />
I got about 1 blue per cycle of those 5 mobs, they have a 20min spawn iirc.  After splitting them up it's not a long wait between spawns.  They don't drop items but up to 7pp in change.<br />
<br />
One warning if you wanted to do this you only lose faction with those gnomes in Echom but sometimes zoning into Echo the kings are by the zonein.  So if you kill these to the point where you become KOS to them, make a habit of zoning into Echo invis.  The kings when someone pulls them and then runs to zone, will sit at zone (literally they sit down at the zoneline) for hours.  And they hit very hard.  I tried to take them together, rooting one (luckily rooted the one who CAN be rooted) but the other was still pretty tough with the 51 slow and dogdog.  With canni1 i wasn't able to get mana back fast enough to keep pilling on the dots after they wore off and keep the other rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Talsondar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heya..Prexus here too!<br />
<br />
Agreed on the tough to get spots, not sure what time you play but during my hours of 9-12pm est or so, I run into the same problems.<br />
<br />
At 50 I rotated between BW Giant fort and DLs and getting CoM Temple area and U turns when they were available.  DLs is actually not a bad spot solo for 50, plenty of blue left to pull to your pet off the east wall. Never went back after 50 so i can't comment beyond that.<br />
<br />
Also, in BW there is a real nice clearing I leveled through 51 at without ever seeing a soul.  As you zone into BW from DLs head north until you come out into a clearing.  From there head due east, you will run through some trees and come to a tower with 3 undead inside. Outside of the tower is a wide open area of plains protected on the South by a large hill.  Plenty of roamers and as long as you are somewhat attentive, very few adds.<br />
<br />
I have spent much of 51-53 in BW getting the giant fort when I can and hunting the immediate area of the giant fort when too many droodz and god forbid, a swarm kiting bard are present.  Still real good exp at 53 though I am grouping a bit more as of late.  Never at a loss for a MoB if you move just a bit away from the fort.<br />
<br />
If ya want me to take a run over to BW with ya and show you the spots I had great success hunting at just give me a shout in game, we can hook up.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Some more info on gnomes, this is pretty much what I did at 51.<br />
First off if you have jbb, pretty much single pull the first 2 groupings of guards, you can solo pull these. Slow, dogdog, jbb if you have, if not ebolt, vos, whatever floats your boat, Rinse repeat, then when you get done with the first 2 groupings of guards go under the curtain to where the king's spawns.  First pull inside the door is Harold the Herold, conned light blue every time at 51.  Then the next pull is Court Jester,  cannot be dotted, rogue mob.  Then you will see 4 mobs, 2 Royal Guardians, 2 Kings.  Above cannot be rooted, Below can.  So what I would do is Instill Below, run out into main hallway where I pulled all the rest.  Usually Below doesnt come, slow above who hits in upper 120's, dot jbb if you have, and go back and below should aggro, finish him off.  By this time you should have respawn on the front guards kill them off and when you go thru the cycle again you can single pull the royal guardians without the kings there.  Another solution to getting the kings out of the way is train the to the deep, they sit down when you zone, and they will be out of your way for a day or two.  Good aaxp/exp at 51, but most turn light blue at 52 so enjoy while you can.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's really surprising that CoM is camped that much on your server. On Karana which almost all camps are taken 24/7 I still had no problem in CoM, was almost always empty when I was in there.<br />
<br />
That's sad to hear because CoM absolutely rocks for XP from 50-54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I spent some from 50 and 51 in Neriak Commons.  I went to the Blind Fish and made dogdog and buffed him.  Them pulled guards, starting with the bank guard and then working my way to the guards at the zone ins.  the most annoying part was when the guard wandered a little too close to the caster guild one time.  I got deep fried before I could get a gate off!<br />
<br />
Pretty good exp at 50 and 51 but the best part is the money.  The guards always drop a sword that sells for 10 plat, and a shield that goes for a few.  Add in the assorted change from each kill (from 1 to 6 plat each) and each kill I could net at least 15 plat.  (A note....bring a chanter friend with you to make selling easier.  You can sell to the merchant in the blind fish using Illusion and Alliance.  Makes it a lot more fun).  Respawn is pretty short (5 to 10 minutes I think) and there are about 12 spawns to pull from.  Only rarely will you get doubles, and I was killing them in about a minute each.  These guys seemed pretty resistant.  They resisted my slow a fre times, so I started Insideuos Decay'ing them before the slow.  They also didnt seem too affected by my JBB as I got a lot of partials and at least one full resist per pull. (Bastards!)<br />
<br />
Of course, as a barbarian, I dont care if I lose faction with some inkies.  Trolls and Ogres might want to think twice about it if they care about that faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey Thorzion, that sounds like a pretty nice way to make money. ;) Could you by any chance show me on a map where these guards are? I know my way around neriak pretty well(First character was a dark elf who couldn't find his way out of neriak heh.) but I'm a barbarian as well and I really don't want to get killed. I'm only 7% into 54 atm so I don't want to lose the level. :)<br />
<br />
I also heard of people pulling the ones on the bridge just after the priest of discord. I saw a bunch of dark elves a while back in the two rooms on either side of the entrance to the bridge from the PoD. Would these guys aggro on me when I pull? Could I pull from that room? Hehe.<br />
<br />
Trying to figure out how much money I'd make per 12 spawns. They always drop a 10p sword right? So instead of having any variables I'll just say 10p a kill. 10p x 12 kills=120p if I clear all spawns. Sooo I guess if they have a 5 minute spawn... 60 mins/5 mins=12. 120p x 12=1440p. WOW. lol I didn't expect it to be that much. ;) Now for the 10 minutes. 60 mins/10 mins=6. 120p x 6=720p. Still not bad.<br />
<br />
Is my math correct or do I suck at it? :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, I think I may have just found my new farming spot! ;)<br />
<br />
(btw, I think I forgot to add in the time it takes to get to the next guard and kill him so the figures are probably off.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bandits in Jaggedpine<br />
Seachests in Cobalt Scar<br />
Wandering mobs in Trakanon's Teeth and Burning Woods (There's more than the giant fort out there ;)  )<br />
Glacier Yetis in Dreadlands (Did these to 51, myself)<br />
<br />
Also, there's a few nice Luclin selections. Scarlet Desert should be no problem near the Twilight Sea zone. EBolt, Plague, and Project Alpha can take down every mob in the zone except for nameds. Stonegrabbers in Dawnshroud are decent, if you can stand the place's LOIO feel. If you like getting adds (Hey, some people do...), Mons Letalis is good. <br />
<br />
Also, the Hole is good for exp, except for one problem - hard to single pull, and damn near impossible if you have Goner out. Those elementals don't hit hard, but they do hit fast, for a decent amount. And like Krug said... Lower Guk is still good at 50. The Frenzy room is a nice one, for sure.<br />
<br />
And finally, for grouping at 50... I know everyone hates to hear it, but Karnors is good. It's so easy, even with total twits in your group. You could also likely trio (or duo, if you have a good tank or kiter) the Toilers and Goranga in Maiden's Eye. Just watch the hell out for those Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not intentionally bein picky or anything, but to the guy who said that he started to cast insiduous decay on a mob because they were resisting slow...Why? insiduous decay debuffs disease.  Slow is a magic spell. I think a lot of confusion is caused because you can remove slow by casting cure disease. But Verant just put this in so that you can remove it from one of your group members without having to cast Annul magic or similar and remobe Aegolism from them or some other Uber, costing 50 pp at a time spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">but for some reason slow is still affected by affliction efficiency..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wsbsteven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Burning Woods isn't camp much on Xev except for the fort.  I solo around the fort but not the giants.  I took out a wurm that was hitting me for 147 at lvl 49, too bad he left me oom, 20% life and no more pet after it was over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thats because slow is an affliction, doesn't meant that it's a disease though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Do the X'lottals in Neriak 3rd Gate once you get Turgurs. It isn't as nice as HHK but still pretty nice. There are a couple guides to soloing there on the Mage web site. The area is across the water on the bridge. You can kill the 2 X'Lottals who are really weak, but nuke, then med up and kill the guard out on the other bridge. But watch out. He resists a lot of spells. Need to debuff him then slow him to live. Almost died once or twice to guards resisting. Oh, and some HT also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did 51-54 in Mons Letalis. It's a beautiful zone, never camped, nice money. (Superb and Flawless hides sell for a lot, plus iron oxide and fists of rock, and high quality hides...)<br />
<br />
I posted a bit on it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Mons was good to me, no experience modifier but the cash was good and it's just NEVER camped.  I went there at 51, at 53 there's alot of light blue to me so I've moved to the Hole.  City of Mist was great experience at 51 and 52 as well, go to the goo house and pull from there.  Plus you get your reports for the epic.  The only thing is you have to fight your way past a mess of greens to get there, since like half are undead and half not.<br />
<br />
I did DL at 50, lots of blue left and if you can find a monk to duo with the exp just flies up.  I know everyone has bad things to say about that zone but I think it's great.<br />
<br />
So Dreadlands -&gt; Mons or CoMist -&gt; The Hole</div></div><hr />
