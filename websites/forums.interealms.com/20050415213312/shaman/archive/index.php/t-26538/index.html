What is this?<br />
<br />
Lvl 49.  Cleric and Druid seem to have matching ones also.  <br />

Assuming this is part of phase 2 of the class balancing?  I just hope we never get a complete heal hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My guess is that they are placeholders for the next step of the class revision. Setting at level 39 initially kind of looks like CH is being reviewed though, probably a minor CH and a major CH for each priest class. Perhaps with the distinction between the classes coming from the types of fast/group/HoT heals they have available.<br />
<br />
There are a bunch of no-class spells with the same names as low to mid level nukes on that days update page too. Those are probably to replace the nukes that were used as effects on gear, since the damage done by many of them have been increased or decreased. For example conflagration has been increased from 622 to 900. It's used as an effect on that ranger weapon from HS (also the fabled version as well), so the &quot;new&quot; nuke is probably a special one specifically for the weapon. Likewise winter's roar has been changed, and they will probably want the shaman bracer to be nuking what it allways was.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We already have a minor CH. Its in the back of my spell book next to my Disease DOTs (even though its pretty efficient! BWHAHAHAH)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Possibly related to one of the Veteran Awards or maybe even to the new healing potions that are supposed to hit the game.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They have classes attached, so they are not healing potions. Why would a priest class need a healing potion anyway?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It would not surprise me at all if they gave allmost identical CH type spells to all 3 classes. Something like 5k at 39 and 7.5k at 44, with both spells being on the same timer group to prevent feathering. That would solve the problem a lot of guilds have with getting enough healers for rotations (a problem which is likely to become more prevalent as the game ages). The distinction between the priests healing could then come from the other healing tools available to them.<br />
<br />
I think I would find it amusing and ironic if all the people who were so bitter about their healing capabilities suddenly found themselves turned into clerics after all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't see Shaman getting a 5k or 7.5k heal any time soon.  Since our current heals can't top 2k base...they seem to not think we need much healing.  I just don't see them giving us a heal that is 3.5x bigger than our BIGGEST heal at 70 at level 44....maybe I'm crazy, but no way.</div></div><hr />

How many people have ever asked for CH on this board?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, they are re-envisaging the classes. Who knows what they will come up with, some of it is likely to be pretty fundamental changes to the general functions of some classes. A blurring of the lines between classes so that social groupings within the game can better cope with the game's aging process. We have to wait and see what they have in mind, but, like I said, it wouldnt surprise me, I can see the logic for doing that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not saying I would complain.  It would help our guild and since I 2/3box often now, it would sure help me take down bigger targets with my BL or SK tanking if I could bust out at 7k heal..base.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">How many people have ever asked for CH on this board?<br />
<br />
Many have asked to be able to function as main healers in all single group content (you too, probably), which is effectively asking for a CH.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's nonsense. You don't need CH to main heal in all group content.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you dont want to go oom in a fast pulling group doing leading edge content you do. There is absolutely no comparison to the efficiency of CH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you dont want to go oom in a fast pulling group doing leading edge content you do. There is absolutely no comparison to the efficiency of CH.<br />
<br />
Yeah, efficiency has been a huge problem in EQ. :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Whether you kill 20 or 18 mobs per hour, what's the difference? If you don't have enough HPS you won't be killing a single mob. In content that is 'leading edge' you usually use fast heals as a cleric anyway as the HPS of those is higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Running out of mana before a mob is dead has an effect on groups. At least in the groups I'm in, probably yours are different (How does that work btw? Do the mobs congratulate you on a good fight, then leave because your oom?). Clerics dont seem to have that problem nearly as often, and it isnt because of their superior canni ability ;)<br />
<br />
Shaman can only sustain healing over time when they can use HoTs most of the time, which for the most part is what really limits what they can do in groups consistently and the type of content they can do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't run oom, simple as that, and I am not joking. I assume your Shamans run oom when healing in high end content, that's a problem. Maybe it would be smart to wait till you have enough mana before pulling the next mob, though. <br />
<br />
I have yet to see anyone being gtg mana wise and suddenly finding himself oom midfight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">NAH, in RS the cleric uses CH at 95 and can take out all of queen + named phs w/o 1 slow. (That's me botting the cleric). Add slow and you can start ch around 80 life and hit 7k chs. I can keep an ft 10 cleric going indefinetly with this setup.<br />
<br />
Seen ft 20+3from aa + 8mana from clicky need mana breaks because they did not use CH. (elixir+remedy/light from what I can tell).<br />
<br />
CH is very very good and useful. I would want it personally. And not that incomplete crap either, I want a complete one that can crit.<br />
<br />
Make it so I cannot cast anything but heals when I have my &quot;heal disc&quot; on and a regular shaman w/o heal disc. Make it so you can't switch between the 2 too fast (ie 1 min to switch) to make it unabusable.<br />
<br />
That'll solve all problems I have with eq.<br />
<br />
Will enable guilds to recruit druids, shaman or clerics instead of &quot;just clerics.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am not talking of RS or any particular zone. Fast heals have a higher HPS than CH, that's a fact. If you can keep up a tank with CH, you sure as hell can do it with fast heals.<br />
<br />
Efficiency is secondary when we are talking about main healing and I don't remember any Shaman ever saying &quot;Help, I can't main heal in groups 'cause I am running oom!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Im interested in this for sure ..<br />
<br />
As far as the &quot;CH issue&quot; goes .. Its no secret to anyone that on a &quot;personal level&quot; I am a 'healing shaman' ... I wouldnt mind a CH type upgrade but i dont see one as a NEEDED either .<br />
<br />
If the goal is to &quot;Make shamans better able to fill the main healer role&quot; as was stated in our &quot;reenvisioning statement&quot; I can see a lot of ways to do that .. a CH type spell upgrade is one option but not the ONLY option .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Help, I can't main heal in groups 'cause I lack HPS!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm not sure about a 7k CH..but I could sure use something bigger than I currently have.  Sometimes with some tanks, I'm firing off my 2300 or so heals just praying for a crit. cause the tank HP's are just hovering, not recovering any of the ground I lost while slowing.  Something a little bigger would sure be welcome for me.<br />
<br />
A CH would sure help me I tell ya.  Anyone that would turn it down is a freakin idiot.  You hear me, and IDIOT that belongs in the same category as people that called for a Panther Nerf.  If you don't want to MH, DON'T.  Say no to groups that want you to MH if you want.  I just love when SOME shaman feel they need to speak for ALL shaman and say we don't need/something is too powerful.  Don't use it if you don't want it, simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">m970456, if they gave me a 3k base fast heal, I could heal ANY content also.  <br />

CH means we would in be rotations on raids.  That is something I'd fight to the bitter end.  The end being me changing classes.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't mind a CH, but I don't expect one.  One of those things that either I would store away for a time to use it or just not use it.  Either way, no need to screw those shaman that would like it by saying 'NO WE DON&quot;T NEED IT'..when some really would like it.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.  I don't see them ever giving us a 'real' CH, but if they do, I really don't think it will be anything less than a level 70 spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh.  Well, we often times don't have enough clerics on, so I'd be in a CH rotation for sure.  I would not like that.<br />
<br />
In terms of being a main healer, All I'm saying is there are many ways to main heal.  CH isn't the *only* way.  Heck, I main heal through mpg chain pulling right now (if its a guild tank).  A little bump to the stuff we have already would be fine with me.<br />
<br />
But yeah, agreeing with the posters above.  I'm guessing this is just a first step in smoothing out healing in the lower levels, not a CH.</div></div><hr />

Why would SOE add a &quot;smoothing spell&quot; between the level 29 Greater Healing and the level 51 Superior Healing at 49, though? If that's what they wanted to do, they would add it at 39 or so, wouldn't they? Besides, the name of the spell makes me wonder...</div></div><hr />

... Hey chu, wanna suggest this on the offical forums?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Well, the cleric &quot;light&quot; spells are their fast heals, and the druid &quot;renewal&quot; spells are their CHs. There isn't an analog for shaman &quot;salve&quot; spells, but its pretty safe to assume that its a heal of some sort.<br />
<br />
Clerics allready get CH at 39, so they dont need a new one. Druids are supposed to be getting upgraded heals, so, the fact that the new spells are junior forms of the &quot;renewal&quot; line would seem to suggest that they are going to get a progressive series of spells in the line, starting at 39 (which is where the clerics get their CH). Following that line of thought it may well be that Karana's and Tunare's will be upgraded sometime in the near future.<br />
<br />
What might the &quot;salve&quot; line be? thats hard to say, but I doubt it will be filling in the gaps between greater and superior healing, because there isnt a significant gap between 49 and 51. So they are most likely a different form of heal. Shaman do get a CH type spell in Kragg's mending at level 58, so it *might* fit in that series. If the Druid renewal line goes 39 49 58 64, shaman would allready have a spell at 58. 39 and 49 would be consistent. We used to have a partial CH at around 64 too, but it got removed before the release of PoP. Just as the druid healing is supposed to be beefed up, so is ours. I think its not too unreasonable to speculate that the salve line may be a partial CH, and if thats the case Kraggs mending would probably be revised and renamed, and the old 64 spell resurrected in a new form.<br />
<br />
Of course its also possible that they may be planning to introduce lower level HoTs for shaman. But, if they did that it would raise the issue of how the new spells would relate to stoicism and torpor, so I have doubts that they would take that form. CH still looks like the best bet to me.<br />
<br />
What about the clerics? Since they are &quot;giving something up&quot; if druids and shaman get effective CH type spells they may be thrown a bone in the form of their fast heals (they dont need a new CH). Since their 2 new spells are in the &quot;light&quot; series, what may happen is that they could recieve a larger range of &quot;light&quot; spells starting at 39, with the current &quot;light&quot; spells being beefed up to CH levels with the same casting time and the same hp/mana efficiency they currently have. Superior healing is a 34 spell to them, so it wont be in conflict with the light series, in fact it will be a natural progression. That would increase their healing power and leave them as the undisputed &quot;masters of healing&quot;, but at the same time allow shaman and druids a greater role as healers in a more diverse array of content.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is all speculation ;). It will be interesting to see how it works out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After the events of the past two weeks, I can't help but suspect that Kragg's Salve will actually be an ointment applied to our hind ends after the &quot;real-absolutely-final-no-kidding-this-time&quot; versions of Leopard and Panther go live.<br />
