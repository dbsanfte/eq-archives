<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Punko123</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The technique is as follows:<br />
<br />
Pay a rogue to open crypt door for you, get a pet and buff it nicely.<br />
Pull the ghouls from the first 3 spawns, you may get doubles, or all of them depending on level. If you get all, they harmtouch for 611 or more, depending on dar or higher, you will not live.<br />
<br />
Skeletons have a small assist range, so you can usually single pull ghouls from next to them. Pull with slow, resists are very low here, sic your pet on the ghouls pet first or it will interupt you.<br />
<br />
Try to get an aegolism or similar if you have low HP, harmtouches can kill you very easily if you do not pay attention.<br />
<br />
Once you pass the 3 ghouls behind the locked door invis up, be weary of roamers and go down the ramp, left, then right, down a small ramp, through a door, then hug left and go stand in the corner besides the stairs down to the room with the ICG.<br />
<br />
This corner is relatively safe, if you are 60+ nothing will agro you here, and I think it is even safe from 57ish.<br />
<br />
From this spot try to see the crypt caretaker or PH roam, when he is at his furthest position you can walk past the ICG with invis, into the room of a named.<br />
<br />
The baron has a nasty HT, about 1k, and the hierophant can cast our torrent of poison spell which can hurt very badly. The named hierophant also needs to be dispelled or snared, because he sows himself and runs at low health, and is at a short distance from agroing caretaker, 2 ICG and getting a CH meantime.<br />
<br />
I do not think it is doable without being level 60, or one would need very good (1100+) AC at least and 2300 + hp unbuffed.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion, it could be wrong, but I tried my best to give advice in this post since I farm crypt quite often on AB =).<br />

PS: many of the normal ghoul knights see IVU, so do not bother with it, it is worthless.<br />
PPS: I tried making this a reply to an older thread, but the board would not allow me =(. Crappy gnomeboard mechanics =(.</div></div><hr />
