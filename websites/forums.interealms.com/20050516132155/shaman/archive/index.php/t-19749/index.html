<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Worlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...about the strength of the shaman class.<br />
<br />
Tonight, I was in a group caming Upper Sand wing of Bastion of Thunder.  The group, when I got there, consisted of myself (65 sham), 65 cleric, 65 warrior, 65 monk, 65 mage, and 65 beastlord.  Soon after I got there, the monk was replaced by a Ranger (65).  About an hour into the group, the BL decides its time to log, and we cant find a replacement.  No biggie, we're fine on DPS anyway, so we keep on.  About half an hour later, Cleric says she needs to go, and tells us that she has been trying for 1/2 hour to find a replacement and couldnt get one.  No biggie, we're in a safe spot so we sit there for a min trying to decide what to do.<br />
<br />
At this time, the group is now me, warrior, mage, and ranger.  I get a wild hair up my butt and say, 'screw it, im FM, pull one.'<br />
<br />
Ranger pulls, I toss a Q on tank, mage 'sinia's, I slow, and toss a Tnarg's on tank toward end of fight.  He ends at full health, and im only down 10% mana or so.  So we continue to pull, looking for a healer and a replacement DPS for a while but never finding one.  Eventually mage has to go so he gets a replacement mage.  By the time we finally find a cleric, an hour had gone by.  That's right, an hour of chain pulling, sometimes 2 mobs and occassionally 3 if I had the mana, with no breaks in between with only 4 group members.<br />
<br />
So we get the cleric, rebuff, and continue pulling.  After about an hour, cleric goes LD.  Fine, np, we start pulling again.  After 2nd pull, my KEI drops.  No biggie, we'll just have to slow down pulls a bit, I say.  So we continue pulling for about another half hour, pretty much at the same rate as before, no breaks in between, chain pulling, sometimes 2.  Eventually we get an enchie and cleric to fill last two spots.<br />
<br />
All in all, I had 4 AA dings in roughly 5 hours in that group.  And a good chunk of the time, I was slowing, debuffing, healing, and nuking.  Hell, we even took out Rorek Steelthorn with just the 4 of us.<br />
<br />
Never again, after tonight, will I ever say the shaman class is lacking in any way.  Just thought I would share that with the rest of the community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As long as we don't get a named i can be main healer/main slower in a chain pulling poe group too... or ldon hard for that matter.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying shaman is underpowered, but i think we do need some added bonuses to make us more desireable.  <br />
A group heal that can be mgb'd, make our blood of naddox spell a mgbable cure over time (2mins cures as much counters as blood/tic).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Posts like this warm my heart :D<br />
<br />
As long as the mob doesn't greatly outdamage quiescence + chain tnargs, we can keep a group alive through pretty much anything.  I can't even begin to count the number of times that the cleric has died and I've pulled the group out of what everyone but me considered a sure wipe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's good to hear something positive on the boards tho :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not saying this to go.. oh look what i can do, but to help this post lighten the hearts of the shaman.<br />
<br />
I have soloed in BoT. The giants arent that tough if you have decent resists. The only thing you need to worry about is gaters. Mind you its not easy and there will be downtime before your next giant kill and spliting is very difficult and sometimes limits your pulling. <br />
<br />
Beyond that i would like to point out that a Pally and a Shaman can duo a very large portion of BoT with almost no downtime. I have done it and its amazing. Suprisingly enough a good shaman and pally duo, especialy in a wing where we can land DoTs, can kill as fast as a lower tier level group. Meaning that no, you dont have the DPS to keep up with a time flagged group, but even keeping up with a group that just got into BoT is pretty good i have to say.<br />
<br />
Make friends with a Pally, trust me. No you might not killing things OMG UBER FAST. But I cant think of a duo that can last longer and is more virsitile and self sufficent. Even more then pet classes cause its very hard to control pets sometimes.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought i would share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I too have been stuck playing Main and only healer in BoT and the Few times I have done it we had no crowd control either so unless they pulled two mobs we were fine. if they pulled two  and someone started to Off Tank my mana would be gone. But single pulls I could Malos, Slow, Heal, Canni. without to many worries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I built a group to farm ornate for cash in SolRo.  It was me, a rogue, and 2 warriors.<br />
<br />
I pulled, slowed, and healed.  Chain pulled... 2 at a time.  Four people.  Cleared the first floor and the tops of both stairs before repops....<br />
<br />
And it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the complaints being made recently.  The complaints are about the End Game shaman - Elemental and Time... BoT and even SolRo don't qualify.<br />
<br />
It's nice to hear someone proud of their accomplishments.  I salute you for not wussing out - for stepping up and doing the shaman class proud... but unfortunately it doesn't refute the arguments being made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
It's nice to hear someone proud of their accomplishments.  I salute you for not wussing out - for stepping up and doing the shaman class proud... but unfortunately it doesn't refute the arguments being made.<br />
/agree.  Good to be proud, just realize that while we can still do some amazing things in certain situations, we DO have deficiencies in the upper end of the game.  There was a time years ago when this board was regaled weekly (sometimes daily) with bragging posts about Shaman endeavors solo or grouped.  Many of us feel we shot ourselves in the foot with these, and that posts like that are partly to blame for why we've been 'neglected' in balancing matters for so long.  So the boasting posts don't happen as much anymore (for many reasons) and they aren't looked upon quite as fondly as they used to.<br />
<br />
You should be proud.   I have a story from a few weeks ago that made me very proud..  Pickup LDoN adventure on normal - figure it should be an easy (if maybe slow) win even w/ strangers.  Group should be okay w/ a 65 druid for primary healer I thought.  Paladin MA so aggro shouldn't be an issue for me &amp; I can pump out some DPS.  Average group level was about 64.  Rest of group was magician, monk, &amp; ranger (plus me) so I thought we'd be killing very fast.  I didn't know any of them well, but had done an adventure with one or two of them before.<br />
<br />
We zone in, and since it is Takish and I hate the doors I let the monk pull.  VERY first pull from zoning in and she brings five to the door (not aggroed on group yet).  As she stands at 40-50% health to begin the first split, the druid heals the monk so all 5 come on top of us, and squash the druid in less time than I can land a Tnarg's.  /sigh.  Monk gets crushed next (didn't FD for some reason, or maybe it failed. /shrug).  Magician is going down fast and zones out.  Ranger is at half life &amp; zones as well, leaving the pally tanking one, dogdog on a second, and 2 are pounding on me (last mob parked).  Pally zones, leaving me last one standing in the dungeon entrance with 5 live mobs.<br />
<br />
During the fracas I had managed to root park 2 (one of which the pally was on) and slow all but one.   The one unslowed mob had been VP'd initially.  I back and root (using clicky legs) the 3 remaining unparked mobs, then dot the paladin &amp; mage pets previous targets (both were low on health).  Repark as necessary, and about two minutes later there are only 2 mobs standing, both are parked and rotting nicely as I tell the survivors to come back inside.  I was low on mana, but still standing.  Was a pretty nice feeling when the ranger, magician, and paladin came back inside to see me there standing by 3 corpses with 2 other mobs almost dead in the room.  :cool: <br />
<br />
The monk couldn't pull worth crap so I took over.  The paladin went LD (I'm still suspicious it was a /q, but what can you do) 15 minutes later after the monks 3rd time bringing 4 to us and never came back.  The ranger and monk were in mediocre bazaar gear and couldn't tank to save their life (literally).  <br />
<br />
So now I'm pulling, slowing, CC'ing, and assist healing (the druid's manapool left something to be desired) AS well as tanking.  It wasn't pretty, but we finished the adventure about 10 mintues into overtime.  If the paladin had been in the adventure for even another 20 minutes (or we'd had some luck w/ a streak of collect drops) we would have won w/o overtime.<br />
<br />
I single-handedly DRAGGED that group through 80% of the adventure.  We had multiple deaths, but I didn't give up even though several of the group wanted to.  It was a miserable adventure in some respects, but it was a testament to our durability and well-rounded abilities.  The 300 aa's probably helped alot too. :D <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">And this helps our stackability on raids how? It's nice you can be a &quot;real priest&quot; and heal a group like we should be able to, but I don't think this ends the discussion on shaman improvements.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The way they plan on helping us &quot;stack&quot; on raids is to force us to have the new slow spell because trash mobs quad for 3k and you need to slow them as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A couple of points to make:<br />
<br />
1. At level 65, BoT is an easy zone for most anyone that has decent equipment.  If you are a casual player and all you want to do is pump out a few AA's and relax with friends in a low level zone, then shamans are just as they stand.<br />
<br />
2.  For a Plane of Time equipped shaman like Jinheim, elemental planes and hard LDoN adventures are like BoT to the rest of us.  Low level zones to fool around in and pump out easy AAs.<br />
<br />
Where the pinch comes in is when you're equipped like most non-elemental shamans are and you're trying to do hard LDoN adventures, contribute to elemental level plane raids and groups, and do things that are really challenging.  Other classes have more tools to contribute in such situations than shamans do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sure, we can solo things from several expantions ago that used to take<br />
a full group. So what? In the amount of time it took to solo that dragon,<br />
you could have gotten MUCH more exp in a group situation. Same goes<br />
for duo'ing and dealing with a group with LD members. Yes, we are<br />
versatile and can fill in for missing or incompetant members of our<br />
group. I'd bet a skilled Druid or even Ranger could do the same, given<br />
the same level and AA points. However other classes can point to these<br />
posts and say &quot;Ooh, look what a Shaman can do! Don't upgrade<br />
them, they're obviously fine, upgrade me!&quot;; taking quotes out of <br />
context, ignoring the lack of exp, zone difficulty, and the fact that the <br />
normal LDON adventure was lost. <br />
<br />
Before anyone makes another bragging post, please askyourself this:<br />
Is your ego so important to you that you'd rather puff your cheast out <br />
and see our class remain stagnant, then see us get upgraded along <br />
with the other classes? <br />
<br />
These bragging posts only serve to provide amo for pinheads like that<br />
turtle_pet guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hi clueless one, let me stress it for you.<br />
<br />
OUR STACKABILITY AND USE IN RAID IS CLOSE TO NI(hi)L<br />
<br />
How many time must we say this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mitrian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">These bragging posts only serve to provide amo for pinheads like that turtle_pet guy.I respectfully disagree.  Ever taken a statistics class?  The basis of statistics is that if you work it right you can make the numbers support you regardless of you position.  The same is true of words, if not more so.  They are taken out of context all the time, I see it on every EQ forum I've ever visisted.  What turtle or whoever wants to do with these stories is out of our control, and is a terrible reason to not share your stories and opinions.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed reading about these experiences.  Brings back some good memories for me, too.  Regardless of the real issues I have with the shaman class where I play 90% of the time now (raids, hard LDoN, etc), I love my toon, and I enjoy the class.  And it makes me happy to hear of others also getting enjoyment!<br />
<br />
I lament that it's been so long since I had my own story like this, though.  I think the last one for me was in revamped Cazic-Thule down in the mosquito sewers.  Fun times!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">As long as you dont have any wing bosses pop or can contol the debuffing of the Kreigers, BoT is cake.  But try and heal your tank (your average BoT tank) on a Kreiger add while its resisted slow even after you land Malosinia.  Oh and dont forget to land that cripple fast too.  Those 1500hp procs can be hard to heal over even on the best tank.<br />
<br />
BoT on low setting (exp) is doable for a Shaman, but if youre out to get wing bosses, best have at least a Druid for heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hi clueless one, let me stress it for you.<br />

Lay off.  <br />
<br />
He isn't clueless, he's just not as experienced &amp; also not bitter like some others.<br />
<br />
I'm well aware of our raid stackability issues &amp; even though I'm not in the Elemental Planes I'm aware of our high end shortcomings, as are many.  Raid stackability was not mentioned nor a subject of this post, and why an upper mid-level shaman can't be happy seems to be a sore point for many.  :(   He wasn't saying all of YOU don't have room to complain, he was saying that HE wasn't going to complain any more.<br />
<br />
Worlaan's and my post do nothing to negatively impact our striving for shaman balancing and improvements in my opinion.  He and I were very specific about the zones we were talking about &amp; mob strength (relatively weak).  Our posts don't address shaman stacking or high end shortfalls.<br />
<br />
This community has really gone downhill when an enthusiastic board member gets snapped at in this manner.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oh god these posts give me headaches.<br />
<br />
I hate the negativity when people cut and paste and they attack - it just takes away from the thread and the forum overall, it's ugly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not all classes stack well on raids, shaman and enchanters being 2 that come to mind.<br />
<br />
But there are a host of other things that we can do really well as opposed to other classes is what the poster is trying to point out.<br />
<br />
You guys expect and want shaman to excel at everything, well make a necro or bard, oops they don't excel at everything either.<br />
<br />
The fact is shaman kill slower, but are able to survive in and excel in a variety of other environments, not alot of classes can do what we can do, and you know it. Shaman excel at damage MITIGATION.<br />
<br />
There is a trade off in eq, power in one area - weakness in another - it's called game balance. <br />
<br />
In a raid one shaman slows, one malos, one cripples, after that yes there's nothing left for me to do, except throw on a dot or an ugly nuke.<br />
I accept it, because I excel in other parts of the game.<br />
<br />
Raiding is only one part of the game. And yes I understand your disappointment if you are part of a guild with more than 2 raiding shaman. My guild has 6.<br />
<br />
But I can do things other classes can't do and often they marvel at my ability to do them in non raid settings. Imagine being a warrior and not being able to solo? Sure your very important at the raid as the MT, and maybe your the SA... ok after that you are just a foot soldier like the rest of us. Who can't solo, who can't save a group in an ldon or a messy pull.<br />
<br />
So warriors should complain I can't solo, I can't mitigate damage?<br />
<br />
Necros king of soloers and can add a ton of dps at a raid and can FD off agro, but you know what they can't save me from a messy pull in a dungeon or an ldon. Not like I can. <br />
<br />
No one can touch me in my powers of survivability.<br />
<br />
Necros FD - I stand and fight, and boy do I put on a good show. People screaming run for zone and I'm busy rooting and slowing.<br />
<br />
I can knock back root adds, I can root park adds, I can slow and I can heal, plus throw in dog and spirit call. I am a ONE MAN GROUP, who can do things that no necro, bard, enchanter or BL can do.<br />
<br />
We contribute in so many many other ways - not thru damage but thru damage MITIGATION. No one mitigates damage like the shaman can - and this where our true POWER comes from.<br />
<br />
Yes I can't do everything in the game, but you know what I like my role and I love what I can do because I consistently impress others of the TRUE power of a well played shaman.<br />
<br />
I don't want a group heal, I have enough to do thk u<br />
I don't want nukes, I am a dotting class<br />
and before you flame me I think you will find that SOE agrees with me<br />
<br />
<br />
I do agree as content gets harder, our spells should reflect the RELATIVE increase in power, which they don't. <br />
<br />
The slow does - thk god<br />
<br />
The new canni does - thk god<br />
<br />
The new Q doesn't - they should have listened to shaman and given us a lvl 65 single heal upgrade which would have been for the very elite shaman playing in elite zones and which healed quite a bit more.<br />
<br />
The new dot doesn't - new slow acting dot, doesn't help us at all with harder hitting, higher ac higher hp mobs. Should have been a lure type, 5 sec cast, poison or magic based dot, high damage - and hard to get.<br />
<br />
Anyways shamans can be tweaked, but I for one love mine, love what I can do and I am having a good time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I duo easily with an SK partner in Sol Ro all the time, but this is meaningless when discussing our desirability in groups or raids. If the healing is there, a BL is a much better choice than us. On raids, we are delegated to /assist tiny-healing while we try and drop Rain spells that get resisted half the time and crit even less. <br />
<br />
Our most powerful offensive spells are relatively useless on raids. I still use Bane on some bosses, but I cant keep it going full time. I will get summoned instantly. Hopefully SCS will help this, and we can actually contribute to the DPS on a raid, as well as fill our other utility roles, but I am not sure SCS is going to work on every tic of a DOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I have no trouble healing in EPs or hard LDoNs as long as I have a comparably equipped tank and reliable crowd control. <br />
<br />
Comparable to what?<br />
<br />
Are you suggesting the balance is achieved due to equipment, and not by skill or spell line up??  And not even by the equipment you are wearing, but by the equipment that those around you are wearing instead?  So by making those around you better by having tons of good equipment, it just means that you don't have to be as good to just be mediocre.<br />
<br />
Not sure whats wrong, but one of us is looking at this the wrong way.  I am pretty sure its not me, but I have been wrong before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Funny.  I have been doing this in BoT since l hit level 63 and no AA's.  I used Tnarg if a quick heal is needed but basically, just started casting Kragg when tank hit's 80 pct.  Now with Canni V and Q it is alot easier.  Before that, I was mashing on my Canni IV hotkey almost non-stop.<br />
<br />
Healing and group utility is not a problem anyway as other posters have posted.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not all classes stack well on raids, shaman and enchanters being 2 that come to mind.<br />
Shaman are the single worst stacking class on raids. The one class who might do less damage then us, bards, can pull, debuff, overhaste, resist buff, give te best mana regeneration and add sick damage shields and.<br />
Enchanters have at least as critical a job as our slowing, can take over our slowing if need be and add much more critical buffs to the raid. Oh, and they outnuke us.<br />
<br />
But there are a host of other things that we can do really well as opposed to other classes is what the poster is trying to point out.<br />
What the original poster pointed out is that he did a good job at keeping a group if idiots focused while playing his shaman to the best of his abilities. That is a good thing but in no way does it prove or disprove anything about shaman balance issues.<br />
<br />
You guys expect and want shaman to excel at everything, well make a necro or bard, oops they don't excel at everything either.<br />
Did you read the proposal? Did you read all the complaint and balance threads? Noone wants Cleric heals, noone wants Druid nukes, noone wants Necromancer DoTs. We want to outheal paladins, outnuke rangers and have a way to do decent damage in both exp groups and on raids.<br />
<br />
The fact is shaman kill slower, but are able to survive in and excel in a variety of other environments, not alot of classes can do what we can do, and you know it. Shaman excel at damage MITIGATION.<br />
Our 'killer slow' exceeds Enchanter and Beastlords slows by 5 and 10%. That is the very smallest advantage in any class defining feature. Warriors can outtank Paladins by more then 5%. Clerics outheal Druids by more then 5%. Enchanters outhaste Shaman by more then 5%.<br />
And yes, noone can do quite what Shaman can do, which is a direcr result of no other class having our exact spellset. However shaman strengths are being eroded, shaman class features are given away in superior form to other class and our weaknesses are not adressed at all - and this has been going on for 6 expansions now.<br />
When we do get upgrades we get situational ones while every other class gets true upgrades.<br />
As to shaman excelling at mitigation, that is laughable. We are not even in the same leage as, say, an enchanter. We have slow, root and heal. Enchanters have pacify, mez, slow, stun and runes. Enchanters also have superior buffs and do way more damage then us.<br />
<br />
In a raid one shaman slows, one malos, one cripples, after that yes there's nothing left for me to do, except throw on a dot or an ugly nuke.<br />
I accept it, because I excel in other parts of the game.<br />
If your idea of contributing to a raid is casting Malos I understand how you can say Shaman are doing fine.<br />
<br />
Raiding is only one part of the game. And yes I understand your disappointment if you are part of a guild with more than 2 raiding shaman. My guild has 6.<br />
We do just as badly at grouping - raiding merely adds the additional stacking problems.<br />
<br />
But I can do things other classes can't do and often they marvel at my ability to do them in non raid settings. Imagine being a warrior and not being able to solo? Sure your very important at the raid as the MT, and maybe your the SA... ok after that you are just a foot soldier like the rest of us. Who can't solo, who can't save a group in an ldon or a messy pull.<br />
Taunt, AE taunt, incite, shield, defensive and superior tanking ability can not save a group? Uhh . . sure. I see you wisely did not choose to make your example a paladin.<br />
<br />
Necros king of soloers and can add a ton of dps at a raid and can FD off agro, but you know what they can't save me from a messy pull in a dungeon or an ldon. Not like I can. <br />
At the very least a Necromancer can keep one add occupied. At best he can slow, manadrain casters, use snare to prevent runners, have his pet tank one, use lifetaps to tank another, use snare and root to park MOBs and if something does go wrong he can FD and rez in the cleric. That does not look too bad for one of the best DPS classes out there.<br />
<br />
No one can touch me in my powers of survivability.<br />
*Boggle* would you mind defining your version of 'survivability' ?<br />
<br />
Necros FD - I stand and fight, and boy do I put on a good show. People screaming run for zone and I'm busy rooting and slowing.<br />
Now do it again with a competent Necromancer.<br />
<br />
I can knock back root adds, I can root park adds, I can slow and I can heal, plus throw in dog and spirit call. I am a ONE MAN GROUP, who can do things that no necro, bard, enchanter or BL can do.<br />
Every single class in the game can do things no other class can do.<br />
<br />
We contribute in so many many other ways - not thru damage but thru damage MITIGATION. No one mitigates damage like the shaman can - and this where our true POWER comes from.<br />
Enchanters, Clerics and Bards all outmitigate us, as do Druids in outdoor zones. Heck a chainstunning Paladin outmitigates us.<br />
<br />
I don't want a group heal, I have enough to do thk u. I don't want nukes, I am a dotting class and before you flame me I think you will find that SOE agrees with me<br />
That is a problem, not a boon.</div></div><hr />

To the whiners and nay sayers &lt;sp&gt;:  don't ever forget that not everyone who comes to these boards are elemental or even VT equipped nor are they 65 with 600 AA's.  And we do still enjoy playing our shaman without all that.  I may be 65 with over 200 AA's but I've only got 5600 hps raid buffed.  Do I let that stop me from doing my job as my guild's only shaman on raids (that just changed recently)?  Nope.  Do I back off and let another class do the slowing because they have better buffs than I do?  Nope.  Because I know I can mitigate the damage brought on by a mob if I get a slow resisted better than a beastlord or an enchanter.  Shaman get the superior slow compared to all others in mana cost, casting time, and chance of resists.  Having played a 65 chanter, I know their slow is resisted even more than ours and the agro from tash is unreal compared to our malos.  <br />
<br />
So yes, I am PROUD to play a shaman and proud of where I am today.  And I agree with Stolastorv, we need a whiner's forum on these boards badly.  Now you know why I don't visit very often anymore.  There's enough negativity in the real world without compounding virtual negativity on top of it.</div></div><hr />

I feel the same way Stol.  What I'm starting to think, however, is that a lot of these people are just tired of Everquest but can't pull themselves away.  I think that the last 4 years of development decisions have shown that our intended area of strength is as a group's primary debuffer and secondary healer.  Every expansion has brought greater focus on our skills in a group enviorment while adding relatively little to our raid &quot;stackability.&quot;  After seven expansions we need to accept the hand we've been dealt and move on.  Some classes, warriors, enchanters, and shaman in particular, just aren't going to stack well on raids.  That seems to be the way the winds are blowing, so just play your shaman and enjoy it, pick a new class, or leave Everquest behind entirely.<br />

I've been told this is false.  Pretty sure both classes deal with aggro'd, unslowed mobs better than us.  /shrug.<br />
<br />
Shaman get the superior slow compared to all others in mana cost, casting time, and chance of resists. <br />
BL slow is cheaper, faster, and resists less than turgurs...if you are talking about the new slow...then both chanters and beastlords have a higher % slow than us.  And the BL spell is still cheaper at only 150 mana.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Your post comes along at a time when many shaman are feeling underpowered relative to the changing game dynamics, and are feeling a total lack of attention from the developers.  A post elsewhere on this board, of a chat log with a developer, reveals a startling lack of developer knowledge regarding the state of the game in general and a specific lack of knowledge regarding the shaman class.<br />
<br />
You may not have intentionally done so, but your post goes a long way toward refuting many of the arguments put forth in the shaman petition.  If I were a dev and read your post, I'd get the impression that shamans need absolutely no attention whatsoever.  And that's why people are so sensitive about this subject - SOE seems to find one post in a hundred that indicates everything is fine, and then use that as the basis for doing nothing.  After all, &quot;the shaman community&quot; doesn't believe they have a problem.  <br />
<br />
They did the same thing recently with the mage class - maybe 5% think something,  so they glommed onto that viewpoint, which was considered useless by the other 95%, and implemented it, claiming that &quot;beta mages had requested it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to flame you at all.  But can you honestly say you're suprised that you struck a nerve? <br />

Perhaps there needs to be a seperate forum for high level discussion only, much like The Overlord's Sanctuary over at The Steel Warrior, a forum that deals exclusively with endgame issues and topics. <br />
<br />
It just seems completely unfair that because a player is not doing endgame content that their accomplishments at the level of the game they are at are to be dismissed out of hand, or worse ridiculed and basically told that it don't mean squat because it wasn't in PoTime. <br />
<br />
I totally accept the words of the many more advanced Shaman that have been sharing their wisdom here for a long time that there are serious issues in the endgame affecting the class, but to jump on someone not at that level because they played their character to the limits of their ability and did well and were proud of their accomplishment is shameful and diminishes you<br />

<br />
I sympathise with the concerns of the uber-shaman. I support them in their efforts to lobby and promulgate change. I beleive that they are quite correct in their assertions that the top end shaman have been unjustly neglected and need some positive changes.<br />
<br />
This thread is not about the need for those aforementioned changes. This thread is not, in my opinion, even an argument against those changes. There have been plenty (too many) threads for and against that particular ex-equine<br />
<br />
This is a timely and welcome thread reminding us that this EQ thing can be a really good, fun game and that for all our top-end weaknesses, we shaman can be a fun, versatile and powerful class in the right situation.<br />
<br />
Last week I was doing a run-of-the-mill LDoN (insofar as this is possible for a ghetto-shaman!) when, after about 5 minutes, the SK and Warrior both went LD, leaving me (shammy), rogue, cleric and chanter scratching our heads - 24 more **insert random stupid item here** to collect.<br />
<br />
On went the AC gear. Gogo Main Tank shaman. Rogue would pull, chanter would mez any adds, I would slow pullers primary target (to get aggro) then DoT the carp out of it to keep aggro allowing rogue to go berserk on backstabs. Cleric would keep me healed because I had to perma-canni during melee - and I would also slow or/and root mezzed mobs in between whiles. we finished the adventure - 4 of us, on a 6 person adventure, and I tanked each mob. <br />
<br />
Sure, its not a big deal really, but the 4 of us felt pretty good about ourselves when we completed, and I felt like I had earned my &quot;I ain't no druid&quot; badge!</div></div><hr />

Oh and Hi! Im a shaman, level 65 with only a meager 90 aa currently. I have been playing EQ just a few weeks before Kunark was released. I have all my spells besides Primal Essence.  I am not a main healer in any situtation, besides emergencies, I leave that up to the druids and clerics in the CH Chain on our raids. I am not a nuker, though when the mob/time and mana permits I squeeze out my lowly 925 velium strike thats even been seen to crit for 1233 before with the 1 aa I added to SCF just for fun. I dont get to malos much because the mages malo line over writes mine so its a useless waste of mana. My dog sucks and couldnt tank his way out of a train of CB orcs, likely even with foS and SLtW. (just kidding he could actually do that but I wanted to keep up with the spirit of whining). Please dont ever give me anything remotely near a CH because then Ill have to be yet another channel on raids and I really dont want that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good to see there are SOME people who just enjoy the game from day to day without picking apart how left behind the shamans are... and when it comes time to stand on the PoT stone so shamans can have rezzes let me know. Ill be there.. until then Ill just have to be a slower/buffho. Im trying to figure out who to blame for that but I cant for the life of me find out who made me roll this toon the day I made her.<br />

At any rate ... woot Worlaan!! Nice job.<br />
<br />
I got a taste of what it is to be versatile last night in LDON. Our warrior went LD about three-quarters of the way into the collect mission, which left me with a cleric, a wizard and two druids (yeah yeah, I like odd group makeups). Puppy looked up at me balefully, and I could practically hear him say, &quot;Oh crap. That means I have to tank, I take it. Did you remember the extra treats?&quot; I did. Gave him a treat, buffed him up with FOS, Endurance of the Boar, Virtue and puppy haste and off we went. I warned the group before hand that I was in solo mode, and just to sit back and watch and med up (KEI's had worn off, and I had lost mine from an earlier death I'll just chalk up to an ill-timed Canni 5, lol). Anyways, I had one druid pulling. I'd park the mob with VP and slow it, then send puppy in and cast Pox of Bertoxxulous. Every once in awhile, I'd cast the epic. Mana permitting, both druids were dotting and Mr. Wizard was nuking, and the cleric was medding as fast as she could go. I kept Q up on the puppy and on myself when I cannied, leaving the cleric with mana for paci and the druids with mana for dotting. I never dropped below 50m. I was hitting C5 every time it refreshed, and was hitting C4 when I got bored. <br />
<br />
You know what? We won. With time to spare. The others were breathless afterward, and the wizard actually asked for &quot;an ice pack for my bruised mana pool&quot; ... but we won. And they ALL said it was thanks to me and puppy. The cleric sent me a tell saying she had no idea shaman could &quot;solo&quot; like that, and said she didn't know what she would have done if I had gone LD or some such. The druids (a RL married couple) both said I was on their Must Group With List and told me they thought shaman were amazing.<br />
<br />
Am I &quot;uber&quot; or &quot;leet&quot;? Hell no, go look at my Magelo. I'm a mostly bazaar and LDON equipped shaman with 60 AA (haven't updated Magelo to include RC1) who can't quite get to 5.5k HP raid-buffed. Do I think shaman are an amazing class? Yes!! Read a couple of these posts and you tell me. Do I think shaman could use a few upgrades? Yes!!  I'm not going to bore you with a list of upgrades -- we've had a million and one posts on them already. As a class, we have some problems that really need to be addressed. I'm just as pissed at the lack of attention from SOE as the next shaman. But instead of wasting my time whining and complaining and carrying on about how SOE hates us, blah blah, I suck it up and log nearly every night to a toon I love playing and people I love playing with. I make do with what I have because that's just how I am. <br />

Look at it this way. You have a new addition to your family and want<br />
to move up from a condo to a house, so you need to ask your boss for <br />
a raise. Do you go and tell him how you think you make more money <br />
then most of your peers? Brag about your new top-of-the-line fridge, <br />
plasma TV and BMW? Then expect a raise next review cycle? No, you<br />
simply tell him about your new child, the lack of a yard, cost of clothes,<br />
how you haven't gotten a good raise in two years yet worked hard, etc.<br />
You make a case FOR it, not against it. <br />

Hail, Kbok. Didn't take you long to reply. At any rate, nothing in my post says we're &quot;overpowered&quot; ... in fact, to my mind, it just says I was being a shaman. If you were to, say, solo in a zone like Droga, is that not how you would do it? VP, dot, puppy? Maybe some melee? I re-read my post, and I don't see anything there that says we're overpowered. Perhaps I missed something. Like I said, I was just being a shaman -- just like Worlaan, just like Frekkels.<br />
<br />
How can I expect SOE to seriously consider addressing our problems after reading &quot;a post like that&quot;? Being that I don't expect them to seriously consider addressing our problems one way or the other, I don't see how it matters. I simply find consistent whining to be incredibly unproductive and rather wearing on the nerves, and I'd expect SOE devs and PR folks feel the same way.<br />
<br />
Given your scenario (about the movement from a condo to a house), here's what I'd do. I'd tell my boss -- look. Look at what I've done with what little you gave me. Look how productive I can be. I have proven it. Now, imagine what I could do with just a little bit more. Not going to give me a raise? Okay, I'm still thankful to have a job and steady income, and, as always, I'll work to make do with what I have. Maybe a second job is in order.<br />

You make a sweeping statement about our class based on your experience in a low end zone and wonder why some people take issue with that.<br />

Light help me, people here are always bloody flaming someone. Whoever it was that initially said we need a Whiner's Forum on these boards -- Amen to that, and when can it be started, Sunmoon?? Gawd.<br />
<br />
Whining about whining doesn't help.  And to be quite honest, almost all the comments on this post haven't been whining or flames ... sorry if that disappoints.   Instead I'm reading statements from people that don't agree or have a counter opinion.   Wow ... call me naive but I thought that was what a discussion board was all about instead of orator s platform.    <br />
<br />
When I read the title for a post stating, &quot;I'll Never complain again ...&quot;  it certainly had me expecting to find something about complaining as a topic.    Much less as a second part of &quot;about the strength of the shaman class&quot;.    Or even ending with &quot;Never again, after tonight, will I ever say the shaman class is lacking in any way. Just thought I would share that with the rest of the community&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Thanks again for the story but your start and finish left me thinking you have another agenda.      Boggle or no boggle.  And as to side bar about &quot;bloody flaming someone?&quot;, if comments become whining, counter opinion are flames, and constructive commentary is bashing ... I guess the real informative thought here is boggle.<br />
