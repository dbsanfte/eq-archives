<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK , ive just taken part in a guild BoT raid (yep i know we are not uber) , we have 7 shammys on raid (and yes know that is at least 4 too many but we are a family type guild)<br />
<br />
As we had so many shamans i was doing DPS (:P) We had people casting tash , malos , decay on incomming<br />
<br />
Every cast was resisted , every SoT, BoU , BoS , must have been100ish  cast of those in the raid .<br />
<br />
I know that RNG can be unkind but 100 in a row!!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What wing were you fighting in?  There are some wings that are totally Posion resistant, and others that really wont take Disease no matter how many times you toss Insideous Decay.<br />
<br />
Sadly, BoT makes it hard for shaman to go DPS mode sometimes.  Patch healing and cures are usually what I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mspeedie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So do LODN and get Bane and Anathema.   It checkes versus magic.<br />
<br />
One more tool in the tool box, in the battle to try to find some useful function in a shaman nerfing world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What Thor said: each wing has an innate resist. As I recall, one is fire, one is ice, one is poison, one is disease. There may be some overlapping also (resists to more than one type.) Magic seems to be consistantly effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JustinTimberlake</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Please...allow me to cry you a river.  Go play a real class and/or game.</div></div><hr />

Whaa...<br />
<br />
Go away please.  Your kind of responce isnt wanted here.</div></div><hr />

When you get more than 2500 HP send me a PM. Until then, I think I will ignore your advice.  Try thinking for yourself a little rather than being a fan boi class nazi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Haha!<br />
<br />
As soon as the number of HP that I have has any bearing on how observant I am on resist rates in certain zones I'll let you know.</div></div><hr />

Find some manners, or find the door.  You have 3 posts of no content and this sort of crap isnt going to be tolerated long.</div></div><hr />
