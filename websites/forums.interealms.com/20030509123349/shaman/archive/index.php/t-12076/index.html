Ok, I know what to do to get Stoicism.  But I wanna know, can a fairly well equipped 46 shammy solo the encounter, and if not, what/who do I need?  If i pull one of the &quot;uderwater mobs that pop after the hand in&quot; (sorry, I forget the names), will the other agro too, or can i take them 1 at a time?  I read the sticky on it (thank you BTW), but I didn't see any specific info on my questions.  Thanks in advance!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yes you should be able to do that part solo.  You can pull one without aggroing the other.  Make a puppy, let him tank, it will be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">.. and don't hand in the quest pieces to your dog.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Baby jesus. I did that TWICE. I thought I was gonna through my machine across the room the second time.<br />
<br />
Its REALLY easy to do. Park puppy at the FRONT of the boat so ya dont do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They came single for me at 61, which could be different at 46, but to me the two elementals spawn standing quite far apart and I would think you could single pull them with a non-damage spell like slow.  They were completely trivial at 61, didnt even do much besides let pet kill em.  I would bet it is soloable at 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I helped out on the final turn in at lvl 42.  The elementals were db to me at 42 for cryin out loud!<br />
<br />
The 44 shammy I helped confirmed that the hard part is single-pulling the drunks.<br />

<br />
Highly suggest you park your pet at the mouth of the ship before doing the hand in.<br />
<br />
I knew quite a few people that handed the stuff to their dog.<br />
<br />
I was told to hail the spirit each time you handed something in, but not sure that's necessary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Good to hear that this is doable by a 46-47 Shaman, I'm gonna give it a try soon enough. Seeing as how I've failed since 39 in getting Canni II. <br />
One question though, does anyone know good places to get LOY maps, like Dulak Harbor, Gulf of Gunthak, etc, etc, etc ?</div></div><hr />

((printable versions and downloadable complete sets for the LoY map feature!))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">question .... i was wondering if the spell can be mq'd by me turning in the flask / shard  killing the mobs and letting the other shaman in need of the spell loot and turn in the items .... is this possible ?  anyone tried it yet ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Myst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did this a couple of weeks ago at 50 but not solo, had a 52 druid along.  The hard part is getting the drunks and not the adds...you can do the elementals solo easy I pulled with slow and only 1 came at a time.  All of the componets are no drop I don't know what would happen if your lower level looted the elementals and then tried the turn in there wasn't any faction adjustments that I remember so I guess you could try it...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Probably not.  Seems like most LoY era quests give invisible character flags.  Without having already turned in the flask, I bet the NPC would eat the drops of the elementals.  You'll have to drag the shaman in need of the spell to dulak to get the flask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Larsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gawd this quest is easy.<br />
<br />
I got really lucky it seems- 2nd pirate droped flask.<br />
<br />
Follow the advice in the sticky thread about the dead spot.<br />
Check building invis, pull with slow back to dead spot.  Db at 44, killed 2 np with no pet, 2 Bliz Blast and some melee, with a root to end it.<br />
<br />
Swam out, killed elementals, got a major game changing spells in 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
BTW still can't get *&amp;^*%$ Can II tho .<br />
<br />
Is this DAOC or what?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah it is possible to MQ this quest.  I just recently helped a guildie with this quest because she was having no luck with the flask.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this is what I did for her.<br />
<br />
Killed 5 pirates looted flask... <br />
<br />
handed the flask into the sea spirit and then the stone...<br />
<br />
now this is where it gets interesting :)<br />
<br />
when the mobs spawned i pulled and she made the mistake of ae'ing... well of course she ae'd the sea spirit and died fairly quickly.  So after I killed the mob, I went ahead and looted the first part and then agroed the second mob so it wouldn't despawn... <br />
<br />
Since she was bound in PoK and it was about 4 in the morning it took her about 20 minutes to find a ride and get back to me... anyways there I was letting a stupid elemental chase me around and around and around.. till finally she showed up we killed the second mob and she looted the second piece.<br />
<br />
I then turned in my piece, she turned in hers and received the spell.<br />
<br />
So in a nutshell, I basically did the entire quest for her and we still got her the spell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I found invising, targeting mob, and running out then nuking i 90% of the time got pirate solo, at 44. other 10% i got just two of four or so, went pretty easy. And for the final fight, solo pullable at 44 and very very easy. let doggy tank and nuke twice with BB and dead, repeat. scribe spell. woot got mine today good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">20 min!! from PoK to Gunthak??<br />
Heck, just SoW and run thru warrens, I do it all the time, it takes about 5 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just make sure you arent still targetting the sea spirit when you get ready to attack Flotsam or Jetsam. Heh...I forgot to retarget and accidentally attacked the spirit (who is red at 62), and he ate my 61 pet in about 5 seconds and then came after me. Fortunately, I was able to escape and get back in time to kill the two mobs and get my spell.</div></div><hr />
