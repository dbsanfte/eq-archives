<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are some good arguments here and I will collect those and pass them along.   I will pass along the concerns regarding healing considering the damage the mobs dish out, as well as the concerns that Slow is becoming a useless tool as the fights happen to quickly and often slow is resisted.  We will work together to find other issues that I should forward along.<br />
<br />
You know, I have emails in my box from representatives of several classes, all claiming that their class is broken and needs to be seen to immediately.  All of them demand more, more DPS, more damage mitigation, more healing.  It is the responsibility of our designers to make sure that each class is distinct and valuable, granting more of these things to everyone depletes the classes.  That is a much tougher challenge than you might comprehend, especially since many of you live in the microcosm that is your chosen play class.  And should the team give in to all of these demands,  the classes will lose their distinction.  <br />
<br />
So before you demand that we open up dialogue with you, before you demand I visit your site (as opposed to the 10 other classes that are demanding the same thing) make sure what you are asking for is not merely to &quot;keep up with the Jones's&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Someone asked in this thread that I should visit and post what I expect of you.  All I expect of you is open polite dialogue.  Posts that flame me or SOE will most likely not see my name somewhere in the replies.<br />
<br />
I am going to close this thread as this really is not the place for this discussion.  I will continue to visit the Shaman's Crucible (and I do visit it at least once a week) and post when I have something to add.  <br />

<br />
He does also make some nice points.<br />
<br />
[U]Now, I am sure every class feels left behind in one way or the other.  But, I think the biggest question is, &quot;how well can my class contribute in a group and in a raid, in this GoD expansion&quot;<br />
<br />
Well, I have heard complaints from just about every class, most of which had valid points. (These complaints were seen after the sewer trials)<br />
SK/Pal = &quot;We drop like flys now.  We cannot stand up to these mobs for more then a couple of rounds.  All I do is just suck up all the clerics mana, in which they are the only class that can keep us alive.  Our class is useless, exept for the dps it does&quot;<br />
<br />
Mag = &quot;We have nothing good to offer.  Groups are looking for more then just dps now.  Our only other utility is CotH, but that wont make us be sought after by groups.  Why would a group want to invite a class, in which all they can do is lay down some dps.&quot;<br />
<br />
Enchanter = &quot;I cant believe they took away our only means for being wanted in groups &quot;charm&quot;.  All we got now is our mez, slow, and mana buff, all of which can be substituted by other classes.  And all of those creates a great amount of agro, so we die all the time anyhow.&quot; <br />
<br />
Clerics = &quot;With all the spam healing we have to do to keep everyone else alive, we create a tremendous amount of agro.  And yet if we dont keep our tanks alive everyone dies anyhow. So we are screwed either way&quot;<br />
<br />
Necro = &quot;we are the least sought after class there is.  Our primary abilities are dps and feeding mana.  But now,  our dps has droped dramatically from the low HP these mobs have.  Our dot spells arent usefull as they once were.&quot;<br />
<br />
Shaman = &quot;ALL of our spells are obsolete.  Our slows can be substituted by 3 other classes, our heals are a joke, and we have no time for dps after we debuff the mob because of the little hp these mobs have.&quot;<br />
<br />
Warrior = &quot;Our tanking abilities suck, due to the fact that we cannot keep agro.  In order for us to stay alive, we need to keep the healer alive. Our taunt button is just not doing it anymore from the increased spam healing that needs to be given to us.&quot;<br />
<br />
Look at the trend here btw.   Most classes are unsatisfied with their usefullness due to the high dps and low hp these mobs have.  <br />
<br />
SO, what can the Designers do to fix it so everyone is happy, where classes are ballanced, and yet is still VERY challangeing at the same time ??????????</div></div><hr />

Brenlo who knows very well what a Shaman is and leveled one past 50.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what pisses me off is they play the &quot;woe is us game designers who have to balance these classes&quot; card... yet they keep adding even more classes to the game... *** did we need BST or BER again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It certianly would be nice if this thread stayed productive for at least once.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That is possibly one of the worst posts i've ever seen out of Brenlo.<br />
<br />
There are some very major and valid concerns for a few classes at the moment, Shamans perhaps being at the forefront. As it stands Paladins, Shadow Knights, Mages, Shamans, and Berzerkers (yes i know they are new, but they do suck at the moment) are absolutely horrid in the context of GoD, and in some cases long before that. And those are just the worst cases. Outside the holy trinity alot of classes are having very valid issues. <br />
<br />
But i'm sure they will just find some ways to make Warriors and Clerics even more required. Lord knows raids weren't enough, now single group content! Next thing you know, you won't be able to solo without them (that's sarcasm btw).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">BTW, any warrior, enchanter and cleric concerns at the moment are just fluff. Check any of the guilds far along in GoD progression, and look at their cleric rosters as well as which type of tank they use to do their raid encounters, as well as their GoD trials. Also try doing Ikkinz, Vexd and Tipt without an enchanter, find out how hard it is to replace them. Those classes need to shut their trap at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">BTW, any warrior, enchanter and cleric concerns at the moment are just fluff.<br />
<br />
Look, I didnt say that their complaints are worthy of change. I just said that is what they complain about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">See, but at the same time yer invalidating other actual problems by listing them in the same way. <br />
<br />
There are ALOT of valid complaints, from a multitude of classes, and it is wrong to lump them all together as if they are all just &quot;keeping up with the jones's&quot;.<br />
<br />
Brenlo is absolutely wrong in the way he's attacking this problem, but that's really nothing new from SoE. Lord knows if they'd actually listen to the player base (and not individuals or individual communities) then we'd be in alot better shape.<br />
<br />
The easiest comparison is Warriors vs SKs/Knights. They completely screwed the pooch in regards to rebalancing these three classes that were not that far off to begin with considering a Warriors huge raid role (and huge agro over a period of time). But they decided to only listen to the warriors concerns and now SKs and Paladins are pretty much as effective tanking as a Shaman. In fact, due to the high DPS and low HPs of these mobs, it makes sense to use a Beastlord or Ranger to tank due to their no hit discs (Weaponshield for rangers). The most glaring example of this is when you have a chanter with a hasted Pooka vs Jhiru in Tipt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Warriors need good gear and a great aggro weapon -- I'm thinking BoW -- to do GoD.  It's not an expansion for people not up to that level.  However, at least they CAN be important, even pivotal, once they get their AA and gear.  Not so the pally/SK.  Even time-geared hybrid tanks with 400 AA get munched unless they have multiple healers in their group -- and still have an excellent chance of dying and a group wipe anyway.  Warriors complaints about GoD are the same ones pre-GoD -- aggro.  If your guild can't get you a BoW, they are not ready for GoD.  You wouldn't be very good outside GoD either, most likely, if you're not even at that level as a warrior, so they really have no reason to complain about GoD nerfing them.<br />
<br />
GoD brought back the holy trinity of cleric/warrior/chanter with a vengeance.  Any of those guys complaining is being short-sighted and flat out wrong.  You don't have to play much to realize that.<br />
<br />
Clerics complaining they die?  Umm...welcome to the club?  Chanters complaining they die?  Um...ditto?  I've been on countless raids where the only people dying were the shamans and maybe the MT's.  If you aren't prepared to die in the game, I'd just suggest you find another game.  Demanding content be &quot;fixed&quot; because you die sometimes is almost...disturbing.  Come on now!<br />
<br />
It's not at all fair to try to smooth over everything everyone says by just saying, hey, it's the same for everyone, lighten up!  And realize how limited your vision is, especially compared to ours!<br />
<br />
Puh-lease.  That's not even trying.  Any kind of discriminating thinking brings you to the point of making a few judgments sooner or later, not coming up with reasons why you shouldn't or don't have to.<br />
<br />
Hybrid tanks have become virtually useless classes in the trials alone -- nobody is going to invite them for their DPS.  Shamans -- well, we've had problems for a while, but GoD just crystallized them for the higher end shamans.<br />
<br />
For the lower end people, things are more balanced.   We should not expect everyone to be able to march into GoD with crap gear and low AA.  We should, however, also expect that people of the appropriate level of gear and AA can all make very significant, very positive contributions.<br />
<br />
We don't want people to abandon classes or flood into classes with every expansion.  There should be no iron-clad, clear &quot;winner&quot; among classes, with the rest by default turned either into losers.  Or just not even being played anymore, taking them out of the running entirely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree all calsses can be easily thrown into 3 catogories in GoD : the demanded and nearly imposible to replace : 1) clerics warrior (and if charm works or CC is required for boss fight(ikk1) chanters.<br />
2) the good to add classes: bards rogues monks druids chanters(if charm doesnt work)<br />
and 3) the rest ...<br />
<br />
also things that should be looked into: HoTs taking BUFF slots. with mobs procing stuff that blocks slots and the abdundance of realy good &quot;click effects&quot; people are running out of slots to put stuff in. and chances are very good(like 75%) that your HoT wont stick(that if you even bother with it since well its better to just put your mana and CASTING TIME into real tnargs to ensure that you even do something wich could posibly be noticed...)<br />
but what seriously kills my fun in the game is:<br />
I knew i wasnt that important on raids especialy if other shamans were around . i accepted this since i atleast was good in after raids single group stuff. however this is no more and i seriously begin to think about even logging in because what point was it to be online again? they dont need me for trials, they dont realy need me for raids, oh yea i guess i should think about soloing.. oh joy and i thought the shaman strenght was groups all the years..<br />
I know brenlo is probably posting soon in the typical arogant manner for sony that all is fine and we just see the grass is greener etc and then next step the mostlikely announce a cleric warrior enchanter upgrade so that those classes can fit the requirements their mobs put in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Brenlo who knows very well what a Shaman is and leveled one past 50.<br />
<br />
This scared me the most. At level 50 I would of said the same thing but also understood that what I meant was that I know very well what a level 50 shaman is. In comparison a level 65 is a completely different toon.<br />
<br />
The argument that other classes are also slammed and suffering in GoD does not make our problems any less valid. It only means the expansion design has serious problems affecting the majority of classes. I know I was looking forward to a challenging expansion. Being neutered is not challenging. Reverting to the holy trinity approach to advancing in the game is not challenging.<br />
<br />
Challenging is having to learn how to balance who and what you bring to an encounter to win the encounter. That is not an option in GoD. There is no flexibility.<br />
<br />
It has been mentioned that this is still early in the expansion and changes will be made to correct this. While I hope so, I also hope those changes make the content doable but keep it difficult and challenging. Dumbing down is not what is needed. Allowing all classes to use their talents and skills to win is what is needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Disclaimer: this is not meant as insult in any way.<br />
<br />
At 50 you really don't have an idea, how playing a shaman at 60+ or 65 is - it's just a fact of the game, that game roles and playstyles evolve and change quite a lot through levelling.<br />
<br />
AND as 65 with no EP-access i have only a vague idea, what playing a EP-enabled shaman with double my hitpoints is like.<br />
<br />
So really Brenlo, your game experience as a shaman is far, far away from the level, where most of the problems are observed.<br />
<br />
Your reply and hopefully deeper looking in that topic is appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I've said it before and I'll say it again.<br />
<br />
The Gates beta test was a piece of crap.<br />
<br />
The first two weeks were unplayable because of the graphics code which was pushed which made framerate like swimming through jello.<br />
<br />
The second half the beta test was a joke since spells were rarely changed and it was difficult to get groups to test content and new abilities.<br />
<br />
So for example.  Is there any shaman here who actually had all the spells other than Plague of Daluda and Balance of the Nihil for the beta?  And was able to actually test them?  I remember having to complain the last week of the beta that Breath of Trushar was messed up before they fixed it.<br />
<br />
Did anyone notice during the beta that EVERY red con mob was IMMUNE to slow?  Don't the designers see that there is a problem with this blanket flagging?  That maybe they are screwing four classes including most prominently shaman?<br />
<br />
It is now that all these problems are coming to light because now is when we are really beta testing this expansion.  Of course this is nothing new, and this has happened in basically every major expansion since Kunark.<br />
 <br />
It is very important for the designers and producers to recognize this and see that they might have to make major changes to content and character balance after the fact.  This is not class envy, or dilution, it is a reasonable request to get what we payed $29.95 for this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am going to close this thread as this really is not the place for this discussion.

<br />
     Well he haven't post ,so all our post were absolutly uninteresting for him  :D  And it's really dishonnest to say that warrior and cleric complaint because they don't. <br />
They biggest problem with class balance is class ability and diversity have decrease little by little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Brenlo responded to my email in which I highlighted that the issues isn't a class envy one.  It's a content design one.<br />
<br />
Plain and simple, shaman are not equipped to handle fights that are 30 - 75 seconds long.   I think this is the important thing to stress.   Our &quot;over time nature&quot; is not applicable in this expansion, nor the last.  We need to be given the tools to adapt to this content.  There is a start, in the new slow.  Love it or hate it  (I think it can be tuned), it is better designed for the fast paced nature of GoD.  What I don't understand is that that spell is followed by 2 over time spells.<br />
<br />
The only mob I have ever cast the new disease dot on is a luclin boss, certainly not a POP, LDON or GOD one.<br />

For Brenlo's reply to my email.<br />
<br />
Let's try to keep things positive and focused.  Right now we are talking about GoD and GoD issues, not BoT or LDON easy or whatever else.  If changes are made, they will be made to the NO DROP spells that are coming from GoD.  Meaning you must be doing GoD content, and facing the issues that GoD content brings to obtain the spells.  So it won't affect balance in previous content as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Henora,<br />
<br />
i disagree with your view that this is a pure GoD issue (as i already posted somewhere else). As you stated yourself, this is also an issue for ALL present and future encounters with hard hitting mobs and short duration.<br />
<br />
Mind you, i am realistic enough to know, not much can and will be done about this GENERAL problem outside of GoD itself. Still let me be opposed to that limited view of the problem ;).<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet, more expansions with design like this will come. Limiting us completely to GoD in that discussion will hurt us in the future.<br />
<br />
Other than that, cheers and congrats for your very good communicating with Brenlo. Nicely done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">to be honest the Way GoD set out i think is unbalanced for alot of classes. or more it seems to assume that poeple are already end of GoD equiped to do it. not elemental or time. and that causes all classes problems.<br />

<br />
I'd agree that this isn't just about GoD.  It was obvious by the end of LDoN that these issues existed and would only be exasperated if Gates content was the similar in pace to LDoN.<br />
<br />
One thing to think of though as you point out is what happens once people are equipped with gates gear and have just that much more DPS and defensive equipment and abilities?<br />
<br />
I suspect that tanks are going to be in the 15k-17k hp range by the end of Gates.  That is assuming items in the range of 300 to 400 hps and that the best warriors at this point in time have on the order of 12k hps. DPS will probably go up by 20-30% for melees with the very best weapons. If anything by the time Gates is nearing its end if nothing happens to our spells we're going to be in an even bigger world of hurt in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

3. Berserkers have no crits: every other pure melee class has innate crits. I believe even pallys, sks, and rangers have them too. This leaves berserkers the only non caster class without crits. Beats dont count cause they got a pet and the pet uses spells.<br />

The Ber class is too new to comment on balance imo. All it's details haven't been ironed out yet. None of which really detract from the fact that you are on a shaman board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'd agree that this isn't just about GoD.  It was obvious by the end of LDoN that these issues existed and would only be exasperated if Gates content was the similar in pace to LDoN.<br />
<br />
I'd agree that it isn't just about GoD either.  I posted about some of these issues back in December, before GoD was even announced.  <br />
<br />
However, a lot of our conversations get bogged down with folks saying that they do just fine in BoT and other zones.  So shaman aren't broken, everything is fine.  This is what I want to avoid.  <br />
<br />
We are also specifically talking about GoD spells and what can be done to make them more suitable to the roles we are forced to take in the new expansion content (and it would be applicable to older content, like LDON as well).  I can't say I know everything, and that is why I don't play the chat with developers meta-game of secrecy.  I want them to listen to me, but not as the only voice.  I can't say what is best for all shamans, but I can tell them where there are problems.  Right now, there are problems in GoD.  Right now the team is focused on GoD.  It seems like the right time to discuss these problems with GoD and how either content or spells or our class gets tuned so that things work better.  If the game is going to keep going in this direction of fast fights that it has for the last 3 expansions, I want it to be recognized that this is contrary to every tool that we have.<br />
<br />
I dunno guys, Brenlo has been polite and he even, as I posted in the other thread, says he is going to try to speak with the developers to get a handle on what their ideas are about &quot;What is a shaman&quot; and what are our roles now in this changing game.  I would encourage people to let sleeping dogs lie and get over the bitterness... or at least put it aside for a while.  Maybe nothing happens as a result of this, but he is listening and reading.  I would like to show him the crucible full of people who care about the class and the game and are willing to be both thougtful and insightful, I've seen it before and it was impressive.  I think we didn't start off on the right foot with him, but we can try again, if he can.  Keep in mind, 10,000 to one is scary odds when heading into hostile territory.<br />
<br />
I know we have other problems, but right now is an opportunity to grab the attention of people working on the new expansion stuff, right now.  I am hoping that if we narrow the focus we will have at least some of our problems worked on, instead of none.  I am hopeful that some of that changes that can be made can be something that helps on all levels.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Rogues get innate crits on throwing weapons, and rangers do on bow attacks, warriors do all around (I think.  Played a rogue and ranger, but never a warrior - too dull)<br />
<br />
I would think that, with all the focus on throwing as a skill, berserkers would get criticals with that.  (Considering the damage on even their best summoned throwing axe isn't all that great, since throwing damage isn't calculated like melee damage is)<br />
<br />
But, then again, berserkers are new.  Of course they have alot of issues.  I dont, honestly, see the point behind having added the class myself.  Seems like just asking for more work balancing a game even more that's hard enough as it is.<br />
<br />
Back to the point of the thread, though, even i've figured that we have problems with fast, low-hp fights, and i'm not near the top end yet myself.  I group a lot higher then my level, and almost always findmy DoTs are not worth the mana to cast, and by the time my nuke finishes casting (even focused) the mob is already dead.<br />
<br />
And I have even weaker heals :)  No Tnargs yet for me, fighting mobs that hit very hard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I could list everything with the shaman class that doesn't work in pvp, but I'd be writing a novel. Come to think of it, nothing really works in pvp. It's a non isssue though, as SOE clearly doesn't care.<br />
<br />
There is a difference between getting a resist message and getting: you must target an NPC for this effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I think some of the things that need to happen are what is happening now.   Dev's and SoE staff scanning class boards for the cheapest game insight you can get ... free commentary.   <br />
<br />
There are several things that can be done to help fix things.  Things like the blast variable % heal idea being discussed in another thread on this board.  <br />
<br />
And if you can do percent CH heals and think along lines of variable % heals ... why not the same with DD’s and to some extend Dot’s.   <br />
<br />
A variable % DD's would act just like current CH heals.   Say max effect is 25% (just a number for example - could be any percent) of remaining HP per each cast.   This way any new spell would not trivialize old world content and new at least per spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">You know what i think GoD did ? It showed everyone what the people in Time and Elementals ( places locked out to the none raiding player ) what you all were talking about. I mean at the time the hardest thing they would see is a Hard LDoN, which while its challanging, its not near trying to heal fro a GoD group.<br />
<br />
<br />
So gratz to GoD for uniting us?<br />

Thers a joke in there, i just know it...</div></div><hr />
