<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I was finally awarded the Spear of Fate !! :D <br />
It was rather easy to do with a 60 rogue, 2 Fire pets, 3 clerics, one druid and 2 shaman (myself included).  We pulled Rak out, sicced pets on him, and stayed just out of his AE range, but still close enough to heal the pets. Took about 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
This was done with MQing the Tear btw, as we have not had much success getting to Fear when the Golems were up and we had a few Tears floating around. I did every part of the epic quest up to that point, and turned in Ghiosks books a second time to max TrueSpirit faction.<br />
<br />
Thanks to my guild, Evening Reign (http://www.eveningreign.net) on Druzzil Ro, and thanks to all of you who have posted info and strategy on these forums :)<br />
<br />
Onward to Oracleness !</div></div><hr />

I've found the spear of fate to be useful for reaching those hard to reach itchy spots on my back. Like.... right..... here...... ahhhhh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenweir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I saw two shamans complete their Rak fights last night (me not being one of them, grr).  Had 3 mages, 1 epic mage with air pet, and 2 other mages casting their highest earth pets, they were chain casting pet.  Had a druid and cleric healing with one good main tank, both went smoothly i hope i get to try mine soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizmonde</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Grats on the weapon, I hope to one day make it that far. One question though. What does MQ'ing mean? sorry but I have been away for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Seanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Grats SneakyB! <br />
<br />
And Grizmonde, MQ=Multi-Questing=Having another player turn in parts for the quested piece before you do, or in this case having someone else turn in the Tear to Rak, and after Rak dies you loot the scale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Morb, Griz and Seanus.  :)<br />
