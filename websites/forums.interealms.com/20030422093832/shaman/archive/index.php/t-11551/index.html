<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently at level 55, and only have about 2k.  I am trying trying to get some more money, then sell my EDT and buy a Tae Ew Chain Tunic.  I also want a couple good melee weapons.  But 2k isn't going to get my crap.  I have asked around for places to get some money, but everyone just tells me Rathe Mountains.  I've been there alot since level 34 for money, but it's ALWAYS over camped on MT server.  All of the planes loot sucks so far, I've heard that LoY loot wasn't very good, I went to Crystal Caverns today for Geo's, they were camped, and figured they would be for the next few hours, IGs in everfrost aren't bad, but the 6 minute spawn time sucks.<br />
<br />
If someone has any good places to get some money for a 55 Shaman, PLEASE post them here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kiegar Dar`Grunt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe the Geos in WL? They are higher level and rarely camped. I think you'd be able to take them solo. Might wanna research that though, never been there, But a friend of mine goes and hes does well, get about 8k a day.</div></div><hr />

i picked up a Worn Golden Tooth (haste item):<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19560<br />
Patchwork Jetsam (30/35 2hb)<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=19279<br />
2 x Blue Diamonds, 3 x Sapphires, and about a half-dozen misc 50+ plat gems, plus a slew of misc vendor trash in a single night in Dulak  (2hb was on the way over to dulak, an aggro skellie)<br />
<br />
plus finished Stoicism.  and about 350pp in cash.  that's without really trying too hard, soloing the whole time.<br />
<br />
so loot in LoY isn't too shabby.  i soloed a bit in Nadox this morning, and i'll probably go back there tonite and see how it goes.<br />
