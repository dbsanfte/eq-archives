<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Benlo &amp; Co. As you can see the Shaman population is still up in arms regarding 'Class Balance'<br />
<br />
I understand that many issues may be kept under wraps while in development.<br />
<br />
Please could you however just post to confirm that you have read the issues explained under the many threads, and if possible say whether the Shaman Balance is still being looked at??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you missed the memo Zann where we were asked specifically NOT to post direct questions to Brenlo and SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, noo he addressed Benlo, (Mr. JLo) NOT Brenlo.  I betcha if JLO were a Shaman she'd get something done for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nah, she's clearly too busy casting 'grow' on her booty to champion the shaman cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/kneeslap Kamidari ... LMAO :)<br />
<br />
I think Zann missed that really big long thread where Brenlo and Rytan came and made a few posts ... and pretty much informed us that shaman are right where they want us.<br />
<br />
So, anyways. Pudding, anyone?<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">OH .....  Sorry must have missed that thread. /em embarrassed<br />
<br />
So I guess we will never know what (if anything) is happening.</div></div><hr />

Sure, if your into pimples and large scars on said booty.  You know if you would stop scratching your booty it might heal a little better.  Not to mention the skid marks on your armor.</div></div><hr />
