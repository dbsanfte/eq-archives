<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone EVER seen these 2 spells drop off anything anywhere?<br />
<br />
I heard some report that one of em drops off some vampire in tenebrous, supposedly teh other drops in the deep?  Anyone know the locations of either?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One drops off the flying vampyre at the top of the tower in Tenebrous Mtns (sorry, I dont remember his name, but I have seen him).<br />
<br />
The other from 'an enraged underbulk' in The Deep, a mob with placeholders...location, no idea.<br />
<br />
This just from what I've read, I have neither spell yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why does Verant have two spells that are used by almost all casters drop off a total of two mobs?  They arent even very good spells! doesnt make sense</div></div><hr />

directions is right, then left.  a decent group can fight in and hold spot easy.  decent exp.  pop is every 20 minutes with  possible ph's.  spot is the back left hand corner at the dead end.<br />
<br />
not that great spell?  never to have to buy wings again is great, let alone being able to cast at any time (meaning after a CR)<br />
<br />
editted for spelling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the vamp in tenebrous is Trilexior Aeridia, the spell locations thread does not lie, i was the first to post here with that info ;) he's a 59ish chanter so bring a friend or two, and be ready to camp him cause it can take a lot of kills to get the spell. never carrying fish scales again is very very nice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Not using the reagents I'm sure is SSSOOO nice.  I can't say as I don't have either spell yet.  But I agree, why the heck would VI put these spells, used by like EVERY caster on a grand total of 2 rare-ish mobs?!  I mean, almost every drop spell has at least 2 or 3 places it can be gotten, why make these so hard to get when everyone wants them?  I know I know, making them overly common would put the wing dealers out of business and ruin the fishing industy, somehow breaking the game, but still, jeez, cut us some slack here VI.  2 mobs?!</div></div><hr />

Due to level restrictions you CANNOT CAST EB OR LEVITATION ON CHARACTERS UNDER LEVEL 45!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Yes, that's right.  If you want to be nice to a n00b or a young player, you have to carry components anyway.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, that's not quite correct, Tannus.  I have 2 computers a 60 shaman and a level 43 twink warrior, and can confirm with a great deal of surety that you cannot cast level 50+ spells on sub 45 characters.  You have to be 45 or higher to have a 50+ spell cast on you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Odd - I dual box with a twink warrior as well, and as soon as he dinged 42 I was able to cast all of my 50+ spells on him (I'm only 55, so the 60 spell restriction doesn't apply to me).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The named enchanter vampire Trilexior suffers from the same curse as the rest of the flying named in the coterie castle.  When they get to low life they run, and their pathing is a little messed up, so they get snagged on one of the crypts and poof, leaving no corpse.  If they poof live, you don't even get xp :(<br />
<br />
I've bug reported this ad nauseum, given that Tri is the only drop mob for the EB spell, and even said something about it on Developer's Corner.  Absor emailed me back on this so I know he at least read it.  <br />
<br />
As an aside, there are several named flying vamps in the castle.  They drop cool things like ruby crowns, and jacinths and rubies (yes, I'm being sarcastic, but this is the general loot on the nameds).  While the vamps are fun and even challenging to fight, their xp is total garbage.<br />
<br />
I'll keep trying, but oh boy, they're not making it easy to get this spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aye - I have seen a couple named ones poof too.  To stop them running, we started using &quot;Ghetto snare.&quot;  This basically consists of pulling a lowbie vamp add during the fight.  The named won't run if they have help :).  I have never seen EB drop though.  <br />
<br />
I really probably won't try for the spell too hard now.  Its easier to get Ammy of the Grey Waste for all your friends than camp the spell. <br />
<br />
A majority of people 45+ that you can cast this on will have an eb item of some kind already.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The prime use for this spell that I can see for high levels is corpse recovery in evil airless zones like Kedge. <br />
<br />
Fish scales are not commonly available on vendors (except that erudite chickie in EC) and if I'm dead and waiting for a rez, the last thing I want to do is hit the bank, buy a fishing pole and some bait and then go fishing so I can get my poor mangled body :)<br />
<br />
Same deal for Lev.  Batwings aren't commonly available everywhere, and especially not on Velious, which is a particularly death-prone continent :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">We did a small raid this weekend of the main coterie castle in Tenebrous, hoping to have a copy of Everlasting Breath drop.  8 people 53-59.  First... Trilexior aggroed us while we were outside the castle and actually left the castle without provocation to join the party, so we fought him on the slope behind it.  He dropped... you guessed it.... sulphur crystals.  <br />
<br />
Then, while we were forming up on the back balcony, we were aggroed by two other named and a few other trash mobs.  This is highly unusual and definitely was not the case when pathing on the nameds was broken.<br />
<br />
Whatever Verant did to the vampires, I would strongly suggest at least 3 full groups.  Why anyone would want to have a 3 person raid for sulphur and the odd ruby crown, given that the spell is a rare drop and Tri respawns only every 60 minutes, is beyond me.<br />
<br />
I've bug reported it, but hey, I doubt that there are ears to hear or eyes to see over there :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">3 full groups? when I camped it was usually with 4 characters, when I camped it for the spell they ranged 54-60, now we do it for xp and cash and we're all 60. A lot of the centurions are green to 60, the generals and nameds are a little tougher but no mob there is over 55 from what i've seen. hell we used to get bored and pull stuff from the two nearby vamp camps outside up into our spot on the 2nd floor of the castle, nothin like a train of vamps with the triplets and nameds adding ;)<br />
<br />
but seriously, unless they radically changed all those mobs, this place can be done with 3 60's a lot quicker than 3 groups. it's a lot more than &quot;the odd&quot; ruby crown, nameds drop plat items or very decent midlevel items (really nice stuff, but nothin ToV style) almost every time, I've made 5k in a day there off all the crap. Note that general boots and capes sell to merchants for 50ish pp each, that's a ton of the cash right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Point is, Stonienogg, the castle is broken.  You can't control the aggro anymore.<br />

Go with your 3 60s and try it.  I bet you haven't done it since the last patch.  And make sure to camp a sprinkler cleric out beforehand for cr.  It's not the way it was before.  Let me say that again.  It's not the way it was before.<br />

I can't tell you how upset I am with this current change.  It's not worth going there anymore, not for any amount of non-stackable coterie gear.<br />

I regularly did it with myself (60 shaman) and a second computer (55 druid).  Druid basically was there for snare/thorns, and ES arms dot. Only thing that ever changed was the named started dropping loot more frequently, that I could ever tell.<br />
<br />
Dunno what you call broke, but I did it regularly up until two weeks ago. No spell drop btw, although I did get some other drops.  Quite good gem drops though.<br />
<br />
Only thing to watch is the timing, and Trilex's fear spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Originally posted by Mirabilis Dictu <br />
Yup, you did it prior to the patch.  Try again.<br />
<br />
Sorry, pre-patch, post-patch, makes no difference. It is not broken.<br />
<br />
Trileskior is a weenie.. he's not the problem.  Try the SK.  Yes, there's an SK.<br />
<br />
Yes, Trilex is a wuss, even though I had to put up mr against him.  Trilex has never been a problem.  Yes, I'm fully aware of the SK vamp, and yes, I've killed him.  Routinely.  Its not a problem, if you can take Trilex out, you can take him out.<br />

BTW, you accidently posted your reply as a new topic :)</div></div><hr />

I haven't taken any further action (e.g., petitioning, bug reporting), although in retrospect I really should. Perhaps I'll do both tonight and post back with the results.<br />

Update: <br />
<br />
I petitioned and bug reported this evening (5/7/2002). The guide that talked to me (five hours later :rolleyes: ) didn't know the answer and logged to check the chat channels. He was unable to get a definitive answer from anyone else that was online, and said that it could be a bug, or that there could be three versions of the scroll that drop. He advised me to fill out a bug report and to hold onto the scroll in case it gets fixed.<br />
<br />
I imagine it's a bug, and I guess I'll just be patient. It's not like it's an indispensable spell. Maybe it will get fixed when they get around to adjusting the herb prices.<br />
