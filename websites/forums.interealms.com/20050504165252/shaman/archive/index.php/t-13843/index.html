HER DIARY <br />
<br />
Saturday night I thought he was acting weird We had made plans to meet at a bar to have a drink I was shopping with my friends all day long, so I thought he was upset at the fact that I was a bit late, but he made no comment. <br />
<br />
Conversation wasn't flowing so I suggested that we go somewhere quiet so we could talk, he agreed but he kept quiet and absent. <br />
<br />
I asked him what was wrong he said nothing I asked him if it was my fault that he was upset. <br />
He said it had nothing to do with me and not to worry. <br />
<br />
On the way home I told him that I loved him, he simply smiled and kept driving. <br />
<br />
I can't explain his behavior; I don't know why he didn't say I love you too When we got home I felt as if had lost him, as if he wanted nothing to do with me anymore. <br />
<br />
He just sat there and watched T.V. he seemed distant and absent. <br />
<br />
Finally I decided to go to bed, about 10 minutes later he came to bed and to my surprise he responded to my caress and we made love, but I still felt that he was distracted and his thoughts where somewhere else. <br />
<br />
I decided that I could not take it anymore so I decided to confront him with the situation but he had fallen asleep. <br />
<br />
I started crying and cried until I too fell asleep I don't know what to do I'm almost sure that his thoughts are with someone else My life is a disaster. <br />
<br />
<br />
