<br />
PoV -  Razorfriend's can easily be pulled out from the cave single using harmony and can all be snared/rooted for bow kiting. This goes for Crystalline Gomes as well. These give 6-7% AA per kill at level 65.<br />
<br />
HoH - I've seen wizards kiting in the basement so I suppose it's possible. Not sure if they give more xp then PoV.<br />
<br />
CoD - Tried rooting and shooting the zone in mobs. Low resists but they only gave 2% AA per kill at level 65. I didn't see a safe path towards higher level mobs. Haven't spent much time in there though.<br />
<br />
PoS - Haven't tried soloing anything here yet. Not sure what does and what doe not summon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">luterin</div><div class="date">11-28-2002, 04:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">HoH is pretty safe to bowkite in, avoid the SW corner with yellow con mobs and also avoid the &quot;spirits&quot; since they are immune to changes in movement, otherwise its easy.<br />
<br />
PoS is worthless as what I have found out anyway, everything there summons.<br />
<br />
Most interesting zone to solo in is PoTa, but you need quite a bit of luck along with lots of knowledge of the zone/mobs, but kinda interesting after a long fight to kill a red con mob.</div></div><hr />

Takes a while, and its enjoyment level is only slightly above being bored in the first place, but I typically get 5 to 6% of AA per kill.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Timberglen</div><div class="date">11-29-2002, 03:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the PoS cave frogs summon, but the zone entrance ones do not.  <br />
<br />
Now... Two things to beware of:<br />
<br />
- The citizens *WILL* assist the frogs.  Harmony of Nature works like a champ on these.  Luckily they have a small aggro range, but they'll heal that frog, and well...it sucks when they do.<br />
<br />
- There are stupid roamers that occasionally get near the zone in.  When they do this, make your kites smaller.  The Southeastern corner allows you to do this.  <br />
<br />
<br />
The frogs (what I solo) take me roughly 25 minutes per kill, but my gear isnt up to par.  I've just started playing again, and I only have AM2.  They are snareable, and are rootable.  They do not summon.  They also drop Etheral parchments once every blue moon.  I can't say what they give AAxp'd as Im not level 65 yet.  In level 63, normal xp being 100% they give roughly 60% of a blue solo xp.  I've not found these to be extremely worthwhile honestly, but I guess some xp is better than none. :)</div></div><hr />

They take about 15-20 minutes a kill for me with AM2/EQ/DCOTS.  At level 62 ( I am holding here untill AM3) I get about 2 blues of AA a kill.</div></div><hr />

It's really not worth the time though.  You'll get much better exp in a group.</div></div><hr />

And yeah I know exp is better in a group but with my play time its not always easy to get a group so I just like to have options available :) If I have like a couple of hours good to just kill a few mobs and not spend all the time LFG<br />

That's weird, I've always gotten 6% AA per kill at 65 there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ellizzbeth</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 01:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Groups tend to be better generally, but if you want, I suggest getting Kei and haste, and am3/EQ is needed.<br />
<br />
in HoH ~ Hunt the humans in plate (guardians), but avoid the 63+ Sentries, since they are immune to root/snare.  Invis and run to a safe spot (some spirits see invis btw), then harmony if needed, and snare.  Resists occur here and there on snare, almost never on root (our 63 one).  Shoot arrows and use dots, as a nuke will break the root.  Some of the rooms are large enough to operate in, as are the halls where they widen out.<br />
<br />
I have however encountered some bugs here: pathing mostly, and sometimes, somehow, you can agro basement mobs who train the bleep out of you from nowhere.  Have noted that if they are camped and being cleared, this doesn't happen.  I also think agro might be bugged there - I have seen some of the spirits act very strangely (could invis and remove agro, but as soon as uninvis'd, they come after you, then invis and they unagro again).  I had a guide test some things, and he bug reported it.<br />
<br />
Parchments are now super rare drops off certain mobs only.<br />
<br />
CoD is also doable if the zone in area is clear, as you have room to snare and root there, but otherwise, pretty hard since this is a dungeon (no harmony, etc.).<br />
<br />
I highly suggest duoing over soloing.  Many mobs which cannot be snared/rooted are mezzable.<br />

That is roughly twice the exp rate that I can get from Velks soloing.<br />
<br />
Are the pulls constant when soloing in the planes?<br />
What of added dangers?  In velks there is like zero danger for me, since the stuff doesn't hit hard there and if there is a castle train, you can avoid those.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats compared to 1 AA every 2.5 hours roughly last night in a fast pulling POV group....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diegaron</div><div class="date">12-02-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At level 65 with AM3 and EQ with only KEI (purchased in nearby nexus) you can get about 1 AA every 3 hours in HoH.  I generally harmony pull singles and kite them around the graveyard.  They give 5-6% AA each and take about 10 minutes to kill with no haste.  I cast drifting death as I bow kite them in a circle and refresh it as soon as it wears off.  It adds nicely to damage but my low conjuration skill hurt at first.<br />
<br />
This is a boring but effective way to solo for excellent experience.  Can you get better exp. in a group?  Definitely.  I've got 1AA in 2 hour in PERFECT groups (warrior, cleric enchanter/shaman all present) in HoH where we chain pulled and had NO wipeouts.  However, in a typical group in PoP you are going to DIE and have group wipes fairly regularly.  It's a way of life in PoP.  You get NO experience while you spent 30 minutes to an hour doing CR.  And therefore, on average,  &quot;typical&quot; groups in PoP yield much less exp than you can get soloing in this manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lyrid</div><div class="date">12-03-2002, 12:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its simple to get an AA in an hour and 20 minutes or so.  I can slain the Hurricane Loroks at 8 percent xp per kill (a full 8 percent at least like 8.25 percent).  Takes me about 7.5 minutes Casting one or two nukes after root breaks to kill em.  Mobs are fairly plentiful if they aren't camped too hard, sometimes enchanters/wizards/and groups like to kill these.  <br />
<br />
They dont summon, but will jack you pretty good if you get near em, something like triple 600, they don't hit us that hard, but dont' afk near em after aggro.  They also proc Froaking Mist, and they Croak after being slained. <br />
<br />
They can drop ethereal spells.  Good xp for the effort.<br />
<br />
They are on Forest side, stay away from giants and beez, though they ave interesting drops (the beez)</div></div><hr />
