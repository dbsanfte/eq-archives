<br />
 Happy Holidays!<br />
  The holidays are here and the citizens of Azeroth are celebrating the <br />
  occasion with festive decorations and winter time activities.  Keep an<br />
  eye out for some fun and exciting surprises throughout the world!<br />
<br />
<br />
 New Dungeon - Maraudon<br />
  In the vast gray of Desolace lies the earthen tomb of Zaetar, fallen <br />
  Keeper of the Grove and son of Cenarius.* Zaetar rejected his Keeper <br />
  heritage when he joined with the princess of the chaotic earth <br />
  elementals, Theradras. Their unholy union gave birth to the misshapen <br />
  and cursed centaur, who promptly slew their father for his part in <br />
  their misbegotten creation. Fearful of Cenarius' wrath, the <br />
  grief-stricken Theradras sequestered her dead lover's body in her <br />
  secret sanctuary, the Crystal Caverns of Therramok, where she watches <br />
  over him to this day. Travelers who come to Desolace have little <br />
  trouble spotting Zaetar's tomb, for the blessing of nature that <br />
  permeates his being transformed his resting place into a verdant <br />
  paradise of flora and tranquil pools. Today, this tomb is now trodden <br />
  by the hooves of Zaetar's children, who have claimed this great cavern <br />
  as their sacred stronghold Maraudon.<br />
<br />
  Maraudon, a level 40-49 dungeon in Desolace, is now open and ready for<br />
  business.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Cloak &amp; Helm Graphics<br />
  There are now interface options that let you not display your helm <br />
  and/or cloak on your character.*These options will allow a player to wear a <br />
  cloak or helm, but not have it show up in the game world.*The check <br />
  boxes to control this functionality are in the Options menu under <br />
  &quot;Interface Options.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
 General<br />
- Players will now receive credit for killing a monster even if <br />
  they die during battle.<br />
- Players will now be able to purchase and train mounts from other <br />
  races in their faction.  However, you will first need to obtain <br />
  &quot;exalted&quot; reputation status with that race in order to do so.  <br />
  Mounts of the opposing faction are not available for purchase.<br />
- A &quot;Looking for Group&quot; channel has been added.*Additional improvements <br />
  in looking for group functionality will be added in future patches.<br />
- Daze chance has been reduced in degrees depending on the level of the <br />
  monster versus the level of the player.  Thus, a monster will have a <br />
  better chance to Daze a player equal in level than it would Dazing a <br />
  player five levels higher.<br />
- If you die in Molten Core, you will now be able to retrieve your <br />
  corpse at the Blackrock Depths instance line.<br />
- Several instance bosses and sub-bosses have had their levels slightly <br />

  drunk or sober.<br />
- Skill gain messages will no longer appear for auto-ranking class <br />
  skills when you gain a level.<br />
- Training costs for all classes are in the process of being rebalanced.  <br />
  For this patch, training costs have been adjusted for the Rogue and <br />
  Warlock classes and we will be making similar adjustments to all <br />
  classes in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
 Talents<br />
- Damage bonus for the Warrior's One-Handed Weapon Specialization <br />
  (Protection tab) increased to 2% per rank.<br />

  been fixed. This spell now correctly requires channeling.<br />
<br />

 Player versus Player<br />
- Gurubashi Arena - The arena in Stranglethorn Vale has been changed so <br />
  that free-for-all PvP will only take place on the floor of the arena, <br />
  and no longer in the stands or on the entrance ramp.* Please keep in <br />
  mind that on PvP realms, members of the opposite faction can still <br />
  attack you anywhere in the arena because Stranglethorn Vale is a <br />
  contested area.<br />

  Runecloth Bandage can be learned by visiting your faction's Artisan <br />
  First Aid questgiver.<br />
- Sell prices on Runecloth Bandages and Heavy Runecloth Bandages have <br />
  been reduced.<br />

<br />
 Quests<br />

  bandage (Linen Bandage) was working correctly in that it brought up a <br />
  channeling bar and required you to remain still while bandaging.* All <br />

  amount of experience.<br />

  use their*appropriate combat abilities.<br />

I agree that it seems they are really pushing people into dungeons.  I only played a warrior to 10 in open beta but from that experience and everything I've heard warriors do need a lot of help.</div></div><hr />

Its a significant nerf. Many times i would have to chain cast it against high level foes in pvp just to get it to stick because of resists.<br />
<br />
I just completed nature’s swiftness at 30. Had this nerf been in place I would have went Improved ghost wolf first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Snare totems did not create any sort of imbalance whatsoever. Mages, hunters, priests, warlocks, all get brutal ways of making people go away as it is.<br />
<br />
one out of every two people in the alliance it seems is a plate wearer, one of them has minimum of three lives, the horde needs more power!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still mill if you were to compare the alliance and the horde the 2 top most feared classes in the game are shaman on the horde side and pally on alliance. I have killed so many people and also have contributed to the death of many (hehe frost shock) it's amazing. Pallys seems overpowered hell they probably are but so is sham. I do have to admit tho i was expecting a different type of nerf. This one simply sucks and has nothing to do with anything.<br />
<br />
Frost shock is what we use to snare in pvp not as much earthbind totem.<br />

For getaway purposes, I try to remember to do the following:<br />
<br />
1. Taunting totem. Doesn't last long, but instacast.<br />
2. Immediately followed by the Tauren stomp ability when playing my Tauren Shammy. On the Troll, pray that the totem lasts long enough to cast Ghost Wolf<br />
3. Cast Ghost Wolf and off I go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is assuming that totems do not get resisted.  Many times when I run through high level areas, the snare effects get missed or resisted and does nothing to slow down the mob chasing me.  With the recent nerf, I will have to pray or use a potion to get away after using up one of each totems.<br />
<br />
In PvP, frost shock is great if you are fighting 1v1.  Realistically, most PvP fights are group vs group.  The snare totem was our only form of protection.  We are now only left with 1 snare totem per fight since group pvp usually lasts 10-15 sec, 20 sec tops.<br />
<br />
I agree that the instal cast, no cooldown of the snare totem previously was a bit overpowering, but introducing a 15 sec cooldown is quite a hefty nerf for the Shaman class.</div></div><hr />

We had a group of 5 level 42 to 46 Horde come over to Auberdine last Friday night. They were there for a good 45 minutes, and only bailed after some of our 50+ peeps started showing up and owning them. 1 Shaman, 2 Warriors, 2 Rogues.<br />

20 seconds tops?  Man...that 45 minutes was some of the best time I've had in this game. PVP under the controlled PVE ruleset is a blast. I was only level 28'ish and got owned several times, but I also got the killing blow on one of the Rogues twice and on the Shaman once. Aimed Shot + 5 points into talents that improve chance for crits...nice!</div></div><hr />

Hunters and pallies truly seem like the fotm/pet classes.<br />
