<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Shaman number 3 has just dinged 34. Man i forgot how good it is at the low levels. Slows almost never resisting , DoTs landing , i dont even mem malise. Straight up tanking everything. I keep making people laughing my group cause a add will come and the warrior will try to frankily get them on him and im like&quot; i got it &quot; while i stack on 3 DoTs and melee ( yes hit it ) down almost as quickly as they are on the other mob ( KEI is nice ).<br />
<br />
I really missed this level of shamanhood. I gotta say though, i really miss my aggro. In high levels when i want aggro for a offtank its not hard to do at all, at this level i need to Slow and stack DoTs then sit and if im lucky ill get aggro and be able to stand and whack on it a few times to convince it to stay on me.<br />
<br />
Its amazing to me how much KEI has changed the game at this level. Its a curse and a godsend all in one. On one hand you have a large part of people that just blow though the levels and never group with you till 55+ when PoP comes into play, which makes grouping hard at this level ( curse ), then you have the ability to change the one thing in EQ everyone hated ( downtime ) for a relitivly cheap cost. Its kinda intresting how KEI worked out like that, how everyone went to DAoC and came back to EQ saying &quot; *** is up with EQ's downtime&quot;. Was kind of a fix for the issue.<br />
<br />
Anyway, on my 3rd shaman i get my puppy again and enter into the world where the shaman becomes truly fun to play. Frogs dont make bad lil shaman i must say.<br />
<br />
<br />
So whats this post ?  A open rejoicement of the wonderful class that i love above all others....<br />
<br />
To da shaman ;)<br />
