<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How about making a class that's 70% warrior, 30% Enchanter, and 30% Cleric and being done with it.<br />
<br />
I know that comes out to 130%, but slap on a 30% exp. modifier and it'll be ok.<br />
<br />
Basically:<br />
<br />
Plate Class<br />
Weapon Skills - warrior melee table/mitigation table<br />
Cleric Spells - a few basic heals, Stun, Rez, CH, and Undead Taps<br />
Enchanter Spells - mez, sword animation pets, charm, haste, slow, invis, KEI.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else ever feel that's basically what we're heading for anyway with all the muddying of the class lines we already see?<br />
<br />
These guys are the holy trinity, how about making a new class that mix/matches pieces of the trinity and setting 'em loose on the world.<br />
<br />
They could call the class a &quot;Crusader&quot; or &quot;Sentinel&quot; ... if it's not already taken as one of the advanced class titles... I think it may be??<br />
<br />
They could possibly throw in a couple wizzie nukes and innate FD also, since monks are the ONLY class in the game that get FD as a skill rather than a spell.  And if you're an Ogre Crusader, you could have frontal stun immunity too ;)<br />
<br />
We could give them an epic quest that summons a &quot;soul sword&quot; or something to use... or a line of spell-weapons like 1h or 2h swords they could summon themselves ...<br />
<br />
(This was mostly a joke), but I still think somewhat of a mix of warrior/cleric/enchanter might be an interesting idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ancagalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hybrids in EQ are mixtures of two parent classes. To add in a third parent class, they would have to water down the core abilities of this class to the point of being non-effective. <br />
<br />
The one hybrid that really has not been done is a warrior/wizard combo, which should be called a Warlock (if that name were not already used to describe necromancers in EQ). Paladin/SK melee offence/defence capabilities with a line up of single target nukes slightly below that of druids/mages. <br />
<br />
The current knight classes are strong defensive, good utility and weak offensive characters. This knight class would be strong defensive, strong offensive with no utility. A crowd pleaser for the min/max players that are tired of playing their warriors and clerics. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">actually i recona warlock would be more like the bersker, cept no throwing axe, just dd, snare spell shield spells:)</div></div><hr />

exept for the part about BST's being shaman/monk/mage hybrids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sony has a hard enough time balancing the existing melee classes.<br />
<br />
But your point is well-taken, and definitely understood.  I'm forced to agree, with one caveat:<br />
<br />
WIth the release of this new class, every existing character on every server would automatically be reverted to it, with their currect race/gender/name.<br />
<br />
That would be the full realization of your &quot;dream&quot; =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least you would have class balance officially fixed at that point!<br />

Something like this is what I kinda hoped zerkers would be.  I had in mind the samurai from Wizardry.  Offensive machines with offensive spells thrown in, no defense to speak of.<br />
Ahhhh, Wizardry, such great games, think i still got the collection on a cd somewhere....</div></div><hr />
