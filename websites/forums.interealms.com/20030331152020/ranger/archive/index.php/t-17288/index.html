<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Starbuck_Jones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Made it to level 35 in Crystal Caverns.  Been looking for a new place to hunt.  I like the entrance to the Hole when its open.  Its a pain to get all the way there only to find a raid going on or someone else camping there.<br />
<br />
The few times ive been to Dawnshroud Peaks, so have 50-70 other people and I dont like bussy zones ( I hate Rath Mtns with all the giant killers, For every giant you kill there are 2 people complaining that you killed it.).<br />
<br />
I like to fight in zones where I dont have to wait for monsters.  I kill and then can go strait to the next one.  Camping is not fun.  Kill 4 mobs, wait 16 min, kill 4 mobs....<br />
<br />
I would like to find a place I can get about 2% exp a kill or more.  The Hole is nice I get 4% a kill there but 80% of the time ive gone there its camped.</div></div><hr />
