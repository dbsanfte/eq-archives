<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>banditx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi fellow shaman's,<br />
<br />
Well I stopped playing EQ about a year ago.. just before SoL came out.  I had a 53 Shaman when I left.  I have yet to find a game like EQ that has kept my interest.  I have been doing some reseach on the new stuff to EQ since my leave.  I was wondering if anyone had some help hints/tips/info or pretty much anything that they could input to help make my transition back into EQ easier.<br />
<br />
Info on the way the game has changed would be helpful but I would also like some info on the way that Shamans have changed over the last year or so.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First tip:  read as many of the threads on this board as you can.  What you are asking is basicly someone to condense about 1/2 the threads on the board into this one for you.  Go read it yourself.<br />
<br />
Second tip:  go to the bazaar and watch prices.  buy what you can of the current gear currently available.<br />
<br />
Third tip:  find out what you can about tradeskills and quests from POP and other expansions.  it's worth knowing about.<br />
<br />
Other than that, shaman are still shaman.  The biggest change I can think of is that when you hunt in POP, depending on the difficulty of the zone, the mobs you fight for xp hit for about 120 - 400 in the low end zones, and about 600-1200 in the high end zones.  That, and flags are a nightmare to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just some quick key things you may not have known about or would be too confusing to find in a search.<br />
<br />
With Planes of Power you now have a central zone that connects all the newbie zones together, making travel much easier.  It's also full of mid to high level quests, trainer NPCs and a central library to purchase vendored spells. <br />
<br />
Due to a bug in the past, shaman pets can now dual weild, but you need to give the wolf two 1h weapons to &quot;fool&quot;  it into dual weilding.<br />
<br />
The Legacy of Ykesha expansion introduced a new spell for shaman called Stoicism (sp).  It's basically a mini torpor and from what I've seen, extremely useful on the trip to level 60/65 and torpor/quiescence (sp).  There is also pure blood which is a group version of Disinfecting Aura.  LoY is full of nice appropriate level hunting grounds from 35 - 65 also.  Nice loot to be had there as well, might find some upgrades.<br />
<br />
Nurga and Droga have been revamped into level 45 - 55 and 56 - 65 zones, respectively.  A new zone, Veksar, has been completed and can be found at the bottom of the lake in Lake of Ill Omen (look for the temple where the bloodgills have always been).  Chardok and Solusek B have new temporary zones (Halls of Betrayel and err, Sol C - can't remember the right name suddenly).<br />
<br />
Other then that, hunting in the 1st tier planes made leveling/AAs insanely easy.  So easy in fact, that I see high level players running around in level 40 gear all the time now.  Luclin and PoP introduced zones with bountiful experience but pitiful loot.  Ran into a necro the other day weilding a stein of moggok and a havester wearing a crytalline robe from Crystal Caverns.  He was level 64 with 50 something AA and thought he was l33t heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, kinda went off on a rant there.  Dunno how much plat you have in the bank but check out the bazaar.  Tons of new decent equipment for low prices now due to LoY/Veksar.  Fast leveling available in PoP zones though you may want to wait until level 55 and quest the Stoicism spell first.<br />
<br />
Everquest has seen a lot of good changes recently with a few minor negative side affects.  Overall, it's much more enjoyable to play now.<br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find that I can DoT in a (small) exp group now without necessarily tanking the whole fight.  <br />
<br />
PoP gives us access to zones that would've been entirely too far of a trip for a simple group.  Things like Droga, which used to be a wicked little run from FV (with a possible boat ride) is as simple as OT book, to FM and bam you're in.  Veksar?  Even easier - FV book to LOIO.<br />
<br />
Go get a spiritstone.  Now you can bind wherever you want, and be 2 zones (spritstone click, then book) from that centralized plane of Knowledge and from there, anywhere.  Codicil to that - don't die while you're... say ... bound in Veksar, but not hunting there.  Annoying little tromp.  ;)<br />
<br />
Go partner with a mage of your level and laugh at the things you can kill together with little effort.<br />
<br />
Decide NOW if you want to join a guild full of nasty little children in order to see the &quot;endgame&quot; and get a look at all the big zones.  If not, enjoy yourself, and don't fret the flags, the loot, or the exp.  LDoN is coming out, and it looks like what they've said is true - you'll have things to do with a single group that are worth doing.<br />
<br />
The gear these days is so far above what was available to shamans in the past (some tae ew in particular) for the effort and price, that you can run out and solo/duo things that would've been a challenge for a full group in the past.<br />
<br />
You didn't miss much with luclin.  Skip it.  Lord what a waste.  Bazaar and a couple of quests.<br />
<br />
Oh, yeah.  At 61, we finally get a pretty good pet.  You'll want to read up on getting a horse (unless you're a die hard dungeon crawler) and a solstice earring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Tragik's post is right on the money.<br />
<br />
I'll add to that by saying it's worth getting the LoY expansion. While some may disagree, I think it's a fantastic addition to the game. There is some wonderful equipment to be had, some beautiful zones (Dulak and Hate's Fury are awesome) and some great new quests/spells.<br />
<br />
Making travel easier was the best thing to happen to EQ since it was released, IMO. With the Plane Of Knowledge and an Everfrost Spiritstone, you can bind at your hunting grounds, gate out to Everfrost, make a 1 minute run to the PoK book to sell your loot, pick up a KEI, look for a group etc etc and be back at your camp within a few minutes. There is no PoK book in LoY, which is a little annoying but there are teleports available to Stonebrunt Mountains, one zone away from the first LoY zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One of the easiest ways to catch up is to go here:<br />
http://eq.crgaming.com/patches.asp<br />
It's a list of all the patch messages from now to way, way back.<br />
That'll give you more details than any of us here can even remember. :)<br />
They've revamped quite a few zones, don't know how many of them they had done before you left, the Lost Temple of Cazic-Thule, and the  old planes come to mind; KEI is no longer able to be cast on lower level characters; you can memorize entire spell sets by right clicking the spell book; it is totaly, totaly crazy how cheap realy good gear is anymore; there are in game maps and with mods you can now have a pop-up map for almost any zone in the game (check out http://maps.eq-toolbox.com  unzip and put into your everquest/maps directory), there's an excelent storyline mod that gives you an ingame list of slowable mobs by zone available (at http://geocities.com/crumplez/index.html?155317199009 ) by PennyAntics, unzip and put into your everquest/storyline directory the list goes on and on.....<br />
Good hunting!</div></div><hr />
