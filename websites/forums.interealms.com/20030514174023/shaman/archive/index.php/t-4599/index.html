<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I currently have the Skyiron Cudgel of the Arisen (7th?) and am ready for the showdown in Charasis (Howling Stones).  I've done as much reading as I can on this, but I am still a bit confused on some things.<br />
<br />
Hanging out in the South Wing is An Iksar Apparition.  I give the Iksar Relics to him and he turns into... Oracle Vauris?  Venril Sathir?  A Spirit of Rile also shows up.  Oracle Vauris turns into VS at this point? <br />
<br />
They fight, and 4 Arisen mobs are there as well.  All untargettable if I understand right.  VS wins and Rile turns into a Swirling Mass of Bones or something?  Mobs become targettable and we kill VS and his buddies.<br />
<br />
I give Swirly the Cudgel and the Skull from VS?<br />
<br />
Does VS have his normal loot table?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ssirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">when you give iksar relics to An iksar apparition : 4 arisen, a Swirling Mass of Bones and VS spawn. VS is untargetable, he fight the mass of bones then he becomes targetable. Pull him, mez the 4 arisen (don't kill them !). malo, tash and slow on VS, kill him loot the skull on VS corpse. keep arisen mez. give the skull and your 7th cudgel to the spirit of rile that pops just after VS death.<br />
Vs drops the skull and dulled amulet of the kunzar or a mask with nice stats.<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate to tell me, we are on the same server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Does this version of VS tap at all or is he gimpy?  Reason I ask is because I would rather not drag a horde into HS for something a single group of L60's might handle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no lifetap but i believe he has a HT proc for 800 ish.<br />
get him tashed/malosid/slowed/crippled asap is what i hear.<br />
still gotta kill kaggy &amp; VSR before i do my final fight...ill let ya know how it goes.</div></div><hr />

Just be pation and take your time. If you think something is wrong and its takeing to long odd's are everything is going according to VI's plan :P VS his self is not very hard I slowed him with no debuffs on him and he was down in about 15 seconds<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, this went bad.  The guild and I had no trouble getting to the area (obviously) and we got set up.  I handed in the items and Vauris Sathir showed up.  We waited and waited..... Finally the Swirling Mass of Bones showed up.  And we waited..... Moved into the room (guess this was our mistake) and then all hell broke loose.<br />
<br />
The Arisen mobs showed up and promptly killed the enchanters.  Vauris Sathir finally moved.   We killed the Arisen mobs, and of course they spawned immediately.  Next thing we know Venril Sathir is laying waste to the raid.  Rile even attacked the raid then!  <br />
<br />
I petitioned saying that an untargettable VS wiped the raid out, and I get a tell back in about 10 minutes.  A Guide was in the zone and he said, &quot;Huh!  I can target him.&quot;  DOH!  I explained how the script should work and the apparently found info to support it cause he began summoning and performing 100% ressurrections.  But he could not return my item or respawn the mob.  It was out of his power, but he would escalate it to a GM.<br />
<br />
After 6 hours of waiting for a GM to contact me, I logged off and sent an email.    Then I came here and learned our mistake.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep sounds like my second attempt :( What you needed to do was pull the 4 into the hall and slow and mez them and keep them mezed. No one should enter the room &quot;Untill&quot; VS becomes targetable. Then its time to release the hounds!!!! (AKA send in the Oger) The HT is a proc so have a lot of small quick heals landing on the tank helps a lot. Once VS is down now you can kill the other 4 and exspect at least 1 repop posably 2. You next probllem will be that the guy who pops after VS is down (The one for finnel turn in) is on the same faction. So all but Iksar will be KOS to him.. What we did.. Luckly we had 2 SK's there one was an Iksar and coned admibly I belive it was. I slowed the sprit and got aggro off of everyone eals while they dealt with add's repops. Av our Iks SK got aggro from me took the sprit up to the stage and turned his back to it (No reposit) Once all mob repops where dead everyone camped out in the hall away from the him and came back. Once I was back and ready to do the finel turn in the SK FDed. And I was able to hand in the Skull and crudgel for #8 :)<br />
<br />
P.S. What went wrong was that you entered the room to soon you CAN NOT enter befor VS kills Spirit od Rile that fight alone takes like 10 min it seemed. After VS kills SoR he will become targetable with in like 1 min.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've sent an email to VI asking for GM reimbursement, as the Senior Guide advised.  I've also sent in a Comment to the Dev Corner about how fubared this quest script is.  In the meantime, I am already planning on getting the parts needed for the Iksar Relics. :/<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Killed VS, got the skull.. ran into the room to do the turn in and ate 3 harm touches and died, and the rest of the party that was left standing after the VS battle got torched shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
Sigh.. So Now I have a skull with no spirit to turn it into..<br />
<br />
Time for try Three..</div></div><hr />

Sorry you lost your relics AGAIN bro I can't imagine.  And with -over-nuking wizzies killing VS on our server now ..you have about a 10 minute window to get down there and loot bones..I'll keep an eye on that for ya of course.<br />
<br />
On the good news side I got a few Seb-bound people to take a side trip and got my 7th cudgel finished!  I have all my parts for 8th battle, but I'm gonna wait about 2 weeks so I can normalize my RL and wait for after the holidays.<br />
<br />
I had a mid-high level 4-group of 60 druid, 59 cleric, 57 monky and 56 shaman (me).  Buffed up dogdog and got slow to stick on the second cast.  He went down like Rosie O' on a catfish fry.<br />
<br />
Let me know if I can help out with new relics...but please don't come to MY 8th cudgel battle...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Klothe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">After a disaster of dead caster I find myself wondering about a few things so when in doubt ask the scaled brethren.<br />
<br />
After sitting a long time on the necessary pieces between myself and one other guildie (blackened iksar bones) I grabbed the relics and headed in. 2 chanters 3 clerics 4 tanks miscellaneous and sundry others enuff I thought.  Reread the few scraps remaining on 8th battle and decided as vs IVU'ing and setting up in locked room behind the broken wall room (which seems safer) to do it in the tunnel as you folks mention.<br />
<br />
Turned in the relics Vauris Popped went to kill Rile and then the 4 skels popped.  Before I could ask does each chanter have one targetted one of them casted early with the final results as might expected.  So as I round up the medallion, skull necklace, changeling essence, (thank god another guildie had me a set of blackened bones, I find myself with questions.<br />
<br />
1) Snuggle you are saying you set up in the Hall, you mean the one with the room with the named pop room just on the other side of the broken wall?<br />
<br />
2) When did you folks begin the mezzing? I am assuming after Vauris becomes targettable or did you do this just before you figured he became targettable?<br />
<br />
3) Be it the tunnel or the corridor both seem awfully tight for 4 groups (even shrunk).  Did you string out the Arisen or mezz root em in place?  <br />
<br />
4) Did you fight Vauris up on the platform or did you somehow manage to pull him back to one of the standard corrridor corner pull spots?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any info.<br />

addendum: I hate to ask but I must I must... Did anyone ID the Mask of Fright (ac 10 str 6 sta5 cha -10 wis int 6 hp mana dr pr mr 10  5% mod to intimadation All/All Cazic worshippers only) or the Dulled Amulet of the Kunzar (Magic/Lore/No Drop Neck slot  AC3 STR 4 DEX STA CHA WIS INT AGI+4 SVF SVD SVC SVM SVP+5  All/All Wt0.1 no diety restriction).  I have to assume the final cudgel is 8 buuuuuuut......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Had a disaster night here as well, much along the same lines as you guys have.<br />
<br />
Myself (57 Shaman), 60 Chanter, 60 Monk, 60 Rogue, 60 Cleric all went down today to beat some VS rear. Handed in the relics to the Apparition, waited while Vauris spawned and did his dying. We sat out in the hall, and pulled/killed the Arisen mobs when they spawned. As the 4th one was about to die, untargettable VS + 4 more Arisen spawned and jumped us. Needless to say there wasn't a whole lot we could do against an untargetable mob, so we wiped and I lost the items.<br />
<br />
/petition is a useless command on my server (no GM, maybe 1 or 2 Guides) so I get to get the items over again. Yay, more quality time in KC after I thought I could safely say I never had to ever go there again.<br />
<br />
To add insult to injury, I was booted out of the EQ chat by the resident Chat GM when I asked for the email address of someone to talk to about reimbursement.<br />
<br />
Not a very happy player at the moment. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm getting to be an expert at these, so here's some more tips:<br />
<br />
Sit the party in the hallway, 1 good group of 60's will do it, more is better just in case.  Clear the room of all mobs.  Handin to the apparition, he becomes Vauris and walks to the dias.  Sit far back in the tunnel and watch.  Do not move for the 12 minutes the script goes on.  <br />
Once he pops, pull with malo (if you've got it).  You will get 2 arisen adds (and possibly a little bit of room repop, named mob sometimes).  Get slow on him ASAP.  Even worth having the enc tash before mezzing.<br />
Once he's dead loot the bones, and kill the mobs you have mezzed.  Then kill the last 2 arisen in the room (you have time).  Once those are dead, you can pull any more room repops to clear the way in, or just charge through and do the handin.  I dont know the full timer on Rile, but there's really no reason you can't kill VS and his arisen long before it runs out.<br />
Extra loot from VS is the mask (stats above), and a necklace which kinda sucks.  I looted the necklace as a momento of the fight, it's like 3 ac 3 to a few stats or something.<br />
<br />
If anyone is doing the fight, feel free to send me a cross server tell for any questions you've got.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">do not, under any circumstances kill ANY of the arisen untill you have your 8th cudgel in hand. they will insta repop untill you do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pretty much everyone has covered the strategies you need to use. When I did mine, we set up in the tunnel just outside the room (on the dirt, not on the &quot;floor&quot; area. ).<br />
<br />
We had an Iksar SK doing the pulling, so he wouldn't aggro the Apparition. Once all the mobs in the room were dead, I turned in the relics to the Apparition. <br />
<br />
It seemed to take quite some time before he moved into the room. As stated by others, the thing takes time to go through the different parts, so be patient.<br />
<br />
The Apparition (now Varius) eventually moves into the room and the swirling mass of bones and 4 Arisen spawn. The mass is untargetable. <br />
<br />
We pulled the 4 Arisen up to the tunnel and locked them down. We did not kill them. The Iksar SK pulled them, that may be why VS didn't come with them.  Just slow them and keep them mezzed. <br />
<br />
Eventually the swirling mass will &quot;warp&quot; up on the stage with the remains of Rile and the fight will occur. VS wins, of course.<br />
<br />
Now wait for VS to become targetable. Once that happened, my group killed VS in the room, but back a bit from the stage. Once VS was dead, Rile popped. VS did run on low health, and he finally dropped near the wall on the east side of the room.<br />
<br />
I did the turn in and got the cudgel. There were many guild mates in the room with me, but not in close proximity to the stage, so I don't know what Rile's aggro radius is. It is not room wide if he does aggro. I suggest you tell all your non-Iksar buddies to stay well back.<br />
<br />
Following the turn in, we killed the 4 Arisen. We had one instant repop when we did this.  <br />
<br />
We were able to accomplish the whole encounter before the room repopped, so we didn't have to worry about those mobs. <br />
<br />
This worked for me. I don't know how it will work for others. I had 2 groups with me. 2 enchanters holding 2 Arisen each.  I slowed all of them. <br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
