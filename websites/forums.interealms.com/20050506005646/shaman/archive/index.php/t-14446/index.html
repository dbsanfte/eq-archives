<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was just thinking, as SS and ToV are on same faction......why does SS quest armour come from killing stuff on the same faction(although HoT mobs don't give faction hits). Doesn't it seem strange? It's like saying a freeport guard tells to to kill his friend the rewards you for it.....<br />
<br />
Also i just wanted to know does anyone ever hunt in SS? Iv'e always thought no but maybe the guilds on giant faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trezl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ToV's &quot;Halls of Testing&quot; are called that for a reason, and the mobs inside the Halls are not on CoV faction.  They are testing you and rewarding you for showing your ability to them.  The story is straightforward but decent.<br />
<br />
Also, some guilds hunt SS... my guild kills the crusaders and Yelinak when we can at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We USED to hunt SS.  But that was before they changed it and made Yelinak much harder.  It's just not worth it anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've hunted in SS for fun after I got my full set of SS armor. Its pretty fun to mess around in there. It got even better after they patched it. Not much of a raid zone as there arent many good drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We USED to hunt SS.  But that was before they changed it and made Yelinak much harder.  It's just not worth it anymore<br />
<br />
Not worth it?  Maybe for shamans but it is definitly worth it for a Melees.  Yelinak esentially drops 2 41% haste items for hard to fill spots on melees (his talis for neck, and it isnt meant for a ST key; and the head to turn into TMax for Guantlets of Dragon Slaying).  Yes, his other loot is gimp, but he is still worth killing as long as your tanks have to use cloaks or belts for haste (because there are better options for those slots).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hunted in SS for Kromzek faction when I needed to do my Kael armor turnins.  And we still mack Yelinak from time to time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Used to hunt the Wyverns/cubes a ton for faction. Was pretty good exp at 60/duo/trio. Cubes are seriously resisty tho, and can sometimes split. You'll get some interesting drops, some of which arent that bad depending on your gear. Saw a 50hp neck item drop with 2 charges of greater heal, 7-8wis earring, some decent int caster stick, tons and tons of crappy spells, and alot of stuff you've never heard of before that sucks. mmm actually the wyvrns and those 2 big wurms ( used to call one of em larry, the other Jack) might not be that bad of a soloing circuit now. Hmmm.</div></div><hr />
