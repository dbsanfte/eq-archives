<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Myself and two other friends started brand new on Kane bayle. I havent made a guild since the beggining of EQ, we were the first guild to be created on the Povar server :)<br />
<br />
What is the procedure now? I am sure we could get some friends to log in accounts to get needed number online to create guild, the chat system is nice, but sucks you can't use the enter key for default chat. Or can you? I am using the old UI for now. new UI looks like some distorted cartoon to me.<br />
<br />
<br />
How start a guild?<br />
<br />
Can you have enter be default for a chat channel?<br />
<br />
how can you change text colors in old UI?<br />
<br />
<br />
anyone know these questions?<br />
<br />

So next qustion, how to use new ui? There is a line in my ini with newui = false or soemthing like that, just switch to true?<br />

<br />
That link didn't work, but you can go to the eqlive website and access the Knowledge Base. Search on &quot;guild creation&quot;. Result #10 answers your question.<br />
<br />
Here is the solution:  EverQuest: How to create a guild in EverQuest <br />
The following process needs to be followed to gain approval for you guild: <br />
<br />
1) The person who is to be the leader of the guild must enter the chat server and issue the #makeroom command. This will create a private guild channel. The name of the guild should be used as the name of the channel, although this name can be edited later during the creation process. <br />
<br />
2) Once the channel has been created, the guild leader needs to invite the members of his guild into the channel. To do this he needs to tell the guild members the name of the channel and the password for access. <br />
<br />
3) Once a total of 10 members are in the channel and have issued the #guildapprove command, the guild leader can then issue the #makeguild command. This will move the guild leader to the guild creation screen. <br />
<br />
4) In the guild creation screen, the guild leader needs to enter a summary of the guild's charter. This summary should focus on the guild's role in Norrath and the goals it will pursue. Details of the internal working of your guild need not be included. You may also edit your guild's name in this screen. Once completed, hit FINISH and the guild will be submitted for approval. <br />
<br />
5) The leader of the guild may check the status of the guild by activating the GUILDS button from chat. If the status of the guild indicates a need for revision, the guild leader should select his guild and hit the EDIT button. Comments regarding the nature of the needed revision appear at the bottom of the guild creation screen.<br />
<br />
The guild leader can edit the charter and the guilds name as needed and hit the FINISH button to resubmit the guild for approval. IMPORTANT: If the leader is only viewing the revisions needed, hit CANCEL to exit this screen. If the leader hits FINISH the guild will be resubmitted for approval and the leader will be unable to re-enter the guild creation/edit screen. <br />
<br />
6) Once the name and charter have been approved, the guild leader will be notified via e-mail that the guild is ready to be created. Please verify that your e-mail is correct in our files by going to account &gt; change account &gt; edit registration from the login screen. <br />
<br />
7) Once the guild leader has received notification that the guild has been approved, it is his responsibility to petition and meet the GM of his server between 2pm and 11pm P.S.T. to complete the guild creation process. <br />
<br />
Although...one thing has changed since they published this. Not only do you have to have 10 people in the channel to /guildcreate, but you have to thave them online for verification by the GM when he gives the guild master the tag.<br />
<br />
[EDIT 2]<br />
<br />
Gotta agree with Soupy below. The new UI functionality is fantastic once you find a mod that suits your playstyle. I use a Warcraft 3 &quot;Orc&quot; theme for my Warrior &amp; Shaman, the Warcraft 3 &quot;Human&quot; for my cleric (castle theme), and the Warcraft 3 &quot;Night Elf&quot; theme for my Druid. Here's a pic of the Orc theme. The spell gem bar runs across the top and is awesome looking. It's just not pictured here since I was playing my Warrior at the time.<br />

Check http://www.eqinterface.com for all sorts of UI mods. Do a search for &quot;WC3&quot; and it will pull up all 4 themes the guy put together.</div></div><hr />

You don't need GU to make a decent chat channel anymore. Just have everyone autojoing a chat channel of your choosing. Call it /Beer or something. You can make it any color you choose, you can do a /who on it, and you can have everyone autojoin it the second you login. <br />
<br />
Only thing you don't get is a nifty guildtag name over your head.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need a guild to create a chat channel. Only a &quot;retard&quot; or &quot;downs syndrom&quot; person would think that. By the by, always cool to make fun of folks with birth defects. Don't come here ragging about Verant and how crappy the rules/functionality are in a game that you are playing. Instead, do some research and you may find that your own ignorance is limiting you :)<br />
<br />
Loose the old you UI. It is dead soon anyway.<br />
<br />
Have all your friends type &quot;/autojoin millsfriends&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now whenever they log on, they will automatically join the millsfriends chat channel. You can then just type &quot;;1 message&quot;<br />
<br />
Go to your options panel. You can set the color for your chat channel to be anything you like. You can also create a new window and have it be the only text to show up there. Right clicking on a message window will allow you to set its defualt... so you can make &quot;enter&quot; default to your new channel (you won't need to preface your message with ;1).<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Here (http://www.tgaffney.org/images/vhaksiz2b.jpg) is a shot of my UI. It is pretty clean. You can see I have guild. raid, and tells in left hand window, all other crap in right hand. Best thing about the new UI... you can customize it to your hearts content. Go here (http://www.eqinterface.com/) and find one you like, or mix and match :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">heh gorre, read my post again before slinging insults.<br />
<br />
<br />
I posted that I wanted to be able to SET ENTER KEY as the chat channel, I read everything verant has to offer and cannot find out how to do it. I can figure out how to do a chat. Also, I am using the OLD UI, there is no option that I can find for setting chat on enter key.<br />
<br />
I do not want to have to type a goddamn /1 message everytime.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, have a sense of humor for christ sakes, it is not like I really meant to offend somone with down's syndrom, I was comparing the intelligence level of the people I run in to to people with limited mental capacity. A perfectly valid analogy.<br />
<br />
<br />
You ever tell a &quot;your mama so fat&quot; joke? What if somone has a fat mama? I wanna joke, I will joke about retards, cancer patients, terrorists, you name it, it is simply that, a joke. People who take offense should retreat in to a plastic bubble with no light and take a big fat bite of my crank. This truly burns me up when people play the humor police. Funny how a black comic can get up on stage and throw the &quot;N&quot; word around every two seconds, on a BLACK comedy show, on the BLACK entertainment network, and everyone laughs, yet somone uses the &quot;N&quot; word on the street, they are thrown in to a federal prison for a hate crime and the ACLU steps in because of the horror. Hypocrits, all of em. imagine some white comic on an all white station? Gods, the country would shut down in protest.<br />
<br />
<br />
I edited a bunch of mean content, not sure if you meant to flame or meant ignorance in the literal sense, in which case I might be ignorant, since I don't use the new UI.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line it looks like, I have to use the new UI. great, welcome to cartoon land.<br />

No need to read your post again, but I suggest you read mine :)<br />

<br />
The new UI is fun and easy to play around with. Simply goto a site like http://www.eqinterface.com/ and they have tutorials there on how to modify it. I simply make several folders and add the particular changes I like ( I like the horizontal hotkey bar for example) .  Then when in game can load up your different mods to see which one suits you best. <br />
<br />
As far as guilds I dont think you have to have all 10 people on at same time anymore to make the guild... just not sure about that. <br />
Next time you are on for an extended grind time or something petition, as the guide or GM  and make the guides work for their money... errr plat .<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Millman,<br />
<br />
The new UI is very easy to have fun with.  Go to your EQ folder, you will have a folder called &quot;skins.&quot;  If you open the &quot;skins&quot; folder, there is a folder called &quot;default.&quot;  Never make changes to the default folder!<br />
<br />
Start off by making a copy of the default folder and name it Millman (or any other thing that's easy for you to remember).  Go ahead and open up Millman.   You should see a bunch of files and a lot of them are going to make sense to you.  <br />
<br />
EQUI_SpellBookWnd = Spellbook<br />
EQUI_GroupWindow = group window<br />
EQUI_ChatWindow = chat window<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
The beautiful thing about the new UI is each bit is customizable and there are 100s of beautiful people out there who have already done the work for you.  Go around to the various UI sites and look what's out there, you can take bits and pieces from all sorts of UIs to build one that works for you.<br />
<br />
For example, if you see a spellbook window you just love, you can cut and paste just that file into your Millman folder.   Once you make all the changes you want, log into the game and type /loadskin Millman.<br />
<br />
I thought the new UI was at times very bulky and cumbersome (why on earth would they label all the windows, chat window, duh!) so I was looking for a very sleek and unobtrusive UI.<br />
<br />
Here's a link to some screenshots of my UI (including some very snazzy new spell icons created by Patito).  The last screenshot pictured of the UI has my most recent changes with new player window and buffs window.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Actually the &quot;skins&quot; folder is for the patcher. The UI files are located in a folder named (ironically enough) &quot;uifiles&quot; with sub directories for each custom UI. &quot;default&quot; is there by default. :)<br />
<br />
Also, also...<br />
<br />
Be sure to put the number &quot;1&quot; or the word &quot;true&quot; on the line when you type &quot;/loadskin millman 1&quot;. That forces the ui to load the windows to the x/y coordinates as stated in the UI_millman_##.ini file.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ha, so it is, I haven't messed with mine in a long time, sorry!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Have they finally stopped messing with the UI?  For a while, after every patch, I'd keep crashing to the desktop until I deleted my UI, as they would have added some minor thing, or the compass, raid window, etc.  I got sick of having to download an updated UI, log in, load it, and re-place all the parts in the right spot every week or two for all my characters.  <br />
<br />
If they aren't going to screw with it anymore, maybe I'll try a custom UI again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The main cause for UI generated crashes after patches is when they add new windows (like when they added the raid window).<br />
<br />
The fix is to simply add an entry for the new window to the EQUI.XML file.<br />
<br />
Ex:<br />
<br />
To fix your UI after they added the raid window you only needed to add the following line:<br />
<br />
&amp;lt;Include&amp;gt;EQUI_RaidWindow.xml&amp;lt;/Include&amp;gt;<br />
<br />
That's the first thing I check if my UI's stop working, then make the necessary additions/deletions to get it working again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The new UI is fantastic, although I hate it in un-modified form.<br />
<br />
Modding your UI is v easy - download a modification, put the mods in their own subdirectory down the uifiles directory.  The load eq and use /loadui &lt;subdir name&gt; and it loads your new ui (at least I think it is /loadui, or something similar).<br />
<br />
My current one is still Vert1.0 : http://www.cdlegg.btinternet.co.uk/EQ000025.JPG<br />
<br />
I wanted to use 2.2 but the windows dont all fit together as nicely so I have held back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Woot gorre<br />
<br />
<br />
  Hmmm, then the mods people are downloading, are they because the super genius types fiddle with ini type settings? or is it just use the options type thing? Would love to try my own thing, but if it is too technical, then I am too lazy.<br />
 I am coming around though, some of your UI's seems very nice, perhaps I was just put off by the default.<br />
<br />
one last thing, to enable the new UI just set my current INI file to newui=true or some such?<br />
<br />
Currently only have kunark installed, assume wil work?<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<br />
Yes, you can set ENTER to talk to a given chat channel.  First join the chat channel, then right-click on the chat window's title bar, select CHANNEL, CHAT, and the name of the chat channel.<br />
<br />
If you will take a canned mod, they are dead easy to use.  They are pretty simple to modify, too - they are XML-based and can be modded with a text editor - but they take some fiddling to get the sizes and offsets right if you're changing that.<br />
<br />
If you are designing a new UI from scratch, it's a LOT of work.  But who needs that.  I've gotten a new pet window, a new group window, and a new hotkey window, and left the rest alone.  It's very nice being able to swap my SOW booties in, click them, and swap them back without opening the inventory.</div></div><hr />

I like your buff bar and location of it. Do you keep your inventory up all the time? What resolution are you running in?<br />

Your guild's website: the handy tools link to evermon everquest monitor leads to a porn site. XXX, nice title including the f word, thanks for the link, I was at work. (Sigh). What is that anyway... <br />

Your ATK and AC are listed as 0 in the player window by the way<br />

<br />
There are two areas on the master control box.<br />
<br />
The first has 2 steins and 6 bags - is that his inventory, cause he has another inventory window above it. can you click on that? I would LOVE to get my clickies out of my hotkey box.<br />
<br />
Also he has 4 boxes on the side, one has a book  a paw a moonstone.... are those inventory slots he's wearing that he uses to click on?<br />
<br />
That looks really nifty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The 8 slots where the steins are (beneath the AAXP bar) is your inventory. The &quot;other&quot; inventory is the equipment you're wearing. The 4 slots under the stats are primary, secondary, range, and ammo.<br />
<br />
I love that UI and may switch to it on my bigger machines.</div></div><hr />

I'm terribly sorry about the porn link.  I had no idea what that link used to go to, but you know we wouldn't have purposely posted a link to porn in our guild library!  I let the site administrator know so they can remove it.  One of my guildmates just told me that the old link &quot;was a tool that was used to watch the servers and could be configured to autostart EQ when they came up after a patch.&quot;<br />

Edit - the link has been removed, thanks very much for bringing it to our attention, sorry you got porn spammed :(  Of course, as one of my guildmates said, it gives &quot;handy links&quot; a whole new meaning!<br />
<br />
I like your buff bar and location of it. Do you keep your inventory up all the time? What resolution are you running in?<br />
<br />
I like the buff bar too!  No, I don't keep the inventory up all the time, I only had it open to get a SS of it.  The resolution is 1024 x 768.<br />
<br />
Your ATK and AC are listed as 0 in the player window by the way<br />
<br />
The screenshot is a couple of months old, it no longer has 0s. <br />
<br />
Where do you drag things for auto-equip (or in my lazy ass way, auto-bag while fishing? or corpse looting?)<br />
<br />
Dropping items onto the dreamcatcher icon in the inventory autoequips them. <br />
<br />
I'd love to download your buff bar, is it posted anywhere? <br />
<br />
Not that I know of, I can email it to you if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">You need 30 petitions on the server to get a GM's attention.  Keeping that in mind, have everyone in your to-be-founded guild lodge a petition and remain online for a while.  The more people you get making a petition, the faster your GM service.  Sounds crazy, but it's true thanks to roving GM support.  They won't even look at your server until it has 30 active petitions from people who are still online.  This means you could wait many hours or days to find a GM unless you get a bunch of people petitioning. <br />
<br />
This is also the reason the uber guilds seem to get instant GM support.  They have everyone in the guild petition and 60 petitions show up as a red flag to GMs and they come a runnin'.</div></div><hr />
