After moving and also installing a new video card, they are unable to get into EQ.  They are able to log on up to the Server Select screen - however, after the world finishes loading, and prior to the Character Select screen coming up, they get disconnected.<br />
<br />
<br />
unfortunatly, its not the IRQ's, (well, it could be anything, but we have no conflicts) have turned off all onboard sound/com ports, hell even the printer port.  Everything not in use, is disabled on both computers, after server select, and right after all the files load, but right before you get to the char select screen, we get disconned, with the &quot;You have been disconnected&quot; Screen.  Seem to remember a bunch of ppl with Geforce cards posting up about this type of problem, right after luclin came out, but i cant find any posts at the EQ tech support forums. Have tried assorted Detonator drivers, and it has the same problem with all of them. reinstalled EQ/luclin and it does the same thing.. i figure it has to be something with the video, but i dont know what.<br />
<br />
Systems - <br />
1200 athlons, with 384 ram each. The only thing we changed, was : Upgraded from TNT2 32 meg cards, to GF3 Ti200 64 meg cards. This is after a format of both 'puters, so they are running pretty clean. <br />
Updated to Visiontek GF3 ti200 drivers, ver. 28.32. <br />
Updated mobo drivers to the most current. <br />
<br />
1. I went back to using my old video card (TNT/RIVA or something) <br />
2. Went back to using the driver for said card that I used to play EQ with. <br />
3. Same problem is occurring. I get to server screen, select server, watch as the world, armor, etc. loads - then I promptly disconnect before character screen. <br />
4. Chatted with a few tech support people - utterly useless. Here's a good laugh: I emailed EQCSR Worthless some files, he searches files and says (and I'm not kidding) &quot;hmm... what was your problem/question again?&quot; <br />
5. Several people thru various message boards, chat, and thru the guild have offered suggestions, none of which has changed anything. <br />
<br />
So... I'm going to wipe my hard drive - again. I will reload EQ - again. If it does not work, I think I'm going to just call it a fun two years and let it go. <br />
<br />
Any advice/help would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />
