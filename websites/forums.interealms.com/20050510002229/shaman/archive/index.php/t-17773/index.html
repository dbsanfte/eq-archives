 i care, grats  :) now to get to 65</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Congratulations :)  I'm sooooo jealous - stuck in 58 forever.  That's a milestone that I'm very much looking forward to reaching - level 60 torpor and malo is sort of a class-defining moment I think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congratulations. 60 will F L Y compared to 59. Malo and Torpor are such huge weapons in your arsenal. I remember when Malo was a very large component of raiding in ToV and elsewhere due to the unresistability of the spell.<br />
<br />
And I remember the first time I had Torpor cast on me (in Velks). Was playing my Monk. I was thinking and saying &quot;WT.F. - how did I get snared? Why are my hitpoints going up like a HoT?&quot; Then the cluebird took a crap on my head. Shaman=60=Torpor (This was back in the day when Torpor was rare and expensive)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Haha, I remember the first time I was torpored.  I was killing giants at the fort in GD with my warrior friend... I was 30-something at the time.  Some uber shaman came by for factioning, he sent me a tell &quot;Bong to full and I'll torpor you&quot;.  I'd never heard of &quot;torpor&quot;,  but guessed that &quot;bong to full&quot; meant canni to full mana.  So invited him as he asked, and canned down to 20% life.  Then he blew my mind. :D<br />
<br />
It was inspiring, to say the least. :D<br />
<br />
Grats on 60 and your spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thankyou so much guys, torpor is everything I thought it would be and more :)<br />
<br />
Malo isnt as big a debuffer as I'd hoped, found my slow being resisted a fwe times in BC in PoV, but for being an unresistable debuff (which i can stack other debuffs on top of) i cannot complain. :)</div></div><hr />
