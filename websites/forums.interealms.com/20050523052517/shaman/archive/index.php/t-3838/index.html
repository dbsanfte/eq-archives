<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got spanked last night for casting Malo on an incoming mob in NToV.  I haven't changed anything about how I do my casting, and I was raiding with the same group.  After casting Malo, I took 3 flurries and died.<br />
<br />
I have never gained agro on a cast of Malo, except when using it to pull.  This happened only once last night, so it might have just been a fluke.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else noticed increased agro?  Or was this just a fluke for me?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No extra aggro for me. Maybe the MOB had next to zero aggro from puller or the tank hadn't engaged yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">cleared 95% of NToV last night and not once did I get agro from malo<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, let the main tank get a couple of hits in first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Took down about 7 or 8 dragons over the weekend in seperate raids.  Rotated Malo duty among shaman present.<br />
<br />
Not one died due to Malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Actually, I did manage to get agro with Malo this past weekend.  It was on the AE charm serpent in the basement of Ssra (Glyphed, exiled, whatever--I can never keep em all straight!  :) )<br />
<br />
It was kind of odd.  I never had a chance to cast anything else before he AE'd me, and double flurried.  That made for a really fast dead leezard.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Most likely what happened is the puller, monk i'd assume, feigned right before malo landed and your tank wasn't able to chase it fast enough to get it off ya. Malo still has next to no aggro even since the latest patches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only thing I have noticed is I seem to be finding it harder to pull aggro off people with slow since the patch.  Probably just my imagination but I have had to dump a BoN to get aggro some of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">and that's bad? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slow seems to be increased in agro for me (just very slightly.  Had to delay about a second).  Wish I was high enough level to cast Slow.<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah aggro on togors seems to be reduced (most likely just in my head)<br />
<br />
Makes ghetto mezzing a pain when they won't engage a sitting shaman that just slowed them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you malo before anyone touches it, your probably going to get jacked.  If its just a flurry drake in tov wait like half a sec after someone attacks it to malo.  Its just a drake, if its malo a split second slower than normal it wont matter, better to stay alive so your up when the dragon comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Early maloing is good for getting on Rampage /wince, otherwise as long as I time it so that the MT is hitting the mob in question when malo lands,  I've never got blatted due to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">malo's agro was increased because the icon is a torch setting a dog on fire. mobs dont like being set on fire</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, Slow causing less aggro is a pain when ghetto mezzing.  I couldn't get aggro from a pet ;/.   Usually pulled it fine off a monk though.</div></div><hr />
