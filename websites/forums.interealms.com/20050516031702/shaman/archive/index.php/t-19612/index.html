<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i think i actually thought (well almost myslef someone esle had this idea on a thread too, but i didnt want it lost, and thought it deserved a post of it own.) a way to boost short term healing and dps, but not give a huge increase over the long term, please don`t go omg, thats sick ,rem that the long recast will offset the healing so that over time it doesnt increase our healing hugely. and the dd too for dps.<br />
<br />
both nice, quick but long recast. <br />
<br />
so heal 2.5k 3 sec cast , but 30 seconds or so recast for 850 mana. at level 65 (tnargs being 62) the recast i think is the thing to balance it out <br />
it might need to be nearer 60 sec. and to get that mana back takes least 2 cast on new canni spell, and you wouldnt want to use on self, unless you really being hammered, quin far more effecient. even with 10 sec cast time the ch and 75% ch of cleric and druid can still heal alot more than we can overall in a 30 to 60 sec period (though i think nearer 30 probably fine). but it gives us a heal that can make a difference but needs to be used very tactically.<br />
<br />
this fits our style to, we need to slow the mobs first , by this time the mob has done alot of damage often and this when best heal needed, cast best heal tank back up to reasonable amount and we can then likely heal ok once slowed with quin and turgs. <br />
<br />
and the dd, 1.4k 3 sec cast 30 sec recast for 460 mana. likely change all poison nukes to this. ratio. add one 65 <br />
<br />
i think these would certainly solve or short term healing and dps. but not hugely affect our overall healing and dps. fine tuning being in how long the recast is.<br />
<br />
if you like this idea feedback to SoE. it cant do any harm i would think. if enough like it or a modified version then we could sticky it maybe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well IMHO we need a heal that will completely replace TM. I dont think this is the case with your idea cause of the recast time on it. Greyed out spells gems are the devil.<br />
<br />
Frankly i wish they would just put in Khura's Mending and be done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">was gona say that this isnt to replace god spells, although changing the desease dot to the nuke be better, but more to balance shaman out a little so could do with a whole line of these spells. also though these spell be greyed out you still be able to cast quin and tnargs. the nuke wouldnt take up extra slot but the heal would.  it would still be a juggling act for spells but i think these address a good quick heal/dps but not add too much overall extra power. it would replace i think kragss though.<br />
also, though i would like it otherwise, i dont think they will give us a better heal without some drawback, this drawback i think is acceptable.<br />
and would give us a heal that can save the day without being &quot;overpowered&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">See, your talking about casting Q and TM while this spell is greyed out. Our spell slots are made of solid gold and having to give up another to mem another heal is bad. If this was the better heal then i would have to drop TM and if i did that, during the grey out period i would have no quick heal if it was needed, only Q. I would rather have up TM and spam it 2 times and not have a greyed out spell gem and not have to give up a extra slot dedicated to healing.<br />
<br />
Its good your trying to solve the problems, but i personaly dont feel this is the answer. But im just 1 shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want a 3 second cast, 2 second recast spell that does 2000 hp of damage if I'm targetting an npc, or heals for 2000 hp if I'm targetting a PC.<br />
<br />
No good for PvP, but that's screwed already anyways.<br />
<br />
*dreams on*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hmm,  not sure about a 2k quick heal that doesnt have some restriction<br />
druid best short  (with GoD i believe) is<br />
http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4883&amp;source=Test<br />
<br />
though you could argue that we dont get the 4665 heal over 10 sec?<br />
 i did however say that you can modify these spells,<br />
so possible a 3k heal, 3sec, 30 sec recast? as i said its more the idea i think solves some problems we have, the details can be changed.<br />
also rem that this is a an excellent heal, we just cant spam it. it you only healing too you probably wont want much in damage spells so swap for those. if you have a druid/cleric you wont need one of your heal spells up. this is another reason why this spell idea is good, it means we can heal fine, but a druid or cleric to heal would still be perfered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I always want my damage spell/spells up. Personaly i like the idea and your  ratios are not bad, but i think the failure in logic is the recast time. We specialize in HoT and secondary in quick heals. Its not a question of how long the recast time is compared to how much its healing, its a question of how much its healing and how quickly. The point and dare i say the attraction to tnarggs is that you can fireit off on mutliple targets quickly. If your healing the MA with Q and a shot Tnarggs then suddenly see the mezz broke on the enchanter and she is getting ate alive. Do you wanna wait for that gem refresh for another say... 18 seconds, before you can do anythign but Q her? Im guessing your logic is that having 3 slots dedicated to healing isnt a bad thing, im guessing you dont mind playing a clerical role as a shaman because of this fact. Not that its bad, but its a different type of shaman then i am. I Main Heal cause i have to, i avoid it at all costs cause it bored the snot out of me. So for my style of play 3 slots dedicated to healing is nothing short of annoying cause ill either have to un mum FA or some other buff/debuff or it takes away my ability to have any damage spells up, which i like to have up incase its needed.<br />
<br />
What i feel is needed is a simple upgrade to Tnarggs. Not another heal to fill up another slot, but a straight up replacement. If you can figure out a good ratio for that, with a normal recast time, then im with ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">actaully 3 spells slots would just be in raid or if you are main healer for a group. if you have a healer in group you most likely would use the smaller heal or would only need the one big heal so the cleric or druid could heal. i normally have 2 heals up Q and tnargs anyway. 1 more heal will only get rid of 1 damage spell. and in those situation i dont see the problem with that. as it is i tend to change spells about depending on trash clearing /exp group or raid boss mob. trash/group would need fast damage spell, healing back up. for raid boss more likely dots, though dd would be good too, and healing. (slow malo always.)<br />
<br />
also it could be that 30 sec is too long and 20 sec might be more in line, but what we need to do it get the idea to SoE so thaey can Test it, without test you can`t know how well or badly it works:)</div></div><hr />
