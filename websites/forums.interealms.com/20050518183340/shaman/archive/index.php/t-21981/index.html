<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lumor Spiritdrifter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy,<br />
<br />
Could I ask the computer gurus here for a little assistance.  Up until Sunday I was able to play 2 instances of EQ w/eqw on my laptop (Gateway m675 p4 3ghz 512mb ram 64mb ati 9600xt 80gb 7200rpm hd).  Yesterday when I got home and logged on to play my computer kept freezing and locking up.  after a few mins.  The wierd thing is that before the computer would lock up, I would get alot of activity on my HD(presumably the page file), but also it would sound like it was trying to access the cd-rom.  This scared me and I thought maybe I had a virus or something.  So I ran a full scan of the computer with norton 2004 after making sure that it was totally up to date.  The scan came out clean.  I then ran a scan with spybot.  That was clean also minus 2 cookies that I cleaned.<br />
<br />
I then defragged just to make sure.  None of this helped.  It still continued to freeze.  Then I updated my video drivers just to see, though I couldn't imagine this being a prob since there was no patch inbetween it working and not.<br />
<br />
After all this I resolved myself to the fact that I couldnt &quot;2box&quot; until i figured it out.  So I logged on through normal eq to go retrieve my little twinks body that was killed when the comp first crashed.  I was able to play for around 15 mins when all of a sudden the comp froze again.  This time though the HD didn't go crazy, the comp just froze.<br />
<br />
I am at a loss as to what this could be.  If anyone has any suggestions I would really appreciate it.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If a machine locks up hard like that after a few minutes, often times it's heat-related.  I haven't worked with laptops much - but make sure your fans are working correctly and aren't clogged with dirt, lint, etc.  Excessive heat will cause hard locks like that sometimes.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like your laptop is still under warranty.  I'd suggest you bring it into an authorized service center for repairs.  Complete total locks usually indicate a hardware failure.</div></div><hr />
