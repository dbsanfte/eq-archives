Guess all of you have had problems finding good droppable arms for your shammy. I yesterday killed Piklo in Droga and got:<br />

which is one of the best droppable arms I have seen for a shammy. Just an advice for all of you looking for a new arm piece (that is not part of a high lvl guild).<br />

Pulling around north wall and northeast corner is the only spot I have found that you can regularly get singles in valor.  You can get lucky on spawn placement at outside the caverns as well, but not likely.<br />
<br />
If you are set on soloing regularly in valor I would suggest getting vp3 and just parking one mob while you rot another with regular root.<br />
<br />
As for arms, yes those are awesome droppable arms.  Only other big droppable arms I can think of would be ornate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just keep in mind, those arms are his rare drop, I've killed Piklo a bunch of times and gotten enough Rings of Exalted Freedom to choke a hippo... no arms though. :(</div></div><hr />

had them on my sham and was strapped for cash, sold them. never seen them in bazaar again..been kicking myself in the butt ever since</div></div><hr />

scroll down to the arms section :)<br />
<br />
Well some of them are real nice but never seen them in bazaar for sale (some are no drops as well). Think they are harder to get as well (long quests, elemental planes...).<br />
<br />
I have been looking for a new arm slot item in bazaar since june...<br />
<br />
But I like that list have given me many good ideas on items for other slots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">At 65, I can single pull the north east corner, as well as west wall and east wall. Literally, chain pulled singles today while &quot;level encouraging&quot; my cleric. I mention my level only because the aggro range *might* be smaller than it could be for your level.<br />
<br />
For east wall, take the two golems in the pool first (I pulled the south golem first), then the golem thats a bit further back. There are a spawn of three along the cliff edge that you can't break without FD or lull, so write those ones off and dont even try. Beyond that, you're looking at mostly wanderers left at EW.<br />
<br />
WW is much easier. There are three in a row that spawn on the northern half of the field (the southern half is where the cliff is). Pull those first, with the closest to the wall, then the next, then the farthest. With WW, I've found its a lot safer to pull if you always pull to the north... so go a bit north of the mob, and pull it almost straight to you, then run back to the castle. If you try to pull east west or at an angle, the pathing causes the odds of adds to go up a lot. Just careful not to go TOO far north when pulling or you might aggro a #$%^#$^% spider.<br />
<br />
After the three north most golems are pulled, keep working your way south as you pull, again always pulling them from the north.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps,<br />

<br />
Took me 8 Piklos to get the arms drop.  Not complaining too much, I had two alts who could make use of the ring, and made a bundle off the ones I couldn't use.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>umpaa_the_prophet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The brittlebone armgaurds that drop in Chardok B are one of the best droppable arms I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=22127<br />
<br />
The elemental ones are better though more ac/hp with the IH4 on them. That's only good for one spell really and you need the AA's to back it up I think.<br />
<br />
The elemental ones would probably cost more but I've never seen the brittlebone up for sale. Pretty easy to get out of Chardok though (they are the rare drop however).<br />
<br />
UMP!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Thormo, you were soloing in Droga at level 59?  I had thought that we needed to be 65 to solo there.  Did you have much trouble?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thormo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thormo, you were soloing in Droga at level 59?  I had thought that we needed to be 65 to solo there.  Did you have much trouble?<br />
<br />
Well I was not alone. =( I duoed a 59 epiced mage for additional dps. I would recommend you to get some kind of company even if I think its possible to solo some mobs in droga at lvl 60 (even better at 61 as new pet increase our dps as well). Even though aggro range is short, roamers exist and an add would cause a lot of problem. In addition it is much easier with some more dps or some crowd control. Rezzes in droga is very hard to find. The named mobs are often very close to other mobs I guess its easier to get an add the lower your level is. <br />
<br />
Try to grab some other and group in droga. Good exp and lots of fun and loot. Depending on gear it might be possible to do droga at 59 but I would chance. The rezzes are to rare (.<br />
<br />
Got add when fighting piklo but a group was zoning in to zone so I felt forced to pull him fast =).<br />
<br />
Only been there twice now. Will report when I know more. But the advice is get together some friends it will be safer and more efficient.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thormo, you were soloing in Droga at level 59?  I had thought that we needed to be 65 to solo there.  Did you have much trouble?<br />
<br />
Droga mobs vary greatly in level.  Most of the east side is light blue at 65, which means the mobs have to be maybe around level 45.  And nameds in droga are not any harder than regular mobs, as a general rule (maybe a few more HPs is all).  I was solo'ing Runri at 61, but I am sure I could have done it at 60 with torpor and malo, and I was doing Japel at 63, although it was hit or miss; if I didn't get off a heal in time to deal with a chained nuke, I was toast.  I had about 2200 HPs unbuffed at the time.<br />
<br />
For the west side (e.g. king, et. al.), being 65 is all but mandatory; those mobs are up to level 61 and have around 20k HPs.  Wearing them down with nife and pox would take forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was douing in droga at 58 with my 61 ranger. Pretty sure at that time I soloed runri waiting on a rezz for my ranger. THe deeper in ya get the harder the mobs is a dead on statement. Ice masters can nuke for as much as 2k, and the mobs have tons of hps. I have doued the named earth seer that drops the bloodsworn swords, but was 61 with my ranger 62. The hardest part of droga is some named don't come single or ya need to clear to them and theres a spot where ya can't get a single, like king drognan. Not sure if a 62 shammy can do the shrink and hide in the wall trick on him without getting agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My current (and in need of an upgrade) arms (see magelo below) were bought with adventure points from the BB/MM camp - they're from the least/lowest set of LDoN shaman armor but are still better than a lot of things you can get via bazaar or other simple means (IMO).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The sleeves from Piklo got my ranger 18aa before I finally got them to drop... Bad luck I guess<br />
Piklo camp is pretty easy. There are no wanderers and you can sit AFK forever is needed. Typically I was able to 7-8 mobs before respawn. They are spead out far enough you wont get adds on any pull. Nice relaxing camp. <br />
An adventurous person could do Bone Trooper Grolin as well as Piklo before respawns.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Lower levels take note - the sections of Droga near the zoneins from Nurga are lower level sections.  If you are sweating your invis dropping, just zone in via Nurga and operate on that side of the zone.    The toughest mobs are around the King in the inner sanctum area.</div></div><hr />
