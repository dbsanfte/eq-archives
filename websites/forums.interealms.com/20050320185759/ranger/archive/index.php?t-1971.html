<br />
Forget whether you agree or disagree about going into Iraq as that is a seperate argument.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not in the military nor am I privy to the things they know but there are two things I'm concerned about here which kinda run counter to each other.<br />
<br />
First it has been stated by Gen Franks and confirmed by several other major military heads that lack of OUR ground forces in Afganistan may have resulted in Bin Laden's escape.<br />
<br />
There is evidence to suggest that &quot;rebel&quot; forces in Afganistan were corrupt and let Bin Laden escape to Pakistan.<br />
<br />
So the corrective action for this was to in future operations use out own ground troops when trying to capture key personel of the opposing side.  Saddam is the big man in this case but there are several others worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
The other side is we as a doctrine are trying to get away from using large numbers of ground troops.  One it reduces the risk to lives.  Two it reduces the infrastructure we need to move.  And three in this particular scenario we don't have the solid backing of neighboring Arab states that we can base out of.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I'm not sure which way is better but man would I love to see the Pentagon debates on this... too bad they are classified.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm kind of into conspiracy theories, so here's one. Maybe the U.S. government caused 9/11 as an excuse to move our military into the Middle East so they could pull a &quot;well, as long as we're here, we might as well take out Saddam&quot;. Osama is a plant, a device used so in the end, we could have more oil. Ka-ching! Or 9/11 was intentionally caused by the U.S. to bolster faith in our new president after a close election.<br />
<br />
Well, ignoring all that, Tel, what are you man, new linkboy? Nm, linkman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One big thing about conspiracy theories that makes them HIGHLY improbable.<br />
<br />
With today's communication choices and the wide scale nature of these conspiracies I think it would be AWEFULLY hard to commit conspiracy after conspiracy without someone ever managing to mess one up and report it to the world.<br />
<br />
The timing the circumstances and the sheer luck that some of these theories propose make it so that its just VERY VERY unlikely.<br />
<br />
As far as this whole Linkboy thing.  Not sure why the kick all of sudden to flambast people who post links to what they think is interesting.<br />
<br />
On the General forum people are always posting links to related EQ material.<br />
<br />
On the Real Life forum people will post links to things that are interesting to real life.<br />
<br />
If you don't like the topics or don't want to read the links then close the thread and don't return but don't try and make fun of Kullaas, Aizle, Nitefox, myself or anyone else who comes and shares something interesting.<br />
<br />
The internet was designed to spread information rapidly and its much easier to have a central source with multiple eyes scanning the net and reporting back what they find than it is for each of us to work on our own to find all the fun, juicy tidbits.<br />
<br />
Besides all this posting helps me get my avatar :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
And, I think the whole linkboy/linkman thing was a joke. <br />
<br />
What gets me frustrated is when people post a link with no comments. If you're going to post a link, post your opinion about it as well. (As you tend to do, Tel). That's what makes links worthwhile, IMHO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Linkboy wasn't intended as an insult, more poking fun. The thing that gets me is the sheer volume of the link posts.<br />
<br />
Actually, I was gonna delete my conspiracy theories, because as everyone knows, conspiracy theorists are very paranoid, and as soon as I posted it I thought &quot;Oh crap! What if it's true, then they're going to trace my IP, find out where I live, send the MIBs then *bweet, bweet* double tap to the head.&quot; Oh well, let the suits come.</div></div><hr />

Ah but links are very handy.  They can back up your argument, or in this case they are the basis for the entire conversation.</div></div><hr />

It didn't come from your mind, you didn't break or make the story. You just presented it, then watched as the replies went up.

<br />
Case in point look at the old west.  News wasn't travelling very fast and literally discussions on the weather were a major topic.<br />
<br />
The old statement &quot;No man is an island&quot; is very true and if you attempt to be an island you will likely have no clue about things when you are visited.<br />
<br />
As far as the whole Iraw thing.. Yeah I think its going to be good to go in there and finish the job.<br />
<br />
Saddam's son is a nasty guy.  And the weapons they are rumored to have could give the US or our allies or our enemies for the matter a VERY bloody nose and frankly I would rather not have someone who is crazy enough to try it to also have the weapons.<br />
<br />
Fortunately the people who have the weapons have usually had the restraint to not use them and the people who would use them have not had the weapons.<br />
<br />
It won't stay like this forever but we should delay that combonation of desire to use and ability to use as long as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 12:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What are you talking about!? I have TONS to say, all the time, each post a mini-inspiration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 12:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vader I could list a book's worth of things about you and how you are affected by your fellow humans.<br />
<br />
but I'll get down to the single basic thing that makes it obivous that you are forever marked by your fellow humans and can never become unmarked.<br />
<br />
Language<br />
<br />
The very words you type are the result of another human's idea.  <br />
<br />
Language fundamentally affects how you think about the world.<br />
<br />
And even if you decide to rebel and create your own language by mixing up letters you would still be using a letter system developed by fellow humans.<br />
<br />
and even if you created your own letters you would still be using a concept of markings representing sound or ideas which again was developed by your fellow man.<br />
<br />
And even if you somehow managed to create a language with out a written form you would still be using the concept that certain sounds or combonations of sounds represent ideas or objects or actions which again was created by your fellow man long before you were around.<br />
<br />
And you can't use sign language its been thought of.<br />
<br />
Or body language.... again done for ages.<br />
<br />
So unless you can come up with a new medium all together (perhaps psychic?  though some would argue its already done) then you are forever marked by humankind.<br />
<br />
Kinds sucks to try and be anti-social when the very mind you possess is operated on social skills developed by others since you even before you exited your mother's womb (yes babies at the get go can be affected by sounds they heard during pregnancy)?<br />
<br />
So now that I've hijacked my own thread... how bout them Iraqis.<br />
<br />
I've got to thinking about it and I'm willing to wager that if we field massive ground troop units that we will be calling on Turkey as a base of operations.<br />
<br />
They don't get much media attention but they are one of the rare Muslim countires with a democracy that is a staunch American ally and even (shocker here) an Isreali Ally.  Their location in the middle east makes them an AWESOME start point for military operations just about anywhere with Isreal making up the other very convenient place (though due to recent political problem Isreal isn't a hot idea to base out of right now).<br />
<br />
However I doubt Saddam is going ot give us the leisure time we had like last time to build up... if he detects a build up he will strike first and he will strike hard.<br />
<br />
So if we go in we need to hit the ground running and we will need to neutralize his medium range theatre missiles and provide cover for our infrasturcture to get in place.<br />
<br />
On the bright side Turkey is easy to get to from Europe so we can do some of our prep work further back at other NATO sites and move up after we have the stuff moved and do a final round of setup which will be short in Turkey before going on a full offensive.<br />
<br />
Also keeping troop preparations further back from Iraq will make it harder for them to get intel on our build up.</div></div><hr />

My mind and thoughts are channeled through language, they do not come from it.<br />
<br />
My post on links was not in reference to you, it was more in general, so cool down man, I'm fine with you.<br />
<br />
Social skills change, they change from person to person.<br />
<br />
Anti-social is the lack of social skills, because we wish for the destruction of society. I didn't like being born into a world where there are rules, rules made by someone long dead. Morality was a hurdle I jumped over long ago. I could only hope for anarchy, but while I'm here, I'll play by the rules, til a twist of fate allows me to change them. Or buy my one little tiny island just to myself. That'd be cool!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dayspring Askanison</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 03:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off. these &quot;experts&quot; who say we should have a more air-intensive campaign rather then a ground intensive one. It reminds me of an Army joke. 2 ground pounders were talking over the last battle and one asked... &quot;So who won the air war?&quot;<br />
 Basically what that means is you can not win a war with just air power alone (remember Bosnia?). you need to use the ground troops, grunts, ground pounders, mud lovers if you're going to succede in battle.<br />
 Now on to Vader's comment about war on Iraq would be like EQ. Not that simple. What most people don't realize is that back in 1991 we didn't capture Saddam or Bagdad for one simple reason... IRAN! The majority of the population in Iraq is the same religous sect as the populalation of Iran, but the ruling minority in Iraq is just that a minority sect. It all has to do with Sunni and Shiite muslims.<br />
 So if we took out Saddam and toppled his government that would've left a power vacum in the middle east that would've allowed Iran to take over Iraq becoming the largest Arab nation in the world! And the last time I checked, Iran didn't like us very much, nor do they like Jordan, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the other gulf states who are our allies.<br />
 Yes, I think we should take out Saddam and his government, but we should set up a Stabilazation force along with NATO and maybe the U.N.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 03:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thats an interesting take on the situation Dayspring and one I've heard before... however...<br />
<br />
If we labeled Iraq and Iran as an Axis of Evil and I get the feeling that the White House wouldn't mind toppling Iran also then wouldn't getting them to merge make sense so that in a seperate compaign we could then oust the whole bubble?<br />
<br />
A scenario....<br />
We topple Saddam and destroy all of Iraqs weapons stores and factories leaving only the people behind.<br />
<br />
They decide to ally with Iran or perhaps even be absorbed by Iran.<br />
<br />
Iran gets ****y in their new found &quot;power&quot; and tries something stupid.<br />
<br />
Due to their recent absorbing of Iraq their military infrastructure will be thinned<br />
<br />
And so we move back in and oust that government.  Then when its ALL said and done we carve up the territory into small pieces the size of connecticut so that there is never a centralization of power to present a threat again for a long time.<br />
<br />
It would also shatter OPEC into so many pieces that it may not be able to present a united front anymore to allow the Middle East to use oil as a weapon again and no country would be big enough/rich enough to put forth the money to researching WMDs.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are ALL kinds of unaccounted problems in that scenario but since we have touched on the topic of conspiracy theories already I figured I throw out a grand scheme of my own :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK, I don't really. But sometimes I just want to see action, right or wrong.<br />
<br />
There was an interesting bit on &quot;The West Wing&quot; a couple of months ago. One of the staffers had wrttien a speech basically stating that American values were right, and we weren't going to rest until the rest of the world realized that. His response when challenged about the speech was &quot;They'll like us when we win.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sometimes I feel a little like that. Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead. Screw the rest of the world, they'll like us when we win.<br />
<br />
Sigh, if only it were that easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we are going to do it than DAMN lets do it right.<br />
<br />
Welcome to the United Empire of America...  you do it our way or the Highway (paved via our nuclear arsenal)<br />
<br />
Yes I'm being slightly sarcastic but to be honest if a nation leaves us alone then I say leave them alone.<br />
<br />
If a nation is dealing with us and applies legal pressure like stopping shipments of oil to us or speaking out in the UN about us or applying heavy taxes on our exports/imports then I say we play the game right back(nevermind we are the biggest player in the game and will win this hands down) :D<br />
<br />
If a nation is wanting stir up trouble with us I say goad them (legally) into making a bad strike first then pummel their arses to the stone age (not really as we have this nasty habit of nation building).  <br />
<br />
The rest of world takes pot shots at us legally all the time and we don't go marching in on them or flying planes into their buildings or illegally (by signing treaties)develope nuclear weapons while spouting off Iran is the great Satan.<br />
<br />
If I think some nation is a threat to the US then I'm going to try EVERYTHING to make them make a bad first strike so I have full clearance to go in there clean their clock.<br />
<br />
Its kinda like that example of you making fun of Christianity and then me making fun of you to make you swing first so I have full right to pummel you into the ground without getting in trouble.</div></div><hr />

Please explain exactly where you got that information. Iranians were celebrating in the streets with other Islamic nations when the WTC buildings went down. Plus they adamantly oppose our only real ally in the middle east - Isreal. It's not just the elite ruling class of Iran that blames the US for many of their problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tegwedar</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 04:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few things..<br />
<br />
I am in the Army been in for 8 yrs and now a few friends that get together and talk about old times and where and what happen when we were there.  <br />
First off, The big problem with using less forces is the fact that during the 90 91 conflict Saddom was moved under ground 90% of the time. Also he has multiple look likes that work for him to help protect him. <br />
Also everytime we go into a conflict with minimum soldiers we end up lossing more then we should or drawing the conflict out way to long. Like Vet/Korea.<br />
Smart Bombs do alot but not all.<br />
Another thing.. I dont see another good reason to go in there IF they let us inspect their Chem weapons.<br />
Honestly... I could care less then 2 sh!ts about the Saudi govt or the country for that matter. After saving their asses all we have done is hear them whine and bitch about us not doing this or that. Or not being fair.. AND MOST OF ALL NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THEIR AIR FIELDS TO BOMB AFGAN. They are 2 Faced and in my eye a Bigger threat to the U.S with the amount of oil they dish out. <br />
That hole region is unstable and no matter what we do we will cont to be under the gun. I honestly think we should pull out of the region and under go testing into new power sources for us to use instead of Oil. That alone would cause them to cater to us rather the other way around.<br />
IMHO<br />
<br />
I am P.O'd on this hole issue. We really should have backed the Iraqi rebels when we had the chance... That was the best time..<br />
I would not be surprised to see OBL is in Iraqi either...<br />
Were there is one dumb-ass there is another.<br />
<br />
Again Just MHO<br />
I dont mind if they just lvl the hole region and start anew, would save everyone alot of time and effort.</div></div><hr />
