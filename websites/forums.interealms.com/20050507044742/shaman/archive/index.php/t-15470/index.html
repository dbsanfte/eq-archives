<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been doing a search to see how many HP our pets have for each level but I havent had any luck finding any information on it.Anyone know?Also I realize our pets probably dont have many HP but since we have excellent slow spells, wouldnt this allow our pets to tank for a minute or two?How well do our pets tank?Im only lvl 21 right now but cant wait for my first pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 65 there is times where i treat my pet as a main tank. load him up with buffs and mage pet gear and he is sick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think our level 61 pet has about 3300-3500hp.<br />
I know that the pets from our Spirit Call AA ability enter into enrage mode after 3k damage (Sol Ro the god does exactly this amount with his AE fire attack), which is about 5-8% of total health left, and I have heard that the Spirit Call pets are just copies of our 61 pet.<br />
As for how many HPs our other pets have, I might summon up those old pets and check for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">61 pet is level 58 and has about 2200 HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This is a guess, but I think the 55pet sports between 1200 to 1300HP.  Fully buffed he hits almost 1500.<br />
<br />
Again, that is a guess and not the result of hard number scrutiny.  Im just going by what Kraggs will do to him.</div></div><hr />
