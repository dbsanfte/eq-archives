<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In regards to Shaman's REAL dps contribution(including HIGH end items and AAs), in high end content(RS, MPG, ETC.).  <br />
Lets start with the math;<br />
<br />
(DoTs were all calculated useing the average of 7 casts each)<br />
Name ..............avg mana cost.......avg Total DMG........Average dmg a Tick......DPS.....Efficiency<br />
Curse of Sisslak.......482.4......................5349.8...............764.2(7)................127.3.....11<br />
Blood of Yoppa........518.8......................5643..................627(9)..................104.5.....10.8<br />
Bane.....................387.........................3667.8...............523.9(7)................87.3.......9.4<br />
Blood of Saryrn.......406.2......................4416.6................490.7(9)................81.7......10.8<br />
                                                        <br />
<br />
Now, lets say mobs lasts for 45 seconds after it is in camp. And lets say we need the first 10-12 seconds for debuffs/cast time.  <br />
<br />
Name.............Total DMG(5 ticks)........DPS............Efficiency<br />
Curse of Sislak........3821..................84.9.............7.92<br />
Blood of Yoppa........3135..................69.6.............6.04<br />
Bane.....................2619..................58.2.............6.76<br />
Blood of Saryrn.......2453..................54.5.............6.06<br />
Panther.................4747..................105.5...........7.3<br />
<br />
The most (efficient) DPS a shaman can do (with DoTs/Panther) in high end raid content(after the Panther nerf);<br />
<br />
Blood of Yoppa.............69.6  DPS<br />
Panther......................105.5 DPS<br />
Panther......................105.5 DPS<br />
<br />
TOTAL DPS........................280.6<br />
TOTAL DMG.......................12629<br />
TOTAL Mana......................1818.8<br />
<br />
A couple of things here;<br />
- Due to the high resist rate(20%+) of our magic based dots, I used Yoppa instead.<br />
- Dots really cannot be stacked up to add more dps, due to the time needed.<br />
- With the 30 second recast time of Panther, and with the specific times needed to recast, it would be hard to consistantly keep this on more then 2 people.<br />
<br />
I guess the real question is, &quot;how much DPS SHOULD a high end Shaman do, and how much mana SHOULD be used&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Should be &quot;contribute&quot; and not &quot;do&quot;.... because I am sure comparisons are going to be made to other classes for balancing reasons.  And thus, bard songs and such would &quot;contribute&quot; to DPS at some point.... enchanter haste is better than ours... etc etc etc.... blah blah.<br />
<br />
There is still the argument that Panther/Leopard is not Shaman &quot;do'ing&quot; the DPS.  <br />
<br />
But really interesting numbers and information.  Would be interesting to see compared to some other classes &lt;cough&gt;BST&lt;/cough&gt;.<br />
<br />
But I do agree.... how much should a Shaman contribute to DPS?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you want to see something even more interesting?........<br />
<br />
Mid end Shaman's DPS;<br />
<br />
Now, lets say mobs lasts for 60 seconds after it is in camp(takes longer to kill, due to other classes haveing less dps). And lets say we need the first 10-12 seconds for debuffs/cast time. <br />
<br />
The most (efficient) DPS a shaman can do (with DoTs/Panther) in Mid end raid content(after the Panther nerf); <br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn.............54.5  DPS <br />
Panther......................105.5 DPS <br />
Panther......................105.5 DPS <br />
<br />
TOTAL DPS........................265.5<br />
TOTAL DMG.......................16580 <br />
<br />
As you can see, Mid end Shaman can actually do more damage, not only because of the fact that mobs live longer(REALLY effects the usefullness of DoTs), but level and gear does not effect the damage output of Panther.<br />
<br />
This is the problem we are haveing.  The devs are ONLY looking at low/mid end Shaman, and are SCREWING high end Shaman.<br />
(just something for you people to look forward to as you increase in ranks)</div></div><hr />

I guess pre-nerf the higher end ones could keep it on more people..now with the nerf..3 is 3.  Kinda sucks for them.  My mana-pool is about 7k now with Cxxx.  I could keep it on 3 before..can keep it on 3 now.  The issue is raids and the complete pain in the freaking ass that it is to keep a rotation (with only 8 seconds of fluff in my case) to do our DPS.  <br />
<br />
My solution:  If they want a max of 3, somehow code it so that it can ONLY be on 3 people at once.  However, I can chain off 3 of these babies in 12 seconds or so..but then not be able to cast any more until the first one wears off.  This would limit the DPS on it and make it much less of a pain in hte ass to us</div></div><hr />

Total............99 seconds (1:39)<br />
<br />
- And most shaman are probably not going to be restricted from doing their other jobs, just so they can hit that Panther spell right when it repops.<br />
<br />
So if you are going to try and keep it on 3 people, you will probably have a gap. <br />
So keeping it on 3 people &quot;consistantly&quot; is going to be very hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, and how many times at exactly when the spell comes ungreyed are we not doing something else..like casting a slow ass nuke or DoT...<br />
<br />
I guess I hadn't used my DoTs much but trying Blood last night..holy hell it sure casts slow for me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">somehow code it so that it can ONLY be on 3 people at once.<br />
<br />
GROUP ONLY !!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Tek</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zurxon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, Tek!!!  Group only and Shaman pet only for the win, all else as it was. That would solve nearly everything that brought on the stinking NERF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Why are we willing to accept something substandard to what we already received? Removing effectiveness for pets? Sure. THAT was broken. The spell was otherwise fine as is. Group only? No. A *smaller* recast timer? Yeah, how about none?<br />
<br />
Don't let them do to us now what they always do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Frankly, I'd consider self-group (and group's pets) only restriction a win. Don't know how they'll code that pet stuff though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>warbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For high end shaman, I would much rather see them just tack this spell on Champion, tripple the mana cost, and perhaps decrease the proc rate 25% if it seems too powerfull.  So;<br />
<br />
If there is an average of 5 melees (3PCs and 2 pets) that would be = 425dps (75x5)<br />
<br />
I think for high end shaman, 425 dps would be about perfect.</div></div><hr />

Make it a my-group-only group buff. Duration somewhere around 5 minutes, high mana cost. That way you will hit every pet who's owner has the pet buff AA (which should have been free anyways .... but I digress).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gaag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That way you will hit every pet who's owner has the pet buff AA (which should have been free anyways .... but I digress).<br />
I disagree here... That would make the spell quite useless for the shaman with a lesser amount of AA's. Seeing the first level of the current spell line is at 61, that would force shaman to do a lot of AA work prior to making this spell usefull and prior to level 61. No thanks. I dislike being forced into a route for getting AA's.<br />
<br />
Please also note the remark from Brenlo at the start of the class re-envisioning. They want to extend the spell line as part of the class re-envisioning, also downwards.<br />
Say you get the first of the first spell of this line at level 20. Your suggestion would it make pretty useless to shaman.<br />
Nope: a group spell with automatic pet inclusion, or an individual targetted spell with the ability to hit a group member, or a group member's pet, independent of the pet AA.<br />
If they are coding happily away anyway: make sure it never hits the cleric's pet :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You wouldn't be FORCED to get the pet AA for it to be of any use, unless your group had absolutely no melee members and a lot of mage/shaman.  It still hits all of the group as a group spell, so should be fine that way (course, then I'd be dreaming of letting MGB work with it...)</div></div><hr />

How are you going to cast it on your pet?</div></div><hr />

You aren't, unless you have pet affinity.  I think that was the point.</div></div><hr />
