<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rainwolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I understand that the PGS can be multi quested, but here's my question.  <br />
<br />
I am in a situation where a barbarian Warrior in my guild has the stone but she has been killing in PoG which has made her scowling to Faola Storm(whatever) in FV.  <br />
<br />
Is there anyway to salvage this that you know of?  <br />
<br />
Can I 2 box my Enchanter and charm?  How to charmed mobs act... <br />
<br />
Obviously she cannot sneak and I don't know of any illusions that make one indifferent in FV.  ESPECIALLY not wolf form!  LOL<br />
<br />
This is fairly important in that a jade reaver is at stake which can be quite costly due to the rare drop rate.  <br />
<br />
Thank you for your help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Charm should work. I believe it's been done before, I don't really know the mechanics of it though.<br />
<br />
Faction repair is also a possibility, I think only indifferent faction  is needed for this turn-in (or even just to be non-KoS may be enough).  Massive slaughter in Crushbone will help fix Faydark's Champions faction, which Foloal Stormforest is on.  Once you're up to dubious you can feed muffins to Pandos in west Freeport to get to indifferent status.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thennes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">should also be able to use the harmony/invis trick to turn the muffins in to pandos..  if pandos is low enough level for harmony to work.. <br />
<br />
invis the person who needs to turn in muffins and have them stand behind pandos, cast harmony, have person drop invis and hand in 4 stacks of 4 muffins, cast invis again on said person before he clicks trade and he should get all of the associated faction hits..<br />
<br />
if he's kos it will take a hell of a lot of muffins to get to a point where he can turn them in by himself but its easier than killing orcs and whatnot to get faction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mift atchou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">only prob is you cant turn in stacks of stuff anymore, any stack is counted as 1 item now. i think that happened when they put in the code to prevent you from combining stacks of stuf for trade skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mienae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can anyone confirm that she's on faydark champion's faction? and does anyone know what the minimum faction for the turnin is? Or even what faction you were at when you did it successfully?</div></div><hr />
