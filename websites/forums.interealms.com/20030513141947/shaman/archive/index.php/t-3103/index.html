Since I haven't heard them acknowledge the issue maybe not enough people in the EQ chain of command are aware of it. <br />
So let them know!</div></div><hr />

ShadowKnights finally got their Tracker Azeal to start spawning, was curious if shaman's got lucky.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've been playing in Nurga with my warrior alt.  We camp in the &quot;safe cave&quot; right past the Overseer room for hours on end.  I've hung out over 40 play hours pulling mobs from that room and the surrounding area.<br />
<br />
No Overseer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jurassic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There was a recent post on the ChampionsofCabilis.com board that a GM responded to an inquiry and was told that the Overseer was working correctly - now I've been told that before and the GM's didn't even check the problem - if they don't have an 'official' bug report then its not really a bug whether or not its working is irrelevent.<br />
<br />
It could be that they moved him and no one has found him or VI is just playing their usually games.<br />
<br />
I've gone from sending messages to GMs to sending them to the Developers Corner to see if I can some clarification that he is working or not.<br />
<br />
Personally, I was told by a GM not too long ago that I was correct the Overseer wasn't spawning and it would be marked as a bug.<br />
<br />
Has anyone seen the chant rock needed drop?  Word was that wasn't dropping either and I just haven't checked Droga's RockChanters to find out...</div></div><hr />

No luck on that either, after killing dozens of rockchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>jurassic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If ya'll have the time please take a minute to /bug, or email your GM or the Developer's corner directly - this is BS and its been down for over 2 months (and about halfway thru its 3rd).<br />
<br />
FYI too - word was it was working normal on Stormhammer some time back - not sure if its working there or not tho atm - Gee if I pay an extra $30 a month maybe I could get a working version of EQ too :P<br />

I was in there on friday and killed everything for a few hours and nothing I needed popped. Just wasted a few hours.</div></div><hr />

I've just gotten to this part of my cudgel quest as well and it's pissing me off they broke the quest only a few months after completeing it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Tossen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I have been sending in bug reports twice a day now since the beggining of August. The only response I recieved was from one of the guides that requested that I please try to cut down my bug reports as they were causing some of the other reports to take longer to get to. They were aware of the problem and looking into fixing it. My simple reply was &quot;I spent more than 20 hours camped in Kurns Tower at level 57 thanks to this ridiculous quest. Now you have broken it at a point that I cannot go any further. Until this issue is fixed, you will continue to see reports on a daily basis from meas it is my only means of getting any resolution.&quot; The guide responded with &quot;I understand. And we hope to have this corrected soon.&quot;<br />
<br />
We have a patch coming up on Wednesday....maybe if we pray hard enough our wishes will come true. One month of this being broken is assinine in my opinion.....three monthes now is just plain disrespect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Lets say we all go down to SOE headquarters and make up some &quot;FREE TEH OVERSEER&quot; signs and parade around outside yelling HELL NO, WE WONT GO!!!!<br />
<br />
Lol yes this is driving me nuts as well. They broke the quest THE WEEK I got to the nurga part. Gah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>jurassic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I've been trying to get this guy since June sometime - i've /bug'd, emailed the developers forum, q&amp;a forum and my GM (yeah got a form letter back stating that I'm not patient enough - whoohoo).<br />
<br />
I can't believe they haven't fixed it or will comment on whether it is broken or not (not that they will comment on it).<br />
<br />
Ya know if I have a bug happen with software I buy usually there is a company site out there to look it up and find a workaround for - with eq i get to buy the software and pay $ every month to be kept guessing what is working and what isn't - why do we put up with this????<br />
<br />
Oh that's right - I'm an addict - I forgot....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Back when the rest of us were working on solving this quest around the fourth cudgel and having trouble with the mushroom forage for Xinth, and then again for the helm drop for the sixth cudgel.. we waited a total of a year and a half for them to fix the quest to get to the point we could get our hammers...<br />
<br />
I consider this an act of cruel, but amusing irony.<br />
<br />
Mercuratrayin, Iksar Shaman, 56<br />
<br />
<br />
But, yes, they really should fix this and every other broken quets before charging another $30 for an expansion when so many bugs predominate the existing material.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Any updates since the Sept. 4 patch?  I'm going to head over after work and give it a few hours, but that be for a while yet.  Anyone seen this guy today?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Update on the Overseer - it seems he can spawn in ANY spot now. I was told by a monk camping the lower floor that the Overseer had popped in 6 different places since he had been there (which must have been awhile). <br />
<br />
I was camping all the gobs from his normal spawn spot up the long hallway past the pit and he spawned up in there.  Took about 2 hours for me to get him to spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">yep got overseer tonight, popped in random spot. Didnt get any slate rock, back tomarah to continue to quest</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Barbasja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Killed Dlubish in the room marked as number 3 on EQ Atlas map: http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/nurga1map.html, sep. 5th 2002. There are four spawns here, two by the tent by the fire, one in each of the other two tents. I kept killing all four spawns for about 1.5 hours, and Dlubish popped right after killing the two by the fire, in the middle of these two spawns. So perhaps Dlubish is a 5th spawn in here and on a separate timer. Looked that way to me. Dlubish is a cleric, and apprx. same level as the other gobbies. Easy kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Skrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I was in the temple of droga yesterday Sunday the 8th of September and saw the overseer near the room marked as 5 on this http://www.eqatlas.com/kunark/templeofdrogamap.html map. This is the room where the Warder who drops the shroud of nature spawns. <br />
<br />
I didn't kill him as I was there with my monk to finish the shackle of steel and had used all my invis potions and hoping to make it to the exit before the current invis wore out... (I did)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>SkegBlackwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">No sign of him for me today (9th Sept), camped his traditional spot for about 3 hrs...<br />
<br />
Can the Sponge Mushroom be foraged here as no sign of that either :( <br />
<br />
Sigh will have to return I suppose..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>mukkrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">He can pop anywhere now -- and he still pops in the traditional area as well. Unless they broke it with the multiple patches they've done lately.<br />
<br />
Gratz me on Skyiron Cudgel of the Arisen. One more turn in and the final fight is all that's left. =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">While I have never seen him in Nurga, I have killed him twice in Droga.  He seems to be spawning in any place where the Warder usually spawns and I've seen him on two occasions.  If you go into Droga while an AE group is faction farming you have an even better chance of getting him to spawn as they are slaughtering mass goblins at a rapid rate.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
