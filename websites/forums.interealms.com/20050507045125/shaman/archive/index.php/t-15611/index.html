<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got this tonight after I got, YET AGAIN an eqgame.exe crash, something that I have been tolerating on a nightly basis for 3+ months now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Apparently they are trying to do something about it?<br />
<br />
It asks if you'd consent to sending info on where and what you were doing in game when it crashed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">lol, now I crash in PoT within 10 seconds of logging in, sometimes faster.<br />
<br />
To top it off, when I crashed the first time I was running, and my toon ran off into the water, where he is slowly drowning everytime I log in.<br />
<br />
Cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did you change operating systems? Windows XP pops up a dialog saying &quot;do you want to send information&quot; whenever an application crashes. Note, it doesn't actually mean there is someone on the other side who's going to do anything. I get the &quot;do you want to send information&quot; when an application that I'm programming crashes - and I know I'm not getting emails from Microsoft with crash logs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">no, its not an operating system message. Its EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">off topic but LMAO Krakster at your sig quote.  My mind is still hurting from trying to follow that thread's logic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I must've turned that option off at some point - I have XP and I don't get that option, regardless of how many things I crash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yah the eq error window is a new function. When it popped up my game was still running but then it crashed after. All I could think was if they can detect that its about to crash why doesn't it just do something about it? I know not that simple in reality, but its just one of those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">From http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8421http://www.fohguild.org/forums/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=8421, I think this is in the eqclient.ini file:<br />
<br />
The solution to this is definatly changing UMBRA=TRUE or deleting the line altogether.<br />
<br />
having Umbra=false as well as with a big clipping planes was causing the crashes for me but stopped since I made the change to my eqclient.ini<br />
<br />
Thanks to Behemoth for solving this one sinec it was tied to the time portal clipping problem as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i've already tried that<br />
<br />
doesnt work for me</div></div><hr />
