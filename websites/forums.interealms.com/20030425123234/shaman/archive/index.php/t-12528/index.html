<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been around a few vegetarians in my time here on earth, and I must say, they all seem the same. Guy at work today, typical veggie, anti-bush, anti-war, anti-government, anti-washing.<br />
<br />
He is a well educated person, but other than that, I must wonder if it is a genetic problem with veggies that causes them to have such a warped perception of reality.<br />
<br />
1. Thinks it is wrong to kill animals to eat them, yet wears leather, when confronted with the millions of small animals killed by harvesting produce, freaks out and changes the subject.<br />
<br />
2. Expects people to go out of their way to accomodate their weirdness, had a dinner with some people where they prepared a special veggie lasagne for them.<br />
<br />
3. Are dirty looking/smelling. All of em I have seen, dress with beads, odd colored clothing, baggy pants, greasy or long hair on guys, pony tails, beards untrimmed.<br />
<br />
4. Are incredibly weak. Everyone I have met without fail is scrawny and weak. Just can't get enough calories or don't believe in excersize/gyms?<br />
<br />
5. Hate bush and the government in general. Everything is a conspiracy and all mainstream media outlets are mouthpieces of the Govt.<br />
<br />
6. Hate war, believe in human rights, yet when confronted with millions of Iraqis being slaughtered/shredded/burned they say it isn't our problem(how can somone care more about a cow then people?)<br />
<br />
7. Smoke, not all here, but how can somone who thinks they are so healthy, smoke pot and ciggs?<br />
<br />
8. Drives a small Honda<br />
<br />
9. Lives in Vermont(talk about a crunchy state, my god, it sucks here, I wish I was a vegetarian pole goblin here just so I could get free stuff) All these cows, and hardly anyone to eat them(Vermont has more cows then people BTW)<br />
<br />
10. Talk slow, like he just smoked a pound of weed. Uses &quot;dude&quot; and other weird lingo.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll get blasted for this I am sure, but damned if this isn't a very accurate portrait of the typical vegetarian. And, remember, every goddamn day I ehar about the evils of eating meat, how unhealthy it is, blah blah, this guy can maybe, maybe do 10 push ups, where as I can bench over 400 pounds, and hell I am lazy as hell about my nutrition. Could snap his arm like a slim jim.<br />
<br />
I just can't tolerate weirdness. Why should I be subjected to vegetarian rhetoric and anti-everything bitching and not be able to slap em with a steak and then eat them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Vegetarians don't read the Bible... the 11th comandment is, and I quote: Though shalt eat cows, for they are mighty tasty and best savored with A1 sauce, so sayeth the Lord.  :D <br />

<br />
ROFL Ice!  Seriously, though, I know a few vegetarians (as opposed to vegans) who aren't so scrawny.  <br />
<br />
I've taken to being &quot;busy&quot; when invited to dinner at certain pair of veg-friends house.  It's amazing how many dishes can be made to taste like dirt.  On the other hand, there's a veg couple that I would make every effort to dine with... they can make the same dishes as couple #1, but they taste nummy!!<br />
<br />
Oh, and each couple owns a Honda.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My only personal problem with vegetarians is the fact that so many of them have tried to project their lifestyle on me, almost condescendingly so.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many vegetarians choose that lifestyle because it really is more healthy, or just to fit in with some elite clique.<br />
<br />
If you want to shun meat and live &quot;purely,&quot; so be it.  Just don't berate me because I enjoy a juicy burger every now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just can't tolerate weirdness.<br />
<br />
Please rephrase this to say what you really meant.  I know that you a very opinionated, red-blooded American male with very conservative values, but are you really that intolerate of people with unconventional lifestyles?<br />
<br />
For the record, I don't think your description of vegetarians has any basis at all.  It is very stereotypical, and most of the vegetarians I know (my ex girlfriend and her best friend, for example) don't fit your mold at all.<br />
<br />
The reason you have made all the assumptions that you have made is because the people that fit your mold are the most visible members of that minority.  For every vegetarian that has those characteristics that you listed, there are probably a dozen that are perfectly normal people whose simply chose not to eat meat.  You never notice those dozen, though, because they are just regular people who do not run around shouting &quot;look at me I am a vegetarian!&quot;  What I just said applies to all of the stereotypes and generalizations you have been making recently.  Try and judge people on an individual basis rather than lumping them in to groups and then judging them by their most flamboyant members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Jinheim,<br />
<br />
 there is a very good chance you are right. Perhaps it is just the outspoken ones we all see everyday. Good point. Yesterday had a real heated argument with one, who happens to be a friend so i can be blunt and loud, and I honestly think somonething is wrong with him mentally. Things just don't make sense.<br />
<br />
 Plus, I am biased living in Vermont, this state really is a hell hole of crunchy. UVM was voted best party school some years back by the playboy people, well, that made the college go in to an uproar, curb drinking, parties, etc, now they are known as the biggest hippy school for pot, clove smokeing, granola eating, etc, and they are proud?<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
<br />
I also have never seen a big vegetarian. I am in to weightlifting and read alot about it, and the few vegans there are have an extremely hard time getting the right amount of calories/nutrients they need. Bilogically, we are made to eat an omnivorous diet, like the esteemed poster notes below me, it is indeed in the teeth, and in our gut.<br />
<br />
 It is also widely theorized that one of the biggest reasons man developed the huge brains, is that when they learned to hunt and eat incredibly nutritious meat, that they had much more time to think and invent. One helping of wooly mammoth brain = mega calories and fat, would take many hours to scrounge that much grass, and still wouldn't get the nutrients you need.<br />
<br />
 Not to mention hunting itself probably facilitated the need to communicate and perform as social groups.<br />
<br />
Laying on your side in a pasture eating grass helps no one. A pic I drew of my vegan buddy, he got quite a chuckle.<br />

Most of the rest of the group would like to quietly go on their way and lead their life in private, but these militants require their viewpoint to be foisted on everyone else.<br />
<br />
Look at the veggies - they've sued Burger King, McDonalds, etc. to make them provide a veggie alternative menu.  Why?  If you don't like what the restaurant serves - don't go there.  How hard is that to understand?  The militants would rather force an established, accepted, traditional American restaurant serve their food in order to make themselves look mainstream, even though they will never be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm a vegetarian.  Let me see if your silly bigotted stereotypical guidelines apply!<br />
<br />
1.  I don't think it's wrong to kill animals, but I do place some &quot;value&quot; on them, between the value I place on plants and that of humans.  I try to cause their deaths as little as possible.  I still eat milk and cheese, because giving up everything with milk and cheese ranks above discomfort for the animals, and I wear leather, but not much (one pair of shoes every year or two).<br />
<br />
2.  I just ask what's being cooked beforehand, and see if they can put the meat in another stage or something.  If I'm not dear enough for them to go out of their way a little for my eccentricity, then why am I eating with them in the first place?  If it's a dish where meat cannot be seperated, then a replacement like noodles or some such + the other parts of the meal is usually enough.<br />
<br />
3.  I shower every morning, and after each tough workout.  My hair is usually between 1/4&quot; and 1&quot; long.  I wear deodorent and brush my teeth twice a day.<br />
<br />
4.  I skate for 1-2 hours on days when the weather is good, or go running for 30 mins or so.  I practice wing chun kung fu 3-4 times a week.  I go through an abbreviated set of exercises in the mornings when I wake up.  I'm 5'10&quot;, somewhere between 145 and 160 depending on time of year (I get lazy about exercising in winter).<br />
<br />
5.  I don't dislike bush.  I dislike a lot of the stuff the government does, because I don't see that they have the right or the need to do such.  Yay libertarianism.<br />
<br />
6.  I hate war.  Any rational person does.  Only the mentally disturbed like for their neighbors and sons and cousins to go off to some foreign country to die.  But sometimes it's the only way that you can prevent more evil in the world, as in the case of Iraq, South Korea, etc.<br />
<br />
7.  I don't smoke, tobacco or otherwise.<br />
<br />
8.  Heh.  I drive a 1989 Honda Prelude.  Dad gave it to me on my 18th birthday (3 years ago), after I drove a hoopty-ass 1987 van for 2 years.   :p   So I guess one of your stereotypes isn't as ridiculous as the rest!<br />
<br />
9.  I live in Virginia.<br />
<br />
10.  Though I have a tiny bit of southern drawl, I don't talk slowly.  I say &quot;dude&quot; occasionally, but not as much as my knife-obsessed, steak-loving, red-blooded-American, porn-addicted, chronically-masturbating roommate.  Just because the guy has a different vocabulary than you do doesn't make it wierd.<br />
<br />
Conclusion:  Mill, pull your head out of your ass, you'll be able to see the people around you for the people that they are more clearly.   :D  I almost never bring up the subject of vegetarianism unless prompted to (such as this post).  In fact, I can't think of a time where I started talking about the reasons why I'm vegetarian without first being asked about them (except when I told my family initially  ;) ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mill: <br />
Although stereotypical, your description describes a large number of the vegetarians I know (a couple of hundred or so).  I don't mind adjusting my menu to accommodate them much as I love to cook pretty well anything, but I also cook what I want for me and my meatatarian friends.<br />
<br />
I've learned over the years that moderation in anything - especially diet - it the way to go.  Extreme diets (as vegetarianism is to an omnivore or a pure meat &quot;diet&quot; as is also a fad now) are generally unhealthy without taking some other extreme countermeasure (such as vitamin supplements).  Interestingly, I have seen some seriously obese &quot;vegetarians&quot; - after all french fries, potato chips, M&amp;Ms, and cheetos are all vegetables aren't they? :D<br />
<br />
There was a great article in Time magazine about the spectrum of vegetarianism:  Vegan at one end to &quot;Chicken and Fish only&quot; vegetarians (/boggle - last I checked, chicken and fish were animals ;) ).  The latter category has been nicknamed &quot;The Beady-Eyed Vegetarian&quot; since they won't eat animals with sad, friendly, loving eyes like cows, rabbits and deer.  Good news is, these folks probably will never be cannibals either I suppose!<br />
<br />
Why are they vegetarians?  Of all the vegetarians I know, the single most common reason is &quot;I just wanted to see what it's like.&quot;  Most of that category last about 1-3 years.  A few last longer because they just view it as a discipline to adhere to - like runners or weightlifters.  Some want to &quot;protect the animals&quot; but have no real sense of the balance of nature or the food chain when they espouse their doctrine.  Many of my friends do it for religious reasons and since man does many more harmful things in the name of religion, I can truly respect a discipline like vegetarianism when based in faith.  Finally, a few of them are vegetarians for effect.  They get to be the center of attention more often as a vegetarian (&quot;Oh, that's ok - I just won't eat anything - SIGHhhhhhhhh!&quot; - How can you eat something so disgusting!  We need to stop killing cows - someone should defend their rights!  And a host of other equally ridiculous &quot;convictions.&quot;).  These folks are clueless, and will switch to the Atkins Diet just as soon as it becomes the next cool thing.<br />

<br />
I will never become a vegetarian.  I really have a high respect for them being able to restrain themselves this much.  I can't imagine living without meat, egg, cookies and cakes <br />
<br />
:p<br />
<br />
This forum is the first time I see them being bashed as unhealthy though.  I have no doubt being vegetarian's healthy.  But I can't do it, all the delicious stuffs walk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not a nutrition expert, but I don't think you get all the nutrients that you need off a pure vegetarian diet.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, when my roommates demolish all of the meat in the house, I have to eat veggies for a day until I have time/money to go to the store.  During those days I usually feel kind of tired and sluggish, like I have no energy at all.  Maybe its just me, though.<br />
<br />
I think that dietary habits, like almost all things, are best when they are a balance between the two extremes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">As was said before in this thread, everything is bad in excess, vegans can be as unhealthy as the rest of us. I have known several, they die young as do omnivors and carnivors. Despite the propoganda, you need to choose what works for you. All this militant diet BS is just that, bs. If being a vegan works for you, then do it, if following the Atkins diet works best, then just do it. Generations can be used to prove all sides wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I admitted up there it probably is really just the outspoken ones, but every one I do know is the same. It is not wrong to generalize in a situation like that. I need proof above all else, and I have never seen a normal looking/acting vegetarian.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tried the atkins diet, short term, it really does work, dropped 11 pounds in two weeks and ate like a grease monkey, but it causes havoc on your bathroom duties, and you really need to be creative in your food choice. I do not think it is realistic long term.<br />
<br />
Good thing about it is, you get good muscle gains while on it as well, where as a normal low-fat low calorie diet you struggle to even maintain your muscle mass. There is a reason bobdy builders geting ready for a competition rely on high protein, very low carb diets, it keeps the muscle while burning the fat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I probably should not even post based on the obvious bias.  But I would like to say that Vegan's are people too.<br />
<br />
I was lacto/ovo Veggie for 4 years prior to turning Vegan last May.  I started this lifestyle for health reasons and have been pleased with the changes.  <br />
<br />
1.  I do not wear leather.  I do own some from pre-veg days but it is going to goodwill soon.  And comparing the accidental killing of small creatures in farming to the wholescale slaughter of cow, pigs or chicken is just assinine.  Yes there will be losses but it is in no way intentional.  I do not run from this discussion.<br />
<br />
2.  If someone invites me to dinner then yes, it would be courteous to feed me something I can eat.  I typically will plan on bringing my own food or eating ahead of time if its not a personal invitation.<br />
<br />
3.  I am not dirty.  I shower daily, have a neat and clean hairdo.  I do admit to not shaving my legs as often as some but its been winter and whos looking under my slacks?!  <br />
<br />
4.  I am a woman with serious knee issues.  I guess that could be considered weak as it inhibits me from participating in sports and strenous activity.  I prefer to be able to walk and be somewhat sedentary then to try to be super active and have my knee continually dislocate and tear all the ligaments, again. Thank you.  Unfortunatly my gym recently closed down so now I need to find a new place to go to Yoga. :(<br />
<br />
5.  Government.  Ah, I dont think its simply eating veggies that make people dislike government.  <br />
<br />
6.  Its called Respect and Compassion for ALL life.  From that of human to the smallest goldfish.  I have my own other reasons for hating war that stem from a past before I was Veg.<br />
<br />
7.  I dont smoke.  I dont do drugs.  I do drink but no where near heavily or to excess.  Remember the only happy cleric is a drunk cleric!<br />
<br />
8.  Drove a Chevy for 7 years and it was just replaced by a Toyota.  Those Hybrids look very cool though and I want one of those next!<br />
<br />
9.  I live in Tennessee.  Not the Veg capitol of the world.  Southerners consider Pork to be a seasoning not an animal for some reason...  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
10. I dont talk slow, I dont act stoned and I dont say Dude.  If anything I say things like: Hon(ey), w00t and uber way to much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I dont consider this an attack.  Your post did that quite well though.  With every single post you paint yourself with a stereotype as well.  I read once that people feel the need to attack others of differing beliefs simply because they were not comfortable or sure enough in their own convictions.<br />

 Ahh, but how silly you are being. I told you above, I have to deal with an obnoxious veggie friend, and he angers me to no end, so this isn't some random crusade, I am sick to death of stinky breath tofu eaters trying to ram retarded ideas down my throat.<br />
<br />
Knee issues, wanna talk knee issues? I have had 5 operations to my left knee, all the cartilage cap on my femur fell out, was removed, pieces of bone fell out and were removed and pinned back in place. I had to travel to Mass General to have Bo Jackson's surgeon perform a new surgery, they cut out the end of my femur and replaced it with cadaver bone, two giant screws. Those had to coem out eventually because they were grinding against my flesh. My knee looks like it got hit with a hand grenade.<br />
  I have pain just going down the stairs, but pain is good for the soul, and pain can be overcome. Jogging sucks, running fast too, but I can do it. Injury is NEVER and excuse to not be active. I consider being active and strong critical to keeping my knee from further injury, the stronger the surrounding muscles are, the less stress on the knee joint, lazy = hurt.<br />
You once again show the stupidity of the vegans, it is a sin to intentionally kill animals and eat them, but okay to kill millions of small animals a year harvesting grain and such, and leave them to rot in the fields, how compassionate!!<br />
<br />
<br />
You don't shave your legs much, fine, what do you do when your hubby or boyfriend wanna play? They consider that attractive? Their hands should be in your slacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
You wanna be a vegan, fine, I have no problem with that, but I do have a problem with idiocy, like saying it's okay to kill animals unintentionally and let them rot, as opposed to intentionally for food. Just taking the brush hog out to trim the fields I must kill 20 varmints in a single acre, they did nothing to deserve this did they?<br />
<br />
Perhaps if you ate meat and stayed active, you wouldn't be afraid of injury. I am not, it would take a mac truck of an impact to hurt me(weightlifting and staying active contributes to much heavier bone mass), and even if I break something, no problem, doc fix it, go do it again.<br />
<br />
<br />
I attack others when they are dumb, no less, no more. What exactly is my stereotype anyway, I am curious. Redneck is funny, because no one can say why, I think they picture me as a hillbilly, well, that's fine, I do live in a rural state, I know how to shoot guns, I am tough, love beer, jerky, heh!! I certainly don't look like one, hell if anything I could be considered a preppy, I love anything 80's.<br />
<br />
Gonna go run me over some roadkill, after all, it's okay if I kill them unintentionally right?<br />
<br />
Do all vegans live in fear? Fear of injury, fear of ill health?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It is absolutely rediculus to paint a whole group of people by one &quot;friend&quot;.

Course you need to follow the advice as well then.<br />
<br />
Knees.  Ah.  Mine is a birthdefect, lived with it my whole walking life.  Its not a Vegan fear.  Its a hang up from being 7mo pregnant and almost falling daily on my daily walks.  And all the years prior to having a knee dislocate twice a week until finally it simply wasnt painful, ie: no ligaments left intact.  I had one surgery that removed numberous pea sized lumps of cartalige and split the tendon, repaired damage and tried to counteract the years of damage.  Of course now with the scar tissue it aches like blazes with weather and arthritis.  A doctor wanted to do the whole bone moving, chopping bit on the other knee but I said NO and I live with it.  Thankfully they keep me mobile at the moment.  That said I am a single mother, I dont have time for knee injuries or surgeries.<br />

I did go to a gym quite frequently.  So it wasnt a body building one but it was a gym.  It closed, Im looking for a new one.  I am not obese by any means, thank you.<br />

My fiance lives 1000miles away.  When we move in together I will shave more simply because its much nicer.  But when its winter and the dryness of TN has already made my skin scaley I am NOT shaving for no one but myself and make it worse.  hehe  Men get away with not shaving their face and its visible! No one sees my legs unless I want them to during the winter.  The only man I am out to impress does get the full treatment when we are together.  <br />

On to farming!  Now, everyone eats those grains and veggies harvested that accidentally kill small animals.  Its nothing compared to the millions of chickens crammed into a tiny cage with their beaks cut off, festering with disease, overfed and underexercised till their bones break.  Of the tiny baby chicks hatched unluckily male that get tossed into plastic bags or ground back into the feed.  Nor to the beef industry dragging downed cattle to the slaughterhouse.  I simply can not equate these two as equal.  It is horrible that small animals are killed in the process of grains and veggies.  But it is more horrific to view a slaughterhouse's activities because it is intentional.<br />

I enjoy very good health thank you.  <br />
I do not live in fear, only sadness at the lack of compassion for all life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think Mill was &quot;trolling&quot;, as he often does. Assuming that to be the case, he certainly got the results he was looking for.<br />
<br />
Generalisations based on a small sample are not usually valid. Too often people form their opinions about a group of people based on a high-profile vocal minority - a minority who are not particularly representative (prime example; gay people). I am sure there are vegetarians who are approximated by Mill's crude stereotyping. But I know plenty of vegetarians who are not.<br />
<br />
There are literally millions of people who are vegetarian for religous reasons - Buddhists and Hindus being the obvious examples. Generation after generation of vegetarians who seem to get by just fine without meat - which kinda scotches the &quot;cant get a balanced diet without meat&quot; argument doesn't it.<br />
<br />
Sure, there are certain dietry requirements that are harder to source from a vegetarian diet (particularly vegan), but so what. Ok, in a sample of 1 (i.e. me) it was never a problem. I was vegetarian for about 3 years - basically because it was significantly cheaper for me to be vegetarian than to eat meat, and I do mean significantly cheaper, and I was living below the poverty line putting myself through university. Now, that is not to say I ate no meat (or fish) during that time - If I was invited to dinner, I would eat what was put in front of me - always have, always will - 'tis poor manners not to. Nevertheless, over that time, I would not have eaten meat of any sort more than maybe once a week, and most of my meals were vegetarian. During that entire 3 year period, I maintained a very active sporting lifestlye - training between 6 and 20 hours a week for several sports including athletics, cross country, orienteering, karate, cycling, rock climbing, including representing both Scotland and Britain at junior, university and senior level during that time. All on a 98% vegetarian diet. Sure, I took vitamin supplements, and also iron supplements, but apart from that, I got a good diet. Being a vegetarian requires that you be a bit thoughtful about what you eat, but it is not so hard and it is not a &quot;boring&quot; diet. I never ate tofu either! But I did eat cheese, milk and eggs. <br />
<br />
People seem to have this perception of vegetarians as eating tofu, veggie-burgers, lettuce &amp; brown rice (when I was a vegetarian I ate almost none of the above). I still only eat meat about every 2 or even 3 days, but that is because I don't really feel the need to eat meat every meal, and I believe that I have a more interesting and balanced diet for it. I have no moral, religous or ethical reasons for not eating meat, and I certainly dont dislike the taste - I love a good rare steak, have no problems with eating cute lambs, rabbits, etc. But hell, grilling a slab of meat and throwing some chips beside it, with a bottle of ketchup, is not my idea of a fine meal.</div></div><hr />

 Good job going to the gym, I was poking at you because I believe not being active is far, far more dangerous to your health then your diet. Stay active, eat like a sewer rat, and you will still be in better shape then a scritct diet do nothing type.<br />
<br />
  And no matter what anyone says, PETA and others that preach stupidity, I really don't like. If it wasn't for eating animals, humans would not be here, debate that as you will, science has pretty much proved this. Hunting gave us the nutrients eneded for big brains and helped develop language, and force social behavior.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hindus are weird. They don't stear clear of meat because they don't like it, they don't eat it because they fear retribution in the afterlife, I quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;All of our actions including our choice of food have karmic consequences. By involving oneself in the cycle of inflicting injury, pain and death, even indirectly by eating other creatures, one must in the future experience in equal measure the suffering caused.&quot; <br />

So, Johnny hindu down the street thinks if he eats that hamburger, in the afterlife, a cow is gonna eat him.<br />

And remember, another thing to hate me for, I think religion, period, is idiotic.

<br />
... smip<br />
<br />
I think that dietary habits, like almost all things, are best when they are a balance between the two extremes.<br />
<br />
I've taken more human nutrition classes than your average MD is required.  I've been vegitarian for over half of my life (going on 19 years and I'm age 36 now).  It is perfectly fine to be on a vegan lifestyle and meet all of your nutritional demands, I was vegan for 4 years but it limits my choices too much, most restaurant choices are not listed as being dairy free or whatever and it's very hard to find accurate information.<br />
<br />
To be on a vegan diet and live well, there's more to life than just &quot;veggies&quot;, there's grains and root vegitables and fruits and legumes and the the list goes on and on.<br />
<br />
Of our ignorant friend's list of stereotypes, I match 3.  I wear the occassional piece of leather because the overall harm done to the environment is less by wearing a leather jacket that has lasted me 6 years now as compared to plastic coats that would of have to be replaced by now.<br />
<br />
Yes, I fully expect someone to prepare me something special if I'm invited for food.  I explain ahead of time my requirements and offer to come over and assist in preparation or bring my own dish to share.  Furthermore, my girlfriend has non-tropical sprue, better known and Celiac's Disease (www.celiac.org) and is unable to eat many things that people take for granted.  The short list of foods she is unable to eat consists of wheat, rye, barley, oats, dairy, corn starch, mushrooms and bananas.  Some of those foods will &quot;merely&quot; make her sick for 4-5 days, at home with a continous stomach ache and intestinal distress.  Other of those foods will give her a very life-threatening allergic reaction.  While I am fortunate enough not to have as severe a problem as my girlfriend, if I eat something that has chicken or beef broth (for example) I am usually sick for a day or two.  Even eggs has this effect on me.<br />
<br />
Now, given that my health can be impacted so much by eating something my body isn't currently able to handle, why should any rational person try to feed me something I cannot eat?  If you are an open-minded and educated person, something which Mill has demonstrated very clearly does not apply to him, you would be aware that drastic changes in someone's diet can have severe reactions.  I'm sorry, but I go out to eat with friends, friends that care about both myself and my health.  Friends that are wise enough to realize that the small bit of effort they put into accommodating my needs shows how much they care for me.  Fortunatly, I don't have any friends like the ignorant Mill.<br />
<br />
As far as hating our government, well, let's just say I probably love it more than you.  I can demonstrate this fact by I know our bill of rights, by heart.  I know what cases are in the legal system &amp;/or going to the Supreme Court and how those cases can change / restrict my rights as set forth by the constitution.  I love my country so much that I actively fight to preserve those rights including the right to disagree with our government and being able to express those views.  I also love our government enough to tolerate people like Mill, people who don't understand rules apply to everyone, even the people that disagree.<br />
<br />
Iraq.  I could really write a lot on the situation with Iraq, but I'll keep it (fairly) short.  Saddam modeled himself after Stalin, a very not nice man.  The Russians are very much aware of how brutal a man he is, they lived under Stalin, yet they were opposed to the war.  Because they wanted to see people suffer?  No, because they felt there was a way of working to remove him without subjecting the population to a war.  The same goes for Germany and even those frog-eating Frenchies.  They know what it's like to have an army march through and fight in their homes.  They weren't opposed to the war because they wanted to see the Iraq population suffer, they were opposed because they thought continued pressure could bring about a change.   Sure, it might not have taken 3 weeks, but how many people are currently hearing the propaganda of Al-Jazeera and Saddam and are just as willing to believe it as our dear Mill is willing to believe the garbage spilled forth from CNN?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I've read that its hard to get certain B complex vitamins on a veggie / vegan diet, as well as the obvious challenge to get enough protein to be 'built'.  Most veggies/vegans I've met have been very skinny.  I personally love to eat too much to adhere to any strict diet; and as such I need a large muscle mass to burn off dunkin donuts, beer, taco bell, and pizza (the 4 major food groups as far as I'm concerned).  I don't think I could maintain the muscle without meat.<br />
<br />
You've really gotta be tolerant in today's world; you don't necessarily have to like beliefs, cultures, etc, that vary from yours, but at least accept that that vegan, or that gay guy, or that buddhist monk, has as much a right to do whatever the hell s/he wants as you do.  The most ironic, hypocritical people I come across are those who are in any way non-mainstream, but who condone other non-mainstream activities (i.e. homosexual anti-drug advocates).

Ever hear the hidden track on Tool's Undertow album?  It covers this discussion well (&quot;tomorrow is harvest day, but for them [carrots] it is the halocaust&quot;).

Ok.  Because the person values animal life more than you do, you say that they should, by extension of their greater value of life, not eat vegetables.  But, do you value human life?  OMG!!

 Weirdness to me is anything that is really deviant behavior. People going out of their way to  make a political stand, but then making exceptions(wearing a leather jacket). People believeing in &quot;faith&quot; when we know the real deal.<br />
<br />
 Read Stephen Hawkins books, really read them, visualize, and think about it. Those guys, Einstein, Stephen, etc, are not just smart, they have something screwed up in their brains I think making them godamn super genius.<br />
  Presented with logical, mathmatical arguments about the universe, or the other view a super being just said &quot;let there be light&quot;, I take the scientific, we SEE stars being born and stars die, they do not just blink in to existance you bunch of silly god fearing schlups.<br />
<br />
 As far as education, if that is the best insult you can throw you need some yourself, I have an extremely high IQ, and am very intelligent, I think that is one of the reasons I didn't get brainwashed in to religion or cults like anti-war protestors. I can think for myself.<br />
 If you like being weird, saving animals, fine, then you should grow your own fruits and veggies, probably hydroponically so you do not have to harvest anything from the earth, save them rodents!, should live in a log cabin made from deadfall wood, not use electricity, internal combustion engines, or anything synthetic, then, I would respect you, not some half ass save the world but burn it down at the same time mentality. Probably just do it so you have something in common with vegan women.<br />

That is weak, weird, and deviant.<br />

Besides, you god lovers, if God didn't want us to kill, why the hell did he let us invent the spear, machine gun, atomic bomb, why did he let Hitler,  Stalin, Susan Sarandon live? Oh, he is testing us? Nice friggin god.<br />

I do not need to give &quot;lip service&quot; to anyone about my lifestyle.  See its not a fad or a diet, it is simply my way of life.

Thus for the first 25 years of my life I lived in very uncomfortable and embarassing discomfort.  I get a wonderfully varried and nutrious diet with more protien and less fat than half the people posting in this thread I would wager.  <br />

 If you have a medical condition, that is one thing too, obviously you need different food. But doing it to save the planet is silly, because not one of the ones I have known really do that, they eliminate a couple things and proclaim themselves saviors of the planet. They have no problems using oil and synthetic products, but balk at killing an animal.<br />
<br />
I do not like double standards, in anything.<br />
<br />
My belief is with science, things I can see, touch, things people can prove, or at least show a plausable theory. That includes a disbelief in any gods, any fancy ideals that make no sense.<br />
<br />
 Survival of the fittest has been the rule for eons, for the entire cycle of life on earth, which, by the way, we are a tiny, tiny part of. If an animal isn't fit to fend off humans, then too friggin bad. You didn't see our mammal ancestors trying to save the fuggin dinosaurs did you? Why should I give a crap about the whooping crane or sea turtle? How the %%*&amp;^ do they help me? Can I eat them?<br />
<br />
Medical condition, fine.<br />
Belief, fine, but you better really stick to it, no stupid half measures. No car, no power, no plastics or chemicals at all, all of those kill animals, directly or indirectly. That would be doing something. Just not eating meat and proclaiming one's self savior of the planet is stupid.<br />
<br />
Rain forest? Who gives a crap. Rain forests account for a small % of the earths plant produced oxygen, contrary to what people woul;d have you think, algae in the ocean are the real power houses there. I don't care about 1000 species of frogs, rats, insects there, if they ain't fit, eat em or burn em down. Everytime I see a rain forest burn, I think Yummy, more South American beef!<br />
<br />
Earth has been here for a long time, nothing at all Man can do is going to have the slightest goddamn impact on the planet. Modern man has been around what, 50,000 - 100,000 years? Idustrial age what, couple hundred? 60 years for atomic age? Think the earth gives two craps about this? All the nuclear warheads on earth detonated at once would be nothing compared to impacts from space bodies that occur over time quite frequently. Crunchies gonna protest asteroids now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Show me proof of god, and I would believe. Show me proof vegetarians are more healthy, I might believe, but all the super old people you read about, contribute their health to eating rich foods, red meat, drinking booze.<br />
<br />
Am I intolerant? yes, of things I think are silly. If somone proves me wrong, fine. I have nothing against a vegetarian as long as they don't bitch at me for gleefully pounding chicken wings or worshipping the almighty hamburger. I don't bitch at them unless they try to hamper my meat eating. Which they always seem to do. Perhaps it is just Vermont, the crunchiest state in the nation, I dunno.<br />
<br />
I will gladly respect your choices, as long as you respect mine. That was my whole problem, veggies always seem to bitch and cry at me because of my voracious meat appetite. They protest, generally act like liberal asses. Once I meet a nice, pleasant, sensible vegetarian I can talk with, who knows, perhaps I will change my tune.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Ok, schpleef has demonstarted that he does not have basic reading comprehension...either that or about a 5 minute memory.  No further replies will be directed at you, schpleef, it's a waste of bandwidth.<br />
<br />
Mill...I too have read Hawking...and he doesn't profess to know how the processes that made the universe what it is today actually started.  In other words, he knows how the engine runs (somewhat), but he doesn't know what turned the key, what the key was, or how it was turned.  Do you?  Or have you forgotten to contemplate this small part of the whole &quot;origin of the universe&quot; thing?<br />
<br />
And as for bringing in the survival of the fittest argument against vegetarianism:  Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should.  I could attack my roommate, kill him (despite the power bestowed upon him by his eatting of steaks), and have a good bit of meat to eat, as well as more space and less walking in on a masturbating freshman....does that make it right?  No.  Might does not make right, it just means you can force others to do what you want them to do, regardless of the justice of the situation.  Might and good can coexist, but so can might and evil.<br />
<br />
And don't try to muddle the vegetarian issue by dragging environmentalism into it too.  Start another inflammatory, stereotype-laden thread to discuss that so we can have a clear discussion here.   :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol you just couldn't be an average joe, could you?  You have some unfathomable need to stick out like a sore thumb and your platform is vegetarianism - to go against our evolution as omnivores, and to insult anyone who doesn't agree with your wigged out diet which wouldn't even be healthy without modern advances in food nutrition to tell you whether you're getting enough protien &amp; vitamins.  Even so, you probably take a multi and a b-complex every day, am I right?  That's because the diet you're eating is unnatural for our species and doesn't address many of our nutritional needs.<br />
<br />
Most telling is how you associate meat eating with other things you don't like, for example linking your masturbating roomate with eating meat.  This issue goes much deeper than saving animals or being healthy for you, and is something you probably should speak to someone about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Gwain is doing good. Hell I would be insulting myself if I wasn't me. I come across as an ass often. That's okay.<br />
<br />
I agree because you can do something, doesn't mean you should, I really do.<br />
<br />
That being said, I think vegetarianism is one of those things. Simply put, meat is much more nutritous than veggies. 1 pound of beef or one pound of greens, you gonna get more stuff with the beef. Not to mention it tastes damn good, and we evolved because of our ability to eat meat.<br />
<br />
And, I started this thread, because a vegan friend of mine had me about ready to slap him at work he was being so damn stereotypical vegan.<br />
<br />
I thinka  balanced diet is the way to go, for me, more meat and less veggies, but I tried the Atkins diet, and while it does make you lose weight, you poop soup totally, and it isn't realistic I do not think. And unless you are a master chef with unlimited money and time, getting a truly balanced diet with veggies alone is going to be very difficult, not to mention time consuming, pain in the ass for you and everyone around you.<br />
<br />
Gwain, Hawking does know that there was indeed a key, thats good enough for me, we will find it. Consider the last 100 years and the knowledge we have unlocked, consider the human genome project, computers, space program, I mean goodness. God supposedly got pissed some monkeys tried to build a real tall building to reach the heavens(smart move turd brains), well, wouldn't he be rolling over on his cloud seeing us land on the moon? Isn't that his base or something?<br />
<br />
Humans are incredible, and barring a truly horrific impact from space, and even maybe not then, we will survive longer then any other species in history, and we will drastically change the world around us, but that is okay, that is Darwinism at it's most basic. Humans adapt, invent, and use other creatures for their benefit, like any predator does, just on a larger scale.<br />
<br />
gwain, sorry for the enviornment thing, but holy crap that pisses me off as much as anything. I want oil, meat, big V-8 engines, if a friend ever bought one of them hybrids, I would smack him daily.(enormous amounts of hydrogen gonna be needed, guess where that comes from? Electricity!!! Where does electricity come from? Fossil fuels and nuclear mostly, wow, good for the enviornment that)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">After spending a few minutes searching the web, I came up with the percentage of adult vegetarians in the US: 1-2% (estimated) with something higher than that of people that claim a vegetarian lifestyle because they only eat meat occasionally.  Vegans make up about one fourth of the vegetarian population (or about 0.25 - 0.5% of the overall population).  These figures are from the Vegetarian Resource Group - I don't know if they are credible or not.  Anyone else have a source?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">VRG is a very excellent source for any questions you might have and they present things in a factual way and even acknowledge many points against vegetarians.  For example, Mill's point about we are omnivores, from a purely biological point of view this is correct.  However we are also capable of free thought and have found out that a balanced diet can be made from only veggies.  What reason for the choice is left to the individual, but it is quite safe to do.<br />
<br />
I notice Mill has not addressed any of my counterpoints.  Every time I shoot one of his arguements down, he brings up some other spurious point.  He doesn't attack vegetarians except some guy he knows pissed him off so he comes here &amp; randomly attacks.  Gosh, I stubbed my toe, I should post a thread listing all the stereotypes of rednecks and why I hate them because they can stub their toes also.  Or maybe one was in the room when I stubbed my toe.<br />
<br />
Come on, Mill.  If you're so smart, address my counter points.  You brought up yet another point out of the blue.  Meat is more nutritionally dense than vegetables.  This is true.  Meat also requires far more space and water to produce the one pound of edible meat.  Care to debate that point?  I can provide you links, many if most from VRG, to back up my claims.  <br />

 Iraq. I could really write a lot on the situation with Iraq, but I'll keep it (fairly) short. Saddam modeled himself after Stalin, a very not nice man. The Russians are very much aware of how brutal a man he is, they lived under Stalin, yet they were opposed to the war. Because they wanted to see people suffer? No, because they felt there was a way of working to remove him without subjecting the population to a war. The same goes for Germany and even those frog-eating Frenchies. They know what it's like to have an army march through and fight in their homes. They weren't opposed to the war because they wanted to see the Iraq population suffer, they were opposed because they thought continued pressure could bring about a change. Sure, it might not have taken 3 weeks, but how many people are currently hearing the propaganda of Al-Jazeera and Saddam and are just as willing to believe it as our dear Mill is willing to believe the garbage spilled forth from CNN?<br />

<br />
BWAHAHAHHAHAHA<br />
<br />
How about france, germany and russia didn't want to go to war because: a) We went to war in Afghanistan and made up stuff for them to do and they felt impotent, b) We don't need or want them in this war, c) they have sold items (or in the case of france their P5 vote) to Iraq in violation of those MULTIPLE un resolutions. <br />

<br />
 yes, you can have a balanced vegan diet, but it takes a hell of alot of work and time to get the missing stuff. Why do it?<br />
<br />
 How many vegans truly practice what they preach? They are largely hipocrits. Many things they sue everyday harms animals, takes away their habitat, etc. But they only think meat eating is bad, and it is okay to have animals die by accident.<br />
<br />
List your points, I will gladly address them, and shoot them down with logic one by one, I am a friggin vulcan when it comes to logic, most people just try to be PC and act like asses.<br />

1. Medical condition vegan, fine.<br />
<br />
  I already said that dumbyhead.<br />
<br />
2. Your friends should accomodate you.<br />
<br />
  Of course, duh. It is however, a pain in the ass for them, do you bring them meat do eat?<br />
<br />
3. Both you and your girlfriend cannot eat meat. Hmm, odds of that are what, 1 million to 1? Good choice there. I am happy that both of you have medical conditions that cause you not only to not be able to eat meat, but have a moral aversion to harming animals. Is a very good pairing, and  big time in the minority.<br />
<br />
4. I am no more intolerant then people I pick on, in fact, I am probably less so, I do not protest, or actively try to harm other people's interests. Crunchies often do. Somone goes and frees a chicken I was gonna eat, I should be able to bash them upside the head.<br />
<br />
5. You logic is silly, you accuse me of being an ass, when you come across as twice the ass. You only reinforce my theories by your stupid ass not-want-to-wear-leather but you are wearing it &quot;for now&quot;. Hypocrit much? IN fact, I am not sure I even believe your story about medical conditions, one of you maybe, but two? Meet in a support group for meat intolerant people or something?

Ditch all your leather, anything produced at the expense of animals, including oil(habitat has been reduced from pipelines, drilling, etc), electricity(same, plus global pollution from fossil fuel plants, nuclear waste, and ruined waterways), and then perhaps I can respect your half hearted decisions.<br />
<br />
Oh, but that wouldn't be convenient, would it. Some Morals. At least I know I am an animal eater/killer, always will be, and just don't give a damn. My morals dictate, if they can kill me and eat me, it is fair, and vice-versa. That is what makes us human, we use things.<br />
<br />
CNN sucks, watch Fox news, Oreilly should be president. But once again, you show your crunchy vegan ways, you think mainstream media is bad, let me guess, you get all your news from the Onion and the BBC?<br />
<br />
<br />
Question, how many animals that are carnivores/omnivores do you see in the wild that shun meat out of principle? Hmmm, none maybe? Well, if they aren't intelligent enough to embrace a benevolent society to save their brother animals, how smart are they? Because animals have a type of smarts humans throw away sometimes, it is called common friggin sense. A bear aint gonna flip his nose at a salmon, because he is smart enough to know it is damn good for him and he was designed for it. Vegans have lost this. The bad side of humanity showing up, choosing to be different because of odd principles.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Are principles against common sense?  Because I've never seen animals do anything based on principle.  No wiping out unjust dictators, no giving to charities, etc.  Conversely, I've never seen an animal fly a plane into a tower in a heavily populated area or try to take over the world or some such (except on Pinky and the Brain).  We're steering onto a debate of the animal mind though, and I doubt most of us have any experimental data to back up our claims.   :p  My point is, animals do not have the capacity to make choices that people do.<br />
<br />
Meat has more calories and **** in it because of all the vegetables that went through the creature's system before it was slaughtered.  It's more efficient to cut out the middle man and go straight to the veggies.  You may have to eat slightly more, but hell....most americans are overlarded anyways, they already eat more than they should be eatting.<br />
<br />
Also, as to the Hawking thing:  What if all this universe crap was set into motion by some large invisible guy with a beard who sits on a cloud when the whim struck him and he snapped his fingers?   :p   Sure, it's not very likely....but a thing don't gotta be likely to be.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">The Veg'n board that I frequent has stated rather amusingly that &quot;The only real Vegan, is a dead Vegan.&quot;    :D   This means that we adhere to our beliefs as closely as possible with the ideal of Veg'nism.  That is all anyone can do be it regarding religion, health or morals.  The point is that the only veg'n that has perfected the ideal of &quot;harm none&quot; is dead.  Our world today does not allow us to live and harm none, but we can all do our best to reduce the harm we do.<br />
<br />
I am now reading a very interesting book, Diet for a Small Planet  by Frances Moore Lappe.  I highly recommend it if only to expand your knowledge.<br />
<br />
Now something I just dont understand is the fact that it has been said that its OK to be veg'n for Medical reasons.  Why is that? Are not moral, cultural and religious beliefs just as viable reasons.  I too dislike hypocrites but do not understand how you can blast a whole group of people for the few you know from said group that are hypocrites.<br />
<br />
If people are true to their beliefs as closely as possible why should it be anyone else's business? As long as they are not hurting anyone what is the matter with it?  I know this is a naive and idealistic view but when I get right down to the heart of the matter this is really all that matters.<br />
<br />
Being Veg'n is a lifestyle.  Not a temporary diet, not a super restricted fad.  Simply a completely different lifestyle than your average American.  Why do I continue?  Simply because it makes me feel like I am contributing in a good way to my world.  <br />
<br />
This was not something hard to change, it was just something I had to do to remain true to my beliefs.  Yes the change in diet showed me serious health benefits but it was the spiritual ones that keep me vegan.  I learned to eat new foods and expanded my cooking skills greatly.  I learned to read labels and what things like whey, caseien and gelatin are.  When I ran out of household supplies I changed the brand I bought to one that was &quot;Cruelty Free&quot; meaning no animal (by)products or animal testing.  When I found an ecologically friendly feminine product I switched to it.  When I buy new shoes, coat, clothes I look first in the consignment and secondhand shops for &quot;recycled&quot; goods and if I can not find what I am needing I buy manmade products. <br />
<br />
I do not force my lifestyle onto anyone else.  Should someone wish to discuss it I gladly will.  Should someone attack me for it I reserve the right to defend myself. <br />
<br />
Perhaps Mill, the later is your issue.  Your veg'n 'friends' feel attacked by your attitude about their lifestyle and thus feel the need to attack you back.   Maybe if you tell them that you will respect their right to their own lifestyle if they will respect yours you will not have them harping on you?<br />
<br />

It does not take a hell a lot of work.  Just don't cook meat and use something different.  Hell, by simple logic (for simple minds...) preparing a meal without meat is easier since that's one less thing to cook.  Let me give you a hint, it's not that hard to cook.  Put meat in pot, cover with water, simmer.  Boiled meat!  Put veggies in pot, cover with water, simmer, boiled veggies!  Astounding!

No, mister psychic, she can eat meat just fine, as long as it doesn't contain any of her food allergies.  The short answer is people who have been vegetarian for long enough no longer produce the enzymes within their digestive tract to properly and efficiently digest it.  If I eat meat I get sick because I can no longer digest it efficiently.  If I wanted to go back to eating meat I would have to ease myself back into it so my digestive tract would make the enzymes again.  <br />

You're right, you're omnivore. Meaning you can eat either of them.<br />

You were built to be able to eat either plant or animal as a source of food.  Just because you are on the Atkins diet does not change your classification (in the scientific sense) to carnivore.  Besides, if you look at it, it's not fully carnivorous, it's low carbohydrate.  Get away with the starchy stuff like potato, bread, etc.<br />

My point is simply that, as omnivores, humans certainly CAN eat meat.  People on the Atkins diet can't eat veggies just as much as vegetarians/vegans can't eat meat.

The bottom line is, crunchies do stupid crap, to get attention and to be different, fine, but when people look at you like the weirdo you are, don't get all defensive, after all, you got the attention you wanted.<br />
<br />
My vegan friend is funny by the way, he is my friend, and we have some funny arguments, but what I say still stands, he is a social weirdo.<br />
<br />
Good point about a vegan making meat for somone coming over, 100 bucks says they would never, ever do it. Handle and cook animal flesh for a heretic? Doubt it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Double standards, they want respect, yet totally disrespect meat eaters.<br />
<br />
<br />
And don't give me this crap boiling some veggies makes all the nutrients you need, even I know from reading you need to be very creative in the right types of fruits/veggies/beans/etc, and vitamin supplements.<br />
<br />
 Point me to a link showing any type of vegan that is large and well built. I am really curious if it is possible without massive supplemental nutrients.<br />
<br />
I could snap any vegetarians arm I have met in half. ONly been around ten or 15 maybe, but I kid you not, the average male might have weighed 150 pounds. Is this a choice of theirs or a side effect of diet?<br />

 Your &quot;lifestyle&quot; choice seems really idiotic. I understand your need to be different though, I am sure it makes you feel more accepted in a certain click of society's fringe groups. Why can't a vegetarian just come out and say &quot;I wanna be different, and since almost all people eat meat, I am going to stop it. heh, look at me, I'm &quot;special&quot;, bust your ass to accomodate my weirdness!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Learn how to insult too, jesus, reading your &quot;attacks&quot; make me feel warm and fuzzy because it is like being dissed by one of Jerry's kids. Be creative, pick on my brutishness more, bonus points for assuming my intellect or education is low, even more if you try and say I am ugly or fat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">No need, you keep insulting yourself.  When are you going to answer one of my questions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Taladaen, the point AvalanchW (sp.?) was trying to make was that vegetarians &quot;can't&quot; eat meat, and therefore others should bend over backwards to provide them with something they can eat, if they're invited somewhere.  My point is simply that, as omnivores, humans certainly CAN eat meat.  People on the Atkins diet can't eat veggies just as much as vegetarians/vegans can't eat meat.  Now I know you want to feel special, and that you've even gone so far as to become a vegetarian or vegan to feel that way - but cut out the double standards please.<br />
<br />
&quot;Can't&quot;?  What, you want me to pull a Clinton and ask what the definition of &quot;can't&quot; is?  I certainly can eat meat, I put it in my mouth, my muscles move my jaws up and down, I swallow, I ate it!  For choices apparently only known to Mill, I won't.  For a slightly looser definition of &quot;can't&quot;, I currrently cannot eat meat.  It has been so long since I've had it that my body no longer produces the enzymes to digest it properly.  Basically, I get an upset tummy for a day or two after eating something with meat in it.  There is no double standard, you're taking the definition of vegetarian in too strict a meaning, a point which I have already pointed out.<br />
<br />
Also, the Atkins diet is not entirely meat, again as I have pointed out.  Do you even read before replying?<br />
<br />
I want to feel special, wow, you're just as psychic as our friend Mill here.  Let me give you a hint, I've been at these message boards for quite some time, I've never discussed the issue of vegetarianism or anything related until now.</div></div><hr />

Would you mind backing up your absurd claim that your stomach doesn't produce the enzymes to digest meat?  Just a link to a reliable source of information that confirms this.  I'm not a doctor, but hell we still have a god damn tailbone after millions of years of not needing a tail, and you're trying to tell me you can't digest meat because you haven't eaten it in awhile?   You're full of ****.  I'd bet good money your upset stomach that you claim you get from eating meat (if you're a vegetarian, why would you be eating meat?) is psychosomatic.</div></div><hr />

A man found a long stretch of beach upon which hundreds of starfish had been stranded by a great storm.

You'll never save them all.&quot;  The boy smiled.  &quot;It matters to the ones I save.&quot;<br />

Um Faern, I am confused here as it appears your clue is either in code or just simply nonexistant. You stand out now for being Lactose Intollerant, was that your clue that your now looking for something to make you stand out?<br />
<br />
You said you felt like you had been stabbed due to an intollerance to lactose.  Well I am sorry to hear of your pain, but some people feel that pain not only for lactose but for things like meat and meat by products.  <br />
<br />
I am sure Mil will say that its allright because its &quot;medical&quot; but it doesnt make any sense to me.  Why is it ok to have a physical medical reason but not a moral, emotional or psycological reason to be Veg'n?<br />

And what makes you think there's a difference between drinking milk when you're lactose intolerant and eating meat when you've been vegetarian for so many years?

you own a leather jacket, do you not? Any leather shoes, belts, etc?<br />

You drive a car? You know how many animals are killed/displaced because of oil pipelines, wells, spills, etc?<br />

Do you consume power? You know that alot of our power comes from the burning of fossil fuels, and that the waste is harmful to animals? Strip mining isn't pretty either.<br />

Faulty logic, Mill.  The primary cause of death is life, in every example when something dies it was alive just before it died.<br />
<br />
I never said I try to prevent the death of every single living being, you assumed it.  You are making an assumption on what you think I feel.<br />
<br />
To sum it up very briefly, I try to cause a minimum amount of pain, suffering and overall damage to the world around me.  Key word there is minimum.  I gave you earlier a hint towards it but you just ignored it.  When I use a leather jacket that is going to last years and years, the overall damage is less than buying a synthetic jacket repeatedly over the same time.  I'm not even opposed to eating animal, per se, in fact I rather enjoy sushi from time to time (read my posts and you'll notice I said I was vegan for a number of years, past tense).  Some damage is done no matter what you do but there's no reason to go and aggravate the damage.  Like Cali had posted above, I may not save all the starfish, but the ones I do save appreciate it.<br />
<br />
I've spent summers on farms, I've taken lambs off to slaughter, I've helped raise cows for both beef and dairy.  I also know that the condition that many animals are raised in for food is not to my liking, and therefore I choose not to participate.<br />
<br />
Does it make a difference in the world, somewhere is there some cow let free to run about in a field because I wouldn't eat it?  No, not really.  But when I'm old and dead people will say that I cared and I at least tried to do something I believe in, and that's good enough for me.</div></div><hr />

 please then just say &quot;I don't like meat&quot; and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
You are mistaken if you think eating animals causes more deaths than our everyday behavior. I seriously doubt, even as much meat as I eat, I am responsible for eating more then one cow/one pig a year, if that, maybe 20 chickens?<br />
<br />
But seriously think of the millions of animals killed indirectly by non-food related causes.<br />
<br />
I love animals, I really do. I love pets, I live and work on a horse farm in addition to my geek job. I think whales are great, and so are apes. I do not like to see a species go bye bye, but I also realize that is the natural order of things.<br />
<br />
We raise animals to eat. That isn't any different that hunting them in my eyes, either way they die by our hand, and yes conditions may not be good for captive animals, but thats the law of the jungle. They exist by our will alone anyway.<br />
<br />
If an animal species becomes really dominant over another, they don't have debates about it, they kick their ass and thats the end of it, humans are animals, if we deem it fit to use/kill animals, than that is survival of the fittest in it's most perfect form.<br />

If they demand respect for their deviant ways, than my mainstream ones should have respect as well, no?<br />

Why does animal life hold so much clout anyway? Why aren't plants given the same rights? At what point of complexity does a life form become important?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">This article give several good points of information and was found on a Veg'n site I visit frequently.  I know its lost quite a bit of formatting in the copying over, sorry.<br />

Compassionate Living:<br />
Human Choices, Humane Results<br />
This article is by the Animal Protection Institute and can be found here (http://216.190.132.195/doc.asp?ID=159).<br />
<br />
&quot;Animal rights&quot; is a concept based on the belief that humans have a moral responsibility to treat animals with respect, and that the interests of humans and animals should be considered equally. This means that in any decision that could potentially affect the life of an animal, that particular animal's interests should not be dismissed simply because it is inconvenient for us to consider them.<br />
<br />
Although it may not always be easy to determine accurately the best interests of an animal, we can safely assume that animals generally prefer to live, to be free from pain, and to express their natural behaviors. The failure of humans to consider an animal's needs/interests as equal to those of humans is an expression of prejudice called speciesism.<br />
<br />
Defenders of speciesism often argue that humans are superior to other species because of their greater intelligence. Taken to its logical extreme, this argument would imply that humans with higher I.Q. scores should have more rights than humans with lower I.Q. scores. However, in western society, we have developed the sensitivity to extend basic human rights to all humans, whether or not they meet any criteria for intelligence, capacity, or potential. But animals are commonly experimented on without their consent, and even killed, for food or for many other reasons, if it suits human purposes. This gross inequality is what we are trying to address with the concept of &quot;animal rights.&quot;<br />
<br />
Another common assertion is that humans are superior to animals because we possess the capacity to understand morality, as well as the ability to determine right from wrong. Since animals appear to lack these same abilities, it is argued that humans are not obligated to treat them in any particular way. However, if only those who are capable of making and understanding moral judgments were to be accorded basic human rights, then infants, young children, and the severely ill or mentally challenged would be excluded. It is equally logical to affirm that, since humans are the only ones who can make moral judgments, that it is our responsibility to do so on behalf of the animals.<br />
<br />
All animals, including humans, have the ability to experience pleasure and pain. Unfortunately, humans have tended to inflict tremendous amounts of pain and suffering on animals without any consideration of how this affects the animals themselves. By making compassionate daily choices, you can help end widespread animal abuse and exploitation.<br />
<br />
What You Choose to Eat<br />
<br />
Every year billions of animals are raised and killed for human consumption. Unlike the family farms of the past, today's factory farms are high-revenue, high-production entities. On a factory farm, animals are confined to extremely small spaces, which allows farmers to concentrate on maximizing production. Because this type of overcrowding breeds disease, animals are routinely fed antibiotics and sprayed with pesticides. They are also fed growth hormones to enhance productivity. These chemicals, antibiotics, and hormones are subsequently passed on to the environment, as well as to consumers of meat and dairy products.<br />
<br />
Beef <br />
<br />
About 41.8 million beef cattle are slaughtered annually in the United States. <br />
For identification purposes, cattle are either branded with hot irons or &quot;wattled,&quot; a process in which a chunk of flesh from under the cow's neck is cut out. <br />
Raised on the range or in feed lots, cattle when large enough are crammed into metal trucks and taken to slaughter. On the way to slaughter, these cattle may travel for hours in sweltering temperatures with no access to water. <br />
Animals unable to stand due to broken legs or illness are called &quot;downers&quot; by the meat industry. Downers are electrically prodded or dragged with chains to the slaughterhouse, or left outside, without food or water, to die. <br />
Pork <br />
<br />
In the United States each year more than 115 million pigs are raised on factory farms and slaughtered for human consumption. <br />
Factory-farmed pigs are raised in crowded pens which are enclosed inside huge barns. The air in these barns is filled with eye- and lung-burning ammonia created by urine and fecal waste collected below the floors. <br />
Breeding sows (or &quot;animal production units&quot;) spend their lives in metal crates so small that they cannot turn around. Denied adequate space and freedom of movement, these sows often develop stereotypical behavior, repetitive movement such as head bobbing, jaw smacking, and rail biting. <br />
At the slaughterhouse, pigs are stunned (often inadequately), hung upside down before their throats are cut, and then bled to death. If workers fail to kill a pig with the knife, that pig is carried on the conveyer belt to the next station, the scalding tank, where he or she may be boiled alive. <br />
Chicken <br />
<br />
Every year approximately 8.785 billion chickens are raised and slaughtered for human consumption in the United States. <br />
Crowded and unable to express natural behavior, chickens begin to peck excessively at each other. Rather than solve this problem by providing adequate space for the chickens, farmers &quot;debeak&quot; them, a painful procedure where the bird's sensitive upper beak is sliced off with a hot metal blade. <br />
Chickens raised for consumption have been genetically altered to grow abnormally large. As a result, many broiler chickens' bones are unable to support the weight of their muscle tissue, which causes them to hobble in pain or become crippled. <br />
At the slaughterhouse, chickens while still fully conscious are hung upside down by their feet and attached to a moving rail. Birds missed by the mechanical neck-slicing blade and boiled alive are called &quot;redskins&quot; by the industry. <br />
Eggs <br />
<br />
There are more than 459 million egg-laying hens in the United States. Of these, 97% are confined to &quot;battery&quot; cages -- tiny wire boxes roughly 16 by 18 inches wide. Five or six birds are crammed into each cage. <br />
Battery hens are forced to produce 10 times more eggs than they would naturally. When egg production slows, farmers use a method called &quot;forced molting&quot; to shock the hens into losing their feathers, which causes them to begin a premature laying cycle. &quot;Forced molting&quot; involves starving the hens and denying them water for several days' time, during which many hens die. <br />
To keep hens from pecking each other in their crowded cages, farmers &quot;debeak&quot; them. <br />
Male chicks, considered by-products of laying hen production, are either tossed into plastic bags to suffocate slowly, or ground into animal feed while still alive. <br />
Milk <br />
<br />
About half of the 10 million milking cows in the U.S. are kept in confinement. <br />
Dairy cows are forced to produce 10-20 times the amount of milk they would naturally need for their calves. This intensive production of milk is extremely stressful, and as a result many dairy cattle &quot;burn out&quot; at a much younger age than their normal life expectancy, and up to 33% suffer painful udder infections. <br />
To continue milk production, a cow must bear a calf each year. Although calves elsewhere stay with their mothers for a year or more, on the dairy farm they are immediately removed from their mothers so that the milk can be sold for human consumption. <br />
Calves are sold to the beef or veal industry or become replacements for &quot;burned out&quot; dairy cows. <br />
What You Choose to Wear<br />
<br />
Leather <br />
<br />
By-products of the beef industry are defined by the parts of the cow that are not consumed by humans. These include hooves, some organs, bones, and skin. <br />
Skin (leather) accounts for about half of the by-product value of the beef industry. Like meat, leather is a product made from animals that experienced the horrors of factory farming, transport, and slaughter. <br />
Besides the initial environmental hazards from raising cattle (deforestation, erosion, water use and pollution, wildlife eradication, etc.), the leather industry uses some of the most dangerous substances to prepare leather, including formaldehyde, coal-tar derivatives, various oils, and some cyanide-based dyes. <br />
Wool <br />
<br />
Sheep raised for wool are subjected to a lifetime of cruel treatment. Lambs' tails are chopped off and males are castrated without anesthetic. <br />
In Australia, where 80% of all wool comes from, ranchers perform an operation called &quot;mulesing&quot; where huge strips of skin are carved off the backs of lambs' legs. This procedure is performed to produce scarred skin that won't harbor fly larvae, so that the rancher can spend less time caring for the sheep. <br />
The shearing of sheep at most wool ranches can be a brutal procedure, as workers are encouraged to shear as quickly as possible. As a result, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year from exposure. <br />
Sheep that are no longer useful for their wool are sent to crowded feedlots and then transported to the slaughterhouse. <br />
Fur <br />
<br />
Each year more than 40 million animals are senselessly tortured and killed to satisfy the dictates of fashion. <br />
Wild-caught fur is obtained by setting traps or snares to capture fur-bearing animals. Once an animal is caught it may remain in the trap or snare for several days starving or slowly strangling. <br />
Farm-raised fur comes from animals kept in tiny, filthy cages, deprived of adequate protection from the elements. As a result, animals develop stereotypical behavior, including pacing, head bobbing, and self-mutilation. <br />
The techniques used to kill animals on fur farms vary. Small animals such as mink are killed by neck snapping or &quot;popping.&quot; Larger animals such as foxes are electrocuted by placing a metal clamp on the snout and forcing a rod into the anus, and then connecting the metal to a power source. Some animals are forced into bags or boxes and gassed with carbon monoxide or carbon dioxide.</div></div><hr />

I see seals and walruses downing fish like they're Oreo cookies at Oprah's house. I see lions, tigers, and all the cats thinning the local herd as if they just read Darwin's 'Origin of the Species.' I especially like the &quot;hold the live zebra down by the throat as the rest of the cats tear ass into it while it's still kicking&quot; technique.<br />

Oh, let's not forget those crocs and alligators who disembowel the local river crossers. Real &quot; humanitarians &quot; there. Or is that &quot; reptile-atereans&quot;?<br />

 Sounds horrible. It is a price I am ready to pay(guilt?) for eating my favorite dishes.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake, if a mother bear, a hungry lion, or even an unruly dog desired to eat me and I didn't have a gun or a stick or something, I would be killed, in a spectacular fashion, and no one would give two craps. It is as it should be.<br />
<br />
And still, vegans are not practicing what they preach, to do so, would be to live in a  cabin built of deadfall wood, use no man made products, no power, nothing, not even till the soil, but live off roots and stuff.<br />
<br />
There is no middle ground, if you are human, you are responsible, in one way or another, for killing animals.<br />
<br />
<br />
I simply accept it and eat yummies. Nothing like some hot chicken wings and a case of beer, playing beer croquet out on the lawn on a nice summer day.<br />
<br />
Besides, humans are not even beggining to develop, we, as a modern species, are incredibly young, and most of us reproduce like crazed mexicans at a porn festival, the world will be totally changed in 100, 200, 300 years, and thousands of animals will be killed off. It is the way of things, and no vegan can even make a dent in the process, no matter how many meat eaters they annoy.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do feel pity, I am not a total monster, but out of sight, out of mind, paying 50 dollars a pound for hamburger would be worse for me then having some suffering cows and 2.99 a pound eats. I need fuel, high protein, muscle building stuff, not skinny making stuff.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">If you are so concerned about cruelty to animals you certainly shouldn't drive a car - animal (and human) deaths on the road occur in the millions every year.  Many of those deaths are truly obscene - like being fed into a grinder (see Cali above) but with the grinder switched off when the animal is mangled but not quite dead.  <br />
<br />
Strangely, even the most rabid animal rights activists still drive a car.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I would love it if slaughterhouses did things humanely, and all animals at least lived with decent conditions. I wasn't aware of some of the atrocities, although I imagined they exist.<br />
<br />
There is cruelty to animal laws for pets, I think their should be for livestock animals as well. I would still want to eat them, but put em down easy for crying out loud.<br />
<br />
grinding up a live animal is wrong, and quite gutless I must admit.<br />
<br />
Whenever I see a dog mauling on the news, believe it or not, I think the owners should be euthenized, an animal does not know right and wrong like we do, remember Bane and Herra? The casoprecario or whatever the hell they were? They are actually a fine animal for a pet, but some jerk off raises them to be mean and somone dies, whose fault is that?<br />
<br />
My 165 pound Great Dane is so gentle we let 5 month old babies play on the lawn with him, even takes toys out of his mouth, and he is 100% loving, because we raised him with love and discipline.<br />
<br />
<br />
What am I saying? I dont know. I love animals, but I realize I need them to survive.<br />
<br />
Think of all the cleared land we, as a society have  done, and then think of all the billions of animals that died as a result, going to a shopping mall is killing animals, anything but grizzly adams style living is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u90"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p90">Thats why I stated early the running Veg'n joke: The only true Vegan is a dead Vegan.<br />
<br />
<br />
For me it is not just about being healthier, its about moral responsibility to take the steps I CAN to lessen the cruelty that does exist.  No one can truly in this day and age live without inflicting some damage.  But I am trying very very hard to reduce the amount I do cause.<br />
<br />
Its all about baby steps and small changes.  Even if all you do is switch laundry detergent from Tide to a cruelty free product or one night have your spagetti with marinara sauce instead of meatballs.  Tiny changes that CAN help.  No one person is going to change the world but if everyone takes even one baby step forward the world WILL change.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I am not trying nor do I care if I convert anyone or even if I change opinions but hopefully people can walk away with a broader knowledge of the situation.  However you want to live your life is fine and I respect your right to do just that.  But I do feel that even my small contribution helps not only my own sence of responsibility, morality and emotions but animals and the enviroment as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 At one point, I would have cared, but the cold reality of the world has taught me things.<br />
<br />
 What I think doesn't really matter. I think all people, regardless of race should be treated equally, they aren't. Minority people get tons more rights and handouts. I can't change that, if I try I am labled a racist.<br />
  I think people who live in this country should speak english, or learn it. We don't need spanish speaking schools here.<br />
  I think fat chicks should not work for &quot;Jazzercize&quot;, just because some court says it is unfair to descriminate against fat people.(lose some weight, I don't get a job for victoria's secret being a 245 pound male!)<br />
  I think &quot;addiction&quot; should not be an excuse for anything, great story other night about it on dateline type show, people getting away with unreal crap, claiming to be addicted to soemthing.<br />
 Methadone clinics should be shutdown, and people who use them should go to jail if they use heroin.<br />
  I think people should shutup when they have an opinion that is just obviously wrong(NAMBLA, KKK, ACLU, Jesse Jackson, Spike Lee). They should be punished.<br />
  I think the IRS should audit big business instead of joe taxpayer.<br />
<br />
 Most of all I think people should use common sense, and value all people around the world the same. If thousands are dying in Uganda, Iraq, wherever, we should step in and beat ass on bullies.<br />
<br />
 But I am just an average guy, nothing I do or say will change anything. Notice the anti-war protesters didn't accomplish anything but cost their city money and rape the taxpayers anymore.<br />
<br />
 I think people just need to use their heads more, and be decent human beings. Not what you think of me I know, but every single rant I do, generally has a serious point. And an honest, good one.<br />
<br />
This post started, remember, because I was fed up with hearing about how evil I was for eating meat. I like it, and I don't recall asking his permission.<br />
<br />
<br />
People hide behind all kinds of evil in their fanatic quest for what they think is right, usually stupid people with no guts. Like France for instance, perfect example of a spineless, gutless bunch of turds. Hypocrits.<br />
<br />
Thanks Cali, I respect your choices, and your ability to not push it on others, really sorry if I offend you, btu not that other guy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">I'm not saying that its not true, but alot of this stuff really strikes me as bull..  Its right up there with the partnership for a thought-free america's propoganda machine.<br />
The failure of humans to consider an animal's needs/interests as equal to those of humans is an expression of prejudice called speciesism<br />
Do wild animals sleep in your bed with you?  They're our equals right?  Why not then?<br />
cattle when large enough are crammed into metal trucks and taken to slaughter<br />
Oh that's so much more cruel than the non-metal trucks...<br />
The shearing of sheep at most wool ranches can be a brutal procedure, as workers are encouraged to shear as quickly as possible. As a result, an estimated one million Australian sheep die every year from exposure<br />
So these ranchers kill millions of their own sheep, despite the enormous financial loss, just for the fun of being cruel?<br />
<br />
Its propoganda, and you bought into it.  Heh I was watching an interview with a woman from Greenpeace.  She was (with some followers) protesting outside a grocery store against genetically engineered crops.  She had all sorts of great information on it, such as &quot;they put fish genes in the corn and who knows what else?&quot;.  She looked like she was drunk, high, or both.<br />
In the EQ world, these are the people who insist that bard and enchanter/shaman haste stack, who insist that fbss is 17%, or sash of dragonborn is 27%, etc... people who just believe whatever they're told and pass this on as bona fide fact.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but you really should be a bit more skeptical Cali.  Again, I'm not saying none of its true, just that a lot of it reeks of bull.</div></div><hr />
