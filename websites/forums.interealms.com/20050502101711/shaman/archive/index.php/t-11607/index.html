<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm speculating that it will, well praying actually.  Anyone know for sure? :)<br />
<br />
BTW, I've been getting research drops in CT already, that's what made me think it may already be live.  Not too sure though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is live for both casters and priests.  However, there are still some kinks being worked out, which is part of why it hasn't been officially announced.  (One recipe in the book was wrong, some spell scrolls are Lore, etc.)  So proceed with caution :)<br />
<br />
Everything I've found on the new research so far is linked on the Spell Research (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_spellresearch.htm) index at EQ Traders.  The old (49 and under) research still needs a lot of work but the new stuff is in pretty good shape.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hell, I just wanna know if the new parchment spells are live, or when they will do it, so I don't have to just hoard the specs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This patch I have been waiting eagrly for.  I even scribed the group str and dex spells hoping for the change to go through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have officially adopted the policy that I will not buy LoY until they put in  Blood of Nadox  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3842&amp;source=Test) (shaman replacement for Pure Blood),  Talsiman of Alacrity  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=3391&amp;source=Test), and  Tiny Terror  (http://lucy.fnord.net/spellhistory.html?id=3393&amp;source=Test).<br />
<br />
So I'm hoping that they will put these on the March 13 patch.  Otherwise, I keep my money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The recipe for Malo works as of Tuesday night.  I managed to get all the parts and had a 200 + geerlok skill wizard friend combine it successfully.  It was not trivial at his skill level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ugh.  Non trivial combines at 200 is just gonna keep the price of some of those spells up there.  <br />
<br />
Gotta start my stockpile I guess...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I disagree, Thorzion.  Malo usually sells for 60-80k if at all on Ayonae Ro, and though it took a week of solid bazaar scouring for the parts, I paid all of 350pp for the parts. (the staff shard was given by guildmate, not bought, but is fairly common)  <br />
<br />
As people begin to learn what words/runes/items to save, it will get even better I think.  Not only will researchers go into business snapping up parts in bazaar to combine and resell, thereby driving the price down, but it is possible to do what i did and locate them yourself rather cheaply.  (Though I still haven't seen a single component for Pox available yet for some reason)</div></div><hr />
