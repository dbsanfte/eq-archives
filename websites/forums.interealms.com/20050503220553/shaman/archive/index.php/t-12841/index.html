<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just wondering with the changes made to your Earring of Embedded Coral, with the new focus effect.  The new effect is this<br />
<br />
Eterninostrum <br />
1:  Increase Spell Duration by 20% <br />
2:  Limit: Max Level(65) <br />
3:  Limit: Min Duration(24.00 sec) <br />
4:  Limit: Effect(Complete Heal (with duration) excluded) <br />
5:  Limit: Effect(Invunerability excluded) <br />
6:  Limit: Spell Type(Beneficial only) <br />
<br />
I got the Crown of Ambivalence just because of what you said about the extra tick to Torpor and Quiescense.  I was wondering if this effect added 2 ticks or if it is the same focus effect as the Crown.  Also, question for anyone, I have SCRM, do these stack or is there a 50% cap like spell haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The earring will add an extra tick to Torpor and Q every time, unlike the Focus of Mediocrity, which would only add a tick most of the times. Other than that there's no difference. <br />
Of course having this effect in an earring slot is the biggest advantage on it for a Shaman.<br />
<br />
The Focus of Mediocrity though will affect detrimental spells as well(I know that wasn't your question, just wanted to add that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">reinforcement is not capped, or if it is, the cap is over 50%.  SCRM + 8th shawl yields 70% longer buffs, from all the tests I've seen on it.  Not sure if you can get over that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oaklanbash_Vaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK I have Staff of Lost Rituals for my dots, but Crown is nice for longer Slows and Malos once in a while, not like many mobs live long enough to make a difference with those 2 spells.  I seem to get an extra tick EVERY time with Crown, if earing doesn't add 2 ticks then not worth it.  I either get 2100pt Qui/Torpor or 2400pt Qui/Torpor, but that is not from the crown, that is from the phantom tick that shows up 50% of the time.  Without crown it is either 1800pt or 2100pt every time.</div></div><hr />
