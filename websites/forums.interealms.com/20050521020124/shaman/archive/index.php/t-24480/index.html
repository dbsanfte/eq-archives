<br />
I'm still dubious after 4 weeks of hunting in RCoD so I'd appeciate any quick methods too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are there any Non OOW mobs that improove Dranik Loyalist faction. Looking to beat up on some greenies to raise faction</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, but there are plenty of greenies in scar that raise it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
depends on your level, but dranik should offer enough lowlevel mobs for faction raising.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just read something on Allah that says you can not ruin your Darnik Loyalist faction so kill away...gonna look for the link<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have been reading on some of the DS expiditions. here is what i am thinking. I believe the firepit has Kyv`s &amp; ukun`s which raise Dranik Loyalist faction. So what u can do is get 3 people in a group (1 must be around lvl 51 or so. make the lvl 51 toon request the mission &amp; then all but you can disband. Now you zone in &amp; kill greenies till your heart is content...gonna try this...will let you know</div></div><hr />

<br />
It always bugs me when people use absolutes like 'always', 'never', or 'everytime'.  Just takes one example to prove you wrong and then your entire point is cast in doubt.<br />
<br />
Somebody, somewhere is going to mention Ring of Scale faction and how it's scattered across Antonica, Velious and Kunark.  And I wouldn't be surprised to see some linked factions in GoD and OoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree with your original point.  :)<br />
<br />
Your skill in anal-retentivness has increased (100)<br />

I'm more confused by the dragorns...seems like depending on the zone it will give you positive or negative Mura Mutaam (sp?) faction.  I understand the storyline, but is there an easy way to tell which faction they are on?  Everybody scowls at me at the moment. :)</div></div><hr />

From what I've seen dragon's come in three varieties:<br />
<br />
1) The traitorous ones that have joined mata muram's armies, killing them raises dranik loyalist faction. They always scowl and attack on sight (maybe won't if you raise your muramite faction high enough, no idea on that one). So far I've mostly seen these in NC. <br />
<br />
2) The ones that are pissed you're messing around on their planet and treat you no differently then a muramite. Killing them doesn't effect your loyalist faction. These are the ones in most of the zones and are kos regardless of faction. <br />
<br />
3) The mobs actually on loyalist faction which start kos but never actually attack you. These are the quest givers and I think are lvl 70. <br />
<br />
I have yet to figure out what is on the children of dranik faction though.</div></div><hr />
