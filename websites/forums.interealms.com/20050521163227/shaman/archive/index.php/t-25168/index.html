<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, im getting the game today or tomorrow.. and my friend has a druid.. so im thinking bout A) making a shaman or B) making a shadowknight/paladin.. would making a shaman be just as easy or fun as a shadowknight/paladin? Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tbh if you and your friend are going to duo together then the basic building block for any mmorpg is tank + healer.<br />
<br />
Yes, you can do wonderful things with weird combinations but if you have those 2 bases covered then even if there is no-one else on the server you can still go and xp. If paladins and sk's are similar to EQ1 then I would be tempted to go for paladin - but I'll leave that for someone who has been playing EQ2 to recommend best tank.<br />
<br />
90% of mmorpgs are based around these 2 classes then add other classes as required/needed. <br />
<br />
I'm not in EQ2 but this is the method I will approach when I convince my wife to start playing again :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just depends on what you're trying to do. If you and your friend are looking to duo exclusively, I'd say make a Crusader. If you plan on grouping together and don't care about duoing, I'd say go for Shaman. A Druid/Shaman combo is probably the best combo to have for a pair of healers.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Monjay-Tunare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">if you will be duoing alot, sham + druid is going to limit you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You definitely want a tank and not another priest if you plan to duo a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have a great group of friends that I play with, and might even form a guild with soon, but I also 2 Box a Mystic/Conjuror combo, and I can tell you that pair is lethal.<br />
<br />
With the Mystics Wards (Single and group) I can use the pet as a tank modestly and kill even small groups of mobs without much trouble. It’s a bit tougher with harder hitting mobs, but once the pet has agro he manages.<br />
<br />
I advise Mystic/Conjuror or Defiler/Necromancer if you are going Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Expanding on what Gojirax said: Our biggest weakness, IMO, is our low DPS output. I've did some duoing with a Sorcerer in my mid-teens while I was still in Freeport. With me ward tanking and him using his AE nukes, we were able to duo pretty effectively. I think we only had one death the entire time we played together.<br />
<br />
Tanking blue and white group mobs isn't hard, IMO, it's killing them before you run out of mana that's the trick. Just like in EQ1, we do well with high DPS partners.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tanking ability of all non-tank classes decreases dramatically once the sub-class level is hit (L20).<br />
<br />
Basically, the way the game works is that as each character grows, they become more specialized.  Before L10, *anyone* can tank effectively.  Between 11 and 20 you start to see the Fighter archtype pull ahead by a little, but some others can still do it in the right circumstances.  Post 20, the Fighter tree, and particularly the Warrior and Crusader branches, really start to pull away.</div></div><hr />
