Exp in Veksar isnt half bad atm.  What do you all suggest?  My goal of course is to get the Shammy as HIGH as possible in the shortest amount of time possible. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm lvl 56 right now and Poi is slow xp now days.  Of course if your plvling there it might be a lot better.  I'm thinking that the speed of the pulls would be too slow though.  If your gonna be doing slow pulling you might want to try PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>libeck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I two box a 63 monk and a 57 shammy.  I find that the hedge/dock in PoN isn't too bad for xp and the stuff dosn't hit so hard that I can't keep up with healing the monk and add in a dot or two every fight (KEI and Drogmor).  I tried PoV once and even with slows cast asap things hit to hard to keep up with healing.  Once I get to 58 I think it should be doable though.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monk has CA3 CS3 and LR2 which makes a big difference in how much you have to heal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BomBoom Babatbatbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well my monk only has FR1 so..  lacking in that department.  It is the time the AA's should start flooding in though.  So I will try PoN to see how he does.  Ill get Virtue on the monk just in case which puts me at around 5400 hp shammy buffed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A friend of mine did the same thing as you, this is what he did:<br />
<br />
from 50 to 58: poi - any mob<br />
<br />
58-60: ponightmare - nettling wraiths (because they are lvl55-56 mobs, hit nearly just as hard as poi and just about same hps but higher lvl so more xp and plenty of them)<br />
<br />
from 60-65: hoh, mainly white suits.   if you cant get the AD flag, then keep doing wraiths until lvl62.<br />
<br />
if your monk doesnt have good enough gear/aa to handle hoh well then maybe try pov? larvae, skeletons and frogs are all good choices and usually uncamped.<br />
<br />
hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
