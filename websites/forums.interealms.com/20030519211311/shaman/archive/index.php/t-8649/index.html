<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm running a 1ghz celeron on an ABIT V6HT motherboard ( if memory serves me ) 448 MB of ram with windows xp. The problem I have been having is a complete system lockup. Everything freezes and rebooting doesn't fix it, I have to cut the power completely in order to get it to boot. Rebooting just brings a blank screen and no video signal to the monitor, absoloutely no attempt to boot without cutting the power. This occurence is very rare ( once or twice a month ) unless I turn on my USB slots. With my USB enabled ( doesn't even have to have a USB device in to cause the lockup ) it can happen anywhere from during startup to about 3 hours running. It almost always happens when I have my USB enabled, and it is really hurting me right now, since I want to set up a webcam and use my digital camera.  I have noticed that when I start EQ with the USB enabled, I can run EQ for longer on average than being outside of it. It could be a fluke but I believe playing EQ stops or slows the lockup with USB. <br />
<br />
In case anyone needs to know, I am running my cable connection through an ISA ethernet card instead of the suggested USB connection because of this problem. The other cards I have in there is an ELSA Erazer X nvidia geForce256 card ( yeah kinda old I know =\ ) and two disabled voodoo 2 cards I left in there to cut down on air leaks from card slots. <br />
<br />
Worst case, if there's no easy solution, would it be possible to get an adapter to change the USB webcam signal into a 9 pin serial? Or anyone know of a non USB webcam for that matter.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The first obvious change when you enable usb is that irq's get changed around. USB controller requires one so when you enable it more things get shared, etc.  I would try this. Get an usb mouse and disable the ps/2 port. that will free up irq 12 so it should be the same as before with usb disabled.  If disabling ps/2 port isnt in bios then booting w/o a mouse in port should disable it.</div></div><hr />
