<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys.<br />
I was poking around Akheva Ruins yesterday, and saw The Va'Dyn up.<br />
I got a cleric friend to come over to help me kill him so I could get the Toeslicer that he was wielding for my bard.<br />
As a side effect of this, I managed to get a reasonable parse of how well persistant casting AA from GoD works.<br />
<br />
Before the data parse:<br />
-I spent the 18AA to get persistant casting<br />
-I have 7% stun resist on my Breastplate from the plane of time as my only stun resist gear.<br />
-The Va'Dyn will stun you through normal melee, but also procs Storm Tremor (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2927&amp;source=Live) for even more stuns than a flurrying mob would do.<br />
<br />
I went through and counted some totals:<br />
I was successfully stunned 87 times.<br />
I successfully shrugged off 14 stuns.<br />
Of those 14 successful no-stuns, 4 of them were through casting a spell.<br />
Of those 87 stuns, 22 of them were stuns that interupted a spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Analysis:<br />
14 stun resists + 87 stuns = 101 stun attempts total.<br />
14 successful stun shrugs out of 101 seems a bit high for 7% stun resist.<br />
If you consider that 4 of those were persistant casting stuns, it might be that the remaining 10 stun resists were solely as a result of my 7% resist from the breastplate.<br />
The remaining 10 resists out of 101 stuns from the BP would probably be well within standard deviation, showing stun resist to apparently be working properly.<br />
<br />
22 spell interupt stuns + 4 stun resists = 26 persistant cast potentials<br />
4/26 = 15.3% chance to shrug off a stun when casting a spell.<br />
Note:  the sample size is too small to say for sure that 15% is the hard amount how often it works, but this is the only data sample I've ever seen to work from.<br />
<br />
Something to consider:<br />
I wonder if +7% stun resist affects persistant casting percentages?<br />
Like, if I didn't have my BP, would I only have channelled 8% instead?<br />
I don't expect to kill Va'Dyn again like I did, so I can take off my breastplate to test.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclussion:<br />
18AAs is not worth a ~15% chance to channel a spell through a stun, IMO.<br />
DO NOT BUY THIS AA IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE MARGINALLY USEFUL TO BUY INSTEAD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've done 2 seperate parses of 1,000 stuns at persistant casting 2 and 42% stun resist.<br />
<br />
I can't find my sheets atm so will edit this later w/ exact numbers, but this is an approximation.  The actual resist rate was about 45%, with ~13% of the stuns having casts go thru them.  I'm now at 47% stun resist and PC3.  I'll be compiling a new log very soon.<br />
<br />
edit - as a note, the 'con' of a mob has nothing to do with the % resist;  greens stunned as much as reds (ect) and vice versa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">So, your persistant casting with huge stun resist mod appears to be the same percentage as my persistant stun resist with low mod.<br />
13-15% regardless of stun resist mod.<br />
What a great AA!   /sarcasm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, that makes sense.  The amount of stuns to channels thru it should be consistant within a margin of error.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well.. personally any ability to channel spells through stuns is great for me.. regardless of how low it is.  15% with PC3 seems to be about right.  I have PC2 and I channeled two slows yesterday in the span of two minutes in a ldon adventure (have I think 23% stun resist at the moment).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well.. personally any ability to channel spells through stuns is great for me.. regardless of how low it is.  <br />
I think Juu's main point wasnt that channeling through stuns isnt valuable, just at what cost. Depending upon where you are in the AA &quot;list&quot;, you may want to make an adjustment on how high you put this particular 18 aa's worth. <br />
<br />
This one wasnt high on my &quot;wants&quot; list anyway, but it was there. Now it has been bumped down quite a bit though, thanks Juu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tulkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd like to see it 5%, 15%, 25% in respect to levels purchased.  25% for 18aa seems reasonable and effective for the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the offer of the shard btw :&gt;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ya.  It's a matter of perspective.  For example,<br />
For 18 + 5 AAs you get C5.<br />
For 18 AAs you get spell casting subtlety.<br />
For 18 AAs you get run5.<br />
For 18 AAs you get radiant cure 3 plus a few AA to spare.<br />
For 18 AAs you get 10% more max hit points + regen 3.<br />
Or<br />
For 18 AAs you get the ability to channel spells through 15% of [b]stun[b] attacks.  (now consider the number of actual attacks against you that actually stun attacks, and now consider how many of that fraction are done while you are casting a spell).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">its a great aa for pvp<br />
<br />
players rely on stun attacks<br />
<br />
has saved my a.s.s. many times</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Velkoran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the 15% recover from stuns seems right to me,it has gotten my spells off in critical situations and i mean come on,we arent tanking class ;p<br />
