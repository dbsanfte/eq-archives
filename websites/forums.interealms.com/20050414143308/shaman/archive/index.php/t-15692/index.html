<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">new virus going around using a vulnerability to try and spam microsoft.<br />
<br />
this mainly affects XP, NT, and 2k systems, but also can affect 95/95/ME systems.<br />
<br />
the problem is you will get RPC errors that cause your system to reboot alot. the fix in XP (mainly affected OS) is pretty simple.<br />
<br />
1) (XP only) Turn on that peice of junk &quot;internet connection firewall&quot; that is found under the advanced tab of your connection. this might cause furture browsing issues, but to keep the virus from crashing system turn it on.<br />
<br />
2) RUN WINDOWS UPDATE. open internet explorer, go to tools, then windows update. and follow the instructions. you are looking specifically  for the MS03-026 patch (here is a link directly to the patch http://microsoft.com/technet/treeview/default.asp?url=/technet/security/bulletin/MS03-026.asp) but you really should run a full windows update.<br />
<br />
3) update your Antivirus software and clean your system of the virus, mosst of the major companies have the fix now.<br />
<br />
4) remove the firewall in step 1.<br />
<br />
i hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

and it's not 80%. they don't have that kind of saturation on win XP and that's what 99% of all the calls i've taken on it so far are about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">btw the worm is a DOS on windowsupdate itself so you might have trouble getting to it. Try to use different sites if possible. Best way is to get it from symantec.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">5) Remove windows and run WINE on Linux.right, that'll solve all OS security holes.  while I do run linux on some of my PCs, anybody who thinks doing step 5 will end all virii and worms like this is delusional.  linux has had (and more will be found) just as critical security holes as MS has had.  if anybody reading this doesn't believe it, go subscribe to RHN (redhat network) and make sure you get the emails sent to you (free for individual).  you'll get almost an email a day about flaws in either linux itself or common installation items such as mozilla (the web browser, for you newbs).<br />
<br />
so, as soon as you get 80% of the marketplace or whatever it is on linux, the hackers, script kiddies and virus writers will just move to linux.<br />
<br />
and before you start, yes i know Redhat is the newbiest versions of linux, but do you expect the millions of people you are trying to convert to compile linux themselves? riiiiight.</div></div><hr />

That's what makes this particular worm so much fun, it doesn't require anyone doing ANYTHING but being on a network...aka internet. <br />
You don't have to download porn (although that is always a bonus), or recieve email to get this....it will find you.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">This accursed thing hit me Monday while I was playing EQ. :) Spent most of the morning reinstalling XP because I figured it was just Windows blowing up again . The first thing I did was run a complete virus scan and it didn't detect it ( virus definitions were about a week old so I figured they were ok, lol). The only thing that clued me in was CNN mentioned it so I figured what the heck and checked up on it. God, I'm glad that's what it was because I was about five minutes from fdisking the whole drive. If you're curious if you have it or not the worm is mblast.exe and it's located in the &quot;windows/system32/&quot; or &quot;winnt/system32&quot; directory. Lol I was backing up like a madman while windows was coming apart at the seams this morning. Whoever writes this stuff needs to be hurt bad, keeping a computer up and running is bad enough already, we don't need idiots helping us out more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">something i've encountered while trying to clean a few systems here.  Tftp.exe will appear in the windows\system32 directory, upon deleting it, it reapears almost instantly. I've disabled the restore feature thru the control panel, it stayed gone for about 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
we found that an application named CCPWDSVC loads every 3 seconds, we suspect this is the source that keeps reinstalling the ftfp.exe. As long as tftp.exe has been deleted once, and all the other tft*.* files has been deleted, the tftp.exe that get restored is a valid windows file, so don't worry about it anymore.<br />
<br />
we also discovered that the restore feature has been reactivated by this nasty little worm. i've worked on about 6 systems so far, have a few more in line waiting. So far, each system has had to be delt with differently, the guide to cleaning this by microsoft doesn't work for every system, if it did for you, consider yourself lucky.</div></div><hr />

I can't patch at home because my internet connection is down/flaky at the moment.  I got a copy of the patch from our sysadmin...now to find a cdburner so I can take it home.</div></div><hr />

- No.<br />
<br />
Guess the answer:<br />
(1) People don't patch their systems.<br />
(2) Most internet connected home users are utterly clueless about firewalls and their absolute need.<br />
(3) Clueless users in #2 connect via VPN to their work network, thus infecting it and allowing the worm to bypass corporate firewalls.<br />
(4) Micro$oft monkey designers who think everyone needs every possible service enabled in an OS, especially home users who never use DCOM or only use RPC in loopback mode.<br />
(5) Micro$haft uber coding skills.<br />
(6) Highly trained and competent MCSE sysadmins who think having every freaking port open on a firewall is a good idea.<br />
(7) All of the above.</div></div><hr />

1) Start up the computer and quickly hit the start button then hit Run.<br />
2) Type msconfig and hit enter.<br />
3) Go under the BOOT tab and hit Safemode.<br />
4) Restart the computer and it should be in safemode<br />
5) Then run scan disk this will take a long time (6 hours here)<br />
6) Go to msconfig again and uncheck safemode and restart computer.<br />
 This fixed it for me hope it does for you aswell.</div></div><hr />

IIRC RCP ( remote call procedure right?)  is only used to execute files remotely. I generally always disable that process anyway.<br />

I'm assuming you have cable or dsl, you could have avoided all this by simply disconnecting you network cable, the part of the virii that forces a reboot every 45 seconds is only activated when a network connection is detected. So, if you have already been infected, disconnect from the net and run your virii scanner and fix your problem (follow the steps described by either symantic or microsoft), then reconnect and run the patch update stuff.</div></div><hr />
