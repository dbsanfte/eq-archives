<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been trying to get a handle on some fighting techniques for soloing and there's one area that's been troubling me. I'm trying to break up the group of four underbulks at the back of the plateau near the Deep zone line in Echo Caverns. I can usually manage to get the single mobs nearest the zone line with no trouble. And if I canni/med back up to full mana and strength, I keep thinking I should be able to take the four underbulks grouped in the back.<br />
<br />
My husband says you really need a luller on duo with you to get those four because of how close they are and how easy it is to agro. He can break them up pretty easily solo as a Pally but as a 45 shaman with pretty okay gear (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=839656)  I can't seem to get all four (I think at least one is always an undercon personally). Anyone have ideas or tips?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You won't be able to get that group single pulled till you are higher level. At 45 I just did the ones to the side of the main corridor. By the time I'd finished the 4th one &amp; had a short med/cannidance break, the first one was respawning. You can also do the taskmaster room if you can handle 2 at once - only the first 2 on the platform aren't single pullable, you can get them single if you jump up &amp; melee one, but then you have to manage to channel a slow, &amp; if you get too close to the 2nd he'll jump in. The stonegrabbers are virtually immune to our dots &amp; nukes - you have to meelee them down with the help of dogdog. Watch out for Fireclaw &amp; the named fiend too - I don't recall what level I was able to solo them, probably would have been about 45 or so, Echo took me to 50, was fun when I was able to solo the taskmaster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Feh. I was afraid someone might say that. The only way I could think it would work was if I rooted, rooted a second one, let DogDog take agro on number three, took the fourth loose cannon myself, and then worked my way backwards through the chain. And that clearly wasn't working even though it was pretty darned logical in my brain.<br />
<br />
I've been pulling the group of four in the main corridor myself and that's been quite easy. If no one else is in the zone, then I run up to the plateau and take out the single pop to the right of the group of four underbulks. It's been a fiend, a stonegrabber, or an underbulk any time I've been there.<br />
<br />
 By the time I'd finished the 4th one &amp; had a short med/cannidance break, the first one was respawning. <br />
<br />
Actually, it's been a bit of a wait for me before th respawn happened. That's why I started wandering to the plateau when no one else was there. I wanted to see if there was anything lurking that I could lure away from a group and take some time until the cycle in the underbulks of the center main corridor started again.<br />
<br />
You can also do the taskmaster room if you can handle 2 at once - only the first 2 on the platform aren't single pullable, you can get them single if you jump up &amp; melee one, but then you have to manage to channel a slow, &amp; if you get too close to the 2nd he'll jump in. <br />
<br />
Thankyou for this information. I've not yet tried the taskmaster room. Mostly because it's been camped any time I've been there.<br />
<br />

<br />
I discovered this the hard way. The only spell I can get to consistently and repeatedly land on them is Curse. I've yet to have it be resisted by a stonegrabber as a matter of fact. Could be that I've gotten lucky each time, but it has always stuck.<br />
<br />
Watch out for Fireclaw &amp; the named fiend too - I don't recall what level I was able to solo them, probably would have been about 45 or so, Echo took me to 50, was fun when I was able to solo the taskmaster.<br />
<br />
Trillicor. Trillicor the Damned is what I call him. He's lullable when I've duo'd him with my husband's Pally fighting beside me. But if you wait too long he'll jump you, causing you to scream like a girl, abandon your beloved pet DogDog, and race for The Deep zone line, all the way cursing yourself for thinking &quot;Gosh, one more pull and then maybe I'll refresh sow.&quot;<br />
<br />
Not that I'm speaking from experience, mind you. Okay, maybe I am. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm. I have hunted Echo with several of my toons. I started my Shammy there at 45 and been playing there for a few levels. At 47 the Taskmaster and lower TM area are all doable solo.  I always get my slows to land on the mobs whether it is Trillicor, Fireclaw, Taskmaster or what have you.  To pull TM I usually clear Lower TM area. Send pet and than call him back. Sometimes he gets the TM clear without any adds. The other times he gets two skels with him.  I let him take a little damage while I pull the skells to a safe range and root them. Proceed back. Slow and incapacitate the TM and if needed heal my pet. Than proceed to beat the snot out of the TM occassionally rerooting the skels. I do this with just our buffs and no Virtue.  The big room as I call it with the underbulks in the back is a bit tougher.  I start by pulling the fiends out and using same tactics as TM so that I have some breathing room.  I than proceed to the underbulks. I root right away.  Allowing the others to come. Let pet take one while i pull the other two away and root them. I try to keep them far enough apart. I than go back to pet and assist in melee applying my slows and incapacitate.  Constantly trying to keep the others rooted.  It does get messy once in a while and i do at times end up taking two at a time but with them slowed I usually come out on top. If not I am close enough to the zone line to bail out.  I am no place near uber geared. Best thing I have is my Soulstripper. Hehe <br />

<br />
So let me see if I understand what you're doing by stating it a different way. <br />
<br />
You root one of the four (I'm guessing the one furthest back). The remaining three head for you and Dog Dog takes the hit on one of them. You step back away even further and keep casting Root until you have the two remaining ones you pulled rooted. Once they're rooted, presumably some distance away, you go back to DogDog and help him take out the one he grabbed. And then you continue to root anyone who breaks free but fight them each until they're dead. <br />
<br />
Do you ever have to heal DogDog in that process? Are slow and incapacitate the only spells you cast or do you cast any dots? Do you need to heal in the middle?<br />
<br />
Sorry about all the questions, but I have this stupid mission in my head to try this by myself, sort of as a right of passage, if only to prove that I can do it. I'm genuinely interested in how others have succeeded.<br />

<br />
Well I'm about 40% into 46 now and I have some really great gear for my level (thank god for tradeskills and a keen eye for a good deal). I keep thinking I *should* be able to do this. I just haven't got the hang of it yet. And you're right...the Soulstripper rocks. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>tatter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As you come out of SH .. Before you get to the plateau with the 4 spawn .. Stay low and pull the first one .. and get him down on the path .. <br />
<br />
Then .. Stay low and walk to where the first one was .. Pull 2 (Solo ) Make sure you pull it out on path .. <br />
<br />
Then .. Walk up on plateau and stay close to the edge of plateau as far back as you can to the left as you look at the bulks .. Pull 3rd .. Fight it on the plateau .. <br />
<br />
Then do the last one . Always works and is easy .. Try it you'll like . <br />
<br />
I am L 39 and single everytime ) . Use a slow pull not a DD or dot .. Seems to cause less possibilities for adds .. <br />
<br />
Hope this works for you )</div></div><hr />

I think we're talking about two different spawn points here. Yours is good advice for shaman wanting to pull the four in the middle of the Echo zone, but it doesn't work for the 4 underbulks (plus two random spawns) near The Deep zone line in Echo. Not unless I'm *completely* mistunderstanding you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ermanarich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When doing this I was using primarly root. slow and incapacitate.  If I have a virtue buff on it is not that bad and I usually don't have to heal myself. I do when heading back throw a heal on the pet if he is pretty low. If he isn't I don't. Most of the damage is being done to me. I found out that if you can get just two of the pulls and root one you can pull the other to the entrance way to the deep you will have plenty of time to finish it off and than go back for the other. At 48 I was getting single pulls all the time. With KEI I was able to start chain pulling.  I am sure you are going to do great at this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tatter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh You could be right . .I was talking about the ones just befoer TM room</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>iasmin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Okay, I think I figured it out. Here's what I did...<br />
<br />
Fully buffed with everything (I still had buffs running from Sunday night), I zoned in to Echo from Shadowhaven and called for DogDog. Medded up and headed for the plateu near The Deep zone line. 6 mobs were at the top of the plateu near the zone, two in front and 4 in back. In front there was an underbulk (dk blue) on the left and a stone grabber (lt blue) on the right. In back were a grouping of 4 underbulks in a rough diamond shape.<br />
<br />
I jumped into the entry to the Deep at the top of the plateau and pulled the stonegrabber with a slow. Nothing agro'd. DogDog jumped in and I stepped back, landed Curse, and jumped back in to melee. Stonegrabber died quickly.<br />
<br />
I moved a little further in to the room and pulled the lone unerbulk with root, slow, then curse. Then I canni'd. I sent DogDog in as an extra dot. When root broke, I rooted again, as it started running to the fiends parked over into the plateau edge. Underbulk died within a hit or two.<br />
<br />
I canni'd some more, then set DogDog to guard at the top of the plateau again. This time I headed for the 4 underbulks in back. I hugged the cave wall all the way in back in an attempt to get *proximity* agro, rather than pull with a spell. And lucky me I got the underbulk on the far right of the diamond shape to follow me all by himself.<br />
<br />
DogDog jumped in a little earlier than I wanted because the underbulk got in a shot on me as I was running back to the puppy for battle. I rooted him, backed the dog off, slowed, Cursed, and tried an Incapacitate cast this time. Worked very nicely. Root broke, so we meleed again, after which I canni'd.<br />
<br />
One of the two front mobs popped again while I was dancin' so I took that out again using the same technique. It made me realize that I was probably being conservative with time and a bit wasteful with mana. Rebuffed, took out the pop, canni'd again to full and then headed back for the rear underbulks.<br />
<br />
Parked the puppy directly in front of the rear underbulks in a straight line, but against the far wall. Then I inched forward to see if I could proximity pull the first underbulk and it worked again. Yay me! Ouch, root, back off puppy, slow, curse. Dance dance dance, dead underbulk.<br />
<br />
With two left and a pop on the way, I thought I'd try for two to see how I handled it. I rooted the rear underbulk, then slowed it, and the left underbulk didn't seem to react at all. So I rooted that one to get its attention. Cursed the first one, danced some more, and then was lucky enough to have root break.<br />
<br />
I had moved up to the entrance to the Deep zone tunnel in case the front mob spawn popped in the middle of the fight. The slowed bulk followed me there where we duked it out. Root broke on the second one as the first one hit about 25 percent health. I took a few hits as I rooted the second one again and dotted it. As the first of these last two were ready to keel over, a well-meaning, but otherwise kill-stealing, camp stealing boob of a shaman sent in his dog to dispatch the last of the bulks I was trying to kill.<br />
<br />
So I didn't quite do it myself, but at 85% health on me, a dead underbulk, and a cursed and rooted final underbulk, I would have had it if he hadn't screwed up my kills.<br />
<br />
Edit: It occurs to me that I should mention I dinged 47 over the weekend. Killing all 6 of these mobs netted me a bit under 10% xp (maybe a litttle less as I wasn't strictly watching).</div></div><hr />
