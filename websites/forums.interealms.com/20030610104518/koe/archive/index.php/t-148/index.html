<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
As many have the day off on Friday I was wondering if there was any interest of maybe getting 3 groups together to hunt in Kael. I am sure we can all use some of that quest armor :)<br />
<br />
If you are interested leave a post here and we can pull something together. I was thinking about meeting sometime around 11 am est and hunting in Kael all day. A 5 or 6 hour raid should produce some nice quest drops not to mention some decent exp as well. Let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

PS. If anyone who has exp in running these raids is available to take the lead on this that would be most appreciated. (Klydon, Timbo, Rizz etc)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As to the raid structure; I can help a bit here: IMHO, I think you need at least 1 cleric (2 would be nice), 1 chanter (2 would be nice), 1 shaman and 1 warrior 55+ (2 would be nice). <br />
<br />
General tactics are to have one group designated as an add group with a cleric and a warrior 55+ with some extra healing thrown in. They take care of the extra giant, should you get one. (Most are spread out pretty good in the arena area). The other two groups pound away to assist the main tank and then go help the add group. <br />
<br />
I would recommend at least 2 healers per group and 3 tanks/pet casters per group as well. <br />
<br />
Goodluck everyone; I know Kael was really stingy last time I was there, so we are due. :D</div></div><hr />

I think it was Klydon that lead this raid last time and may I say did a SUPERB job at it. Once we all were logged in and situated everything went well =) The drops were slow but that being my first time I didnt know what to expect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sinsemsinfutura</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When is good friday? If it is on the 13th, it will conflict with PoG raid.  Might want to reschedule on another day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Falino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye I have a Growth raid scheduled on Friday starting at 7PM EST, so these two events would conflict with eachother.  Maybe another time though I'd love to come.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boroque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Some mobs are 54+ I think, nothing higher then 57.  I had lots of fun last time I was there wish I could make it.  <br />
<br />
I won't be able to go to Growth either.  I wouldn't wanna be KoS in my wife's treehouse :D <br />
<br />
GL all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kilrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know PoG is planned on the same day however it is not until 7PM and Kael would be over before that time. But as it stands so far no one can go so I suppose it is not gonna happen. Sigh. Oh well.<br />
