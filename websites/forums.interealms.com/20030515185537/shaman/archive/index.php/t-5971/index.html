<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Khayla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey folks, I've been reading these boards in earnest since working on my epic. I completed my epic this past Saturday, with no issues. I did it from start to finish, no cheating, no mistakes. Here's the summary to hopefully help with rumors. <br />
<br />
1. Kirn - we did this with 3 groups. All 50+. Made it to him with ease. FYI - AE heal in Kindle's room WILL reach anyone on the first floor pulling corpses. It caused a massive train, but we got clerics camped and regrouped in short order. Kirn and his pet were up. Pet depopped when Kirn respawned after turnin. Slow did not stick, but he still went down easily. 3 groups was overkill. <br />
<br />
2. Neh'Ashiir - 16 people. Set up camp in the building before hers. Pulled her reaver. Very easy fight. I was warmly at this point. <br />
<br />
(Note: my faction turned ally after turning in the diary to the spirit) <br />
<br />
3. Rak'Ashiir - We positioned two 49 mage pets in his room (he was up, not his reaver). The groups set up camp in the hallway, far enough away from his AE. Tight quarters, we had to shrink everyone. Made sure both mages had under 100 fire resist. I did my turn in, died about 5 seconds later (ouch). The fight lasted about 5-8 minutes. Pets had to be resummoned several times, more than I expected. They seemed to take a good amount of damage, but the mages summoned fast enough for it not to be an issue. There was no one else doing damage, we didn't want to take the risk of him aggroing the groups. <br />
<br />
If I missed any info, please feel free to post here I will be checking back.</div></div><hr />

I got mine on Sat also, I was buffed to 2400hp's, FR was 150, and only took about 700pts of damage. Guess I got lucky, I didn't die. One mage fire pet, our monk resisted 99% of AE. Basically fire pet and monky tanked him.</div></div><hr />
