Thats one of my main music projects.  If you go to the page you will see a picture of myself (Shaman) and my wife (Ranger - yes people who look like that actually do play eq).  There are several songs on that page we did based on EQ.  Thats usually how we test new software and equipment - we do EQ songs.  Better stuff is at the top if you're listening.  Generally, if it has an EQish title (Corpse, Ruins, Scars &amp; Shadows, SOL, etc) it is.  The non-eq stuff is the serious stuff.  Listen to 3 In 11 if youre into odd jazz.<br />
<br />
Songs that have an MK logo were made for WizKids games, and if you've been to any MageKnight Tournaments last year, yes, that theme music was us.<br />
<br />
The instrument I am holding in the picture is a Zendrum.<br />
<br />
Thats just one of 5 bands I'm in.<br />
<br />
So, yup, theres more than EQ.</div></div><hr />
