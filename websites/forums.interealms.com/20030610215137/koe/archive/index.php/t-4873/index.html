<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I remember a couple of years ago on A &amp; E with Biography and they profiled the &quot;Fast food Kings&quot; for a week. Covered (that I remember) were Ray Kroc (McDonalds), Harlon Sanders (KFC), and Dave Thomas. <br />
<br />
I remember that they mention that Dave's health had slipped after he suffered a heart attack (you notice how drawn his face looked in recent times). <br />
<br />
I hope Biography reruns the show and it is worth watching.<br />
<br />
If you think about it.. Dave Thomas was the last of the big burger barons and one of the best rags to riches stories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kindonini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, today was a VERY sad day at the office. Since Wendy's is still a fairly young company, there are a lot of people working at the corporate office that have been there since the beginning and today was a very emotional day for them, as you can imagine. I have only worked there a couple of years, but shortly after I started working there I had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Thomas. He had an amazing way with people that I just can't describe, he touched everyone he met in some way.<br />
<br />
He leaves behind an amazing legacy and The Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption will continue his fight for all avenues of adoption.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ryptagudn Gobbleguts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A number of years ago I worked with someone who once worked for Wendy's and mentioned he had met Dave Thomas.  One of the natural questions, of course, was:  Is his TV persona similar to his real life persona?<br />
<br />
The answer was &quot;yes.&quot;  I was told &quot;He's a really nice guy who just really likes hamburgers.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wendy's is easily my favorite burger joint (mmmm...big bacon classic), and Dave's smiling face on the TV will be missed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I really admired that guy... <br />
<br />
A truely honorable fellow so it seemed.<br />
<br />
I once heard him on a story and one line he said was pretty insightful as to his personality.<br />
