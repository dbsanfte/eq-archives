<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To generalize, every other class has AA's that enhance and improve their core class design. Wizards get faster casting, less mana, improved damage AA's to support nukage. SK's get improved lifetap/ht AA's. Go down the list the and each class gets AA's that improve what they are as a class.<br />
<br />
Shaman get borderline improvements to our class specific abilities. More dogs (taken from mages), improved canni (no complaint here) ... the ability to bump our alchemy (/boggle.)<br />
<br />
Shaman do not get an enhancement to our core class: slowing. If there is any change of benefit to the shaman class this is the area. AA's that reduce the casting time/refresh rate. AA's that reduce the resist rates of slows. AA's that decrease slow mitigation by 2, 5, 10%. None of these are unbalancing ... no more so than unresistable HT's or Manaburn or the other class AA's that actually focus on the class core ability.<br />
<br />
There - thought I would toss that out into the mix of shaman fixes flooding these pages of late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd say our &quot;core&quot; ability is superb (well, up for debate on the active/passive thing) mana regen.  And for that, can5 is one hell of an AA.  Or maybe it's buffing (we are the &quot;king of melee buffs&quot;), where we get SCRM and QB.<br />
<br />
And a lot of wizards don't even obtain manaburn, since it sucks in pretty much all situations, so I wouldn't consider that one of their core abilities (though it was a pretty big deal a long time ago).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, I'ad say that would make a lot of folks very happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I think reduced mitigation should be inherent to shaman, rather than through aa's.  Of course, I think most specialist classes should have their core abilities examined and enhanced.</div></div><hr />
