<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For kicks and giggles, went into an expeditition solo... Not sure what exactly I did, but the one I went into (said pools) had mobs that hit at best 300-400s and gave 1-2% AA... Mobs dropped pretty fast with ol' speedbump, BoN, Bane, and a few swings from mah skelly-procin club!<br />
<br />
Did about 18 mobs with a few occasion of an add.... Wasn't all that hard lol... Anyone else try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i tried plant..i zone in..mobs are quading for 1200+, slow fully, some don't root and all summon. i decided to gate.<br />
i can solo sol ro easier for the same xp.<br />
i hadn't tried the other 3...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I goofed around in crematory the other night and found myself a named.  He went down easy - just as easy as the other mobs, in fact.  I got an 80hp pure-melee neck for my trouble.<br />
<br />
The exp wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either.  1-2% per kill, but I can tear through them pretty quick.  I'm interested in doing this some more, but only for a chance at spell drops from the occasional named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sure you will start to see more threads around.. but basically if you take an expedition from the High Priest, it's a flaggin version.. ie 1000+ hard hittin mofos!<br />
<br />
BUT if you get your expedition from that NPC around the outside of the sewers zonein (sorry name escapes me atm) then the expeditions are pretty much xp/loot type deals that hit from 100s-600s but cake as hell.. Not sure about spells, but we had a ac15 all/all er4 back drop in the easy one... just rare...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Does the number of people in your group matter?  We tried this last night with a full group of 6 - talked to Gamesh, and took the Processing Plant adventure.  Mobs were hitting just shy of 1200 max.  We never found a named, but got decent exp anyway.  Since 2 of us were 2-boxing, it was kind of stressful though, so we wouldn't mind doing an easier one on occasion if that's obtainable by a full group.  <br />
<br />
Did we talk to the wrong guy?  Did we pick the wrong adventure?  Inquiring minds want to know.<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh yeah...  As a warning to others, we encountered a golem-looking thing on our adventure that was unslowable.  Things that hit for 1100 and don't slow are not pleasant. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">several other threads already on this subject, but the plant is the hardest.  Doesn't matter who you get this from, all the mobs there are pretty hard.. hitting you for 1200s, but have no hps.  The golems yes are immune to slow there too.  Just pick any of the others besides the plant and you should be okay to go do.  Crematory i think is the lightest hitting mobs.. at least at the entrance.</div></div><hr />

Are the mobs in the plant rootable?<br />
1200's wouldn't be fun if root broke or resisted, but that would be interesting to do solo if they can be rooted. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">some are rootable and some are not...they all seemed to summon...plant was the hardest, i did some soloing in the cremetorium (sp).  mobs in the crem are 400 hitters up front and 1k hitters in the back, noticed a bunch didn't summon and lots werer rootable...that is all i have done thus far...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Things I've noticed while soloing in the Crematory<br />
<br />
Stonemites - Slowable, immune to runspeed<br />
Underbulks - Slowable, rootable, summons<br />
Flies - slowable, immune to runspeed<br />
Goos - slowable, rootable, does not summon<br />
Larva - slowable, rootable, does not summon<br />
Tureptas - Slowable, rootable, summons<br />
Golems - Immune to attack speed, rootable<br />
Gnats - slowable, immune to runspeed<br />
Ghosts - slowable, rootable, casters<br />
<br />
Not sure whether the unrootables summon, as I was tanking from the outset.  Unsure whether the golems summon, because if they did i'd have died, and wasn't in the mood to test it ;)  Will maybe add the max hits to this when I get home if anyone wants to know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just curious, do you guys zone in from Riwwi or just Nitimbi when entering Barnidu to go to the expedition area?  And can you just invis all the way there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Natimbi -&gt; Qinimi -&gt; Barindu.<br />
<br />
Invis will get you all the way there, be wary of roaming see invis mobs in Qinimi however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FYI, there are occasionally see invis mobs that pop along the way in Barindu as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bhone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">on the XP-only expeditions, are the named in static locations?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Seems like some are, some aren't...  Kril V'Lak in the Plant has always been in the same place for us, but I've seen the Sludge-Eating Fly all over the place in the Lair.  In fact, once the fly was the 2nd mob we came to in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xarila</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i know there are some xp only trials, no flag possible at the end, does anyone have an idea who to speak with for those trials  :confused:<br />
<br />
i mean the trials where the mobs hit for 300-600 !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All the expeditions are the same no matter who you get them from, and you want to speak to Gamesh for the exp only versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heh I tried soloing in Vxed. It took about the same amount of time to kill a mob as it does for me to solo at the tables.  I got 2.5 blue AA per kill vs the 3.5 I get in PoF.  So if you have GoD and are not EP flagged take your VP3 self over and solo Vxed.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />

You just hail Gamesh and tell him what sewer expidition you want: Plant, Pool, Lair, or Crematory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Hildaorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Do these mobs die faster than BoT Giants, because I solo on the south wing in BoT and get 4 to 7% per kill (depending one what type it is).</div></div><hr />
