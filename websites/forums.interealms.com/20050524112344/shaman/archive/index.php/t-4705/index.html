<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really do not think all this whining that Druids are overpowerd is warranted.  Granted, they get a pretty nice big heal.  Which causes a pretty nice big aggro response from the mob.  (I hope you turned off your Damage Shield, Mr/Ms Drood_01)   Let's just see how long these &quot;main healer - CH casting druids&quot; will last, with their pittyful defense, courtesy of a life of kiting.  <br />
<br />
I for one am not worried about balance issues.  After a couple Flurries or Rampages it all sorts itself out all right ; P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agreed.  Wasn't like we were always playing the MHealer role anyways.  If it ups the DPS of a group by going shm/dru/damageX4 more power to it.</div></div><hr />

/agree<br />
druid_02 INC CH for MT!<br />
mob aggros<br />
druid_02 runs around screaming &quot;Get it off! Get it off!&quot;<br />
cleric_01 sighs, &quot;I spent more mana keeping the CH druid alive than on the MT&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Haha..I thought the same thing when I first heard about druids getting this new CH spell.<br />
<br />
Think I might have to snicker when one of the little tree hugging buggers gains aggro and is reduced to a puddle of goo on the ground.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yummy, druid pancake its something to look forward to. Again us Shamans must learn not to stand or sit close to druids that get the CH spell, for once they get pounded the monster will move on to the next closest sitting person. Which isn't going to be me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Check this thread out, I made a mistake and that was trusting information from eqmaps. I posted on the druid's grove and - surprise!  Yes that is the admin posting about how I am begging for flames.<br />

It's druids like those over at the grove that give the rest of them a bad name ... I'm still shaking my head<br />

<br />
it's shamans like you over at the grove that give the rest of us a bad name.  You were very rude and cocky on your post and said a lot of things you shouldn't have.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, lots of kneejerk reactions around here. You guys should chill out you have one of the easiest classes to play IMO. <br />
<br />
You guys are pretty much what I expected out of the druid class. You especially Ligge.<br />
<br />
Before you go bashing someone you know nothing about, take a good look at yourself first. <br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out why you sound proud of yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They removed your post Curst! you must have really ticked 'em off!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bah, I made an honest mistake and they bashed the hell out of me. If you had read my original post you would see what I'm talking about.<br />
<br />
I am not a kneejerk reactionary, I don't troll boards looking to piss people off.  I post here and other places to ask for info and to give info - that is all!<br />
<br />
I did not bash anyone, I did not go out of my way to make anyone feel like crap ~ that quote about the kneejerk reactions and about Ligge are true. They are kneejerk reactionaries, both Ligge AND the moderator bashed me for no reason other than I had gotten wrong information from another site.<br />
<br />
I dont ever see this kind of thing happening here and that is why I love this board and most of the posters here.  If someone makes an honest mistake you guys are usually nice in telling them they were wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, did you mean to say &quot;this board&quot; as in the Shaman's Crucible and &quot;nice&quot; as in our comments? Really?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Peyoten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Lol yeh shamans should feel proud of how they handle themselves....HAHAHAHAHAHAHAH please tell me another. The crucible doesn't bash on other classes and aren't arrogant? I think you guys should read each others posts a little more.<br />
<br />
Sorry I don't like to troll but that was just begging for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hehe just leave the druids alone. they dont interfere with us we dont interfere with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Peyoten:  Its not arrogant when you can back it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Peyoten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok Snap you laid down the gauntlet...time to go to war. BACK UP what you and your companion just spit out... I REALLY want to see you justify the attitude.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Uhh...if it's arrogant, it's arrogant -- it doesn't matter whether you can back it up.<br />

Nobody gets a free ticket to ride.<br />
<br />
Of course, it's human nature to try to steal a free ticket.</div></div><hr />
