<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>hyperflux77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I managed to get all 8 skulls, and the priest popped after an hour and  a half (I must've stepped in something).  So I dragged some friends off to ME to go looking for charcoal...  We must've killed like 80 of the little &quot;I'm wearing my brain on the outside, its all the rage&quot; alien guys at the Akheva zone-line, and no charcoal, how rare is this stuff?  Any help would be wonderful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very rare.  On the good side, Toilers are good xp.  You might try auctioning for it as you kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Laramil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was helping a guildmate get his shield and we killed those things for what seemed like a month before some dropped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Derkar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I set camp near the lake on the hill and killed the toilers for about 2 hours and got lucky for a charcoal drop.  I have heard of it taking as long as 5 mins to a month, so your chances really vary.<br />
<br />
But the place is pretty good exp, and all I can say is hope for the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I helped a friend do the quest, and then I did it for myself.<br />
<br />
All the times we camped for the charcoal, we set up on toiler hill.<br />
<br />
First time took about 6 hours total camping (2 different days worth).<br />
<br />
Next time took about 3 hours camping, 1 night.<br />
<br />
ymmv</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm in the same boat. I've been in ME so long, I'm ready to move in with the 4arms. Is it possible to MQ the charcoal? I have a friend that says she has some, but claims it isn't MQable.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I know this isn't exactly on topic, but with the group it takes to kill the spawned skellies when you turn in the box, I'll bet you could go to FG and get the fungus-hide shield from the caller quest.  I'll take  +32 AC +15 Sta +10 Wis +15 vsDis  over +25 AC +20 Wis +8 Cha +12 vsMg +6.50 Wt  anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The charcoal is indeed MQ'able as are all other parts.  The only exception is that one person must get all of the tormented va'shir skulls.  This person also must have enough faction with the quest giver in Katta to turn in.<br />
<br />
The fungus hide shield is indeed very nice.  However,  you will need a significantly stronger group to do the caller quest (even at the slowest speed) AND that shield is rare.  It may take roughly the same amount of time to collect the quest pieces for the Shield of Bane Warding as doing the FG shield, but most of the quest mobs for SoBW can be solo'd.</div></div><hr />
