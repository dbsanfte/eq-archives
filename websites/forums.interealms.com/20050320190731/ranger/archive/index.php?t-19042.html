(Yes I'm STILL bitter about the 2 weeks I spent camping that rat Wiltin Windwalker!  Curse my lack of available playtime!!)</div></div><hr />

Wilton was there the first time I zoned in to get him.<br />

I spent two weeks camping Slaythe for the gloves....</div></div><hr />

I read that if you talk to Lieutenant Leafstalker in Kelethin before you go to OOT, it puts Wiltin into the spawn cycle, whereas he would not spawn otherwise. I went to Kelethin and asked all the appropriate questions (what quiver of kithicor gets him started, just hailing him doesn't do any good) and when I got to the Seafury Isle, Wiltin was ready and waiting to die.<br />
<br />
My biggest problems so far have been going to Rathe Mountains and finding Hasten Bootstrutter or Brother Zephyn up instead of Maldyn the unkempt, and having to kill about a dozen deathly ushers to get the rune of ivy from Castle Mistmoore (I saw 3 or 4 pairs of black silk gloves though).</div></div><hr />

I just have VERY bad luck!!</div></div><hr />
