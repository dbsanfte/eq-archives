<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>IosseVZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey everyone, my friend is just starting EQ and we would like a good caster duoing pair.  Since we both know shamans rock and he would like to be a shaman :), what would be a good caster class to pair?  I have played Necro and Druid, and out of those two it seems the Druid would go better as far as stacking DOT's, and also there wouldnt be the problem of the necro pet KSing the party if hes hasted.  Chanter could be nice, but has similar abilities to shaman (haste, slows).  Any advice would be appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try search button,there are 50,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 threads of the exact same question already.<br />
<br />
i'd say go dru if you just duo all them time.dru is MORE then sow and port.shaman and dru STACKS.<br />
<br />
if you just plan to play together,chenter is good.they're duo good if no one around,and you can start a group anywhere anytime you get a puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My main is a 59 shaman.  I also have a 53 necro and a 43 druid plus a few mid to high melees.  This opinion is based on my experiences with these three classes.<br />
<br />
Personally, my favorite casting duo is a necro / shaman team.  I love to play either side of this pair and frequently 2 box using this combo.  The amount of damage that this pair can lay down using only dots is fantastic.  Factor in pet damage, any direct damage you might do and both classes' superior mana regen and a necro / shm pair can do some pretty amazing stuff with very little down time.  Even with the overlap in necro / shm dots, there are enough spells that can be laid down between the two to handle most anything (especially at later levels).  It is incredibly unlikely that the necro pet would outdamage the combined output of a shaman and necro unless you were both taking a nap during the fight.<br />
<br />
Druids also make decent partners, but in my experience, this comes more from their utility than their ability to dish out damage.  They can't stack as many DoTs as a necro / shm pair, and their damage shields aren't terribly effective against slowed mobs.  I've always found druid / shm combos a little tough to manage.  There is greater down time, aggro probems from the druid's nukes (deadly given a druid's inability to take a beating), healing abilities are largely redundant, etc.  The strengths of the two classes just don't mesh terribly well, imho.  <br />
<br />
I've only partnered with an enchanter one time &amp; it was pretty lame.  From that one session, I got the impression that there isn't  enough diversity between the two classes' abilities to be terribly effective or interesting.  You might also want to look into a mage.  I've had some really impressive mage partners - particularly at higher levels.  I don't know enough about that class to say much beyond that though...  <br />
<br />
That's just my opinion, though.  Your mileage may vary...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I like duoing with a pet class.<br />
<br />
A mage or necro pet does wonderful damage plus the mage nukes and necro's nukes/dots.<br />
<br />
However, non-caster, I like Shaman/Monk or Shaman/Rogue.  Slap alot of dots on a mob let him beat on you while the monk or rogue damage them down.  Fast xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I regularly duo with a Necromancer and it is my favorite partner after Monk and Shadow Knight. In an outdoor zone where fear can safely be used, it's probably better than Shaman/Monk. DoTs stack well, as Necromancers have plenty of options that will not overlap with Shaman DoTs. Regrowth on a Necromancer is powerful, and Strength, Dexterity, and haste on the pet up its damage output and proc considerably. Our Malise line of spells help a lot with Necromancers, as snare, fear, and most of their DoTs are helped with the lowered resists from the spell.<br />
<br />
Magician is also pretty good, and I'd say better than Necromancer when indoors due to the tougher pet and its ability to root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Either necro or mage work well with shamans, for the most part because a shaman's regrowth and eventually torpor(!) can enable them to put out a huge amount of spell damage if they want to.  Mages generally love being in groups with my shaman because they can modrod away like crazy and basically never run out of mana -- regrowth on them plus torpor is an insane amount of mana they can spend.  Add in their pets, and we really rip through mobs fast.  Necros can use the regrowth and torpor too, and also have nice pets, though lesser ones than a mage gets.  However, a necro can fear mobs, leading to extremely easy experience in many outdoor zones -- shaman and necro pets both just attack the mob's back while necro dots and/or blasts and shaman does the same, maybe adding in some JBB blasts.  Very safe and easy.<br />
<br />
One thing to keep in mind is whether you want to get epics -- most people do.  The mage epic is the hardest in the game.  Necro's isn't easy, either.  By comparison, druid's is much easier than either of them.<br />
<br />
Druid and shaman do overlap a good bit, but snare is also a very valuable spell, and some of their buffs stack quite nicely.  Additionally, you get evacs and ports.  Evac is a great safety spell, and ports are a huge convenience spell. <br />
<br />
However, not a single one of these characters is vital in the endgame in most situations, merely more(or less) useful.  These characters are much less.  The shaman is.  <br />
<br />
Unless you're really devoted to the idea of both being casters, I'd pick a melee.  A caster doesn't improve the power of a shaman(and vice-versa) nearly as much as a melee does.  A necro, say, doesn't get as much out of a shaman's buffs and haste as a melee would.  <br />
<br />
The best thing, though, is to have your friend play both casters AND melee for a time and see how he likes it.  Don't make him feel that he's locked into any choices.  Put your shaman on hold for a while if he wants to take a couple characters to level 15 or 20 and your shaman is already that high, and play something else till he finds something he likes, then join up with him.  What's going to keep the game fun for him, and for you as a team, is not necessarily even a class that works particularly well with a shaman; it's both of you having characters you identify with and look forward to playing.  You know how it is -- many times a cleric is a great thing to have around, but many people wouldn't play a cleric if you paid them.  Let things develop naturally.</div></div><hr />
