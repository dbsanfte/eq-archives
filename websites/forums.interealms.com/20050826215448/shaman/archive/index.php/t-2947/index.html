<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fandain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">this probably was asked before but couldnt find it in search:<br />
<br />
what shields stack?<br />
<br />
and in my case it would be:<br />
does 8th ring stack with alchemy potion and a magician/druid damageshield, this would mean 8+31+33=72point damageshield.<br />
<br />
So is that possible and if yes, is there a cap for this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The complete stacking rules are crazy. I suggest checking Rangers Glade as they have done a lot of research on DS stacking.  The specific combo you listed DOES work.  My small guild frequently uses the 70+ DS on the Main Tank to take down mobs that are unslowable/hard to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Something appears to be changed, or I'm remembering wrong. One of our tanks told me last night that the DS potion I gave him was not stacking with the sheild of the 8th effect. I was pretty sure at some point it did. This new?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should still be able to get 130 plus on someone.  I know I've seen screenshots of people with 150 plus, but I think I read something about a change in stacking?  Dunno, check on Safehouse, someone asks that nearly every week.<br />
<br />
I'm really not to knowledgable on DS's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i recall that for the 8th ring and the potion DS the orderin which you put them on matters, may have been potion first then click your ring.  Dunno if that makes to much sense but hopefully you can see where i am going with it.</div></div><hr />
