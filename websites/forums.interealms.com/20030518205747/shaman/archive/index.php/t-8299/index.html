Emperor Key (&quot;Ring of the Shissar&quot;) <br />
<br />
4 things are required to complete the key quest for the key to the emperor's room. The key is a wearable ring. It is not soul bound. <br />
<br />
All of the pieces for the quest are obtained in Ssra Temple. Nothing is multi-questable. <br />
<br />
1) Pouch. This drops from the taskmasters in the basement of Ssra. It is a container so make sure you have room for that when you hunt for pouch. The other three pieces are combined in the pouch to make the key. Single group obtainable. <br />
<br />
2) Idol. This is obtained from Commander Zazuzh, also referred to as comm1. The three typical places to camp idols would be in the assassin room, in the area up the ramp in the entry room, and in the area through the right door in the entry room. All mobs are slowable. Single group obtainable. <br />
<br />
3) Ring. Yes you need a ring to make the ring. This is obtained from Commander Zherozsh, also called comm2 or Commander Zero. Both require swimming up spirals to reach the next floor. You can opt to go up the spiral that is through the right door from the entry room, or go up the ramp in the entry room, through the room on the right and up that spiral. Elites are not slowable. Rings are typically less common than idols. Single group obtainable, and some form of root or snare is recommended. <br />
<br />
4) Insignia. You would not be expected to obtain this on your own. These are found on the third floor outside of the emperor room from one of three nameds that may spawn. It drops every time. It is very fun to circle around the same room killing snakes again and again and again and again. Really. If you don't already love snakes now, a few hours working on insignias will rock your world. <br />
<br />

<br />
Vex Thal Key = &quot;The Sceptre of Shadows&quot; <br />
<br />
Alas, the VT key does not make a cool item, but it opens the door to the magic wondrous world of yard trash and monocromatic beasties. The quest involves, imo, more of a time commitment on your part. <br />
<br />
You will need to gather 10 lucid shards that are scattered throughout Luclin. They are even all creatively named &quot;a lucid shard.&quot; But they are all different! <br />
<br />
Those lucid shards can be found in the following places: <br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns - The typical place to to camp this shard is at the gate. The gate is first right, then down and 2nd left from zone in. It can drop from a grimling skullcracker, or the runed/smudged grimlings. Bring someone to take hits and someone to heal, it is duoable. More never hurts. <br />
<br />
Akheva Ruins - Drops off the reavers or the rock guys. The most ideal place to camp this is pulling the rocks in the room where Va'Dyn spawns. For anyone unfamiliar with that: go forward at zone, forward past the first intersection and through another hall until you reach a big room. Ideally a group sets up camp in the left corner and mobs are pulled from the room to the left. Many mobs are not mezzable, all are rootable and slowable. A rubble rouser has an annoyingly high amount of hps. While a full group is not necessary, the more damage the better. <br />
<br />
Dawnshroud Peaks - Drops off the sambatas or rockhoppers or in a cave between Netherbian Lair zone and Maidens zone on a wall. This is typically soloable. Many shard hunters have found that lower level players xping in this area are very obliging to announce when they have a lucid shard that might be looted, particularly in exchange for buffs, heals, or cookies. <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - Drops of level 60 shak'nir bugs in a cave close to twilight zone. There is a 2 mob camp right inside the entrance of a cave and a larger camp deeper in. You WILL lose faction killing these bugs, and ultimately may end up KOS to them. A full group is not needed but, snare or root is necessary. A slower and good damage is recommended. This shard is uncommon and may take a while. <br />
<br />
Maidens Eye - Drops off of the named Gorangas in zone (e.g. battlemaster, seer, etc) and it does not drop every time. The 3 camps for this are the three scouts near dawnshroud, the 3 scouts in middle of zone, and the set of 8 gorangas near akheva zone. A full group is not necessary, though given the wanderers in the zone and their typical aggro radius, some form of crowd control is recommended. Personally I prefer to set up camp on the hill just past Akheva and pull the 2 gorangas in front of Akheva, and the 3 gorangas that are just over the hill towards Umbral. This shard is also uncommon and may require a lengthy camp. <br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru - Drops off of Legionaires of the Hand at zone to Dawn and zone to marus seru. You can also hunt these in the long halls in Seru. From the dawnshroud zone you would go straight until you enter a large open area, and click on the icon off to the right against the wall. A full group is not necessary. <br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert - Drops off of Sun Revenants and Sun Reavers in the zone. Soloable/duoable. Shard hunters have found that xp hunters in this zone are many times also very happy to announce rotting shards when they are asked courteously. ;) <br />
<br />
Ssra Temple - Drops off skeletons in the mines of Ssra, the further into the mines the more common they are. (Yes I have seen them drop towards the mine entrance but it doesn't happen often :p) A full group is recommended. Some skeletons run, bring some kind of root/snare and some means to control adds. Respawn is fairly fast. <br />
<br />
The Deep - Drops off all thought leech mobs rarely except young ones, on both sides of gorge. They are more common across the gorge, bring an evacer to get out if you choose that route though. The young thought leeches are the only mezzable so be prepared to tank mez any adds. Full group recommended, particularly if crossing the gorge, but really not necessary. <br />
<br />
The Grey - Drops off of the Sun Revenants in the northwest corner of the zone. There's a pretty little lake with 6 gargantuan skeletons surrounding it. Shards can also drop off the little rock guys from traps, etc, but camping the revs is the most reliable way to seek shards. They are soloable but they have an annoying amount of hit points so whatever damage that can be found is recommended. <br />
<br />
Once all of these are obtained, they are combined in a frame. You are not expected to get the frame without some sort of help, but typically you don't get help for your frame until your shards are complete and you are ready to enter Vex Thal. You are of course welcome to obtain this on your own or seek help independently. When you get your frame, be sure to have an essence emerald and a summoned wisp stone (mage). Ask if you need help obtaining these items. Do not wait until the mob you need to turn them into is standing there to go 'Does anyone have an ee I can borrow?' You will most likely need to flee from whoever just pulled that for you. <br />
<br />
Those 10 shards combined in the frame makes... yet another container! This one has two slots. You will combine an orb of luclinite and a celestial rift in this container to voila, make your key. Both items are no drop. You are not expected to obtain either of these items on your own. Celestial rift is from killing emp, thus you need to have your cute little shissar ring done to even get the bit you need for VT. Orb of luclinite drops off most tough little beasties across luclin - rhags in ssra, seru, worm in deep, etc etc etc.</div></div><hr />
