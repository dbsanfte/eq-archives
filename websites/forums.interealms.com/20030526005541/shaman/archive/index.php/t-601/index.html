According to this, I have to wait longer to cast another spell after I summon a pet (32 sec recovery) then I do after I cast Rage (30 second recovery).  Enchanters (and druid pet, for what its worth) got hit with the same nerf stick. Mages, Necros, SK's (and cleric/wizzy toy pets) unaffected by this.   What brain-dead programmer thinks up these stupid changes.  Oh and the delay on the 55 pet is 24 seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What happened to the talk of insta-cast pets?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nochnaya Zhara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ahh, so i'm not crazy.  I noticed this too and it pisses me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not only did they change the recast time, they screwed around with the way aggro from running mobs works. I used to solo in the Hole, below the first drop, with my pet. If the mob started to run, just back the pet off and just let Curse of the Spirits finish the mob off. And as long as the mob didnt run by a rock golem, I wouldnt get aggro from any other wanderers (since at 55+ you can solo pull warriors/crusaders/flighty fiends).<br />
<br />
Now, since the last patch, if the mob starts to run and I back the pet off, if the mob paths near other mobs, they all aggro, even if they are several hundred feet from your pet. I managed to train first 5 elementals, then 3 on myself, before I realized the aggro had been changed. It now seems to be treating the pet as a player below 55th level, instead of as a pet which only created aggro if it got within the regular aggro radius of the mob.<br />
<br />
Maybe what I'm saying sounds like gibberish, but if you're 55+, try soloing, even at the entrance to the Hole, with a pet and see what happens if you let the mob run. I'm not sure if this has been applied to all zones where you can solo pull above a certain level, but I wouldnt be surprised if it had been.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet the training issue was a bug that was fixed, since the pet isnt 55+ ;-)<br />
<br />
regarding recovertime after casting pet: It suck the whole spell-panel is locked. Should be just the pet!<br />
