<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snearmt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was kinda wondering if peps actually use em...I have 3 and like em (ODS, Coldain bracer, idol of the underking). But my ac is only 1012 buffed and hp only 2428 buffed  with wis 184. Should I swap them out for more hp or ac?<br />
<br />
When i see ubbers running around with 1200 ac ..I wonder if I need to go more that route...does it really help that much?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also are there any other fairly easy Focus 3 items to get that are useful?<br />
<br />
Thanks =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I use ODS all the time. And I usually swap between coldain bracer and supple scale bracer (extended range 3) depending on what I am doing.<br />
<br />
I would love to get an Idol of the Underking :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have 6 at the moment, and I find them extremely useful.  Coldain bracer, idol of underking, amulet of insight for buffing, enshrouded veil, shadel bandit ring and grey flesh gloves (affliction efficiency 3 is hard for me to get right now).  Currently saving for an ODS, and working on getting a circlet of falinkan (affliction haste 3). <br />
<br />
Id say the circlet would be well worth going for if you are on CoV faction, faster casting debuffs can only be a good thing.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have none, I refuse to sacrifice HP and sta (mines low as an Iksar) or pay silly money to wear this stuff right now. There are items with focus effects on that I would wear but havent got access to yet, the easier stuff to get would be a downgrade compared to the sort of thing I'm looking to achieve.<br />
<br />
My druid, level 42, in comparison is dripping in focus 2 stuff, at her level the items are both nice stats and useful in terms of focus effects. <br />
<br />
The difference between these characters? I'm not a solo shaman, I've probably gotten half a bubble of exp and a dribble of aexp solo in 60 levels. The druid on the other hand is a pick up and solo now and again character.<br />
<br />
Its an entirely personal decision of course, if you like the effects then keep on wearing them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I currently use three.  I really like them, but I agree that sacraficing stats for abilities isnt worth it.  The three items I use also have worthy stats.  I wear Sky Watchers Monocle (mana preservation 3) and Shissar Ring (Enchantment Haste 3) and at times I swap in and out Talisman of Evasion (Affliction Effiecncy3).  The talisman has the worst stats of the three, but now that affliction efficency works with slows, roots, malo, ect, its very good.<br />
<br />
Some other items you may consider...<br />
<br />
Frostreavers Embroidered Cloak has spell haste3.  Though an admirable ability, the stats are somewhat lacking (no hp).  All in all, not a bad item.<br />
<br />
Bone Clasped Girdle.  Its to bad the price jumped so high, id love to have this entended affliction3 item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well I had to choose between an ODS and an IGS recently. Both where better than my old boold stained mantle.<br />
<br />
I chose the ODS - Mana Conservation III (effectly 10% off all spells cast, so for me that's an extra 310mana to my mana pool).<br />
<br />
The AC is ok on the ODS (10ac) and has some ok stats.<br />
<br />
My viel has saves me mana on casting a pet (I had this before the ODS) but it has good stats too - it'll get replaced but I would like that to be the Mask of Terror.<br />
<br />
My supple arms are sat in the bank but I think I will keep them on me in future.<br />
<br />
I thought affliction was just DoTs rather than debuffs. Say if I'm wrong on this.. I would like to know.<br />
<br />
edit: ahh I see rag has answered my question already..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally I wouldnt count on affliction haste 3 working on debuffs for good, the fact that they worked with it at first, then didnt after the focus tuning, then did again after a patch suggests that they arent supposed to and will get changed again.<br />
<br />
Would love to be proved wrong on this one however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, I use ODS and only change that out for IGS rarely.  However, if you're talking about SUMMONED Focus Items, they always confused me WAY too much :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
<br />
ODS on shoulders, Amulet of Insight used for buffing.  Veil goes on for calling in dogdog &amp; then it comes off.  Would love a spell haste3, Affliction Efficiency3/Extended Affliction3 items, as I solo alot for exp.  Affliction Haste3 would be nice too.  I'm always looking for them.<br />
<br />
Summoned Focus haste item whenever I can get it, extra DD one situationally dependent (ring/bracer).  Summoned aggro reducer (earring) on raids that I know I'm going to get resisted slows and get summoned (sic) myself. :p<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I disagree that sacrificing stats for effects is not worth it. These items give you distinct improvements to your spells like longer range, faster casting and less mana used.<br />
<br />
It all depends an what you are doing. And the increases in stats get relatively less and less as your equipment gets better. 100 hps more when you have 1000 is 10 percent but if you have 2000 its only 5 and with 3000 its around 3 percent. If you can honestly tell a 3 percent difference in hitpoints by just playing you are really living on the edge :)<br />
<br />
I think it was mentioned in one of the FF threads that the VI people were very surprised to hear that Affliction focus items affected debuffs too so I wouldnt pay too much for those items just yet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Say your group buffing.... 1250 for Kragg and 600 for Brute and Cat. Total manna spent = 1850. Savings assuming 10% = 185. Three casts of Cani 4 and your back on the plus side. Not worth the trouble for me, but rarely am I in the position where I have to buff multiple groups, so I'd rather not have to swap out equipment and/or give up HP's/AC. If buffing multiple raid groups, I guess I can see a use.<br />
<br />
By the by, Is it always a 10% savings? I thought the value varied randomly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From a soloing shaman's point of view Focus items are just too good, especially now that Affliction Focus effects work with our debuffing lines (hopefully it'll stay that way). They make items with focus effects far greater than items with better stats. If I did not have extended affliction, I would use a Bone Clapsed Girdle over a Belt of the Dwarf Slayings. However I plan to get a coldain military wristguard again (destroyed it before focus effects went in). <br />
<br />
Also they're great for Pvp also. What gets better than faster, cheaper, longer dots?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Widda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use the following:<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd be interested in hearing from some lower level shaman about this same subject.  I'm only just now level 26, but I use 3 focus items myself.<br />
<br />
Moonstone Range is extended range II<br />
Chrysoberyl Talisman is affliction haste II<br />
Chipped Bone Bracer is affliction efficiency (?) II<br />
<br />
I really noticed a difference using these items when I was hunting in Marus Seru.  Things there seem like they would hit fast, and run fast.  With the extra range, I was able to keep enough ground between me and the beasties to get an extra spell off, and the talisman was realy helpful in getting off more spells once melee had started.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, the attributes of these same items seemed pretty nice.  Do any other lower level shaman have recommendations?  (I've never heard of an ODS, or a coldain bracer, or many of the other things discussed so far.  :rolleyes: )<br />

Averages to about 5% i believe from reading other boards.<br />
<br />
Few problems with Focus:<br />
Flip-flopping on affliction items. Will they be changed back to DoT only or not? They should affect debuffs, or debuffs should also get focus items.<br />
<br />
Extended enhancement on one crappy item shamans can use? Thought we were the buff kings?<br />
<br />
Extended enhancement should affect group buffs.<br />
<br />
Velious factions restrict which focus items are attainable. Both giant and dragon factioned should be able to do the quests.<br />
<br />
Need more questable items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Affliction Haste III on the Lcea Katta belt (Girdle of Magnificence) is quite nice.<br />
<br />
As of now, they affect other debuffs besides just DOTS... most notably Malo, Malosini, and Slow. Let's just say that a 2-second slow spell is really nice. :)</div></div><hr />

I'm addicted to them now and am trying to see what kindof set of gear I can put together with all the good focus effects. I am definately willing to throw away some ac and resists I dont really need to get more. <br />

Is there any way to filter them though? All this glowing/sparkling/shiny etc spam is kindof annoying.</div></div><hr />

I'd like to get some of the other things, most notably afliction haste, efficiency and extension, and spell haste. Especially now that it is working with debuffs again. My problem is I ended up rather unlucky  with my equipement picks before focus items when in I guess you could say. I have a hard time asking for a Sky watchers monocale when I'm already earing a mask of terror or a nev's eye when I already have a CT brain. I'm still hoping they will go back threw and add some focus effects to some of the nice items i've got with out any effects on them  at all.</div></div><hr />

Working on the Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl (Extended Enhancement 3 plus Flowing Thought) and will never, ever swap it for anything once I've got it.  <br />

Maybe it's just me, but I really don't find the Extended Range on the Supple Scale Armband 3 all that useful.  It's sitting in the bank waiting for someone to convince me that it contributes much to my effectiveness.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like the focus effects.....ALOT.<br />
To me they are worth the loss in AC/hps/resists. Especially when it comes to faster casting.<br />
<br />
I use depending on the situations; ODS, Shissar Ring, Circlet of Falikan, Circlet of Summer, Coldain Military bracer, Supple scale, and most likely a Mage summed Ring, Bracer, and Earring.<br />
<br />
Quite often I am dropping up to  50ac and 200hps to wear these items, but I feel the effects are THAT good.<br />
<br />
Btw, last check, the mage earring is a mana conservation, not hate reducer, and it now works on slow and malo's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You aren't really taking into account the time savings. 350 mana doesn't sound like a lot until you realize that you saved 350 mana the course of four minutes, which works out FT8.75. Or, even better, when you're malo'ing and slowing multiple adds in CT you REALLY need that extra mana.<br />
<br />
In &lt;a href=&quot;http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=2883&quot;&gt;this thread&lt;/a&gt; I manually parsed my logs from XP groups in Cazic Thule. The ODS worked out to about FT4 in the shoulder slot. During particularly stressful periods it worked out to about FT9. <br />
<br />
That's pretty huge. I'd rather be casting damage spells with that 300 mana ... or hitting buffs that I couldn't get to... than be doing more canni4.</div></div><hr />

kobold-hide boots (extended affliction 2).<br />
<br />
when i get my sow booties (this week, if enough friends are on at the same time and willing) or some other better boots (jaundiced bone if they show up for cheap in the bazaar, probably) i'll probably still keep the KHB's to swap out until i hit 49 and they don't work for DoT's any more -- they would still help with Togor's but mobs very rarely live long enough for that to wear out anyway so tis NBD.<br />
<br />
The necklace especially is a HUGE help; i can now pull with Malisement and have plenty of time to slow things on the way back (assuming they get to maximum spell range during the pull, which they almost always do since i usually solo outside).

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I have an ODS. that I have had for a long long time. <br />
<br />
A Enshrouded veil that I also had for ever it seems. <br />
<br />
A shadel bandit ring that I got like 4 days into luclin. <br />
<br />
And that is basicly that.<br />
<br />
Supple scale arm but I never put it on.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt mind getting a Spell haste Item, or extended Affliction. But I am not sure if in the end it would just not be worth the trouble. (Shrug) One day sure. But running out to get an item just for me when I am needed in groups doesnt feel right. Maybe one day when people are not on.<br />
<br />
What pisses me off comepltely is how stupid the implimentation of the focus items were done. <br />
<br />
They should have made all the effect incriment based and not level based. So that gear that you have would still have an effect (though lesser) even after the magical 44th level barrier.<br />
<br />
Level 1 is 1% to 7% effect.<br />
Level 2 is 7-14 Effect.<br />
Level 3 is 14-21 Effect.<br />
<br />
Then if you had an item with a level 2 effect you would not lose anything from moving up in spell ranks. The way it is now Items with the three effect are truely the only ones you would want to get from level 40+ because the level 2 stuff just isnt going to last long.<br />
<br />
I mean Meele have it easy. Get the fastest haste possible For whatever slot you can spare the stats on. No 2 hand slash haste for them. Or 1 hand blunt slash that is only good till level 44.<br />
<br />
Bah.<br />
<br />
Again a decent idea but piss poor implimentation. (Shrug) ahh well the game is fun despite what Verant does, so they keep getting the money. But when another game comes out that is fun with smarter controllers that don't mess up as much as they fix my money will go there. (And drag friends kicking and screaming just like I did to get them into EQ)<br />

I've had one person tell me it isn't worth it, yet a half dozen lvl 60 shaman on my server are hunting all over the place for one, I think I made a good choice.<br />
<br />
I have a Supple armband in a bag with my resist and insta click gear for those 'max range' healing times on raids or when pulling solo and that's about all I use it for.<br />
