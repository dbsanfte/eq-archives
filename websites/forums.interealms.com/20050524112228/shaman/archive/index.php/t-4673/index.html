<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something that's been rolling around in my head is a zone idea that incorporates EQ's current game mechanics. The zone is a series of hallways, or many series of hallways. You begin by zoning into a waiting room of sorts, surrounded by one or many mirror ports (like Tower of Frozen shadow) with a quest NPC by each one. To begin, simply hail the quest NPC and repeat its key phrase like . <br />
<br />
This spawns the hallway beyond the mirror. It is now populated by successive pairs, trips or quads of mobs, whatever it takes to make soloin the hallway nigh impossible. Don't make the mobs extremely difficult, just make them not worth soloing or even duoing. Make em green and don't give em any loot on em, they are yard trash. These groups of mobs are strategically placed so they aggro the whole group at once, without aggroing the group further down the hall. There are 10 or so of these groups all together. Once the very last mob is killed, a named mob will spawn far enough down the hall as to not aggro immediately. It should be noticably, but not terribly more difficult then the groups you just plowed through. It's loot table consists of a LARGE amount of loot, something for every class and/or slot, but it only drops em one or 2 at a time. This loot should be scaled according to the difficulty in making it down the hallway and killin the bastage. This first hallway should be somewhere around 1 group killable at average level 45. The rest of its loot is 6 no rent keys. <br />
<br />
A quest NPC is spawned by the death of the named from this hallway. He asks you if you want [to continue]. He then prompts you to hand him your keys and he return a different key(a la Plane of Sky). The keys will be used for the one of 2 mirrors at the end of the hall. The first mirror is clickable by all and ports you to ZI, the second is keyed and ports you to the next hallway, in which more mobs have spawned thanks to the activating NPC. This next hallway has mobs of higher level/ac/hp/dmg output yadda yadda.<br />
<br />
Here is the kicker, each hallway is TIMED. Thats right, you are given a specific amount of time to kill ALL the mobs in the ahllway or they all depop. If you miss the timer, back to square one. The quest NPCs beyond the original are also on say, 15 minute timers. You are given a 15 minute break between hallways. The timer serves several purposes.<br />
<br />
1. If you wipe out, you can retrieve your corpse safely without summon.<br />
2. No leaving keys on dummy corpses, no camping out to do the best loot mobs.<br />
3. It's a challenge, duh!<br />
<br />
There is one thing I am not sure about and thats whether the game can implement soulbound No Rent keys. If not, then I believe they are testing out a timer on corpses that if they are unrezzed for X mount of time they automatically shift to ZI (scheduled for PoP release).<br />
<br />
This system is different because unlike ring quests, it is intended for single groups, and there is a clear sense of progression. The end loot would be on par with something like Cazic Thule named mobs or slightly better, so no farming from the Vex Thal teams, at least not for themselves. I think all the loot beyond the first 2 hallways should be droppable.<br />
<br />

[i]Complicated(sorta) 3 dimenional thinking ahead!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
My second idea is zone geometry. Instead of a 3d flat plane (or series of planes), how about a zone that is the shape of a cylinder or sphere, where the entire surface area is playable. I've thought of partial way to do this. Have the center of the cylinder(axis) or sphere be the upper (or lower) limit of Z.<br />
<br />
I think it would be REALLY cool to be on the inside of a cylinder, kind of like a giant spaceship with a spin so you don't float in free fall. You could see the &quot;ceiling&quot; above you where mobs are runnin around and fights goin on, tho they would all be upside down. You would constantly seem to be running uphill, like a hamster in its wheel, fightin mobs all the way.<br />
<br />
When you do a /location, it gives you 3 coordinates, Y,X, and Z. Y is your N/S, X is your E/W, and Z is your up/down. This implicitly means that your zone is a giant 3d point grid, always in the shape of a cube, where gravity goes from + to - Z. With a cylinder shape, the axis of the cylinder would be Z=0 or Z=max, depending on whether you gravity pulls you toward the center, or pushes you outward (you fight on the inside or outside of the surface). the outer surface can be &quot;rolled out&quot; to form a flat plane of x,y coordinates. The problem I don't have a solution for is game engine code. In order to use the x,y,z coordinate system, you would have to scale the size of the length of x and y depending on your z-value. In other words, if you have levitate, and gravity is pulling you towards the center, you z-value is greater, so unless your x and y lengths scale accordingly, you would move &quot;faster&quot;.<br />
<br />
I am trying not to sound confusing here, so I will illustrate some more. Lets say for every 10 loc coordinates you move its 10 in-game feet. Every zone has a specific movement ratio. If you are sowed you move at 100 ft per second for example. Well, the circumference of a cylinder is defined by <br />
<br />
pi*r*2, where r is the distance from the surface to the axis. <br />
<br />
Since r is the same thing as Z, we will just refer to it as Z.  Well, if the flat surface of the cylinder is at Z = 100, then the circumference is about 600 in-game feet. So X goes from 0 to 600. Y is the length of the cylinder which for the sake of this exercise we will cal 1000.<br />
<br />
So your cylinder, or tube, is 1000 feet long, and 100 feet from the surface to the center axis, and the surface is about 600 feet around. Now then, put coordinates on every point on the surface of this tube. The problem we have is that the 'distance' from <br />
<br />
/loc 100, 100, 100 to /loc 100, 105, 100 <br />
<br />
is 'shorter' than<br />
<br />
/loc 100, 100, 110 to /loc 100, 105, 110.<br />
<br />
Their relative distances are identical, and a computer can compensate for the speed changes, but the human eye sees one the two as different distances. Not only that, but as you get closer and closer to the axis, the 'distance' between to locs on the same z-plane becomes smaller and smaller, infinitely small. Your toon would take up no space at all, or more precisely, infinitely thin. I don't know if the EQ graphics engine could handle that.<br />
<br />

Besides telling me how long it took you to read all that nonsense... any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nitsujlak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had a similar idea to your first one. Good idea imo though its similar to that ring of fire quest isnt it? Dunno if thats still in the game as i dont hear about it like i did when SOL was first released (and thats when i quit)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Were you pickin your nose when you thought of this? Or were you just extremely bored? ^_^ I like it though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwynhwyfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I suppose they both seem like interesting enough ideas, but how would zones like this &quot;happen&quot;?  So far, I really like the fact that all the places I've been have a reason for why they are like they are.  *shrugs* <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Call it the Halls of Challenge then. The end mob of any particular hall has a quest item for some new quest to &quot;prove your worth&quot; to start the quest. It's pretty easy to incorporate a purpose into a zone. The game mechanics is all I give a crap about tho. I don't RP, I think it's a waste of time. That zone could be a big spaceship will Alien v Predator and Lara Croft dancing around a pole while Michael Knight sits at a bar talking to Kitt and I'd still go there if there was fun and fat loot to be had.</div></div><hr />
