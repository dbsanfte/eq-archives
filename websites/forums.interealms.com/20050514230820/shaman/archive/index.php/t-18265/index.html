<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it looks to me like that's a kind of defensive for monks and rogues...  Slows them by 80% and decreases melee dmg taken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder if it will overwrite our slow causing us to have to cast it again.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet it will at least until the first patch to fix the patch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rgallnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even if that were the case it would only be for 2 ticks and they could only use that opening at RANDOM.  Certainly wouldnt be infringing on our role.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ya its definitely self-only.  Just looks funny in its present form :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Short Buff Box: Yes<br />
<br />
Interesting that this goes into the bard song window.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sort of a bad weaponshield for monks then?  2 ticks?  How long does it take for FD to cycle?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">sort of a stun style spell just to midigate melee dmg though  I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Interesting that this goes into the bard song window.<br />
<br />
Apparently there's 2 shortbuffboxes now - one for bard songs, one for melee abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It decreases melee mitigation though, not an increase. I'm guessing its supposed to be a massive short duration self haste. They just got it backwards right now. Wouldn't suprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">A fury, usually indicates fast and wreckless.  It looks like it is basically a bard like haste, for a short duration.  Lowering mitigation in the process (big wow).  Too bad it probably wont stack with monk epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">On Lucy &quot;Decrease Melee Mitigation&quot; means taking LESS damage.<br />
<br />
It's a self-only defensive stance. It has nothing to do with our Slow spells. Basically, your attack speed is slowed by 80% but you mitigate 20% more damage.<br />
<br />
It's just extremely poorly named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To me it looks like it increases the amount of damage the monk/rogue takes and increases their attack speed at the same time.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok they fixed it today, so it gives them 20% cap breaking haste for 2 ticks. Kinda nifty.</div></div><hr />
