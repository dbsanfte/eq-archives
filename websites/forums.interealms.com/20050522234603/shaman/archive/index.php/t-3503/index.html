<br />
Rich Waters stopped by the necro and mage forums to deliver some news on a rather significant change to caster pets:<br />
<br />
We've had a change up on Test for about a week, and I wanted to share it with you guys and see what you think. Here's the basis of the change -<br />
<br />
When a pet is hit with a spell, it uses the resistances and level of it's owner to see if it resists the spell.<br />
<br />
This means that if you're a level 60 magician for instance and you've got on various buffs and gear that raise your resistances, your pet will save vs. spells as if it was also level 60 with your exact resistance scores.<br />
<br />
Using the owner's level is going to make a huge difference in how well the pet resists harmful spells, and should make a noticeable difference in how well the pets can survive AEs for instance. Allowing the pet to also benefit from your items and buffs means that it will be living a lot longer when fighting casters.<br />
<br />
There is a drawback to this, although I think the good outweighs the bad. If we go with this new scheme, it will mean that the pet always uses the owner's saves. Some types of pets currently are highly resistant to poison or disease for instance. Going with the new scheme would mean they will potentially not resist those types of spells as well, depending on the owner's resistances.<br />
<br />
Overall, this change would mean that pets are much more resistant the vast majority of the time. I think this would be a very positive change for pet classes, but I'd like to see what people think before we go ahead with it.<br />
<br />
Nerfo--cough--necromancers and mages are pretty excited about this change, as pets are notorious for falling victim to the AE spells of ubermobs. Pets usually fall into the category of &quot;acceptable losses&quot; on raids because they can't defend themselves well against such attacks.<br />
<br />
The downside that Waters mentions does raise some concerns. There is a mob for the shaman epic in City of Mist which all but requires the use of mage fire pets due to their invulnerability to fire-based attacks, as players of that level have a hard time dealing with an 1100-point fire AE. Hopefully this inherent immunity won't be affected by the change in resistances.<br />
<br />
The biggest boost from this change really comes from using the level of the owner in the pet's saving throw. Far more than the numerical value of a given resistance, level plays a huge part in whether you resist a spell or not.<br />
<br />
Expect pets to be leading Vex Thal raids very soon.</div></div><hr />

 Thanks for the feedback, I think there were a lot of good points made and I appreciate the time people took to post. <br />
<br />
In the next Test patch, pets will use their owner's resist scores and level ,except when they have better scores of their own. If the pet's own resistance is higher, than it uses it's innate resistance against that type of spell. If the owner has a higher score, the pet uses that instead.<br />
<br />
For example, fire elemental pets have incredibly high fire resistance, but low resistance to other type of magic. If someone tries to cast a fire based spell on this pet, it will use it's innate fire resistance because it's so high. If someone tries to cast a poison spell on the pet, it will use it's owner's current poison resistance score instead.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the comments and opinions,<br />

That would be a huge boon to shadow knights as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wouldnt mind em havin my regen either hehe, am glad tho that I did rak already, I wouldnt like to rely on verants *we think* it shouldnt be effected to get my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">lol rak is still doable by 3 people....one melee and two clerics. less is more for rak.<br />
<br />
is it cool is some kind of way to waste the most amount of time and the most amount of people to get the shaman epic?<br />
<br />
edit: just wanted to say, you don't need to be 'uber' or anything to do it with 3 people. you need a melee class, preferably someone with taunt and/or spells. then you need two clerics, one of them will start CH when the melee is at 4 bubs or below, and the other will patch with a DL. keep this going and remember to only use one melee or there will be too much to heal. casters (who can stay out of AE range) help a great deal as well.</div></div><hr />
