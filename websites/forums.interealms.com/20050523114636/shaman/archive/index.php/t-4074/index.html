<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hayrab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I twinked 2 of my RL friends a iksar monk and a iksar shaman with about 30-40kpp worth of stuff (monk borrowing my fungi) shaman wearing ceremonial iksar chestplate. The shaman is 37 monk is 38 they regen 17hp/tick and 26hp/tick (with regen) respesctively. They told me they were getting pretty tired of The Overthere and they did Temple of Nurga before that so they can hold their own in dungeons. <br />
  <br />
     So I was wondering would Kaesora or Drooga be a good zone for them at the moment all they have is EQ/Kunark will be buying Velious/Luclin soon. I was reading up on Drooga and Kaesora and saw that the zone in is not the same as the zone out. That seems pretty rough for the shaman he won't be able to get out unless hes lucky enough to get a gate off. So what Im asking is do you think Drooga or Kaesora are safe enough for this duo or should they stay in OT for now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jraven1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They should be able to do CoM (at least the entrance). Nice xp modifier and nothing runs. Outdoor zone so shaman can sow, too. Have the shaman save all the various papers/documents/letters that drop if he wants the epic sometime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really cant answer about drogna that well. Never hunted there when i was of exp lvl. Kaesora could be rough on the shaman with some adds really no place to run if your hunting say down by the library. The zone in and zone out one in the same far as i know and where you drop down i dont know what is around there to fight. I had only seen spiders walk past looking up the ledge. I dont mess with the spiders in the zone when i can help it and havent at all since the caster changes. <br />
<br />
<br />
      On a different note since they only have kunark. How about City of mist? Seems like the zone in would be a nice place for them and the zone in area be nice til they decided to move in further. Also a fairly short run from home for stocking up on food/water or getting 39/44 spells if not carried on shamans bag. I had alot of fun in Com and being outdoor dungeon spirit of bi gives a attack boost still and mobs dont run which was always good for my duel with my no snare at the time warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't think you'll be able to Duo Droga at that level.  Your most effective Duoing will be with one mob and possibly one addition.  Droga will give you LOTS of Zerging and you'll die very quickly if you get 5 or so Gobbo adds.  All the gobbos run if they're the last mob you're fighting, and they run along the chain aggro path, so if your root breaks, you'll be in a lot of trouble.  Also, Droga starts out as a dropdown, so your monk buddy's a long way from the exit, if he finds things are a little too hot for him.<br />
<br />
Kaesora's also got a quick dropoff and so you have the same problem of easy entrance but slow exit.  However, as to your particular effectiveness or problems there, I wouldn't know...  I only hunted there for my HS key item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Used to duo in Kaesora alot, never did get that damn shield from the spiders /pout.<br />
<br />
Get a map and tell them to go for it, it's easy to CR from there if you're Iksar, theres a bank a zone away and batwings on vendors in the same zone, dont remember much if anything seeing invis.<br />
<br />
Things to watch out for there: dropping into the wrong area from zone in (dont go all the way down to the bottom you'll get mobbed), getting poisoned (not a problem for heavily twinked), and the old problem of not having snare/stun.<br />
<br />
Dalnir, Kedge Keep and City of Mist are also great spots at that sort of level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't go to Kaesora. It's a pain in the butt because you've got to go half way around the zone before you can get out. In my experience a LOT of stuff there saw through invis which lead to &quot;happy fun time&quot; corpse runs training 10+ mobs around the place. Exp was nice though. :)<br />
<br />
Nothing interesting drops in the parts of Droga they'll be able to fight in (from memory anyway), and half the fun of a dungeon camp is knowing you could get teh ph4t lewts!<br />
<br />
Around about that level I think we were in Crystal Caverns fighting druids for the right to kill Geonids or picking off Terrors. Did a fair amount of SolB Pool Room work after that. Neither were overly exciting but the exp was good. SolB gave me a little practice timing/splitting spawns and such aswell.<br />
<br />
:::edit:::<br />
Forgot to mention there are Necro/SKs in both Droga and Kaesora. While I have no problems with casters, after the caster changes having a necro stack 4 DoTs on the monk then 4 on the shaman is a pain. Getting HTed every 20 minutes or so also goes in the &quot;happy fun time&quot; photo album.<br />
<br />
Stay out of OT. <br />
Don't go to DL. <br />
Nothing in Velks drops pp.</div></div><hr />
