<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nealass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, I needs some advice on where to hunt. I don't have a lot of playing time and finding groups is not what I like to do when on. Not that I can't find groups, its just I like to come and go as I please when exping. So I PLed me a cleric and got it to lvl 38 and at lvl 57 I can now group up for Ranger/ Cleric exp. I did Velks for exp but when it gets alot of people in the zone pulls become harder to find. Where would you recomend me to hunt besides Velks. I have all expantions but have not discovered to much of Luchlin or PoP being simi-retired.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Medain Valacirca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would PL the cleric a few more lvls till 39 at the very least (Cheal).Once the cleric has that get him a kei in Nexus and head over to SolB or Karnors.His mana pool with Kei should be adequate to cover those zones.<br />
<br />
City of Mist would be a good place to PL him up to mid 40s.Lots of undead there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>nealass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Cleric exp will come in time. 1 blue bubble to me @57 = 1 yellow of exp to the Cleric @38 if not more. I'm looking for another place like Velks just not as crowded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunt the entrance to KC with my Cleric.  I am not sure how light blue it would be at 57.  She is 47 now and Complete Heal is nice.   The other loc I hit when there is too many folks in KC is the Bodyguards in EW, however to do that I need a KEI to keep up with the Harmonys.</div></div><hr />
