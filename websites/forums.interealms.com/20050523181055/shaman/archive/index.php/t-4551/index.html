<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm not sure if this topic was already discussed (I'm thinking it has, A lot), but to the point.<br />
<br />
I was recently involved in some (flamewars?) in my previous topic, which involved druids. I myself currently have a level 9 druid, but a 34 Shaman, and would much prefer the shaman anyday. It is believed to be the most popular idea that druids are overpowered compared to a shaman. I recently read a thread which involved bashing druids because wizards are said to be the masters of travel, but druids get port spells and SOW spells. I then started to believe this general idea, and soon wanted to start playing my druid. I then compared the skills and spells both the Shaman and the druid get, and realised that both classes are un-believablly balanced. Why you ask?<br />
<br />
First, druids get snare, where as shamans don't. This is equally evened out with shamans getting slows. They get ensnare, we get Turgur's. Secondly, they have dot's to add with their ability to snare. What they don't get are the powerfull dot's we achieve at lower levels. At level 24, we get Envenomed Breath, where as they get Creeping crude. Shaman's E-Breath = 219 Damage over 42 seconds - Druid's Creeping Crude = 210 Dmg over 60 seconds. I know what your thinking, not really a big difference eh? Well, at level 34 both classes get their newest DoT's. Shaman's Scourge = 542 Dmg over 126 seconds - Druid's Drones of Droom = 340 dmg over 60 seconds. To equal the amount of damage scoure does in 2 minutes, and druid would have to recast Drones two times, making the 170 mana the shaman cast into 282 mana the druid casts. Now, even though our DoT's have a DD component that breaks root, ours stack. Their's don't. For instance, scoure stacks with E-breath, creating a total of 761 damage over 126 seconds.<br />
<br />
Druids get ports? Cry me a river. What they don't get is alchemey. Most shamans that are expierenced in this field know that alcehemy has better uses then making money, as do druids know porting isn't the best and only source of income. If either skill is chosen for money making purposes, it can still make a decent amount of income.<br />
<br />
Quad kiting. Now there's a skill most shamans envy. Sometimes, I wish we had the ability to snare, but then again that would take away our ability to pet kite, and to slow. I was recently grouped with a druid the other night. Even with KEI, he had to wait until FM to kite one mob. I also noticed he was afraid to kite anything above a blue con for fear of resists. I ALSO noticed they did not practice the skills of kiting without snare. I was showing him a good spot to solo when he told me he wouldn't be able to do. Why not? The mob would resist his snares and he'd be dead. Why not run ahead of the mob and root it or dot it? &quot;it would catch up to me&quot;. I was absoultly dumb-founded. I'm not sure about you guys, but when I kite and a DoT wears off, I run about 5 seconds ahead of it and re-cast the dot. Druids rely on their snares so much they never learned to do that. Now, why did he only attempt blue mobs? The resists right? Right. Druids can quad kite, but only mobs that con lower then them. Anything else is suicide to quad kite, much less single kite. The exp a druid gets from 4 blue kills equals the exp a shaman gets from 1 or 2 yellows or one red. A pet kiting shaman would end with maybe missing one bubble to maybe half, and continue with another yellow pull, while a quad or single kiting druid would end with 0m, and having to med back to full before attempting anything again. Shaman's have many different types of kiting they can preform, while druids really only have one choice (snare and nuke/dot). I've read and seen everything from shaman's quad kiting, pet kiting, pet tanking, actual tanking (Dangerous to perform without Turgur's), to the original kiting. I missed a few or a lot, but I know there are more styles. I'm very biased towards shamans, but now some, if not most of you will know that both classes even out perfectly. In the endgame, Shaman's will be dominant, imho.<br />
<br />
Just my two cents.<br />

No one thinks druids are overpowered.  They are an easy class to play, level, and farm with - that is all.  On a raid or in a group, a druid doesnt make that big of a difference.  Turgur's alone does more than any druid can (Sorry druids).<br />
<br />
Snares and ports would be nice, but being a druid would suck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ive said it before and I still think it is true. Druids have one great problem - the perception of their playerbase among the people, and the attitude of some vocal druids. In short, druids are fine, only their public relation sucks.<br />
<br />
As of being happy with your Shaman or Druid or whatever class, its a personality thing more than a class thing. There are great druids, those that fit their style, and there are lousy Shaman.<br />
<br />
I would never play a druid, but I know people who would never play anything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dr00ds aren't overpowered compared to Shammy's but they can solo faster than we can, once they get quad kiting down.  However, we can solo larger mobs that they only dream of (ever heard of a druid soloing a dragon?) and can even solo indoors.  However, their endgame is rather limited and their &quot;super ability&quot; of TP's turns out to be as much a liability as Alchemy is to us....  it's REALLY annoying to have to drop everything to TP someone.<br />

And I expect that quite a few of the Oracles who post here have a dr00d twink, who's their TP Biatch but nothing else, CERTAINLY not their new main.</div></div><hr />

FUNNAYEST QUOTE EVAR!!!1<br />
<br />
Quad kiting. Now there's a skill most shamans envy. <br />
<br />
Wrong.  I don't 'envy' them.  I just wish the wouldn't screw up an entire zone by quadding.  They take numerous spawns, and tend to drag them up and down the area's where I sit/med/fight.<br />
The exp a druid gets from 4 blue kills equals the exp a shaman gets from 1 or 2 yellows or one red. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm doing something wrong.  But I can't solo 1 or 2 yellows or one red.  I try and solo a Yellow mob and I'm looking for a rez.  <br />

All in all, a fun post to read, if a bit off base on some statements.<br />

I myself currently have a level 9 druid, but a 34 Shaman, and would much prefer the shaman anyday. <br />
That's a shock.  I think I'd prefer a level 34 anything to a level 9 anything. ;)<br />
<br />
First, druids get snare, where as shamans don't. This is equally evened out with shamans getting slows. They get ensnare, we get Turgur's. <br />
Wrong comparison.  Snare (a movement speel, not a melee-affecting spell) is barely resistable and ALWAYS lasts the advertised amount of time.  Root (the only shaman line of MOB movement spells) is somewhat resistable with a random, breakable duration - plus druids get root . . . except their root also adds in some damage.  AThe druid equivalent of the shaman's slow line is thorns - there is no faster power-leveling device out there than a good damage shield . . . and it is 100% unresistable.  It kills mobs faster than slow, but costs a lot more in tank healing.<br />
<br />
Shaman's Scourge = 542 Dmg over 126 seconds - Druid's Drones of Droom = 340 dmg over 60 seconds. To equal the amount of damage scoure does in 2 minutes, and druid would have to recast Drones two times, making the 170 mana the shaman cast into 282 mana the druid casts. <br />
I'm pretty sure a level 34 druid can regen back the 112 mana in the 11 additional mana ticks he gets after his first cast.<br />
<br />
Now, even though our DoT's have a DD component that breaks root, ours stack. Their's don't. For instance, scoure stacks with E-breath, creating a total of 761 damage over 126 seconds.<br />
Did you forget the druid's immolate?  in the same 126 seconds (actually 120 secs) that druid just produced 480 + 680 = 1160 damage.  As for stacking, just like a shaman, every druid's lower-level DOT stacks with their higher level ones of the same line (like Drones of Doom with Winged Death).<br />
<br />
I was recently grouped with a druid the other night. Even with KEI, he had to wait until FM to kite one mob. I also noticed he was afraid to kite anything above a blue con for fear of resists. <br />
That's dumb - the &quot;Bees&quot; line of spells are very hard to resist, and druids can easily place them on mobs 5 levels over their own level.  And why was he kiting if you were grouped with him?<br />
<br />
As for the rest of your post - that druid could easily kite any mob you can kite - only generally better.  The reality in your observations is based on a factor we normally observe as shamans in this game: The basic Druid class is significantly easier to play than the shaman class (or pretty much any other).  As a result, a lot of poor to mediocre players eventually end up as druids.  A druid played by a good player (sort of few and far between) is quite impressive, but the really good players tend to shoot for more challenging classes . . . like the shaman community.<br />
<br />
I have a level 55 druid - I created it for the teleports, but since I play 2 to 3 accounts at the same time, he's nice to bring along for the buffs, thorns, stackable DOTs and added healing power when there's no cleric around.  I get compliments on how well I play my druid, but it's not because I'm playing him well (I pretty much have him auto-macroed through any task) - it's more likely because I'm not playing him stupidly - the compliments are probably just sucking up in preparation for another teleport request. :D  Most players have lower expectations about typical druid playstyle.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice post Krup.  <br />
<br />
I think druids often forget about their immolate line because it has a significant resist rate, whilst their other DoT - the swarm line - gets resisted about 1 in 20 times on normal mobs.<br />
<br />
I personally don't like druids.  I accept that this is blind prejudice; hatred of druids having been instilled in me early in childhood by my equally prejudiced parents.  It certainly can't be the result of my in-game experience of druids, all of whom I have found to be supremely competent, sharp, yet considerate players.  I feel truly ashamed.</div></div><hr />

Ok, let me start.<br />
<br />
Before I even start getting into the things you've said, lets look at this.<br />
<br />
#1. You've played a druid to level 9. Wow. That's like what, 3 hours of playtime? And you suddenly know all the druid issues, right?<br />
<br />
#2. You've played a shaman to level 34. Wow. That's like what, 2 weeks of play time? And you suddenly know all about them?<br />
<br />
I think that you may want to look at playing them both up a little higher so you can better understand their issues and capabilities. I'm glad you're willing to post you opinions, but I don't think you've had the chance to develop accurate opinions.<br />
<br />
Next point I want to touch on, is I don't want to be a druid, I don't envy them, and I don't envy their quad kiting, etc. The quad kiting thing is irritating when they try and pull a mob I'm fighting, or when they get pissed at me because I &quot;stole their pull&quot; (when I pulled something they intended to pull, but hadn't yet, I mean).<br />
<br />
Alchemy vs Group Gates? http://forums.off-topic.net/images/smilies/slap.gif Good lord. I bet you're worked on your alchemy from the sound of this... up to, say, 30 skill. Guess what - you're gonna get to work on it a lot more, and you are gonna go broke, then end up with potions that mostly no one will buy. Sure a few of them are useful, but not THAT useful. Alchemy is severely broken, as most of us would agree.<br />
<br />
You speak of how shaman dots are so much more powerful than druid dots... guess what - druids get nukes as well. Stuff that is actually not too bad.<br />
<br />
Druids are severely lacking in the high end game, however.<br />
<br />
All I'm getting at I guess is that you probably need to play some more in order to participate intelligently in these discussions/debates ;)<br />

When I read this post, I was reminded of Skaterr the monk... <br />
<br />
ok i get home last night, right, and i turn on the monitor and <br />
i guess what i see? my brothers account is at the character <br />

so im very tempted to log his 60 enhcanter on but he said to <br />
never ever play it, but that was BEFORE i leart everything <br />

ok like *** is up with leveiling??? it gets reely boring. i <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've seen a really good druid in action, and was quite impressed. Using SoE, Snare and root to do crowd control in L.Guk. Using SoE, Harmony and succor to pull in outdoor zones. Being able to buff the important values (AC,HP, resists) in a convenient group form. Being able to heal far better than a shaman, especially one without Torpor. Extremely powerful nukes. And this is before we even mention the convenience of ports and the xp from quadding. Heck, they even get a group mana regen buff now. It's an extremely powerful utility class.<br />
<br />
The only real advantage a shaman has is we take a hit a bit better (and that's as much about attitude) and a single spell line. Slow is very, very, powerful both for soloing, grouping and raiding. It gives us a definite role. Although our haste and slow can be done by a chanter in a lot of XP groups.<br />

Still, at least wolfie can kick the crap out of bobo. Pointless, but it felt good.<br />

Read my post again you dimwit before you decide to flame me. &quot;Most shamans that are expierenced in this field know that alcehemy has better uses then making money, as do druids know porting isn't the best and only source of income.&quot; Now please, for the love of god, shut the hell up. If all your going to do it criticise, then leave these boards. No one want's to type for 30 minutes just to get shut down in 5.

But since your SOOOO expierenced with the charcter over level 55, why don't you go ahead and post your observations on them, instead of giving the bull**** you have for the past week. Now newbies come here to ask questions, and what do they see when they read this post? A bunch of so-called &quot;luminaries&quot; picking on a mid-leveled shaman. If you would like to post a reply that bashing me, please, go right ahead....just don't do it under this post. Go start a new one. So I guess all low and mid level shaman have to really look forward to is arrogance and pride in the high levels. OHHH, so that's what they gain.

Honestly, I thought the answers were pretty tame. For the most part, it was simply, you might be a little too green to be making the statements you did. Researching a class has it's merits, but until you actually play a class to 50+ (pretty much 55+ on most servers), you really don't have a clue as to what the class entails. That's not meant as a flame, merely an observation. I have 3 char's over 50 and one over 55. I might feel comfortable discussing monk (my 55+) issues on a monk board but honestly, I wouldn't even attempt to discuss them for the other 3 nor my lvl 30 shaman. Do I have opinions on shamans, certainly. Would I come here making a detailed class vs class (to what point might I ask) analysis, no. But that's just me...</div></div><hr />

There is not once class in the game that can do more of a variety of things-period. The reason they stall at high level is also simple:  They dont specialize in anything that can make or break an exp group.(unless you count evacs but wait a wiz can do that)  Shamans are damn near REQUIRED, having a 60 enchanter i know they can slow but damn nothing can compare with a shaman. (i love my shaman over any class)<br />

<br />
well actually he is just level 34,  shammy is just starting to gain power at 34.  before 34 shammy are generally weak IMO.  I would take a level 33 druid over a 33 shammy....  <br />
<br />
Level your shammy and you will see the big difference between shammy and druids.  It looks like you read up on both classes tho and that you know of their advantages.<br />
<br />
But there are a few things in your post that you failed to note.  Things like Canni to gain mana back faster.  <br />
<br />
one other thing.  Alchemy as a money maker...... only if you plan on selling Just sow potions and shrink potions.  and the prices for those now just suck due to bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kushpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm trying to see where this forum is laden with &quot;druids are overpowered&quot; sentiment.<br />
<br />
Many quadders pretty much suck (To be around), more because of how they act in regards to others in the same zone as them than their class.  Heck, I have a 55 wizard I've mostly given up on playing due to not wanting to learn how to quad (I'd rather not be seen as that quadding ^*()^ who just trained something over someone medding), and single kiting otherwise being a bit a tedious mind numbing chore.<br />
<br />
And being a one trick pony sucks anyway (For soloing at least.  I do still enjoy grouping with my wizard, but my groups always seem to be short a healer :( So I play a shaman now, with what I consider a more enjoyable playing dynamic, in terms of doing things versus sitting on my rear collecting dust).<br />
<br />
Druids in the high end game tend to be a bit underpowered IMO without some serious investing in AA.  Crack and single target snare are nice, they have some ok nukes (compared to wizards at least :p), and their dots aren't horrid, but it's as though the class abilities are spread too thin and they can't really do much better than anyone else.  Except PL.  Yippee.<br />
<br />
I don't know, I've never played a druid past level 12 so I'm sure my perceptions on the class are skewed.  And I'm only a level 35 shaman now, with much to learn and experience, but I have been in the 50+ game, and talked to my friends and understand what they consider to be issues with their classes.<br />
<br />
And btw, saying &quot;druids get ports, so what, we have alchemy!&quot; really is funny (I snorted loudly at the start of my chuckle, had I been enjoying a beverage I may have caused my mucuous membranes massive damage!).  I understand the pain of alchemy being an *almost* GM tinkerer with my wizard, with most of my tinkering skill ups gotten pre-luclin.  1kpp per combine for a skill up blows, it really really does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Druids don't get the JBB, but the Elder spiritist vambraces do have a decent dot on them. There's also the epic for both classes. I have seen a druid with 4 mobs rooted and dotted. With snare, sow and long lasting roots this is a very viable and safe strategy.<br />
<br />
The reason you don't see it done is because it can't match the mana efficiency of the quad spells. Fist of Karana is 812 points of damage to 4 foes. 3.2K of damage on one cast is pretty sweet.<br />
<br />
I'd still be a shaman though, because I love being able to pick a blue foe an melee it down. Sure I have to cheat a bit (slow and dot) but it just feels good to club something to the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Said it before, will say it again.<br />
<br />
Shaman &gt; Druid.<br />
<br />
1) Shaman can out heal a druid.<br />
2) Shaman can out nuke a druid. (Unless Mob is Cold Resistant)<br />
3) Shaman can out Solo XP a druid<br />
4) Shaman will be invited to more XP Groups than a Druid<br />
5) Shaman will be invited to more tier1 and tier2 guilds than a druid<br />
6) Shaman is more necessary to a Guild Raid then Druid.<br />
<br />
This is not even adding in torpor<br />
<br />
1) Chloroblast and Natures Touch are the EXACT same ratio.<br />
Which means we heal just as efficiently mana wise, then a druid does.  They just do it FASTER.<br />
<br />
The key is the same key to power we always have.  Can.  We out mana regen a druid.  So using the same efficiency spells, we are going to have more mana to cast more healing than they are.<br />
<br />
2) Lets Leave off the JBB.  No shaman in thier right mind would trade JBB for Right Click Drones.  <br />
<br />
2 Ice Strikes &gt; 1 Moonfire in Damage<br />
2 Ice Strikes = 500 Mana Spent<br />
1 Moonfire = 320 Mana Spent<br />
<br />
Only question is, can a shaman regen 25 mana for every 16 a Druid does.  ((Divide by 20))<br />
<br />
3) Takes the right gear.   But I have a 59 shaman who is going to ding this weekend.  and a 60 Druid.  <br />
<br />
But in the time a Druid can pull 4 mobs, round them up, quad them, and then kill them AND THEN DOWNTIME to start again.  A well equipped shaman can kill 6 mobs.  XP Bonuses and zone hunting plays a role<br />
<br />
4) 2 Boxing now, I can tell you for a fact I get 100 random tells inviting the shaman to a group, for 1 to a druid.<br />
<br />
5) Heh, go look at recruitment requirements<br />
<br />
6) Nuff said<br />
<br />
Only thing a druid is good for is manuevarbility from hunting grounds (which is getting easier and easier in expansions) and track.<br />
<br />
One of my favorite 32k mobs to kill has left me no doubt about relative power.<br />
<br />
Shaman does 1/2 the damage (10k in JBB + Dots) all the while healing the tank about as much as the druid does.  AND slowing the mob.  In essence does 1/2 the damage, and Prevents/Heals 85% or so of the mobs damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My best friend plays a druid, and he's a goddamned good one.  He's been sole healer for a long time, and never has any issues with it.  Grove + NR + NT is a great healing combo.  Winged Death + Drones or even drifting death is a great DoT Combo.  Wildfire is an insane nuke.  A druid is a very well rounded class at the moment.<br />
<br />
The problem I think is that the druid class is very poorly misrepresented on message boards because the most vocal druids also happen to be total idiots.  They don't get invited on raids and they think it's because they're druids.  It's not, they're actually close to retarded.  You go over to the druids board, and every damned one of them is a whiner who has no idea what they're talking about.  They just don't get the big picture.  They can't understand why clerics are mad that they got a new heal.  Maybe because all clerics do is heal, Einstein?  Even the mods are total basket cases.  They support the whining.<br />
<br />
They say that they wanna be able to heal a 7khp tank, but that's not the druids job, nor will it ever be, nor SHOULD it ever be. They say they want better nukes -- Ice Spear of Solist -- wizard nuke, 1200 damage, 300 mana. Wildfire. 1024 damage, 320 mana. new Druid Heal 2900 HP, 400 mana. Wizard heal is what again?<br />
<br />
I like well played druids.  They bring a lot to the table in many situations.  It's just too bad that the vast majority of vocal druids have absolutely no clue when it comes to the big picture.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Laproaigh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">It would take a pretty damn poor druid both skill and gear wise not to outquad a soloing shaman. You have to make this comparison at the same level of gear and skill and in that case there's no way we can match the exp. The advantage there is hunting areas, I can solo for good exp in places where many will not go without a well balanced group. But with the duration and KEI a quadding druid can easily have it up at all times. And a skilled one can out exp a skilled shaman. Of course a crappy kiter doesn't stand a cjance against a shaman with good gear and skills.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is a bit of a change in &quot;the vision&quot;, I don't think druids or necros were originally designed to stack very well on raids. But nowadays the end game is all about raiding so they try to change that. I do think these new heals are a bit overpowered compared to clerics though. But that's only the raiding aspect. And aera in which druids haven't had strengths before. I for one don't much like this blending of the classes. I liked the big differences. Druids and necros have been able to do hell of a lot alone for 59 levels. I kinda like being repayed for that by being more wanted in groups and raids at 60.<br />
<br />
Not that druids are overpowered at the moment, definitively not compared to shamans but I like the differences. I would prefer if druids and shamans got totally different increases in their healing abilities. Say that druids get the 2k CH and we get a regen spell that's less mana efficient and higher level than our current ones but strong enough to be worth a buff slots on raids.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Wodaman Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I've played a druid to 60 and a shaman, also to 60 (my main is a 60 monk).  Both have full spell books except for Group Acumen, Moonfire, and Mask of the Stalker.<br />
<br />
IMHO, at lower levels the druid is more powerful.  As most of us realize the equation changes rapidly starting in the 30's but I was able to make 36-39 with the druid (again pre-Kunark -- which means pre-Kunark spells and equipment), porcupine meleeing that quest armor bad arse centaur in SK (the one with arrows who is faster than sow).<br />
<br />
By 50 however, pre-Kunark, the only folks you saw consistently soloing Ice Giants were shamans and necros.  Then Kunark opened and it was a shaman's dream -- meanwhile the necro declined in RELATIVE power.<br />
<br />
Same for druids.<br />
<br />
What Verant needs to do is make the druid LESS attractive at lower levels, and more attractive at higher levels.  I have a hard time most nights finding a 60 druid in my guild other than myself just because they almost all retire the character or the game at that point.  That's not right, no matter how much we like shamans.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the 75% cheal will help in this as the druids will use it more than shamans who are turguring and torporing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, yes, soloing dragons with the shaman is quite doable and duoing with the monk makes red and yellow at 60 things like Taskmaster Abbyot quite doable.<br />
<br />
The druid finds himself at 60 porting/evaccing, doing fast heals to keep DPS up, DSing, and checking for spawns.  If a cleric is present he can usually chain nuke/stun.  It's not really enough for a main at that level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I'll go out on a limb here and disagree with you about the druids endgame, folks.  I don't think they are underpowered at all.  I LIKE grouping with druids.  Snare is great for runners, the back-up heals are very nice, especially since nature's touch doesn't slow the tanks.  Not to mention, in a good group, with some AA points, they kill far too fast to use DoTs--druid DD spells are GREAT for that kind of group.<br />
<br />
On raid level mobs, when I lead raids, I REALLY appreciate druids.  Natures Touch and Chloroblast are extremely important as back-up heals when switching main tanks.  On mobs with obscene damage, where you almost HAVE to have defensive (yes, there are a few--just not many), a strong core of druids can make or break a raid.  When, due to lag, or just a mistake, you lose a MT and people aren't ready to switch cleanly, it helps even more.  Sometimes knowing you have to switch is easier than a switch on the fly, even with an alert crew of clerics who know that the people at the end of the chain need to DL and remedy while the front of the chain gets established.<br />
<br />
I've seen some smaller guilds make a related mistake on vindi.  They set a heal chain too slow, and try to make the druids (and shaman) make up for the slow chain with assist heals.  With current heal spells, none of them can really make up for a cleric (unless you have a LOT of shaman and druids--most small guilds don't).  The other problem is DPS for small guilds.  With focus items and AA points, druid nuking is VERY nice.  It adds up to a substantial amount of damage to mobs--damage they can't do if they are forced to heal full-time.  I've seen 3 small guilds trying it this way on our server.  They need to up the DPS with druids and shaman blasting, because over the length of a fight without the druids blasting, there is too much chance of a mistake because the fight is much longer.<br />
<br />
Completely outside of the ports and evac, I think druids are much maligned.  Of course, as has been said, part of that is because it is such an easy class that it has a lot of real idiots in it.  Group with a really good druid, and they will surprise you with how effective they are.  Of course, that's true with most classes!  It's finding the GOOD people that is hard.  Try getting into an exp group with some of your server's uberguild people, and see just what they can do with their respective classes.  It's eye-opening to say the least.<br />

P.S.  Exodus, alchemy really, really sucks.  You'll come to see this more as you progress in levels.  I got to 180 alchemy relatively cheaply (probably about 18,000pp total), and I have yet to make another potion.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a 60 Druid with 44 AA.  <br />
I have a freshly dinged 60 Shaman.  ((YEAH!!! WOOT!!! I will never do 59 again))<br />
<br />
In my first guild, I was a big deal.  I showed the power of a druid.  Of course I was the 2nd level 60 in the guild.  I was the 2nd Baron.  I also had spent 100k on EQ in a guild where average players total eq was worth less than 20k.   I was da bomb.  To level 50s, a well played level 60 druid looks like a powerhouse.<br />
<br />
Fast Forward....<br />
<br />
I begin to work with more tier 1 and tier 2 upper end guildmembers.  I come to see how pathetically little a druid offers.  Most groups get LESS XP per hour when druid joins.<br />
((Need Snare, get a ranger you will get MORE XP))<br />
<br />
Sure Druid is vital to heal/smooth CH.... but thats only because the Shaman and Clerics ARE TOO BUSY to bother.<br />
<br />
I decide time to level up a shaman.  Again, I have access to money.  And buy some decent gear.  With good gear I notice Shaman out solos Druid in XP.   Period.  I timed my quads and compared to number of kills I could get with shaman.   Got 6.<br />
<br />
Not only, does shaman get more xp solo.  But getting a group is 100* easier.   &quot;Random Shouts --- Group Looking for healer&quot;<br />
Druid sends tell:  Reply: Sorry we mean Cleric or Shaman.<br />
Shaman Sends tell:  Reply: Sure come on over.<br />
<br />
Then factor in Big Mobs.  Shaman and Monk can take out mobs with 32K or even more hps.   Could any druid and monk do that?<br />
Not a prayer.  <br />
<br />
Fast Forward<br />
Moved Shaman to his own Account.<br />
You know when I add druid to the group with shaman and monk, they get LESS XP per hour?  Druid can not not improve kill rate enough to make him not a xp leech.<br />
<br />
Druids seem powerful when you look at top druids and compare them to 50's, even mid 50's chars.   <br />
<br />
Druids are pathetic when dealing with Groups of Similiarly Equipped 60's.  <br />
<br />
Druids seem vital to lower end guilds.  Providing much needed healing power to guilds that have 1 and 2 cleric raids.<br />
<br />
Druids are pathetic to Tier 1 And Tier 2 guilds.  Only reason to have them is when you DONT have enough shamans and/or clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Why would an XP group which already contains an enchanter prefer a shaman to a druid?  With an enchanter present, a druid brings a lot more to the group than a shaman does, since they have significantly less overlap.  Enchanters can do hastes better than a shaman and can reasonably expect to be able to slow XP mobs without excessive agro (though they often die too fast to bother).  The druid can bring a damage shield, better nukes, evac for emergencies, and snare.<br />
<br />
This sort of discussion about who's better in groups totally depends upon who's already in the group.  If you've already got a ranger or wizard, a druid is less useful.  If you've already got a chanter, a shaman is less useful.<br />
<br />
I can't believe anyone actually thinks there's an answer to the question of which class brings more to groups.  The question is stupid unless you say who's already in the group.  If you assume the group already contains &quot;the holy trinity&quot;, I think a druid brings more to that group than a shaman does.  If it's a less conventional group, a shaman probably brings more to the table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Actually even with Enchanter, Shaman heals more than a Druid currently.<br />

Chloroblast and Natures touch are the same ratio.  Again though Shaman has more mana to spend.<br />
<br />
So Shaman still outheals a Druid.<br />

But your right.  Enchanter in group makes a druid close to equal to a shaman.  You could make arguement on thier use.<br />
