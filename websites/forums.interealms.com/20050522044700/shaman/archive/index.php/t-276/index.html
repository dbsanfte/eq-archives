<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone ever done this?<br />
<br />
I've tried two times so far, both times a failure.  First time I didn't even come close, but I didn't have Malo either.<br />
<br />
Second time he was trained on me at the start.<br />
<br />
Third time, I got him down to 60% life.<br />
<br />
I've got a couple tactics in mind, but I'd like to know if anyone else has or has tried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On my server, multiple guilds camp his spawn, and he's dead about 2 minutes after spawning - literally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">-Test- Server.  The large difference between test server and a real server is people on test server don't largely need Lodizal loot.  Because there's no economy, people really don't care about Lodizal.  I've gotten to him 2 of the last 3 times he's spawned, and only had people there because he wanted to watch me.<br />
<br />
That doesn't change what I want to know, whether or not someone has solo'd him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The only way you are going to solo Lod.. so to speak is if you let the gnoll/turtle fight go through to the finish. He will go up and attack the camp.. he will win but all the gnolls will take him down to about 20% life or so, from there just finish the job.<br />
<br />
But ya.. he does not last the long on the regular servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Each stack will heal 10 hits by the turtle.<br />
<br />
With the pet + epic dot and torpor/potions on yourself you might have a chance.  I never did get a chance to try it though, for obvious reasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">what he hit max you know??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not like I'm ever gonna see him, but what is his spawn time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe Lodizal is an 18 hour (+/- variable) that can skip spawns.  He seems to be closely related to the Stormfeather spawn (several times we have killed one or the other, ran over and bagged the other one).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He's contested but not perma-camped on Fennin.<br />
<br />
He has a soft 18 hour spawn time, plus or minus a few hours, but can skip a spawn.<br />
<br />
At 59, I've slowed him without Malo. Other times I need tash. Seems fluky. He hits he in the high 200s and I think low 300s, and enrages. Epic dot lands easy, and JBB hits but not always for full.<br />
<br />
I'd say with torpor you have a chance, but that's just a far-flung guess, and I was thinking I wanted to try this when I hit 60. I've even served as tank with a single group who successfuly dropped him, so he's not that hard really.<br />
<br />
I just want Stormy now for my eyepatch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Akaylas-Fearstheshoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Little more info...<br />
<br />
He hits for a max of about 300.  Also triples.<br />
<br />
It's possible to Malosini him without Malo, but hard, but sicne I have Malo, not a problem.<br />
<br />
The big problem I see is bracer nuking and keeping healed.  He ran me out of mana my most successful try.  His damage is very inconsistent also, there were rounds where he failed double and dual, and missed, and other rounds where he hit for 300, 270, 300.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of epic doting and then using pet, no bracer, and using all the time to cann/torpor to keep mana up.  To do that, however, I would need to know Lodizal's HP, and my pets DPS.  A friend of mine Calculated about an hour, but I'm gonna recheck it myself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I can confirm Gloriana ... as I just finished doing Lodizal last night around 11:30PM CST with the Help of Garrot the  Assassin of Companions Fame and his guild.   We had been camping Lodizal for three days straight since his last known death sometime around 10:30~11PM CST.   He skipped 2 cycles before popping again.    JBB hit's and he's a weak melee for a top Zone Boss.   <br />
<br />
He headed straight for the SnowFang camp so that report sounds about right with SnowFang's fighting him.   While camping we pulled a couple of the named out of SnowFang to test how &quot;green&quot; they really were ... and guess that the named are much like other protected VI mob's with Ton's of HP.   I would guess that at the first of the fight one could load up with DoT's without gaining much Aggro while SnowFangs were committing sucide.   Plus most of the SnowFang camp had fast respawn rate which would lend to a extra advantage to the fight.    DS and Chloro potions would also add a extra advantage since every bit would help in something like this fight.<br />

I was lucky enough to be the only person in the zone once while camping Stormfeather. I got my SF and was running to EW when, who should I see? Lodizal.<br />
<br />
Buff up. Summon a pet. Haste it. Get to FM. Gulp a DS potion.<br />
<br />
I got him to 60% before my guild showed and down to 40% before I had to ask for a heal.<br />

Next time I try it, it'll be with another 100 AC and 400 HP.</div></div><hr />

The Gnoll's DO NOT aggro Lodi.  He stops in front fo them, and they bow and growl, and beg for their lives to &quot;the Ocean god&quot; continiously...lags me like hell.  =P<br />
<br />
He CAN be solo'd.  I'm told a Shaman on my server did it, but it took a LONG time and he had a group there the whole time, to make sure if anyone tried to KS.<br />
<br />
Lodi doesn't summon, so you could always solo him the pansy way...SoW and run like hell, keep the JBB firing off and DoT's stacked.  But, that's just a guess.  I've never seen lodi moving so don't know if he is faster than SoW, or what...</div></div><hr />

For some reason, the great turtle always skipped the spawn when we arranged enough force.  Then when he spawned, we always lost him to other guild.:cool:</div></div><hr />

 Really, he isnt like Yeldema... Much higher damage output, magic resist and all. One resisted slow and I doubt you will get a second chance. At least your going to run for it:)  Plus the fact that when people see you &quot;struggling&quot; with Lodizal they decide to &quot;help&quot; so maybe they would get rewarded with something nice. <br />
  I have heard many people claiming that he can be soloed by an Oracle, and many have said they have seen it happen too. <br />
 But have you ever heard a story about a... Ok I'm in hurry so  *inserturbanlegendhere*.<br />

He had of course all the 'uber' gear, of what most can only dream, also had all the spells there is to have for a shaman. He had planned it for some time, I don't know how many times he tried, but the final time he had it all &quot;laid down&quot; and he moved in for a certain kill, what he also did.<br />
<br />
It was though a year or tad less ago. I don't remember unfortunately who that shaman was and on which server. In any case, in the post, there were all the details as to what he used, when, with the screenshots to boot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 The shaman was legendary, now retired, Nixx Darkpaw, or Nixx the Mystic from the Test server. The dragon was the king of all wussies in WW, Yeldema. He has no AoE and low melee output.<br />
 Looking now at some of these magelo profiles here his gear wasnt that uber especially considering that this was over a year ago. Mostly it was done with skill and some luck with the adds.<br />
<br />
 Several other shamans have done it after that. Actually so many have done it that soloing Yeld has almost became an Oracle'ish rite of passage. You dont need much uber for doing that, Luck, Malo and Torpor is enough. I have also hear (unconfirmed) rumours that some Oracles have soloed even AoE dragons in WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes AE dragons in WW have been solod =).  As for lodizal, if all he hits for is 300, it shouldn't really be that big a deal.  The warrior snakes in ssra are fairly easy to solo and they hit for 280ish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Lodizal should be soloable nowadays. It won't be as easy as killing the snakes in Ssra though. Lodizal is level 60 and has almost 3 times the HPs.<br />
<br />
Finding the right pace between keeping you healed and killing as fast as possible would be the right strategy. Canni AA will be of considerable help. You have to be aware though that after a Canni a good melee round of hers can kill you.<br />
<br />
If you have 3 k HPs buffed you can make it i'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The Aoe WW dragons are not really that much harder than Yeldema if you have the right strategy, again its just luck with adds and a little extra practice on timing torpor so it stays buryied beneath clickers.<br />
<br />
If I ever get a shot at Lodizal, you can bet my tail I'll try it =)  Chewing through 32k hps will be fun whilst sustaining that damage output though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Maboun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I know for a fact that shortly after velious came out a shaman friend named Kendorm on Fennin Ro killed him solo. I think Lodizal has been buffed up some since velious release so keep that in mind. <br />
<br />
I've tried on at least 5 occasions to bag him with a 60 warrior friend and other assorted melee buddies on Saryrn and usually the same guild has been getting him 95% of the time. I refuse to camp something for more than a few hours at  a time so finding out when he died last is a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">i personally don't think it's possible to solo an AE'ing dragon, because of the dispell. dispell doesn't always eat the top buff, it likes to take the last buff - ie torpor would get dispelled constantly. would be very tricky, plus the damage is harsh, 500 dmg max five times per minute - that's probably 1250 dmg average. a lot extra healing needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I know for a fact that shortly after velious came out a shaman friend named Kendorm on Fennin Ro killed him solo. I think Lodizal has been buffed up some since velious release so keep that in mind.<br />
What was changed is that the gnolls no longer aggro on him and take him down to 20% on their own. This is how people were killing it with ease when it first came out and why it was changed. <br />
<br />
It doesn't work that way anymore though, so would be 1 heck of a good fight 1on1 if you could ever get the chance.<br />
<br />
As mentioned, on our server (TM) the ShowEQ buzzer is setoff everytime he spawns and is always monopolized by 2 people and their horde of toons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I wish there was a way for VI to detect people using ShowEQ.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Lodi's damage output was increased as well.  He previously only hit for 215's.  ALL of the gnolls used to engage him and there was another named in the camp.  All of the names together could kill him.  We actually got the kill on him once by watching the fight until the last remaining named made lodi run.  The chanter started spamming mem blurs on the gnoll and the rest of us jumped on him (Lodi).  I cannot say for sure if mem blur did anything or if we just got lucky, but we got the kill on Lodi with a single 4 man group of high 40's.<br />
<br />
Since then, they jacked his melee damage up to low 300's, and moved the shaman named out of the camp and up on the hill (other side of ToFS).  It's been a while since I was in IC to begin with, so that may have changed, but that was the last set up I experienced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep Yep --- Companions came through and did the trick.   But the DT guildie's were there along the way during the 3 day camp.   Almost all of the DT guild came to cheer, offer support, and buff during that camp.   <br />
<br />
I can say that here again that Garrot and Companions are GREAT peep's.    They came in mass to help Garrot (Companion's) once Lodie popped.    Unfortunately I had just logged after a 18 hour camp run.    Garrot and DT folks in zone started yelling for Fascaser to log back on ... and I got on just in time for the fight to be mainly over.    Happily ... Companions and Garrot --- honorable guild  they are --- award me one of the scales.    <br />
<br />
So --- Yeppers --- I didn't solo or get the kill on Lodizal.   But I can say that I got a bunch more out of the deal than a Lodizal shield.    Since this fight --- I've stay'd in contact with Garrot plus a bunch of the Companions.    They are a Class Act.    <br />
<br />
My Guild &quot;Divine Transcendence&quot; is happy to call Companions friends on Veeshan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I think lod is definitely soloable by a well enough equiped shaman with the right preperation. Ds potions, and some of the other potions could definitely help out. I think the biggest problem is outside of test it's going to be almost impossible to get a shot at him with out getting flat out KSed or at least someone trying to &quot;help&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I almost died when half my guild was there.  Whether you CAN solo him or not is not really more interesting to me than whether you should bother trying.<br />
<br />
All you need is a failed slow or malosini or both if you're solo, and you could be dead really quickly.  I'm infinitely more powerful if slow sticks than if it doesn't -- and sometimes it doesn't.  <br />
<br />
If you're solo, there's nobody to take over aggro long enough to give you a chance to recover.  And I'm an ogre who can't even get stunned from the front, so it's worse for others.<br />
<br />
Anyway, no way to tell whether malosini and slow will fail or not.</div></div><hr />
