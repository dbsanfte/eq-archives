I have Khura's Focusing.<br />
I even have Primal Avatar.<br />
<br />
But I don't have Malo (or Torpor) and look what I get to bid against on my server?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">750k GOLD Pieces, which is 75k pp... not that uncommon.<br />
<br />
KEI goes for 70+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I dont see anywhere in that post about 750k being Gold pieces, one guy assumes and ask but no response, I assume he is Really offering 750kp which is I N S A N E !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah, he said 750k PP... he bought 450k off of ebay... and he had 300k from selling something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So you wait until he buys his copy then prices go back to normal.  Those are those once in a lifetime sales that someone makes that everyone will laugh at the next guy saying:<br />
<br />
/auction Malo lvl 60 shaman spell 750kpp<br />
<br />
Try it on your server with an anon newb and see how many scoff.  Just because one person is willing to pay that much, doesn't mean everyone will...<br />
<br />
Example:  On Saryrn a friend of mine got Sunstrike, a spell they already had so they wanted to sell it.  They asked if I could for them so I made a trademule and auctioned what they wanted for it.  They wanted 40k cause they saw someone else pay that much for it.  <br />
<br />
I auctioned it alone, without a price to see what people offered.  My original offers were 20k, then getting that as a feel of the market I offered it for 30k  (I had talked my friend down)  I was mocked and the sarcastic '/auction sunstrike 5kpp' by someone.  Eventually I sold it for 24k  Which was still really high, but if someone has the cash, and they want it for that amount then that is the value to them and the seller.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to admit, with the prices of some spells and my luck on lottos, (in other words I always lose :p ) I've been tempted to buy some plat myself occasionally :o<br />
<br />
I refuse though... just tempted is all ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">:eek: I thought it was fairly obvious that I wasn't actually serious. I was just showing the people who keep one-upping eachother in bids for Malo that it doesn't matter, because no one has the spell for sale.<br />
<br />
&quot;Yes, I sold my BoC for 300k, bought another 450k off eBay, and now I'm offering it all for a spell. Oh and I ninjad the BoC I'm currently using in the meantime.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please tell me you didn't take this seriously...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It was a JOKE people.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It look like a serious auction to me UNTIL he posted it wasnt.<br />
<br />
/shrug what do I know</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not sure how we were supposed to know this was a joke, I've seen people do equally wacky things in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What I think the guys point was was to make a point about spell drops. Nobody knew the guy was joking while he was offering 750k for Malo. Everyone, including the original poster here, thought the guy was serious until he posted it was a joke. But the point he made at the end was still valid. Nobody had the spell to sell him, even at 750k as a rediculously high offer, still nobody could sell him the spell. <br />
<br />
Luckily, Malo doesn't seem to be nearly so rare on Drinal. Torpor on the other hand...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>NewShaman1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">A guildmate of mine just got Malo for 20k.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/em is afraid to ding :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>imel007</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Im at 59 . 99999999   I don't want to ding to 60.<br />
<br />
All 60 means for me is more mobs are blue.<br />
<br />
Been like this for a month, all the 60 spells I have are focus of spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The part that got to me was there was no one that even had a copy for sale.. even with him offering 750k (before he said it was a hoax).<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I think he made a very good point about the rarity of the spell.  I'd be interested to know how many other classes have spells with a similar rarity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Plat goes for let's say $50 per 10k? 45 * 50 = $2250. Let's assume there would have been some discount for volume. $1800?  I've seen a 60 warrior with vulak/SOD/you name it he has it for $1500.<br />
<br />
I've seen some crazy things, but you can buy a 60 shaman with malo/torpor for $4-500.  Buy the new guy, delete your old character and name change. <br />
<br />
If it's not a joke, it's by far the most outrageous thing I've ever seen on EQ.<br />
<br />
With that said, I think it's safe to say it was a joke<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well the answer to this problem (No Malo) is obvious.<br />
<br />
All of us lazy, whining, bitching Shaman need to just get our butts over to Veeshans Peak and farm those spells.</div></div><hr />
