<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One of the biggest problems we face right now is that if you ask 10 Shamans what needs to change you may get 12 variations of 17 differnt answers. Shamans are probalby the most &quot;Jack of all, Master of none&quot;class in the game, and as a result, there are a lot of different playstyles and ideas on whats &quot;best&quot; to fix us. Murtak wants to heal. I want to melee and nuke. Others want bigger buffs. Some want better debuffs. Obviously, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to keep everyone happy unless . . .<br />
<br />
. . . we find an alternate solution. Here is what I propose. <br />
<br />
AA. Expensive ones. Expensive with big pre-requisites. Here are some examples:<br />
<br />
Healing: Cost = 10, 20, 30, pre-requ = MAXXED all healing AAs, + maybe SCR and SCRM, and a couple Gates ones. Result = +200, +300, +500 on Daluda's Mending, or the new OoW heal (pre-focus, pre-crit, pre-aa, straight addition to the original spell). <br />
<br />
DPS: Cost = 10, 20, 30, pre-requ = MAXXED FoM, Gates FoM, SCR, etc. Result = +200, +300, +500 to Spear of Torment (or the new OoW poison fast-nuke). Again, pre-aa, pre-focus, pre-crit. <br />
<br />
Buffing: Cost 10, 20, 30, pre-requ = SCR, SCRM, couple Gates ones, whatever, lots. Result = +100 hps, 2% melee damage, 100 attack; +200 hps, 4% melee damage, 150 attack; +350 hps, 6% melee damage, +200 attack to Focus (or the OoW upgrade). <br />
<br />
Debuffing: Cost and pre-requisites = you get the idea, Result = an additional -10 resist modifier and -50 attack, -15 resist modifier, -75 attack, -20 avoidance (mobs), -30 resist modifier, -100 attack, -40 avoidance, (whatever, GOOD MEANINGFUL debuffs, not jsut -100 STR and AGI, thats lame) to Balance of Nihil (or the OoW slow if there is going to be one).<br />
<br />
Here is my reasoning behind this. This game used to have the player base seperated by levels. Leveling form 45 to 60 wasn't a simple matter, took time and patience. Now, getting to 65 is a relative joke. Instead of levels seperating the player base, we need another alternative. Zones is one way, but it sucks to have HALF the zones unavailable to the players who CHOOSE not to raid. The answer, IMHO, lies in AA. <br />
<br />
The difference between a lvl 65 with 300 aa and a lvl 65 with 25 aa is staggering, even more pronounced than the difference between lvl 60 and 65. This applies across the board. The lvl 65 with 25 aa is LIKELY fairly balanced in his current play enviroment. However, the 65 with 300 aa in a Time + guild is struggling. This doesnt only apply to Shamans, its fairly universal across a number of classes. So my solution is to make tools available to the more &quot;advanced&quot; characters, the ones who need it NOW, but not make them completely impossible for the more casual non-raiders to even achieve. <br />
<br />
Granted, a Shaman who went and did the 700 aa needed for ALL these powerful upgrades would certainly be goddly. But honestly, do you care? At that point, that Shaman is LIKELY to be at the very tip-top of the games content, the Final End Game of the current expansion. So what if he can solo Grummus. Seriously. I can solo bigol former &quot;Raid level&quot; mobs now, but I usually don't bother because I am busy with other things that actually matter. <br />
<br />
Make it expensive to choose these &quot;trees&quot;. Make it hard. But make it doable and accessible by anyone who wants to dedicate THAT kind fo time into it. I mean, we are talking about MONTHS and MONTHS with some of those examples I proposed. <br />
<br />
Anyway, thats my idea. Thoughts, comments and flames welcome.</div></div><hr />

Fixes should be done without forcing anyone to grind for them.  We are broken, we should be fixed.<br />

Were warriors (when they were broken) forced to do AA's to fix themselves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">sounds similar to a skill tree used in eq2 and other games</div></div><hr />

<br />
edit: By this I mean that I don't agree with the post. AA are not the answer and are in fact just another way to separate the player base, this time based on ability to grind. One of the themes I feel I have seen regardless of the uber vs casual person arguing has been that artificial separation of the playerbase is bad. Well, in this way you would remove all separation but make it a long and arduous path for someone to improve their own abilities.<br />
<br />
You also make it for the attention of the SoE folks, why? Before an idea is presented to them shouldn't it be agreed on?<br />
<br />
This undermines the big argument going on about Shaman being broken, because instead of pushing for fixes, you are pushing for fixes over time, at the discretion of the shaman. So, if I want to be fixed and useful I have to grind 200 aa.<br />
<br />
Thanks Blazz, I really appreciate that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh... I think it's a great idea.  Why you might ask?  Well because I kinda posted on this exact topic a long arse time ago as to how to get AA sinks that could cost a ton of AA and yet keep improving us as a class.  Now Blazz, maybe folks just like you more but I got about 10 neg rep bumbs when I posted this idea so you might get the same... but not from me :)<br />
<br />
I love this idea.  Look at any of the classes and how easy it is to max out the &quot;important&quot; AA.  I know so many of my friends that are working up their Charisma, Wis, Int AAs because they have all the needed ones, along with resists and what not.  It's impressive but not jaw dropping to hear that folks have maxed AAs now days.  Considering the xp in the EP, which I've just gotten access to and is INSANE to get 7AA in a relaxing night of grinding with my guildies.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I still agree we need some powerful AA that we can dump a ton of points into but give us a noticeable return.</div></div><hr />

Um, yes they were, to a degree. Grinding is a part of EQ. Wake up. Its gonna be a part of WoW. Its a part of CoH. Its a part of EVERY progressive game there is and ever will be. Accept that.<br />
 If you are ever hired as a dev for a game please let me know in advance so I dont waste any time thinking about whether I should buy it or not :-)<br />
Lets hear your solutions Spiritblood? Heres a question for you. Are all shaman equal? Is the shaman who plays 40 hours a week not ENTITLED to be farther along and more powerful than the shaman who plays 10 hours a week? How do you achieve this? Listening to any options at this point. <br />
AA are not the answer and are in fact just another way to separate the player base, this time based on ability to grind. One of the themes I feel I have seen regardless of the uber vs casual person arguing has been that artificial separation of the playerbase is bad. <br />
Look, there is NO POSSIBLE WAY to avoid a seperation of the player base at this point. I am offering an alternative that actually makes it POSSIBLE for less-active shaman to choose a path of progression for their character that equally available to EVERY SINGLE PERSON. Once again, are you trying to tell me that the 10 hour a week Shaman and the 40 hour a week one should be completely equal in all regards and aspects? Give me a break man.<br />
You also make it for the attention of the SoE folks, why? Before an idea is presented to them shouldn't it be agreed on?<br />
This is my personal idea, an idea for them to CONSIDER. I never claimed this idea to be the consensus of all shamans here. I made it to their attention because SO MANY good ideas are probably not even seen by them because they are completly smothered in the middle of threads that are 90% worthless posts no one wanted to read. These people don't have time to sift through these threads, nor should they.  Wanna rename it &quot;My Personal Idea on a Solution, Not meant to represent the views of any other shaman who ever played EQ&quot; I will. I could care less. <br />

<br />
Thanks Blazz, I really appreciate that.<br />
No, it offers a solution to the fact that pre-Gates, SHAMAN ARE NOT NEARLY AS BROKEN AS PEOPLE THINK. Gates and above is where the GLARING deficiencies of our class begin to emerge. Pre-EP Shaman are an EXTREMELY powerful class, even in just Bazaar gear. <br />
<br />
Advancement and reward based on time. That is EQ. <br />
Changed the title of the thread. Please don't address the developers as if you were speaking for the entire community :)<br />
Sorry, not my intention, was just offering them another idea. But I want them to see it. <br />
<br />
All in all, I think the people who disagree are missing the bigger picture. Rewards based on time spent are viable game concepts. Isnt this EXACTLY what the non-raiders are complaining about? That they cannot get to the same &quot;level&quot; of gear and zone access with a similar amount of time spent? I am proposing a DIRECTLY linear reward system acessible by EVERYONE based on time spent in the game.<br />
<br />
I seriously see you people that disagree with me as the BIGGEST part of the problem. You want more for less. You want rewards without dedication. You want Diablo 2, where anyone can log in for 5 minutes and be maxxed out. You want total equality with the guy who plays 5 times as much as you do. <br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I would be LUCKY to be able to progress halfway along one of my proposed &quot;trees&quot;. I just do not play that much anymore. I have neither the desire nor the patience to grind. But IF I WANTED TOO I COULD. What is the Number 1 &quot;non-raider&quot; complaint? Its that they do not get equal reward for time spent in the game because they choose not to raid. I am suggesting time based linear equality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not saying all shaman should be equal. I am saying that you are trying to create a pathway that is open to people who have been online for a long time and ground their way to a high number of aa. Not all these people raid, and not all raiders have a high number of aa.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is where your argument fails. Not all Gates and above Shaman have several hundred aa's. The way that Gates and above shaman have been able to get to that position is flags Blazz, not time spent in game. It's been about Advancement and reward based on flagging. If you want to make Gates and above shaman effective you need to enable them to be effective without telling them to take 6 months off raiding and grind 200 aa then come back.<br />
<br />
<br />
Advancement and reward based on time. That is EQ. <br />
<br />
No. It is not EQ.<br />

I am trying to create a pathway for people who have invested more time in their characters that doesnt involve raids, flags, uber gear, etc. The fact that not all &quot;end game flagged &quot; shamans do not have a high number of AA is exactly my point. They should be THAT much better than the guy who chooses not to raid but has the same AA based on zone access and flags? Give players the ability to upgrade themselves in ways other than gear and zones available. <br />
This is where your argument fails. Not all Gates and above Shaman have several hundred aa's. The way that Gates and above shaman have been able to get to that position is flags Blazz, not time spent in game. It's been about Advancement and reward based on flagging.<br />
No, this is exactly where my arguement is proven to be a potential solution. Let me give you some examples. Does the Bazaar shaman have access to any &quot;advanced&quot; focus effects like Marr's Gift, Druzzels Distance, Speed of Mithanial/Soulsec? Hell no, they get IH4, ER4, and SH4. All lower level than the focus's available on MANY advanced raid level items. People who choose not to raid are never going to see Marr's Gift. However, they could work the AA for &quot;Extra Healing 1&quot; and be as effecting as that uber shaman who has 1/4 of the days played and 1/3 of the AA. <br />
<br />
Reward based on flagging is pretty darn new. In addition to that, flaging itself is a function of time. Do you think its hard for Uqua and Qvic guilds to kill Fennin Ro or Xegony? Nope, its pretty trivial in fact, but it still takes ONE THING to get those flags for their members. TIME.<br />
No. It is not EQ.<br />
You tell me what EQ is then. Skill based? &quot;Who you know&quot; based? Its a game. MOST games of this kind reward for time spent. I am not talking about time standing in the Bazaar selling your good, I am talking about time spent improving your character and progressing forward in a semi-linear manner. Flagging allows people to skip that time investment and linear progression in SUCH a massive way its kinda hard to believe. <br />
Its an alarming way to head through life thinking that anyone who disagrees with you is the problem.<br />
Not everyone, just the ones who seem to want the game handed to them on a platter. I know you are not like this. <br />
<br />
You have read my posts. I am arguing with people constantly. I never claimed guys like Murtak are the &quot;problem&quot; because he wants to be a better healer and I could care less. But I am sorry, anyone who cannot see that rewards should be available based on a linear progression of TIME is not seeing the issues properly. LDoN is a reward system based on time. The whole AA system is currently a linear reward system based on Time. Leveling, lots of quests (especially those that involve rare drops), tradeskills, etc etc, so many aspects of EQ are reward systems based on TIME. Why not expand this to help adjust balance more?It does now to a certain extent. Which is better, a 300 aa warrior or a 10 aa warrior. Which is more effective, a Shaman with Cannibilization or a Shaman who hasnt &quot;grinded&quot; that AA yet?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with this as long as it is not detrimental to those who are flagged. We know the game is split, and I am all for individuals to be able to progress their characters (big of me I know) but not at the expense of others. From my experience, and this is purely my perception, people who spend the majority of their time raiding make very little experience. People who spend their time grinding (or not raiding) make a bunch more. I am in the first bucket tthere and about 90 percent of my online time is raiding. The raiding guild I am a member of raids predominantly during the hours I am online. Sadly, I ding most of my aa during raids! I do have some very nice drops from raiding but I lack aa (160ish). I have some friends who were about the same in terms of character progression before I went over to the dark side. We still play around the same times but they have many many more aa than me, and I have much better stats. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

However, they could work the AA for &quot;Extra Healing 1&quot; and be as effecting as that uber shaman who has 1/4 of the days played and 1/3 of the AA. <br />
<br />
I see the problem, I just don't agree with the proposed solution. There should be less of a disparity in the focus effects available, but I would prefer to have those kinds of things be aa driven. Then, you could have a shaman with a bunch of aa's getting great focus effects, and as they are aa driven it wouldn't matter what gear they had. A raiding shaman could have the choice of grinding the extra aa or waiting for a drop with the effect. This kind of idea for aa progression might work, although I think it will make the non-raider feel that they are having to spend aa on things just to keep up.<br />
<br />

<br />
Yep, but its the evolution of the game. I am still a noob compared to some of you old timers, but even I have to crack a wry smile when I see someone go from the hedge maze to raiding potimeb in about 8 days. Granted their gear will suck for a while, but that kind of piggy backing and racing through content on the back of others efforts is laughable.<br />

<br />
I know everyone wants to think that you don't need much more than a pulse to be outstanding at EQ but there is an element of skill involved. Not skill as in clay pigeon shooting, or golf, but in anticipation, reaction, reacting the best way, executing your plan correctly. Shoot me for this but if there was no element of skill at all why are some players avoided and others sought after. There are times in the game when things occur and I look at the group and realize that they are very skillful players, and that my own in game experience was just heightened by being around them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Not everyone, just the ones who seem to want the game handed to them on a platter. I know you are not like this. <br />
<br />
I am glad you realize this. I might disagree with you, but I certainly don't want the game handed to anyone. I like EQ because it is hard. It's annoying as hell sometimes, but there are those little moments that just make you realize why you play. If you don't have those then it's time to quit. While I am having less of them now, I still get them occasionally.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I think that there can be multiple paths to progress by, and choosing one should not close another. Have effects attainable by aa for the grinder, and have effects on gear for the raider. BUT, don't tie base functionality to aa. No shaman, from BoT to Kod'Taz should have to suffer from a different base heal, or resists on a slow. <br />
For what its worth I absolutely agree with you on the amount of aa making a player better. I guess my point is that a non raiding shaman will probably have a much higher probability of being close to maxed out healing aa than a raiding shaman (moi). I would be irritated if a new tree came out and I was suddenly 25aa from starting to improve my base heals for example.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I agree with this as long as it is not detrimental to those who are flagged. <br />
Honestly, IMHO, I think it gives folks who choose not to raid a chance to be ALMOST as good as Raid equiped players through AA. But also remember, while people who raid a ton may not make as MUCH XP, they still make XP. I have 200, and I rarely push-grind. <br />
I see the problem, I just don't agree with the proposed solution. There should be less of a disparity in the focus effects available, but I would prefer to have those kinds of things be aa driven.

This kind of idea for aa progression might work, although I think it will make the non-raider feel that they are having to spend aa on things just to keep up.<br />
This is almsot exactly what I am talking about though. Also, when you start factoring in Tribute, which is REALLY quite economical and simple to use (heck, go clean out Sol A, farm the FS, trib the drops, shrug, easy as pie) then everyone really has a path to a DARN solid character without the current &quot;walls&quot; we have now. The Raid shaman can get that much more efficient for his enviroment, and the non-raid shaman has a chance to get some nice abilities with his &quot;extra&quot; aaxp. It seems win-win to me. I think if you ask most non-raiding players, they dont MIND spending time to keep up, but they cant keep up now. Ask most Raiders what the problem are, and they will tell you they are JUST a teensy bit ineffective enough to contribute effectively. Adding the ability to grow to both class of player sounds fair. <br />
I am still a noob compared to some of you old timers, but even I have to crack a wry smile when I see someone go from the hedge maze to raiding potimeb in about 8 days. Granted their gear will suck for a while, but that kind of piggy backing and racing through content on the back of others efforts is laughable.<br />
Thats just it, and honestly it applies at all levels. I raid, but I am in a slower paced, more family style guild. We arent the speediest through content, but we have a solid membership. We play a lot. We raid a lot. We hang together in groups a lot. There is nothing wrong with content skippers. Personally, I could care less what ANYONE else has. But I want to be able to maintain MY effectiveness in MY enviroment, and I am starting to have difficulty doing that. Xegoney raid the other night was great. 3 shaman, 1 to RGC the MA, 2 others to slow and malos the adds as the waves come in, and guard the chanters when the inattentive break mez. I felt EXTREMELY useful. Then, Fennin Ro, I feel like a baby brother at the Drive IN with my older brother and his date. Yeah, I Bane Fennin, wee. Bane, heal heal heal, so what. NOt like the MA ever got under 80 anywy, guy has 12K hps and 3K ac or something. I dunno. Little extra damage, or healing, and I would be doing SOMETHING. But my mesly 80 dps and 1400-1700 heals didnt even seem to help. <br />
I know everyone wants to think that you don't need much more than a pulse to be outstanding at EQ but there is an element of skill involved. Not skill as in clay pigeon shooting, or golf, but in anticipation, reaction, reacting the best way, executing your plan correctly.

There are times in the game when things occur and I look at the group and realize that they are very skillful players, and that my own in game experience was just heightened by being around them.<br />
EQ definitely has a fairly decent skill factor. I am not saying its TOTALLY simple. But, the less skilled players can easily hide in guilds. LDoN certainly showed people for what kind of skill player they were, especially those first few weeks of it. I had people in my own guild I groaned when I saw in the group, heh. But honestly, if you are half competent and have time, you can advance, easily. You can go from 1-65 and 500 aa and never enter a dungeon. Just the nature of the game.<br />
I think that there can be multiple paths to progress by, and choosing one should not close another. Have effects attainable by aa for the grinder, and have effects on gear for the raider. BUT, don't tie base functionality to aa. No shaman, from BoT to Kod'Taz should have to suffer from a different base heal, or resists on a slow. <br />
For what its worth I absolutely agree with you on the amount of aa making a player better. I guess my point is that a non raiding shaman will probably have a much higher probability of being close to maxed out healing aa than a raiding shaman (moi). I would be irritated if a new tree came out and I was suddenly 25aa from starting to improve my base heals for example.<br />
This is a legitimate point, but on the other side of the equation is that the &quot;functionality&quot; is attainable by everyone. Its not something that is divided like spells dropping in high-end zones, or the best of the best focus only on raid gear. You would be 25 aa from a better base heal, but honestly, dont YOU, and probably 90% of the rest of the raid shamans in the game, already have a bunch of healing AAs? I sure do. EP mobs hit hard and I like to keep my chantys alive (I let the wizards die though, if they get hit, they deserve it heh)<br />
<br />
I think the idea has merit, and should be considered. I dislike the artificial seperration we have now. I have no Gates spells, I have no time to get flagged for KT, I am struggling to raid enough nights to get a new item a month. But if I had a chance to better myself in a significant way with XP, it would make anyting seem more worthwhile, it would establish goals that are real, and achievable, no matter WHAT level I am playing at. And, best of all, anyone can do it. So my friend who hates to raid can become a 2K healer, without Marrs Gift. And my other friend can actually be a SOLID healer in his raids with Marrs. Everyone seems to win.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Also weather or not your playing fourty hours our ten your paying the same about and should be offered the same opportunities..<br />
How is having upgrades to spells tied to AA not offering EVERYONE the same opportunities? <br />
<br />
Currently, the game is VERY VERY divided, those who raid, and those who do not raid. The people who do not raid do not have the same opportunities as those who raid (not opening the &quot;why dont they just raid&quot; debate here).<br />
<br />
Also if you read my initial post, the method of balancing I am suggesting works fairly well on all levels of play. Higher end raid end-game characters can pursue AA that will balance them better for the content they are playing, while lower end non-raiding shaman can pursue AA that will give them increased abilities that they really do not have available through Focus, like Marrs Gift (compared to IH4) or Speed of Soulsec and Mith (compared to Spell Haste 4) or Preservation of Xegoney (compared to MP4) etc etc. <br />
<br />
Please do not sit there and tell me there is HUGE problems with the shaman class &quot;across the board&quot; either. While mid-range shamans indeed have SOME balance issues, the same can be said for almost every class. Shaman are EXTREMELY powerful in mid-raing content (low-mid PoP, High Luclin, mid-Gates) but their effectivness drops off exponentially the closer to the &quot;high end&quot; you get. This system, or one like it, would make EVERYONE able to pursue the path to the type of Shaman they wanted to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">First of all, tying enhancements that are required for good grouping late game to huge AA's is a bad idea, because it will further separate casuals and ubers, and take the raiders away from raiding due to the need to GRIND to be useful on those raids.<br />
<br />
And if you did this for us, you'd have to do it for everyone.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea and I see how you think it might be helpful, but it is not the best way to go about what you're trying to achieve, IMO.<br />
<br />
As for AA's VS focus, it would be nice to see Focus's that were as good as the IV's, but not as good as the named effects (i.e. Extended Enhancement IV vs Zephyr of Brell) enable-able as AA's.  Then, make the AA abilities NOT stack with items.  That way, you don't get extra for the AA's, but rather can access them as an alternative to riding 10-20 raids to have access to, if you are lucky, a single focus item... or doing something else like greed trading through item flipping (Esp an issue in FV with all the droppable stuffs).</div></div><hr />

Honestly I just do not see this as a legitimate arguement against this idea. Please explain how it will further seperate the non-raiders and the raiders. Please try to come up with ANYTHING different that DOESN'T further seperate the non-raider from the raider. All the alternatives I can think of to pump up the End Game shaman while maintaining SOME class balance at the middle and lower end are ALL completely biased toward the raider. Raiders get better gear. Raiders have better access to zones where spells drops. Raiders get better focus effects on gear. How do we begin to create system that will help BOTH sides yet still be viable on all levels of play?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The idea of advancement being tied to time is a terrible one.  <br />
<br />
The chance that anyone would buy any game if they knew that was its premise up front is next to nil.  Just try to imagine anyone picking up a box saying that the main way to advance in a game is to spend more time in it.<br />
<br />
Advancement should come through the application of intelligence and perhaps intelligence unorthodoxly applied.  Being smart enough to do things well and also finding out the shortcuts, the way to do things the best way possible in the shortest length of time, is the challenge for me.  Speed is an essential ingredient, and directly ties to the intelligence of the player as an objective measure of his ability to accomplish.  Merely spending time is no accomplishment at all; it's how you spend it and how little of it you need to spend to achieve your goals.  A game is not a longevity contest.  We're all going to die anyway, and I don't have to come to a game to do it in real time.  <br />
<br />
A further challenge comes in some games from putting my knowledge and insight and attempts to be clever and deceptive to work against others in some games, like say poker or chess.<br />
<br />
Merely plodding along using up time doesn't figure into my picture of mastery at all, and shouldn't be particularly rewarded.  Any fool can just use up all his time.  <br />
<br />
Indeed, in both games and sports, it isn't merely practicing that makes you accomplished; it's practicing the RIGHT way.  Using the right training and drills is not only better than using the wrong ones; using the wrong drills can keep you at the same level forever, or even make you worse the longer you do them.<br />
<br />
Yet though merely using up time is neither fun in itself nor challenging in the least, it should be made the major focal point of a game?<br />
<br />
What kind of accomplishment is that to celebrate -- that one merely spent more time than the other guy?  In every other situation I can think of, the more time you spend getting somewhere, the greater your failure.<br />
<br />
In games, I like that you start from an even playing field, where everyone can excel.  The rules are the same whether you're young or old, rich or poor.  The fun and accomplishment is available to everyone depending on their skill and application.<br />
<br />
Starting from that even playing field, I like to work at outsmarting other people and surpassing my own limitations, gaining knowledge and skill as fast as I can.  If I'm great at a game, it will go faster.  If I'm not, it will go slower.  But in no case will it be about time directly; it will be about my abillity to apply myself and achieve over time.<br />
<br />
Tying time closely to achievement is a recipe for boredom.  I doubt anyone will ever move a single game box off a shelf by telling them that their cleverness and intelligence will rank distantly behind their ability to just put in hours.<br />
<br />
That's the opposite of a game, or fun.  That's more like a dead-end job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Blarg, this kind of game atmosphere would be fantastic if there was a new, free expansion coming out every 2 months, but lets look at the realities of the situation in ANY online game, but especially EQ.<br />
<br />
The game is solved. They all are. Period. You cannot pump out enough content to keep &quot;skill&quot; as a highly influentual factor in advancement. After a while EVERYTHING becomes a grind, be it LDoN, XPing, farming pp for buying upgrades, raid-farming, etc etc. The newness of any event, zone, quest or camp becomes old in a rather short period of time, no matter what or where. <br />
<br />
What has EQ always been about? Reward for time spent, basically, up to a point. XPing isnt rocket science. Going after loot doesnt take a genius. <br />
<br />
This whole &quot;marketing&quot; arguement I see is completely ridiculous as well. EQ is ALREADY about massinve time-sinks. Do you see it written on the box? Get real,  no company is going to put the inattractive features of their game on the box. Here is something though, that MIGHT get put on the OoW box if this system was implemented:<br />
<br />
Advance along the path YOU choose! Shamans want to be better Healers? YOU can choose! Wizards want to have better Cold Damage? YOU follow that path! Clerics want more offensive power? YOU make that choice on YOUR character!<br />
<br />
I honestly though people like you, Blarg, and Snow and Iz and the other advocates for more equality between the raider and the non-raider would be somewhat open to this kind of idea. After all, isnt a &quot;linear path to progression regardless of playstyle&quot; what you are all asking for?<br />
<br />
See what I mean? Any good marketing company can take something that is relatively negative and spin it back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">After giving this some thought, I have come up with a few paths for other classes as well.<br />
<br />
Clerics - Better soloing tools (double attack, snare), or bigger nukes, or better buffing (increased spell haste, AC and hps on their buffs).<br />
<br />
Warriors - More AC, more +avoid, strikethourhg, etc effect, or more DPS output.<br />
<br />
Knights - better AC, more avoind, strikethrough, etc, a mini defensive AA, more DPS<br />
<br />
Necros - summon pet items, more nuking DPS, a group buff that matters, AE hp/mana regen<br />
<br />
Druids - better pet, better nuking focus, an HoT.<br />
<br />
Enchanters - Better pet, pet commands, better DOTs or better Nukes. <br />
<br />
Rogues - more soloing tools<br />
<br />
Wizards - toughie, they are kinda at the top of what they do. What do wizards want? More mana? More crits?<br />
<br />
Monks - Better DPS, better avoidancce, etc etc<br />
<br />
Mages - better pet items (no-drop of course), bigger nukes (tough one, though, they are close to wizards now arent they?) not sure, never really looked at the class.<br />
<br />
Remember, I am suggesting these be SUPER EXPENSIVE AA, the kind that you choose and thats where you are as a character. It would offer variations on each class in the &quot;definitive EQ roles&quot; of healing, tanking, and DPS. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I just cannot come up with many other solutions without TOTALLY re-doing a few classes COMPLETELY, seriously. I want solutions that are available to everyone. I want rewards based on time spent progressing (getting XP is progress). Heck people are argueing that the Raiders do not have time to XP as much, well tough. Make time, or dont be as effective. Suddenly the guy who chooses not to raid can be nearly as effective as the guy with 27 days played that got into a Time+ guild and got tons of drops in the 2nd week of membership because they were gonna rot anyway. <br />
<br />
I dunno. Got no answers to the problems. Someone on another thread said changes to one class effect balance with many other classes. We are a perfect example of that. BLs and Chanters are able to slow as well as we can, the differences are totally negligible. Our DOTs are not effective, and we havent gotten tools to keep up with the need for fast DPS, like Necro, Rangers and Monks did. Our healing looks like a drop of rain in a Lake of mob DPS. <br />
