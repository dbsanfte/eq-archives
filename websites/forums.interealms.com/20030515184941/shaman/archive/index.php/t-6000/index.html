<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping some of you could share your thoughts regarding how much resist gear to swap in for fights where resists are important.  You may have to think back to the days when your gear was ghetto and you actually needed a resist kit.  :)<br />
<br />
Two fights come to mind that I expect to do fairly soon:<br />
<br />
- Halls of Testing Dragons (aoe fire &amp; cold)<br />
- The final shaman epic fight (big aoe fire)<br />
<br />
and I could imagine that we may go up against something with an AoE fear at some point as well.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I have tons of resist gear and pretty good regular gear, but I don't quite know what balance to strike between my regular gear, my resist kit, magician summoned resist gear, and magician summoned focus items.<br />
<br />
I guess the answer might change depending upon what role I happen to be taking.  We have a 60 shaman, a 57 shaman, and a 55 shaman, any or all of which may show up for raids.  Generally, at least one of them is present.  Never been to HoT without the 60 shaman so far.<br />
<br />
Here's my magelo.  My default profile is my every day gear.  My &quot;resists&quot; profile is what it looks like if I sacrifice every other stat to go for max cold/fire/magic resists. <br />
<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=76054<br />
<br />
Last time I was in HoT, I ended up deciding to use neither of the diamond ring resist items, opting instead to use the spell haste mage focus for faster healing and the shadel bandit ring for HP/mana pool.  This was before the last set of resist changes though.<br />
<br />
Some kind of rule of thumb for situations where resists are important like 3 wis = 1 svFire = 20 hp = 20 mana = ....<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />
<br />
By the way, feel free to suggest upgrades I could make, both for resists and for every day gear.  I think I have about 20k in the bank.  But I'm mostly trying to get suggestions on how to swap around what I already have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">when doing ToV, I alway put all my best FR/CR resist gear on, AC/HP doesn't help much there since you will die fast if agro, and mob AE a lots especial wurm<br />
<br />
I carry my resist gear all time, include full set Blue Diamond/Diamond gear(earing,ring,bracer,helm,neck,mask), cloak of ice bear, Stone of morid, Frogok king crown</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I also max out FR and CR in HoT, HP will do you no good in here unless you need to cap out above the min for C5. But you will have full HP buffs so that will not be soley a product of your equip.<br />
<br />
Again I also carry as much resist gear as I can, you never know when you will need it and as a Shaman with STR buffs you have no excuse not too. I know one person who puts his stuff in the bank everytime, we do'nt wait for him anymore and lately he is still running to the bank when we are engaging the likes of Sev or Gonaire. The lifespan of these guys is usually measured in minutes on Brell like every other server.<br />
<br />
As for resist equip, I have a terrible mem for items and can never be assed lookign stuff up so I can only tell you what I use. I also have only so-so resist equip so I can only offer a couple of suggestions.<br />
<br />
Stone or Mordid (Range)<br />
Totemic Legs (or something with resists that you can wear)<br />
RE boots (or something with resists that you can wear)<br />
Lodizal Shield (Back)<br />
BD ears<br />
Ice Belt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">For doing HoT I have gotten 2 items that help alot for reducing dmg.  Stone of Morid and Crown of Froglock Kings.  Those 2 raise my cr/fr by 50.  With dru buffs and gear I was able to hit almost 250. I think that is good considering I am a non uber shaman, and raid alot less than I used to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When doing ToV dragons (not HoT...dragon allies are lame), I always swap for an SBS, froggie crown, BD earring, golden diamond mask. That works great on regular AEs.<br />
<br />
If it is a *major* AE, then I have some other stuff I use. My resist bag currently consists of a full 10 slot, and a partial 10 slot, about 14 items in total. I even keep a crested mistmoore shield for Hoshkar/Zlexak, and other annoying PR/DR mobs like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Also, keep in mind where to stand to avoid the AE<br />
<br />
works just as good as high resists )<br />
<br />
Good luck in HoT )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye i dont rilly worry about risists for HOT my self just stand behind the wall and pop your head out every now and then for a Slow or a debuff and with bard song and druid buff you can raise all you ressist buy 160 or so, even with no ressist items on i can get them all about 200 anyway<br />
<br />
now if your a mele its a bit difrent but im not so i dont worry about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You don't have to sacrafice totally; look into getting yourself a Earring of the Solstice, good resists and you get nice hit points mana stamina, etc....on Karana a full set will cost you 8-10kish, the real expensive item being the Robe and the Golden Idol. <br />
As far as other gear, I suggest picking up a Stone of Morid for your ranged slot, the 20 cold/fire it packs is well worth the price, and by using it your not costing yourself a lot stat wise; also look into picking up a few of the Diamond face masks, again not too huge a stat loss but a nice pick up in resists.<br />
Your already packing most of the better resist items in most of your slots, at least as far as running around gear goes. The SBS is uber cheap on Karana now, I can remember looting one while soloing at the Chardok entrance when I was level 51...heheh a group at the jail had just gotten one to drop and they all had one :-P...this was when it was a 10K + item. Now you can't sell them for more than 750pp, and usually far less (paladin friend got one for 350pp the other day).....sigh what Bazaar has done to the economey.</div></div><hr />
