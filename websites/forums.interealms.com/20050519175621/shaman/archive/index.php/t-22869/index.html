<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A lot of discontent across all boards; with what SOE has done with EQ.<br />
Do they even care? Lots of sarcastic remarks against them, do they not get concern? Sure they held summits to &quot;rectify&quot; our issues, but like what most of us agree. They are things that should have been rectified AGES ago. And even then, those are stuffs which SOE has nothing to brag about.<br />
<br />
Here they are releasing expansions one after another. I am sure most of us arent' even done with LDON, let alone GOD. And now Oow. How long can they continue milking the EQ reputation? Do they even listen to the consumers? Its down to my last few months of subscription. I will most likely end it once and for all. It has become a point where i just couldnt care less about EQ anymore.<br />
<br />
But i doubt they even care if i voice out my anger. <br />

Short answer....<br />
<br />
No.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I only have one concern with EQ.  I only play EQ for LDoN now.  My concern with the next expansion is what is it going to do towards my LDoN play.  I am fearing less and less people will be playing LDoN and EQ will be less and less the game I want to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">But...I will buy GoD and keep playing. Because , if I buy GoD, I can get to level 70 and then ..and ONLY THEN ...will I be able to play in GoD zones. I see links all the time for drops from those zones and I'd love to have them , but I can't survive there yet. <br />
Do I like the fact that I will have to buy the NEXT expansion to play in the LAST expansions zones??? NO !! But, it won't do any good to complain because they don't care as long as they get the money:(<br />
I can hear them now...ALL HAIL THE ALMIGHTY BUCK !</div></div><hr />

If SOE provides LDoN adventures for characters up to level 70 then people will keep playing them. Their convenience and good loot make then very attractive for players who have a life outside EQ.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd be more worried about WoW and EQ 2. EQ is five years old. Although it is still a great game, there is a new generation on the horizon. EQ will survive, just as it survived DAoC and CoH, but, with all the general discontent, I can see a initial outflux of people, even if most of them realise they are jaded with MMORPGs in general and that brand new games are not going to automagically be perfect examples of stable content and game balance! :-)</div></div><hr />

Their business model is to come out with two expansions a year.  There's no way to do quality work on that kind of schedule.</div></div><hr />

Agree, not only that, but they have locked themselves into this loop by continuing to adhere to it. Higher end guilds MOW through content these days, unless, in the case of Gates, half of it is broken and the other half is geared for level 70. This is how they are trying to slow players down? Broken content and obscene tuning? Its no wonder half the &quot;non-raider&quot; targeted content looks like it was coded by some pimple-faced 20 year old who just got out of college. <br />
<br />
Heres a clue SOE, try to create some GOOD content, where people ENJOY logging in, and WANT to play.</div></div><hr />

Nah, they've been given clues in the past, have they listened to the &quot;good ideas&quot;? You be the judge.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well enjoyable gameplay has to come into the equation at some point or peeps will stop playing.  That is why I push so hard on these boards to promote fixing the annoying issues (like FA duration and canny canny canny).<br />
<br />
So I would rank it enjoyable gameplay #1, phat loot #2 for most people.  Enjoyable gameplay includes not LFG for entended periods of time.<br />

These aren't hard, they are a challenge. I have approx. 4470 unbuffed HP, I have like 3 pieces of EP gear and no Time Gear. Do I live all the time? No. Here is my complaint with most people who say &quot;I can't go to GoD&quot; Get in a guild that can help you get the gear you need to make it to GoD now. Stop expecting people to just hand things to you and then whine when SoE says &quot;Here is level 70 so you an go to GoD&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bearchest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think some people tend to forget  SoE is a business and like all businesses they are out to make a buck.  If they keep making money off of EQ it will remain open. <br />
<br />
I know Im not going to EQ2 for one reason only. I put too much into my chars in EQ and it would almost be like abandoning a family member. As twisted up as that seems</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, too bad some people don't have time for that, but have just as much of a right to new content as those that do have time for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">GoD is ugly, sucky and boring at the end. You always see the same mob, the same crappy walls, the same crappy desert, except mobs are hitting harder and harder. Most tactics are known (if not in top end guild), and it is not that hard to find them, apply them and succeed.<br />
<br />
Txevu is as fun as VT is, excpet mobs kills you in 2sec, even with 10k hp buffed. The strengh of EQ is the 'virtual' friends you can have, but now that they are gone for me, i no longer want to get through that ****ty content :). EQ is not for casual gamers, unless you re LDoN addicted wich i doubt with no new challenge since 1 year.<br />
<br />
I wish you good luck, EQ is really getting old, they try to fix things that cannot be without destroying the game completely. EQ is missing novelties other MMORPG will certainly bring  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is about 75% of my gameplay, too. I do lots of LDoNs, since I see that as easy to put together quickly, do quickly, and either log out or keep going, based on other issues. Nice, discreet units where you accrue points for gear.<br />
<br />
The other 25% is raiding with my 'family' guild. We do great, are getting new people, and will likely advance on Sontalak and AoW this month. Not bad for a guild where raid attendance is optional. I think we've found a niche, a guild for people who like to get together and raid, but don't have to when they don't want to. <br />
<br />
I hope Sony realizes that there are a lot of us in this position; however, even at current growth, it will probably take my guild another year or more to make our way through all of the Luclin and Tier-2 content; we only raid about twice a week, and the targets we want to hit aren't always up when we're on.<br />
<br />
So, yeah, I've preordered OoW, and will continue to play. Even with all the shortcomings. And yeah, for me it's all about the friendships, and meeting challenges with your friends. Better gear helps you and your friends move on to more challenging content, no matter where in the continuum you are presently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I haven't been playing for a couple of months and am kind of surprised at how little I miss it.  Like, not 10%, or 5%, or 3 or 2%. Not even 1%.  Which is not to say EQ is the same for everyone, but I'm surprised that my desire to play it is actually 0%.  No anger, or anything like that.  Just zero interest.  Sort of a been-there, done-that thing, I guess.</div></div><hr />

I think, in essence that your statement of &quot;get in a guild that can help you get the gear you need&quot; is rather simplistic, and not entirely thought out. Getting into a guild is not that easy these days. On your server, guilds may actively open their arms to undergeared peeps and take them on whirlwind shopping sprees in the Elementals and Tier 2 GoD zones, but on Karana, you have to have a damn near full set of flags, have good gear and good AA before most raid guilds will touch you with a 10 meter cattle prod.<br />
There are people that have those things that will and do apply, they go and earn DKP, raid points, etc for thier drops and earn upgrades as they can, but they dont get tons of upgrades very fast.<br />
Then you have people that play at odd hours for what would be optimal for their time zone, such as me. I work 8pm EST till 8am EST as a ER RN, I work 4 days a week. On my days off I spend my time with my lovely wife and child. When do I play? 9am-1ishpm EST, sometimes later. On Karana I essentially have 3 choices guild wise, any number of French/Euro guilds, while they are nice and I do know of 1-2 that would likely take me, I really dont fit in. My French is about as weak as it can be and that would make it unfair for the guilds to basically give me an interpreter to lead me around. My other options are the Asian guilds (again Language barrier). There are 1-2 other options that are raid capable, but I dont have the flag requirements. So I stay in a family guild that casually raids, have as much fun as I can when I can, but I do want more, but LDON is my &quot;end game&quot; for now, and there are a lot more like me than most high end raiders want to admit.<br />
Then there are the people that simply dont want to raid, but do want to go do new things. They want to bring groups of friends and give Vxed. Sewers, etc a try, but they cant as they simply dont have either the firepower or the beefy tank or the crazy charmin chanter.<br />
Saying &quot;go get in a guild&quot; is sorta like saying go get a job. The statement is simple, the underlying meaning and process is very complex.</div></div><hr />
