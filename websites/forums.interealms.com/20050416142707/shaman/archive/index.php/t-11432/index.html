at 49 I was able to solo both bards/nobles with a C3. No horse no jbb (ikky) had a regen bp though. You just have to be quick about things =) just wait for isabella to path through and kill her, med to full and then split the bards. med to full again and try to split the nobles. after its split you wont have much time to med between pops but with Stoicism it shouldnt be too bad now<br />
