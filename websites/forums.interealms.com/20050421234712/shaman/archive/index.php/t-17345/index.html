<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gobblok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, you can solo easy there.<br />
<br />
Allways pull with your latest Malo(sia) run back to your campspot (wich should be zonein), Pet on mob and slow it.<br />
After that feel free to Dot, Nuke.<br />
<br />
Mob should be slowable even if Malo(sia) is resisted.<br />
<br />
Some Mobs you should care of:<br />
<br />
Golems are nearly 100% to spells, you better avoid them ( i cant even slow them with malos on them)<br />
<br />
Clerics have CH, so watch your manapool during the fight. If you get low, just Canni / heal  pet.<br />
<br />
You must be in melleerange to cast on the bonedragons.<br />
<br />
You pet can solo ALL mobs but golem when you are low on mana, it just takes some time.<br />
<br />
And at least you can single pull all mobs (i did solo there with 58 and it was pretty easy).<br />
<br />
Happy hunting</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Farrdaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">the hate stone is available in Neriak in the Cleric's guild building.  The merchant is non-kos and is across the hall from the spawn point of the enc epic mob.  even if your a good race you can purchase there just need invis to get down and time the guards.  one of the 2 port stones is also available in the pok library from one of the wizard vendors.  I just find it easier to use erudian/neriak on my wiz when i want one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm pretty sure you can magic-slow the golems in hate, they're just very very resistant. To the extent its not worth bothering with. Maybe I'm wrong, just going on my (rather hazy) memory.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps with a chanter who tashed too, but solo you dont even have the chance to stick malosinia on the golem.<br />
<br />
Otherwise they dont hit hard, with Q, Torpor, or even stoicism you can tank them untill dogdog did its job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">How are gem drops up there compared to say, pre-nerf PoG or the bugs in seb??  And all that's been written in this thread is in regards to the revamped hate, I take it?  Have things changed that much?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes things have changed that much...anywhere close to zone in to hate is sickly easy.  when i say easy, i mean you can pritty much stand on top of mobs without agroing them, wizards can tank the stuff slowed without needing heals and 1bane+1anth+1bos take most mobs to 1 or 2% in about 45 seconds...<br />
gem drops are not that bad, especialy since you can turn in the armor for gems.  it is by no means are cash drops as good as renurf pog, but about = to the cash you can get from seb.<br />
only mobs i don't bother with are the clerics, golems and skelly dragons...i don't like switching spells up and i don't like the rare knock back healers hit me with when they spend all their mana nukeing me.<br />
<br />
give hate a shot now, i promis you will be bored out of your mind and will be tanking mobs x2 unslowed to spice things up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do ya pull the mobs off the bridge/raised area just to the right of the zone/port in?   I got all 4 mobs on me when I tried, this was quite awhile ago though -  a few weeks after the update went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">they never added for me if i pull with a nondamage spell.  agro range is very very small in there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kaluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">To be clear, this in reference to the old plane of hate, via the wizard spires?<br />
<br />
Can it be reached now without a wizard port?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wizard still has to port you up, but i think the stones cost less now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaluden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From other shamans that have played in this zone, with Bane / Saryrn / Quin (Malo, not Malos), would you say this is a fairly soloable area now?  I've got about 4800 HP (buffed) and around 1050 AC, semi good gear (non elem).<br />
<br />
I've been reading up on a few quests that require this zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">FYI the vendors that sell the reagent for the wizard port to hate in Erudin and Neriak wont sell to Frogloks or Bears. Found this out last night. Another good use for our newly acquired shared bank/pp slots :)</div></div><hr />

Should be able to. I went up at 64. soloed just find. Clerics are a pain not because of heals as much as chain nuking me and my pet. But it is doable. Pulled with slow and not 1 resist, would Bane of Nife. Root. let the pet handle business. Re-Bane of Nife and throw in jbb. usually took me about 15-25% mana to drop each mobs. it is slow. Exp ain't shabby tho. 5-6 solo kills was a percent in 64 and i don't think thats too bad.<br />
<br />
Anyhow. it is a nice change from BoT and HoH, PoV and PoS. drop rate sux in my opinion. would venture to say KC or Seb still better.<br />

<br />
I usually go up with kei, stay till it fades.  I'm confident against anything near zi except Clerics and Golems.  I avoid golems, because I don't have the hps to keep going..  Clerics i'll pull if they are in the way, but generally don't bother, CH and Chain Nuking is kind of a pain.<br />
<br />
Also, I've found, the specter mobs are easier to pull with a dot, and then slow while they are still inc.  Not sure why, but they seem to cast less when there is dmg actually being done to them.</div></div><hr />
