<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Soloable? Duoable with a lowby cleric there with 4 or 5 CH's available?<br />
<br />
My fiance just got to this part of her epic quest - I think it's doable (he hits for 585 max I believe, with a ~300 dmg proc or AE), but I don't wanna lose all her work if I fail either.<br />
<br />
I also have a 52 monk with epic and SoFW that can help with dps a bit - and she can play her 65 rogue too if needed.<br />
<br />
Has anyone tried this?<br />
<br />
My gear can be seen in my sig - 6khp raid buffed and ~1320ac iirc. I also have all pre-ldon dots and Bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its been a while since i did this, but i seem to remember slow landing after i did malosini, and after that its not a big deal to kill him.  I would say you'd be better off getting a couple people to help just to make it go down faster, but assuming you pulled with malos it shouldnt be rough.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you could probably heal yourself :) so dont see healing as being any concern.<br />
<br />
I would recommend grabbing a druid fire resistance buff before trying.</div></div><hr />

If he just doubles for 585, then yes, easily - but if he quads like some people say, I don't know for sure. I would just try it but after she spent over 20something hours total camping gimblox (sp?), I'd hate to fail and make her cry just because I was too lazy to do my research ahead of time :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grab a couple of friends.<br />
<br />
Yours truly made the mistake of going into this one underprepared for a friend. After the ensuing wipeout (this was 2 years ago) we were ALL a tad miffed and depressed. (And moi, who had camped all that crap was out 20 hours +)<br />
<br />
Think my friend quit EQ for DAOC shortly afterward.<br />
<br />
Better safe than sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just did him with a raid force. I was just tagging along. I managed to land a cripple on the fourth try, my level was only 52. The other shaman landed a slow, Both got promptly summoned, and killed after landing spells. I believe he quads, not sure tho, he mowed me down pretty quick. Hit me for upwards to 500, mean number 300 something. Took 6-8 hits to kill me. My ac was 1000 and hps 2500 something at the time.<br />
<br />
However, note that I was only 52... You might find it a different experience at 65. The raid force was around 10 people between 40 and 60. and we brought him down after he was slowed. Took a while to land it tho for the other shaman too.<br />
<br />
If you can slow him from the onset you might be good. One phat tank might be a good idea tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You should be able to tank him easily, and with a CH cleric backing up, atleast with your AA's and gear.<br />
<br />
What you might want to bring is some extra DPS ie that 65 rogue, otherwise it might take a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like most of the failures involved folks that weren't yet 65 at the time, or a couple of years ago when a shaman with the abilities we have now would have been insanely godlike. I'll probably grab a tank though, just because I really, really, really don't want to have to camp that tool again for her :)<br />
<br />
I'll ask him to step in if I get owned though - cause I want to see if I can do it :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Please let us know how it goes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hrmm, Ixiblat Fer is a tad tough if he's unslowed.<br />
<br />
I'll tell you about one duo that works, if you can get the people: 65 shaman + 65 bard.<br />
<br />
Have the bard run Ixi around til he's good and angry, then malos/turgur/cripple Ixi.  Run around til Ixi is back on the bard.  Then have the bard dot kite Ixi, in an orbit around you.  He will get summoned, but you will also be in range to Quiescence him.  Since Ixi is slow, he will only get a few hits in every time he summons (and you can use your Q's and tnarg's to heal those hits), but every other time it's just like a dot kite.<br />
<br />
We used a similar strategy before we tried the duo, when we brought a raid force to kill Ixi and wiped because I couldn't get slow off.  Our second try was successful because we had the bard run Ixi around while an enchanter tashani'd and I tried to malos/turgur/cripple it, and then we engaged.<br />
<br />
The whole issue imo is getting that sucker slowed and crippled.  If you get resisted and can't run off having someone else get agro without getting hurt, you're in trouble.  Unless your tank is uber.  Once he's debuffed, he's like a baby with a manual stapler, rather than a baby with a staple gun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just think of IF as a pov golem without the proc, and Kunark era atk level. The most recent time I killed him was probably around a year ago with 3-4 people (don't remember), all 60/+ (don't remember the level range either). It took very little effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nerun,<br />

I can load up Kryss for you to get this done. Wa-la. 6.5k gimp pallytank.<br />

EDIT: Because spelling is hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Talk to me in game. I cna load up Kryssniall for this.<br />
<br />
Outstanding, thanks bud :D<br />
<br />
I'll get with you after raid time tonight if you're on :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll be there. I can finally change my signature, too! /grin<br />
<br />
I'll run the gimpass out to BW while we raid. Gogo second PC!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">soloable if you get him slowed without too many resists,<br />
BUT<br />
<br />
have a crew there to kill him in case you fail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Well as all summoning mobs they wont summon you till you do damage.  Just pull with malo then either root him (NON-Damage type) then go to town on debuffs.  This the way I would pull guardians in the low 60's that summon.  Only thing you ming need is a healer to follow close behind to keep you healed if the is a heavy caster.  Though once you get your resists debuffs land it should not be too hard to get the rest of you spells to land.  Just remember to do no damage to him till you have all your debuffs applied.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">i did this VERY easily with 1 cleric 1 mage and me.<br />
<br />
I wouldnt solo it. Frankly i dont know if it can be done, his damage output is higher then our sustainable healing output i think and its a long fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Done him a couple times.  He's easily slowable especially after malo.  Last time with 3 grps he went down faster than a cop on a donut.  Still, better safe than sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, I tried it last night with my monk and bethiana's pally there to back me up... honestly, tanking him is no big deal. He appears to double for ~575 max, but most hits landed in the 300 range. Slowing him was easy. The only problem was, I got resist after resist on pretty much every dot except bane (which was resisted enough in itself that I stopped using it in favor of healing) and epic - even fully debuffed.<br />
<br />
So, after tanking him for a couple of minutes, I said screw it, I don't wanna lose this for her, and called in beth's pally and brought the monk around.<br />
<br />
The fight took forever (like 10 minutes) but my monk isn't so great yet cause he's only lvl 52. By that time I was at like 40 mana from trying to land dots on him and see what landed, but I basically healed for most of the fight except a couple of CHs, and ran the monk. Was easy to do with melee damage.<br />
<br />
So, if you really felt like having the dog chew him up for like an hour, he'd probably be soloable. It's all a question of whether or not you have that much time on your hands I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">He also either procced or AEd, but Kryss was getting nuked for 200s here and there. Stunnable with two of my stuns. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I was also an idiot and forgot to put Aura of the Crusader on until halfway through the fight, so I missed out on some HPs and mana regen :p<br />
<br />
I didn't even use LoH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Since he's a fire mob, did you try to Cold Nuke him?<br />
<br />
If Cold lands well, id find a nice corner to back up into and bracer him to kingdom come...  :cool:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah, I had already burned like 60% of my mana testing MR, DR, and PR... I just wanted the fight over with.<br />
<br />
Cold &quot;should&quot; land well on him though. Between that and the dog he would be soloable.</div></div><hr />

Yah, targetted AE with 30' range. I mostly resisted it, so I forgot to mention it :o<br />
<br />
Neruns (the monk) didn't get hit once by the AE cause I was careful to stay away from kryss with him.</div></div><hr />

GL getting that done in the next month :(<br />
<br />
I gave up on that faction a long time ago, even though I farm droga like mad I am still not above scowling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, atop factioning I also buy other's Salts and Skins. I have about 60k left in the bank. So I buy up all the salts and skins in bazaar and head to Chardok once a week. And if I AA there for the next month, I'll be done no problem. <br />

I just have to figure out why I get such a poor framerate.</div></div><hr />
