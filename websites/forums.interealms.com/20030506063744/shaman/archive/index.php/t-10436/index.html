<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fangface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just moved from Tunare to VS with the big movelog that happened after the patch.  Unfortunately, I didn't load up on gear before the move and there are very slim pickings on this relatively new server.  I'm also running into a problem that I have never before had, a complete lack of people to group with.  I was hoping that you guys could look at my gear and suggest some area that I can solo without some high degree of risk.  I'd also love suggestions as to what equipment I might be able to pick up myself, since I know some pieces I own are lacking, such as my legs.  Again, there isn't much offered in the bazaar on this new server, wish I'd have picked up my JBB before the movelog.<br />
