<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok I'm looking for your ideas about what will be (is) your challenges as a shammy lvl60/torpor/epic/jbb no malo.<br />
 not great gear.<br />
<br />
Looking for hot fights and good rewards:<br />
<br />
 i did the dragons stuff in WW but the drops aren't what i'm looking for.<br />
<br />
<br />
About the Emp in Seb. is it possible for me to try this ?<br />
how do you break your way to his room ? I saw many things about how to kill him but nothing on how to go to him solo.<br />
<br />
I'm looking mainly for fights to have a chance to get some upgrades for my gear but don't have much ideas.<br />
<br />
Anything good in Akheva ?<br />
<br />
thanks to share your ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you might be able to camp through the first door and solo your way to the protectors.  you can run past that room without agro if you stay in the middle, then solo to the tomb door and camp through....camping through doors is iffy, sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't.  you need to note if you using invis vs undead potions to get down there, some things see invis anyway =/<br />
if you want a tough fight this isn't it.  pop trash mobs are harder than he is.  go solo a GW if you want a tough fight.  the risk is a lot higher than the reward for a solo encounter, but the risk is half the fun...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For soloing Emp this post has about everything you need to know:<br />

As far as the crypt goes, it is actually very easy to do solo. All you need is a rogue to open the door for you. Its easy to get down to the crypt after that, if you are level 65 you can just run all the way down without agroing anything, if you do have to fight down its very easy, at level 60+ everything will be single pulls, nothing is a hard fight, just kill stuff one by one all the way down to the crypt. <br />
<br />
Now when you get to the crypt entrace (the steps leading down), wait for that froggie (or cube if your lucky) to path to you and kill him before going into the crypt. then just invis yourself and walk into one of the rooms, solo the named/PH, invis up and go into the next room (on the same side) and do the same. Now when you go across the room it is very important that the frog that wonders into the crypt does not see you, you may have to wait until he moves out of the crypt before you cross, otherwise he will see your invis and you will have to gate or die. Its actually not hard at all I was doing it at level 60 pre-POP. One thing to remember is that the names do run so keep em perma rooted at like 20 percent. Also don't under-estimate the names, after killing a bunch of PH's the names are a lot harder, just make sure you play it safe and don't do anything stupid. uUm, not much else I can think of, kind of a fun camp to solo and you could walk away with a JBB or herio cloak, it will get boring though and you will go through a lot of dry spells with no names. exp sucks, even at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">See how far in chardok you can get, either route (mines or palace).  By far my favorite zone :)<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
Theres not much gear to be had in chardok solo though.  Theres a few decent shm pieces I guess and you can get lucky on cash drops.  One run down I got two BD's, the dru/wiz evac staff and a greenish metal shard (iks sk epic piece).  Not bad, bout 10k total.<br />
<br />
Chardok is all about multiple mob management hehe, I think you would have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">eh good advices (thx for the link btw)<br />
<br />
tried G.W.... best I did was one with 70percent HPs left.I guess it will be better with our puppy 61.<br />
<br />
about Chardok, except zone in/out I don't have much experience there. do mobs dispell there ?<br />
<br />
Gonna work on this guide about crypt now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The upper tunnel in chardok is a blast at 60. It goes on forever, almost everything is dark blue and you can single pull everything at that level. Two BoNs + pet kill is all you need to kill most mobs and it's very good xp.<br />
<br />
The upper tunnel is located at the gatehouse. If you look up and to your left you'll see it. You need to levitate yourself and run up from either ZO or the inclined area near the gatehouse to reach the tunnel. There's one mob right there to greet you then everything else after that is in pairs but single pullable at 60.<br />
<br />
I went back there at 61 to show some guildmates. Was mostly light blues until we  got to the first Y section where from that point about 75% of the mobs were dark blue to me and excellent XP. Not the greatest loot in the world but a lot fun if you prefer dungeons over the boring outdoors like me.<br />
<br />
If you are looking for pure loot then look no further than PoG. Read Urdegish's excellent guide a few threads down about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Chardok you will want some resist pieces and probably to keep your mr/cr/fr buffed.  At 60 you can single pull very much of the zone until you start getting to mines and taskmaster area.<br />
