<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Akaran_D</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pretty sure the magelo's for both are in my sig.<br />
Truthfully, I'm just looking for a good place / zone where the combonation shaman slows, buffs, dots and paladin DPS will be able to take out mobs with ease or moderate difficulty. The only problem I'm having with this duo now is that I'm relying on my paladin for all the healing power, outside of regen spells - my 900pt healing over time beats the heck out of stoicism and the other shaman heals till about 58... and that's a long 8 levels. I imagine I will probably be unable to continue &quot;just duoing&quot; at about level 54 or so until 58 when the shaman gets her heals, but until that point..<br />
<br />
Zone suggestions would be welcome.<br />
I just moved out of Dulak as the mobs I was killing had started to give substantially less exp (the huts and south side boats) than what I had been used to. I am giving serious thought to Nadox, but I'm afraid of the downtime there.<br />
<br />
Thank you.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am in about the same situation with a 63 pally/52 shaman.  51 and 52 so far have been kinda just hit here and there for me so far.  I did most of 51 in Karnor's.. not a lot per kill but I could basically keep all the left and right courtyards clean.  I also did some Seafuries to get cash but that was basically soloing the shaman until half dead and havign paladin smack it down the last 40%.  Just some ideas but looking for a good spot at 52.  I CAN do trash in PoN pretty easy but slow can be hard to land sometimes because the trash varies from dark blue to yellow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drajjen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go to the pit in Jagged Pine.  Once there follow this strat.<br />
<br />
Once you fall down in the pit immediatly back up against the wall.  Directly in front of you will be a Darkpaw Gnoll (either a warrior, necro, shaman, or cleric type).  They will not aggro even if you don't have invis on.  There aggro radius is actually rather small.<br />
<br />
Once down call dogdog on the shaman and buff him up with HOS, STM, Guardian, regen, and haste (or use some of the big pally buffs, since pets are not effected by the nerf).  Med to full.  <br />
<br />
Make sure the Pally is NOT in the group.<br />
<br />
Cast root on the gnoll, slow, and then send in dogdog, and wait till the gnoll is around 88-90% health then cast EBolt.  Gnolls health will start going down quite fast and even if root breaks he shouldn't aggro you.<br />
<br />
Now once the mob gets to around 60% health send in the Pally to beat the crap out of him until dead.  The combination of Ebolt and the dog will still ensure that you get all the xp.  At your lvl you will get at least 1 to 2% xp per kill.  You will continue to gain that much until at least 54.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Once that mob is dead move up the tunnel and you will see another gnoll at the very front of it.  Pull him with slow and let him run to you and start beating on you.  When dog attacks slowly start moving back and you will lose aggro quickly.  Then rinse and repeat with EB and  the Pally.<br />
<br />
The next gnoll is just a short way away from where the the second one was.  He paths back and forth over a short little area, pull him with slow as well and rinse and repeat the strat you been using.<br />
<br />
The last gnoll is above the last one you killed at the higest point in the big room, pull him with slow and repeat strat.<br />
<br />
Although there are quite a few more gnolls in the big room this is about all of them you can do before the first one will repop in the tunnel.  (could probably do one more if you have a horse/leezard).<br />
<br />
At any rate, I used this strat to get my shaman to lvl 56 but my partner was a monk.  The xp will slow down a lot at 55 but it's great before that.<br />
<br />
Dangers.<br />
<br />
Truthfully there is not really any danger at all providing you use the strat I outlined.  The only moderatly tough fights is when you get the necro mobs.  They will stack several dots on you and lifetap.  I usually kept my two talismans (shadoo, and the other can't remember the name atm) on myself and the monk and I resisted almost everytime.<br />
<br />
LOOT<br />
<br />
Not much in the way of Bazaar stuff, though you could probably sell the gnollish ring for a bit.  And since you have been in Dulak for so long the plat you will see might be a little less than that, but not by to much.  The gnolls drop around 4-6pp every kill, and weapons that sell like fs (good for dogdog).<br />
<br />
At any rate, the Gnolls are easy to get too and not very hard but will get you at least to lvl 54 very quickly.<br />

Any other suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ShammmyMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm, if your looking for exp + cash just sit at seb ent have the pal clear all of the mobs up. Trust me if you get one of the nice camps like Disco or guard or something, thats alot of gem drops + named dropping stuff. Also you have a chance of ODS or RBG. But this is just imo.</div></div><hr />
