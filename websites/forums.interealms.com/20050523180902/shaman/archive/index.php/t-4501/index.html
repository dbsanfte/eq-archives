<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone done the epic fight since the last patch?<br />
<br />
Last night my guild was going after him and he wiped us out 4 times.  Now,  we have killed him as many as 4 times in one raid.  But he totally wiped us out last night.  <br />
<br />
We had 4 groups, 4 clerics on a CH rotation, a 60 MA a bunch of 57+melees and the other cast of crazy classes that come along for raids.<br />
<br />
Any changes made recently or just bad luck?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

We killed hiim saturday, and wasn't to bad.  I was actually playing my cleric at the time.  I think we had 3 groups, and 3 clerics.  We might have had a stray cleric wander up at the last moment, I dunno.<br />
<br />
We planned on a paladin doing a loh 5 seconds into the fight, then doing a 2 cleric ch rotation after that (with me just helping healing).  But of course, in the confusion, one of the clerics fired off a ch immediately and died a few seconds later.  After that, I was just waiting 5 seconds after I saw the chat message from the other cleric, then starting my own ch.  Fight lasted mebbe a minute.  Ma never got under half health.  I couldnt tell that anything changed from the last time I was there.</div></div><hr />
