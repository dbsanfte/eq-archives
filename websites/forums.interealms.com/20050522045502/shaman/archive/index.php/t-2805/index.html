<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a Barbarian Shaman...I guess we're not &quot;evil&quot; as compared to the Dark casters...Are we good? Who are our enemies?<br />
<br />
Do we have enemies? Half Elfs? Halflings? Dark Elves? Trolls?<br />
Or does everyone like us?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We are neutral, I believe.  We are allowed in good cities, but are no necessarily liked.  We are kos to the evil cities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Justice is blind. Neither good nor evil.<br />
<br />
Or to quote a creation of Terry Pratchett:<br />
<br />
THERE IS NO JUSTICE, THERE IS JUST US.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Muktuk Wolfsbreath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll assume that you're not just talking about faction, here, because it's more fun for me ;)<br />
<br />
On the one hand, we forbid the art of necromancy, implying we are good, through and through. Then again, we don't have paladins. Neither do wood elves, but they have druids, and perhaps a &quot;good&quot; race has one or the other. <br />
<br />
We were created by Erollisi Marr and Mithaniel Marr (way over on the side of good), but our warriors often serve Rallos Zek. I don't know if I'd call him &quot;evil&quot; exactly, or even &quot;neutral&quot;--I don't think he has much in the way of moral concerns unless war becomes involved--but he gets lumped in with the evils most of the time.<br />
<br />
I see us Tribunal-worshippers as &quot;officially&quot; neutral, with each shaman having hir own personal tendencies toward neutrality, good, or evil. One shaman might value impartiality over all else, another may temper justice with mercy, and a third might take &quot;vengeance is a sacred duty&quot; to heart.<br />
<br />
As for my take on race relations: I respect wood elves for keeping close to the wild, and the halflings for their hospitality to lost strangers. I gawk at gnomes, pity humans for their loss of barbarian virtue, and mock the Erudites for their rejection of same. Love and hate have their place, I suppose, but they blind one to duty: hence my mistrust of both high and dark elves.<br />
<br />
The shamanic races... well, I'd treat them like I would a potentially dangerous wolfpup: Show them kindness and hope for the same in return, but be prepared to protect your throat.<br />
<br />
Overthink things, Muk?  Nahh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">That's one of the common misconceptions about barbarians, that we are neutral or on the lighter side of evil. <br />
<br />
As Muktuk points out, according to Norrathian lore, barbarians were created by Mithaniel and Erollisi Marr (the personifications of goodie goodie) so are most definitely a noble and good race, albeit primitive. I always correlated barbarians with Klingons...primitive and warlike, but having strong code of honor.<br />
<br />
The Tribunal may represent justice, and justice is blind (neutral). But there is also the warning about making a mistake and being judged yourself by The Six Hammers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Barbarians are neutral.  We worship a wide range of gods including rallos zek (warriors and I believe rogues can choose him).  I personally play my shaman to be mostly good.  I build what factions I can (except FP militia ... I hate those guys) and I stick to them (on CoV faction and I won't kill wyverns because they con ally to me even though there is no faction hit, won't do Woushi either even though its an easily fixed faction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the most important attitude of Barbarians is tolerance, we only hate true evils. We even let erudites and ogres in the town, as long as they don't worship innoruk or CT. I think only DEs, trolls and lizards are racially excluded.<br />
We are kind of the good freeport militia. But where they do it for greed we do it in the knwoledge of our own superiority :).</div></div><hr />
