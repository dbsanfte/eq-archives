<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys, <br />
<br />
More good stuff coming from SOE in the next update.  Man, they are almost starting to make a believer out of me.  I love the mana and buff enhancements, woot (small, but nice improvements).  Now, if they could only do something about our effectiveness in short fights, I'd be happy as a BST (sorry, could not resist). :)<br />
<br />
Upcoming July 2004<br />
We have an update tentatively scheduled for July 8th.  Some of the highlights include;<br />
<br />
The ability to remove augments from items and retain them.<br />
<br />
Pets should properly shrink.<br />
<br />
A new adventure zone will move to Legends.<br />
<br />
Pets will zone with their masters.<br />
<br />
Mana will display a numeric value.<br />
<br />
Buffs will show a countdown timer when moused over.<br />
<br />
The new Veeshan's Peak! <br />
<br />
And many other exciting changes.  Stay tuned.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Mana will display a numeric value.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that's the very last bit of the vision dying<br />
<br />
Maybe... I remember years ago when direct damage spells didn't display damage numerals to others, and when asked why this was so, 989/RedEye/Verant simply said that magic was a mystical thing, and not the type of thing that can be calculated, and was to be measured simply by its landing message, such as, &quot;ignites in flame&quot; or whatnot.<br />
<br />
In today's number crunching, mystery-less Everquest, I think many will be happy to see numerals though.  Now they can post how many mana points they save, with a certain mana pool, per hour, on average, when fighting X mobs with different MP4/Potion/Tribute etc.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, it will be nice to see what my mana pool is without judging based on what i see the percentage as, but I'm nowhere near as excited about it as I am about knowing how long I have left on my KEI :)  I can't think of how many times I've logged on and forgotten how old my KEI is, if I got it right before I logged off the night before, in preparation, or if it's old and about to drop...<br />
<br />
But yeah, I absolutely loathe when someone in a LDoN group goes off to get KEI and is gone for 15 minutes minimum, hopefully they won't go refresh if they have 30 minutes or less... when a cleric does it, it's bad enough, but when you got hybrids running off, and not listening to you, at THIS level, it's kind of um sad.  Especially if you're doing a normal you can just steamroll over anyway.  /target pickup groups /rude</div></div><hr />

No, does not include charmed pets.  Go to the druid boards for a complete assessment.  Could you imagine DC a Gates pet and taking him to an old world zone?  Anyway, won't happen, thank God.<br />

So a few open raids here and there just for fun . . . a few solo fests for spells, but overall a big disappointment.  <br />
I'm hoping the new VP will be fun, exciting, and an adventure!  And I do hope they tune the loots somewhere between Elemental and Time quality.  Say . . . time tier 1 or so quality.  With a Time tier4 loot table on the boss.  <br />

I dont want it to be the end-all raid zone for loots, would make it too contested.</div></div><hr />

If SOE manages to keep the game up, noticably cares about current issues and works on further improving gameplay (note the 'if' :D), who cares? There is still a lot of work ahead for them to achieve that, no doubts.</div></div><hr />

Boy am I glad I didn't waste a leadership AA on inspect buffs.  That was the next one that I planned to buy.  Seems useful ability for shamans even if rangahs will now give us countdown for FA.<br />

It means that when you hold your mouse cursor over a buff icon, in addition to telling you the name of the spell, it will tell you how many minute are left until it fades.</div></div><hr />

Target: Who will this affect ? (all/casual/raiders&amp;ubers)<br />

Usefulness: Will it make EQ less stressfull to play? (scale of 0 - 5)<br />
Type: UI/Bugfix/New<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">God, why are people complaining about an incredibly underused zone that drops essentially worthless loot being revamped into something challenging? New guilds dont really gear up for VP, far better RvR elsewhere. Old guilds dont go there anymore, because the loot is more or less trash.  People gripe about the stupid alien fights in GoD, yet bitch when the game goes back to dragon fighting. Did you cry this much when they revamped Kerra Island as well? I swear, now we're just whining for practice. My guild is in the elementals (until we can cruelly steal more clerics from other guilds... /rude design team), and if I kill Pyronis one more friggin time, I am going to puke. Give me dragons to fight any day over frogs, mud blobs, etc.<br />
<br />
Zones shouldnt be held sacred because a few soloers want to go there and piddle away their time without being bothered. This was the same objection to the plane of mischief revamp. That one WAS handled rather poorly, but other zone revamps were done well (CT, Droga/Nurga, Befallen)</div></div><hr />

Wow. Simply, wow. Now, the question is, will it WORK when it's made live? I hear shaman pets are still not shrinking properly, and I've heard a couple accounts of pets being killed on zoning (both the people I spoke with were mages). Thanks for the info, Thunder.<br />

Yes you are right. I guess I got carried away by all the other low scores. This is actually very useful.

<br />
The upcoming patch lists a lot of new features that many players have been asking for for quite some time.  We actually get quite a few bones out of it as well.<br />
<br />
- Augment removal and what sounds like an equipment/augment turn-in<br />
<br />
- Pets zoning with you (with a side benefit of our pet aa's being even more useful)<br />
<br />
- Buff counters added<br />
<br />
- New adv zones on Legends that will eventually make their way to the other servers<br />
<br />
To me it sounds like a fun patch, and I think the poster that Blazz commented on was a tad over-pessimistic.  These new features will be beneficial for everyone- casual/raider alike.  If the equipment/aug turn-in does go in effect it actually benefits the casual more than the raider.<br />
Other than a few choice pieces of LDoN gear, the raider isn't going to bother with much of it (too busy raiding).  The casual LDoN junkie can buy what they choose, and when it comes time to upgrade they can turn-in old LDoN gear/augs for a percentage of points they paid for it.  They can also move augs around as they upgrade items outside of LDoN.  <br />
<br />
We will probably see more of this type of patch in the near future.  There are lots of UI/Gameplay fixes that can be handled now, and when OoW comes out they can turn their attention to the class balancing issues.  While it may annoy some (or many) players who want the balancing issues resolved now- I don't see them addressing them now when they will have to do it all over again in OoW.  Once everything is said and done, we should have balancing corrected (in someone's mind) and some nice gameplay features added as well.  It seems more beneficial to me in the long run.</div></div><hr />

-Augment removal, although convenient, isn't &lt;exactly a pressing issue.<br />
<br />
-Shrink my dog... yeah, that's terribly important.<br />
<br />
-Gratz to Legends for a new adventure zone... that's one less zone file <br />
-I'll have to load for which I'll never have a use. LDON is too boring to <br />
-spend my hours of play time in.<br />
<br />
-Zoning pets... uhh.. yeah, swell.<br />
<br />
-Mana numbers... now THAT is important! /sarcasm &lt;off<br />
<br />
-How about they fix the duration of the buffs... rather than remind me of how quickly it rolls off &lt;instead.<br />
<br />
-Veeshan's Peak will be like Veksar - 6 weeks of &lt;overcrowding followed <br />
-up by indefinite period of nearly total vacancy.<br />
<br />
-Yeah... I'm being negative... but sheez - this isn't ground breaking or <br />
-exciting at all. It's more smoke and mirrors, people.<br />

I'm afraid i have to agree, where is the fixes to our core problems not bones thrown out and some landing on us.<br />

This is the kind of attitude that I feel has caused us to be behind the 8-ball as we stand now. Smacking anyone down that has negative feedback about where they are taking our class. I remember people saying &quot;Why is our CH spell less than that of druids,&quot; I heard &quot;Wah, go play a druid we aren't really healers.&quot; or &quot;quit whineing its something isn't it?&quot; <br />
When we stopped and were polite compared to druids incessant whineing they thought we were fixed / ballanced / Happy, And we got exactly what were were shouting for, nothing.<br />
Oh and last I knew the druids heal PRE-PoP was the same as ours because they brought so much to the group, evac, ports, snare, damage shield, nukes, agrofree dots. When they put in PoK and nerfed their port they felt sorry for them and gave them better heals, why isn't ours the same???? until that point weren't ours identical??</div></div><hr />

Complaining about an awesome change that will give many people hundreds of hours of their life back is alright? It doesn't effect you but that doesn't mean it sucks. We have a rep bringing our concerns to Sony (Sudedor) why do we have to bring up our issues in every thread? I don't think so, those were some long standing issues and were brought up at the summit so Sony decided to put them in. Not every patch can effect you.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you never use maps or walkthroughs. Never bought items to make quests easier or bought/sold MQs. I'm sure you never shared your account or used EQW before Sony said it was ok too. <br />
<br />
<br />
( And if you didn't do those things you are very abnormal but whatever, most people did and thats technically cheating )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">these last couple of patches seem amazing, must admit.  raising the debuff limit seems huge in my mind, especially for necros, and letting pets zone and giving us a manacount were things they had rebuffed for years.<br />
<br />
but given that all of this has taken place just months before competitors release a product which is extremely promising, it makes me wonder how long all of this spectacular support will last once they have a better idea how much of their customer base will leave with WoW...<br />
<br />
given Sony's craptacular track record, i'm guessing not long.  and though many of you are excited now about what is going on, it might be wise not to raise your hopes too high lest they be dashed when you realize that Sony is notorious for serving its own interests before the interests of its customer base.</div></div><hr />

Its still &quot;cheating&quot;.  I think the righteous attitude taken by so many people about third party programs and ebaying is pretty dumb. I agree that exploiting stuff like TS combines that ruins the economy is horrible, but anything other people do to increase their fun really isn't anyone else's concern. <br />
<br />
Wow someone can use a third party program to check the time on his buffs, or see that this mob is up. I don't think its really anyone's business how someone plays the game.</div></div><hr />

There is a bit of a difference here between 3rd party software and walkthroughs.  Everquest is a MMORPG designed with the intention that different players would share information.  Learning about Lady Vox online or offline is the same thing.  Using a walkthrough, I still have to abide by the rules of EQ.  If I use 3rd party software, I don't.  While I may still be having fun using them- I also give myself a severe advantage over other players.  <br />
<br />
Using an analogy- bear with me on this one.<br />
<br />
Player A and Player B go to a casino.  Player A researches how to play poker while player B does not.  Player A, while he may have an advantage in the game- he can still lose to Player B.<br />
<br />
Using that same example- if Player A, instead of researching, decides to cheat his way through- then Player B has lost his ability to win.  Player A may still be having fun, but he still has Player B at a significant disadvantage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Yes, but in a competitive sense, third party software does not allow you to cheat. The most important thing third party software does is make the game less tedious or automate things you would already have been able to do. Third party software would not kill mobs for you, or give you strats. It may assist in some things, but stuff like walkthroughs and quest guides are alot more helpful than using a program like macroquest. <br />
<br />
The one single way that someone else using third party software effects you is the fact that they can know what mobs are up in a zone. However, even this isn't that big of a deal because rangers and rogues can also tell the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way, I am not supporting things like plat macros or speed offsets. Stuff like that does ruin the game. I don't think someone else knowing the time left on buffs, or using supertarget to target people on raids really effects anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Cheating is breaking the rules. 3rd party programs, at least some of them, break the rules.

But that depends on how you define 'rules'. Im sure there are people who consider forums like this cheating as youre not thinking or researching about a specific problem instead of asking/reading for help. Luckily most of us here at the crucible have no such superstitions.<br />
<br />
But i guess use of 3rd party programs to gain an advantage over someone else is bad style. Especially in PVP.</div></div><hr />

The rules are what sony says they are, not what you or I wish they were.  There may be people who consider forums cheating, but unless Sony does, who cares?</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i think then i missed the patch where they implemented a map showing every mobs position and movement for trackers<br />
<br />
<br />
i think everyone who says seq or any other third party programm does nothing bad only wants to keep up his illusion that he does nothing illegal<br />
<br />
fact is those programms are forbidden by SOE<br />
fact is those programms give u huge advantages over other players<br />
for example....track has a range seq not<br />
                   track gives u the direction to the mob seq gives u the exact postion on a map<br />
                   and there are many more things where u can't tell me that you could do the same without those programms<br />
<br />
<br />
fact is those programms are illegal and u cheat other players that don't use them cause they follow the rules of sony there is no way to discuss that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The rules are what sony says they are, not what you or I wish they were.  There may be people who consider forums cheating, but unless Sony does, who cares?<br />
I guess I dont see it quite this way. There are some things that just do not seem &quot;right&quot; to me, and ShowEQ and other 3rd party programs are among them. There are bots that will run characters and have them kill and loot mobs all night (why else did they nerf the gem drops at Pyramid in OS?).<br />
<br />
Things that take significant advantage of the current rules are called &quot;exploits&quot;. Again, these have degrees. Some arent so bad. For example, if you can make 10 pp selling a combine that costs 8 pp from a vendor, and want to do that for a couple hours to make a couple K pp, heck, I could live with that type of &quot;minor&quot; infraction. But if you want to lock red mobs into a corner and kill them without the slightest risk to yourself, well, thats kinda differnt. <br />
<br />
This type of &quot;level of impropriety&quot; isnt something unique to EQ. Why do you think going 61 in a 55 is a $50 dollar fine, while going 85 in a 30 will probably land you in jail? IMHO, and again, this is ONLY my opinion, useing walkthroughs and other &quot;public domain&quot; information shouldnt even be considered a &quot;violation&quot; on the Broken Law List, while things like ShowEQ etc are up there with embezzlement and fraud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">The sad thing is, probably 90% of the &quot;Features&quot; they've added to the interface are directly from ShowEQ/Macroquest.<br />
<br />
Ingame maps<br />
health/mana percentages<br />
buff timers<br />
Raw Mana numbers<br />
Tradeskill window (err, somewhat)<br />
EQ in a window (EQW)<br />
Compass<br />
showing haste/atk/regen/etc on items<br />
<br />
<br />
Macroquest is a program which, if used in certain ways, definitely modifies gameplay, though not necessarily in a way that detriments the game or other players. Someone botting an alt they can control by sending it tells is a good example. This doesn't hurt anyone. Same goes for foraging or fishing or gathering tradeskill stuff. Who cares? I've even seen macros that auto play the casino. Man I'd be laughing if someone complained about someone macroing to remove plat from the game!<br />
<br />
Of course, MQ can also do some bad stuff... There's even plugins that aren't included in it that you can find if you know where to look which can do some very evil things, like some of that stuff you all read about on SZ. I'm pretty sure the stuff that guy did can't be done with the standard version of it though. I know some people who have it, and at best, it shows you where stuff is in the zone and lets you target things regardless of distance. That's certainly not kosher, but it can't really be used to grief people.</div></div><hr />

No I dont think this patch is a bad thing. I think slamming on other shamans for expressing pessimism is. If he would have come out and said it sucks would have been one thing. While these fixes are nice, I dont believe any of them were directed AT us, we just benefit from them. I dont think he was complaining as much as bring attention to the fact that we are just benefitting from these changes merely by fitting the description of what they were targeted at. I highly doubt the developers said hey Shamans could use pet zoning, and oh I guess the other pets can zone too. Im still waiting for inate dual wield and maybe come equiped with SoW.<br />
<br />
No not every patch, if you could read back through the patch messages for the last 2 years you woulnd't find very many things that were directly addressed to the shaman. Priest class, wisdom caster, chain wearer, pet user, insert x race here, tradeskill x, does not constitute a fix for the shaman class. Im thinking you could count the items that were directly related to our class you would not need to use your toes.<br />
<br />
Does that mean we were very ballanced or just overlooked for 4 expansions.</div></div><hr />

In order to get good things with this bunch, you have to be noisy about the bad things. We might have Sudedor carrying our issues, but it doesn't do us any bood if those issues are silenced or labeled &quot;Whining&quot;<br />
<br />

yeah,  hell they got a plugin on rpgexpert where you can /gate  or /warp to x,y location   and its also possible to do a /zone command  with the plugins too   but  as all you know  gm's will be over that like flies on crap  .... yet we cant get ****in decent CSR !!!!</div></div><hr />

Your nit picking bro. I understand where you coming from, but holding those in the same class together is so wrong. <br />

I dont buy items,  i dont plat dup, I have never done anything to hurt the economy, to make a quest easier or something that would allow me to win something over someone else.

The buff timer is pretty good, but it's as close to a balance feature as shaman get in the patch, but it shouldn't be considered as a balance item as it benefits all buff classes.</div></div><hr />
