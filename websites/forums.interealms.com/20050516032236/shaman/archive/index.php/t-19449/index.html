<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’m starting to feel a tad useless in groups and thought you guys could help me find a new way to optimize my play style.<br />
<br />
I’m 62, with about 50 AA but most are canni, SCRM, MC, etc. I’m going to work on avoidance now though as I’m the one dying way too often. So, last night the group (and this is pretty standard) was a 63 beast, 63 ranger, 60 chanter, 57 mage, 57 ranger and myself. We’re pulling chardok B. The chanter is hasting, tashing and mezzing so I don’t need be CC or debuff. The beast is pulling with slow and has LR3 so he’s barely being hit anyways. The rangers are dropping arrows and spot healing the beast because they aren’t doing anything with their mana anyways (undead don’t run). So I was slowing atop the beasts, dropping a kraggs whenever the rangers let him get below 50% health (usually only on over pulls – rare) and the mobs are dying too fast to dot. So sending pet in and casting a nuke. And with all my buff extensions I only need buff at the beginning except regen. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I shouldn’t be complaining. But I’m used to playing a far larger role. Suggestions for optimizing my style for this type of group? Yes I’m working on 63, but am not in a huge hurry since I’m still saving and slowly buying spells, so AA seems more productive currently.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would have fun with this group. You have the dps and tons of overlap in abilities. Toss in malo for extra debuff, toss in the slow to decrease a bit of incoming damage and heal when needed.<br />
<br />
Perfect groups can easily get into trouble and that is where your value will shine. Don't get complacent or bored.<br />
<br />
Until then, enjoy the dead time, free xp and ***finally*** the ability to actually follow and contribute to group chat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Roles.<br />
<br />
I think every Shaman has their own perception of what their role is in a group.  I feel that I am a versatile class.  I can slow, buff, debuff, cc and heal.<br />
<br />
Slowing:  We have the best slow in the game.  This is one of our bread and butter roles.<br />
<br />
Buffing:  Focus and Boar is a staple for most.  Most of our buffs are saught after.<br />
<br />
Debuff:  For me, my general routine is: malos + slow on incomming mobs.  Most times, I do not worry about having malosinia memmed if the group has high DPS.  Sometimes I will have Cripple memmed if there is no chanter present.  Cripple could be a lifesaver if a mob you are fighting has a nasty proc or hits hard.  Getting that Dex and Str down is a must.<br />
<br />
CC:  Malos, Slow, and Root Park.  I do this a lot in LDON adventures.  If the mob cannot be rooted and is slowed, we can tank them with only Qui up - normal setting of course.<br />
<br />
Healing:  With out Healing AAs, we can be a decent healer.  I never saw Shamans as a healer class, but once when I was asked to heal on a raid, I was amazed at the power we possessed.  Granted, we cannot do it for long period of time, but we can get by with Qui and T Mending.  There has been a few times I have grouped in Earth, and I was the Main Healer or another Shaman was the main healer.  Qui is critical, and I would kill, beg or steal for that spell.  If you thought your world changed with Canni V, welcome to Qui!<br />
<br />
When I group, I am usually a slower / buffer / healer.  If there is a chanter present, I usually ask them to slow for me, but this is not necessary.  I hardly mem my nukes anymore.  They take too long to cast, and the dps in groups I am in are usually high.  Same goes for DoTs.  <br />
<br />
My normal spells I have memmed are:<br />
<br />
FA<br />
[Util]<br />
Slow<br />
[Util]<br />
Malos<br />
Regen<br />
Heal<br />
Qui<br />
<br />
<br />
In the end, we have many possibilities to choose from.  Some nights I am bored as hell, and some nights I am at the edge of my seat.  Nothing is more exciting that getting a crit heal when the MT is at 4%.  Well, exciting for you - not the MT :P<br />
<br />
Try new things - if you need to work on your melee skills, ask the group if it is alright for you to work on them once your duties are met.  OR, you can enjoy your free-time.  Depends on what you want out of the group / game / etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think really that your too worried that your not bringing enough to the group, when, in actuality, you need to ask yourself, would the group be able to exist and function well without me?<br />
The simple answer is no it wouldnt, at least not without finding some sort of replacement.<br />
Your tactics are pretty much standard for most shaman even at the 65 and doing Elemental planes...heals, slow/debuff/occasional nuke and dogdog is as good as its gonna get.<br />
Optimize your mana use and nuke as often as you can, once you get FA that wont be often, even with around 70% extension your still looking at 11 min give or take a millisecond and trust me when people find out you have FA its all over :rolleyes:<br />
Your doing fine, dont get all hung up unless the group says something about that lazy shaman.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I say enjoy the freedom while you can.  I swear I feel like I am playing a Bard twisting 6 songs with Canni/Buffs/Slows/Heals.  My mouse and keyboard could use a nice relaxing group :D  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd tell the BL to pull with disempower so you can do what you do best, which is slowing.  In fact, I'd slow over his slow repeatedly til he got a clue - but then, I'm very adamant about being the slower in whatever groups I'm in, even if I'm primary healer.  Although, I duo/group with a BL and at times he likes to pull with slow to reduce initial hits (foolish since I have Q now) and establish aggro - and it doesn't bother him that I overwrite his lesser slow.<br />
<br />
You can cripple, you can DoT, there are lots of buffs to maintain.  It's nice to have one or two LDoN DoTs as they're short duration/high damage so you can usually get one to run full time for anything short of a massacre.  I often use cripple when I don't have a chance to contribute significant DPS because it'll help the melees/pets mow through critters even faster, particularly in a melee/pet heavy group.  Hasted and FAed tanks vs slowed and crippled critters = carnage.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd recommend you get to 65 where you have more options.  At 65 you have the addition potential to cast FA (a chore but it gives you something else to possibly do), you have Q to your best spot healing option (clerics become more optional for many situations), you can get Bane at 64 (420 damage/tick for 30 seconds - yummy), and so on.<br />
<br />
Shaman have so many options - you should always be able to find some way to contribute.  You might not be the strongest DoT/DD caster, the best melee, or whatever - but dogdog is alway doing his thing and you can always do something.</div></div><hr />

 So, last night the group (and this is pretty standard) was a 63 beast, 63 ranger, 60 chanter, 57 mage, 57 ranger and myself. We’re pulling chardok B. <br />
<br />
Perhaps I shouldn’t be complaining. But I’m used to playing a far larger role. <br />
<br />
Cahyre, look at what I quoted up there.  First there was no cleric or druid in the group so you were the main healer.  Second, you were slowing with what is unarguably the best slows in the game.  Finally, you were sending your pet in for some DPS on top of everything else you were doing.<br />
<br />
I cant think of a more beneficial class than a shaman to a group like this and its no wonder you were getting killed.  There was really no true tank in the group with instantaneous agro recovery and you were doing so much in your group that you were stealing agro.<br />
<br />
You were main healer, main slower and a mini-DPS.  What more do you want? :D  This is why I love my shammy so much.  We do so many things, that we feel we ought to be doing more!.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Lately I've been seeing my shaman's role as cleric/enchanter bodyguard.<br />
<br />
True I malos/turgur mobs, and true I buff the group and add indirect dps with Ferine Avatar, but the most important part is that when an enchanter resists or a cleric gets agro, I slow the mob and heal the enchanter/cleric.  Even if slow resists, at least I will be getting agro enough so that they will regain control of the situation... if I cannot get agro then at least I am buying enough time with heals for the tank to gain agro and peel it off the person in danger.<br />
<br />
We have a unique crowd control ability aside from chanter/bard/necro mez:  Virulent Paralysis 3 is the equivalent of pulling an add away from someone who has agro (can be person in danger or yourself), moving him several paces away, and rooting him with a low-chance-break root for two minutes, but without all the agro and damage.  It saves so much time over trying to pull adds away and rooting them, and it saves your arse when you are slowing and they are getting in your face after resisting.<br />
<br />
After completing those tasks, my role is tears of saryrn or velium strike or bane, and keeping ferine avatar/haste up on tanks and maybe pets.<br />
<br />
If grouped with a druid healer, Quiescence at level 65 should help them with their job.<br />
<br />
If not grouped with any healers, be glad that there is a beastlord doing the slows.  Just assist with Malo (although probably not necessary since the enchanter is tashania-ing, unless you have nukers), like someone suggested, and keep people alive, helping with slowing and rooting when multiples come.  Feel free to nuke and stuff, but the group will rely on you for the strong burst heals (ala Tnarg's) when things possibly get bad.  No real need to overwrite 65% slow with 75% slow, since you are the main healer... unless you're struggling with mana.  It would be a lot easier if you were 65 so that you could heal very well with Quiescence and not anger the melees with Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Don't worry. Enjoy it. Go to town with nukes, do whatever you think is useful. Shaman shine when things go pear shaped. If you get overpulls, concnetrate on honing your CC skills. <br />
<br />
Even if your chanter is very good at mezzing adds, make apoint of rooting, malo and solwing all mezed mobs. It is better that youhave the aggro if it breaks mez than some pansy pyjama wearing high-elf.<br />
<br />
I did a LDoN: SK, Cleric, Rogue, Wizard, Chanter, me. I felt pretty useful for the first 5 minutes, then the SK went LD....so, guess what, I became Main Tank! Someone had to, so that the rogue cold backstab, so on wnet the AC gear and the melee buffs, gogo Shammytank! With slow and 1 or 2 dots, I easily kept aggro on every single mob, so the rogue could backstab away to her heart's content! It was really fun, and the rogue said that she had grouped with plenty of tanks who couldn't position the mobs for her as well as I did. Haha! And we completed the adventure no trouble! The most fun LDoN I have done for ages!</div></div><hr />
