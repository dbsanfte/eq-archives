<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dissonant</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone else a little bit peeved that ethereal parchments drop FAR more than spectrals in BoT?  I hate to make generalizations, but the majority of people grinding BoT have all their 61-62 spells.  I'm to the point now that I'll prolly start destroying EP's out of spite.  VI need to fix the parchment balance, or just remove EP's from tier3 zones and up the spec drop rate a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why don't you make someone's day instead?  Find a shaman that needs them ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hm, when I check the bazaar all 61 / 62 spells are for sale. Beside pet you can get almost every spell for 1-2k (or less). Cheaper then some 60 spells. I still hope to get the level 64 root from the necro NPC with an etheral parch. But I only roll when no one is missing important 61 / 62 spells in the group.<br />
<br />
Havn't seen any 63+ spell for sale on the other hand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tallon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hmm picked up the 64 nuke from the bazaar at 8000pp, think i got lucky and somone missed off another 0   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saw Quiesence in bazaar for sale day before yesterday for the low low price of 100k. rofl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grinding in the West hall near the named room we got 5-6 Ethereal Parchments in about 4 hrs of random mobs.  Mini-named Bee guy dropped nothing :mad: No spectrals seen.  In all my time grinding so far Ive only seen a spectral drop once off a non-named giant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Had been got 2 spectre parchment from west side lightning giants in 4 hour,  1 65 rune and 1 silk pattern for Pot armor<br />
from named lv 65 giant<br />
Lucky guild enchanter wear C4 click legging happily now.:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I saw 2 specs from regular ones in BoT in like 4 hours one night, but since they 'adjusted' parch drops in tier3+ I haven't seen one from a regular mob.... or any from the few named I've done there either<br />
<br />
Really sucks we can't get spectrals and runes unless we can kill Rallos, but VI has never given a damn about our spell troubles, so I'm not suprised.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I've seen a few specs from random mobs in BoT. One time in particular we were going after the wind named and got 2 specs off the 6 or so mobs in his room and another off him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Part of the problem with PoP spells period is that you can level so amazingly fast to 65 that there is no way for spell drops to match up with advancement.  At least with RoK+ you had some time to hunt around and gather spells.<br />
<br />
The way it is currently I can see the overall bulk of L63+ players not seeing full 63-64 spells for a year or so.</div></div><hr />
