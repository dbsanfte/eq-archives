The Rathe join together to form the Avatar of Earth. The pics are on that page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kamfool1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The strategy of Rathe is no different from before, it's just that now it is more executable. Before changes, only 1 in 10 mez would land, and with 6 monsters, that doesn't work well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So does anyone know the date when they made the Rathe encounter doable?  I know it was broken for months, but I don't keep up on day-to-day uberguild activities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">wednesday night I think Lora, also down to TR on stormhammer www.townrebels.org<br />
<br />
I'm sure quite a few more guilds will follow in the next few days as quite a few #1 guilds were just waiting on the rathe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So did TR use the massive zerg?  If so, who cares if they killed it...grats FoH/Afterlife.  Ascent on RN got 10 of the 12 down today, so its only a matter of time for RN to see Time as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So I guess the question on everyone's mind is .. are there rats in Time?  Gotta just love it when a rat makes it to a plane you can only dream about ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Sorry, n0b here but can someone explain who Rathe Council is/are and why it's such a big achievement?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Rathe Council was the Timeskink needed for VI/SI to finish itemizing and stocking the plane of time.  Essentially it was the last of the elemental planes end mobs needed by many uber guilds for entrance into the PoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hehehe Afterlife (http://www.afterlifeguild.org) had meany meany hits last night and SoE was highly conserned about eveybody reading this:<br />
 <br />
Raise your hand if you thought the complex Plane of Time entrance system would work.  Nobody?  You're all correct: it doesn't work.  Or rather, it doesn't work consistantly.  Some can get in, while others, with identical flags (line by line identical from guided meditation), talking to identical NPC's, getting identical messages, can not. -Thott <br />
<br />
SoE was quick to respond with this:<br />
<br />
The Plane of Time<br />
There are a lot of people watching the progress being made towards the Plane of Time. With the first guild reaching the plane last night, I wanted to talk a little about an issue they had. <br />
<br />
Some of the folks that recently completed The Rathe Council encounter were unable to enter the Plane of Time. The requirements for entry are complicated, and those people simply missed a step in the quest that gains them entrance (just an NPC that they needed to talk to). We've talked to them and explained what they missed, and they have been able to gain entry by completing the missing step. <br />
<br />
However, we are going to modify the quest steps a bit to make them simpler so that this shouldn't happen in the future. <br />

Alan has become better at defence (180)!<br />
<br />
This just in from FoH (http://www.fohguild.org/flash/index.php):<br />
Finally, after months of frustration, The Rathe Council falls... Gonna make this brief, cause I'm ****ing tired. NO MORE GODDAMN ELEMENTAL PLANES!!!! THANK YOU JESUS! -Furor<br />
<br />
Grats to them and TR  :)</div></div><hr />
