<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harmonisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">effect : increase the power of the buff<br />
<br />
exemple : buff are 10% more powerfull ( an hp buff give 10% more hp, stats buff give 10% more, ... )<br />
<br />
I think something like that can be very usefull and funny. But it can cause some trouble with the stacking ( 10% focus couldn't certainely be erase by normal focus).<br />
<br />
And you, what do you think about that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>niwggib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neat idea but let me tell you how SoE would impliment this idea.<br />
<br />
All buffs would be designed to be balanced at a certain %. Then once they are all balanced they would reduce their effectiveness by 10% making it so that in order for you to be balanced you HAD to have the AA or focus!</div></div><hr />
