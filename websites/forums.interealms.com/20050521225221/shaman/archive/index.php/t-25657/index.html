<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">well the 6 min recast is verry nice and best of all the epic HOT gose in bard windo now insted of buff windo /cheer i am verry pleased.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">However it does not stack with the cleric AA HoT now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/stacking.html?id=6241&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Yes it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well we hit Menlo tonight and Epic HoT did not land on anyone in either group where it was used.  Cleric AA HoT was running.  So what the hell could it be?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">did you get did not take hold? or just not see the buff icon becuse the icon now gose in bard song windo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bangor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Reason you don't see it is, fateseer's boon is now under bard song slots instead of buff slots. Yes the reduced cast time is very nice. next time you cast you should notice it. gl</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We knew to look for it under the bard window.  I'm not sure if they got the will not take hold message.  My group was too uber and did not need it :)<br />
<br />
I will check with them and see if they got the message or just did not see the buff icon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is it still for your group only or can you target other people to cast it on their group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">As far as I know still can't /tgb it.<br />
<br />
We had 3 1.5 epic'd shaman.  The other 2 used the clicky, I did not.  They are the ones who told me of the problem.  I'm just posting about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The shaman in question got 6 would not take hold messages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ughbash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well the Cleric AA healing ward also goes in the Bard box, so the fact ours now goes in bard box could be causing the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ancestral Aid is not going in the bard buff box (yet).<br />
<br />
With epic buff in the bard buff box, does that mean it can't be dispelled now? That would be handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Means it gets dispelled after everything else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The shaman in question got 6 would not take hold messages.<br />
<br />
Did they have a bard in group? It's possible they hit the 6 buff limit in the short term buff box. A bard in group can easily keep 4 songs up now with melody. Add on a shaman/cleric/druid ward doing a song and it would only take one of the other epic clickies in the short term buff box or an ae bard song and you'd have all 6 slots filled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Shaman epic stacks fine with Cleric AA Celestial Renewal, I just tried it. Celestrial Renewal goes in the normal buff box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">they are talking about the cleric ward aa - that makes a ward that regens hp slowly for a longish period of time - Like the one we had that was supposed to do endurance at first but got made into hp when it went live. (god ward aa)</div></div><hr />
