<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kanelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they must have changed it, i read through the forums and saw a few references to it being nodrop, all about 2 months old.  thanks for the update...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fangface</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After reading UgZug's Alchemy Guide, I decided to recruit the help of a few friends and waltz into Grieg's End to claim a stone for my sort of new shaman character, which is quickly becoming my main.  We had three members in the group 52 monk (me), 65 pally, 65 druid.   It wasn't hard to reach Alchemist Valrona.  She on the other hand is a freaking pain to kill.  Alchemist Valrona has approximately 20K HPs and Massive Regen.  HPs are hard to estimate due to the regeneration. Doubles in the mid-100s.  Ultimately the monk and pally were taking her down and she'd regen back most of what we'd do to her, so in the end the druid just started to hit her with AE's and nukes and the pally acted as a healer.  Once we did that method she dropped with ease, most waves of the AE took her down 15% and the melee attacks were basically just neutralizing her regen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Badjur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hahaha I was in an exploration group in Grieg's shortly after the release of Luclin and we came upon Valronia.  Right on about the hps and massive regen.  We got her but she didn't drop the stone.  Later, during raid in GE finally got the stone, and not ten minutes later another Valronia spawned again in hallway just outside of Grieg's lair and dropped another stone.<br />
<br />
The stones are not no drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While doing servitor we managed to pull her twice... first time she didn't drop the stone. Second time she did.<br />
<br />
Looks like a bag equipped, it is droppable.<br />
<br />
I'm pleased.</div></div><hr />
