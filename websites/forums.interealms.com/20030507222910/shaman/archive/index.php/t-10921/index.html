<br />
Well i dont get to play much, but when i do i like to lvl, and seeing how you guys/gals have horses, heh i want one to so i was wondering what is the fastest place to make pp or should i stay on track on lvling and get in a good guild that will help me out. i need help on this hehe, if you can give me some pointers if you onr BERTOX server my name is Damned. See ya guys around and keep those DoTs going =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tell your level, maybe we can suggest a place you can get xp and decent pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If yas are really lazy like me I suggest you hit steamfont, yes steamfont.<br />
<br />
Kill everything that spawns around the mino caves, loot the air elementals and earth elemntals (and mountain brownies if your a baker)<br />
<br />
Iron oxide sells for 50p and swirling mist sells for 25p. <br />
<br />
This is for the extrmely lazy mind you, IGs make better cash, but you have to fight off KSers abundent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nenyenye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they sell for that much as vt or in bazaar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">what level?<br />
<br />
as much as HG's are loathed, they are pretty good.<br />
<br />
if your 58+ try POG.<br />
I duo there at 57 with a 56 BL. can get some awesome cash there</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FM if you are truly lazy.<br />
<br />
Giants there are wimps.  At 58 I can handle 5 at a time.<br />
<br />
They can drop Forest Loops - 230p<br />
Tunics that sell for 41 to 60 p<br />
Several weapons that sell for 14 - 41 p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Seru aint bad.  13-20pp per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Damned</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">do you mean SS? what do you hunt the guards, i am lvl 40</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">at 40 stick with HG's or the giants in FM (though not 5 at a time).  Or get some exp in CoM - all drops in that zone are completely random, you can make some decent cash selling wu sticks and the snare sword for warriors.  Drops can be pretty rare though, so don't expect to get a ton.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">kunark drops are rare emphasis on the RARE.  I have spent YONKs and beyond in com, only had wu sticks drop once.<br />
<br />
roughly 2k+ mobs i seen killed in com [exp  epic camp reaver raids etc]  thats not really good item to try farm for pp imo.<br />
<br />
i have nothing positive to add   atmo<br />
