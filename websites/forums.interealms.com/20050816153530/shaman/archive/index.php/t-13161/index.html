<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently try think about if should work toward FT15 or just simple get more hp; I know you all say we have good mana regen rate and don't need FT item, but I actually don't use canni4 all time and mainly get mana from canni5+kei/VoQ <br />
<br />
for partner/group exp, I notice KEI can make pretty big difference(try click off your KEI you will notice), I can dot/nuke more which add big chuck of dps; when click off Virtue I notice not really big difference except don't feel good with lower hp number; anyway I rarely get hit more than 1 round and there are some rare situation that you have to get hit lots, but you still die same fast with extra 1000hp. most of time I end up get Pot9 over Virtue when possible<br />
<br />
I know lots shaman agree HP &gt; all ; but after play lots at PoP, since I have enough hp for safely canni5 and 1000ac+ when buffed; I feel HP/AC isn't that good compare to mana regene, and for me FT15(KEI) at lease more useful than 1000hp(that is FT3 &gt; 200hp) and think about work toward FT15 <br />
<br />
please share what you think about the value of FT item as a shaman ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have always tried to obtain &quot;balanced&quot; gear.  From wis to mana to AC to regen to hitpoints to resists to focus to FT...I compare each potential piece of gear to my current gear and what I hope to get in the future.   <br />
<br />
I think FT is important...who doesn't want 15 extra ticks of mana regen?  Luckily, at the level where one can hope to accumulate a lot of FT gear, it typically comes accompanied with a lot of other nice stats, so you rarely have to pick either FT or decent hitpoints/mana/resists/wis etc.<br />
<br />
&lt;-- Focus item junkie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only FT gear I roll on is stuff that is also high in HPs.<br />
My guild does VT with ease and we are just about to start trying RZ.<br />
I've been holding off on FT items while the clerics and druids were getting their fill, but now I've been rolling an a bunch of them.<br />
You can click on my profile to see what FT items I currently wear.<br />
<br />
If you have to choose between FT or HP gear though, I'd say go for HP gear.<br />
When you xp in POP, mobs hit you for 700s regularly.<br />
You need to be able to live through their attacks.<br />
More HP lets you stay alive longer for tanks to taunt off your debuffs and DDs and heal aggro and dots.<br />
<br />
How much does FT really help?<br />
With FT3 boots, and Solstace earring, anyone can get FT4 relatively easy.<br />
4 mana per tick ---&gt; 40 extra mana every minute ---&gt; 2400 extra mana every hour<br />
Blood of Saryn costs 535 mana.<br />
With an Afflicition Efficiency IV item, Blood of Saryn costs 401.25 mana (basicly 400 mana)<br />
Over a period of 1 hour, with FT 4 vs no FT, you can cast a grand total of 6 more dots.<br />
The average xp group I hunt in will usually kill between 30 and 60 mobs in an hour; mobs which have approximately 20-25k hp.<br />
Casting 6 more dots in a single hour than I was casting before isn't really going to be that noticable.<br />
<br />
If you can somehow get FT 15, that's 9000 mana per hour you get.<br />
That's 22 more Bloods you can cast per hour.<br />
It's still good for adding DPS to the group, but a single 2k dot on a 25k hp mob isn't all that amazing to tell the truth.<br />
<br />
Most likely the way you'll get your FT up to 15 is through gear with good HP and mana already on it.<br />
My advice is to not concentrate solely on getting FT at the cost of hp gear.<br />
Go for HP/Mana gear that happens to have FT.<br />
Some key items for this come from VT.<br />
Some examples of stuff in VT that you'd want:<br />
-Belt of Dark Thought (125hp mana FT4) off one of the early diabos<br />
-That shield off the Blobs before AHR that has FT6 and like 100hp mana?<br />
-The cloak I have in my magelo with 125hp mana FT4 off Kelun<br />
-Floating Rune off the first blob (85hp mana arm shoulder neck slot FT2)<br />
-Rune of Judgement (100hp mana arm wrist hand shoulder? slot FT1)<br />
-BP of Judgement (125hp mana chest FT7)<br />
-leggings of judgement (125hp mana FT3 legs)<br />
-I think the torch of judgement is 125hp mana range primary slot with big FT<br />
<br />
Other things to go for are:<br />
Shield of ssra (100hp mana FT4) off High Priest in Ssra<br />
Brain of Cazic Thule (100hp mana FT1) off Cazic Thule<br />
White dragonscale boots (~90hp ~110mana FT2 from Yelinak quest from Tormax head)<br />
Emperor Ssra boots (115? hp mana FT4 boots)<br />
I know the Elemental Mold Bracer also has FT4 on it, and the ornate one is FT2?<br />
<br />
My goal is to hit FT4 using up only 4 slots on my inventory, so that the other slots can have more useful effects in them.<br />
I'm 1/2 way there with 2 FT4 items.<br />
<br />
What kind of raid targets are you capable of to acquire FT gear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got ft 13 without even trying to get ft, concentrate on hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hps &gt; FT.  My magelo is up to date and on raids I don't have mana regen problems.  Exp groups it's not quite as good but with only a few FT, I have no problem keeping people healed and buffed while debuffing/dotting.<br />
<br />
A good rule of thumb that I've been following as best as I can is not to bid on any item that doesn't have at least 100 hps on it.  Only exceptions are slots that are very outdated or that have 100 hps in the very rare drops (i.e. rings, earrings, shoulders).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd go for hp too.  Mostly the only droppable FT gear has sucky other stats and is too high priced (eg. that sucky 7ac 25hp/mana belt with FT-2 that people on my server want 100k for LOL)  At those prices, and with those stats, you're MUCH better off with hp.  Most of the VT / ele planes FT gear comes with 100+ hp, so you don't have to make a choice if/when you get to that stage of equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually Both HP and FT are something that have fallen from the top spot to get.<br />
<br />
The big improvement comes from focus items at this stage in the game.<br />
If I would rate the things I look at in items it would be (in order from most to least important)<br />
<br />
Focus effect<br />
Resists<br />
HP<br />
FT<br />
Mana<br />
Stats<br />
<br />
FT,mana and Stats are so easy to get on items that one should really not even think about them that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">if your guild is elemental capable you can get ft8 just by geting 2 bracers  but i dont concentrate on ft as much as hp and what not :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">HP&gt;Focus&gt;FT&gt;Mana<br />
<br />
focus aint going to work very well if u are nipples up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Focus before all else.<br />
<br />
After all, we *are* casters. Our ability to cast spells is our greatest source of power. HP/AC makes sure we can live long enough to cast, same with resists, FT gives us extra mana with which we can cast more spells. <br />
<br />
However, only focus items directly improve our ability to cast. Casting haste, casting efficiency, and to a lesser extent,  extended range and even extended duration changes the game for a shaman more than anything else.<br />
<br />
Spell haste is irreplacable once you get it. How many times have your target died 1 sec before you can land a heal? How many times have you died 1 sec before you can finish casting root/turgur/heal? A high hp/ac shaman who died because he couldn't finish a spell is equally useless compard to a cardboard shaman who died because he doesn't have enough hp/ac to take punishment.<br />
<br />
Casting efficiency is more effective than FT during the short term. If your mana preservation item has a high percentage, it can equal or surpass FT in the long run as well.<br />
<br />
Extended range and extended duration have relatively smaller impact, but they still grant abilities that you otherwise will not have.<br />
<br />
HP is still important. In fact, I'd rank it below casting haste and casting efficiency focus effects. However, there comes a point where anyone who doesn't have defensive gets creamed in 1 or 2 rounds (about 1.5 secs) if they get agro--hp only goes so far.<br />
<br />
For a class like shaman, who has unsurpassed class based mana regen, FT merely translates to more damage over time. Focus items, on the other hand, increases the fundamental effectiveness of every single spell that falls under the influence of those effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Priorities change as you progress in the game. When you first hit 60 and are in the kurnak dragon, Ntov, Tier 1 stages of the game hps are pretty important since you need to make sure you have enough hps to safely cann v.<br />
<br />
On the other hand by the time your in the elemental planes hps aren't as big a deal since pretty much everything your looking at is 100+ if not 125+ hps so the thing that makes peices stand out is focus effects and resists.<br />
<br />
As far as FT specifically goes I personally feal that by the time that you can reasonably get ft items it isn't really an issue since they have pretty good stats to go along with them. Before Ssra/vt/elemental planes FT items are fairly rare and can have some pretty bad stats but your odds of getting one are pretty low. By the time FT items become more common they also have good stats to go along with them.<br />
<br />
For the original poster i'd say consider working on the 8th shawl if you can stand the tradeskills (tailoring isn't nearly as bad with LoY) and possibly try getting a dain war necklace. That would almost double your FT. Your belt isn't particularly good either so a BoT ft belt wouldn't be bad. Other than that I would just wait till your guild gets shots at ssraa ft items or ya get into VT. Judging by your ring/boots you shouldn't be too far away from starting to hit those areas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'd have to agree with Boinshar.  Focus items are the most important things to go for at this late stage in the game.  FT is certainly nice, but I'd place it a clear second place behind HP.  <br />
<br />
Focus items help me the most out of my gear.  I get the ones that have a lot of hps/mana anyway.  But one of my gimpier items is a shield with decent but not spectacular hps, no resists, and decent but not great stats.  The reason I wanted it?  Affliction Efficiency IV.  MAN did that item ROCK before the affliction focus nerf <br />
/cry<br />
I had 33% savings on half the spells I cast!  Anything that wasn't a buff or a heal got hugely reduced in price  . . . oh how I was pissed when they nerfed that . . . grrrrr!<br />
Now it's just DoTs that get lowered in price.  But honestly that's still worth it when I'm soloing.  33% more DoTs I can cast on the same amount of mana = POWA!  I would loot a super great shield like that one from the blob that has like 6 FT in VT.  But otherwise, I have other crappy items that still need upgrading. <br />
<br />
I think right now tho, what I really want is a mana efficiency item.  Tho that earring from mini-AHR in VT that has the FT1, mediocre stats/hps, and a 22% dmg increase in cold based nukes would be high on my list of items to loot.  Sure it sux in hps compared to a lot else, but dammit, I can nuke for 1170 dmg!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">HPs for survival &gt; FT.  HPs for mana regen &lt; FT, IMO  (up to a certain ratio of course).  I have to agree with Gloriana, go for a nice balance.  As you start to find no-drop FT items, they'll have HP on them, usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Boinshar is dead-on.  There is a distressing trend where people seem to forget the fact that shaman are, in fact, a casting class.  This leads people to denigrate things like focus items and spellcating mastery, and convince themselves that 25 hit points will save them from a PoP bossmob more often than massive increases to their spellcasting abilities would.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Aye, at the elemental planes stages of the game I'll take your word for what's most important, I sure don't know... What none of you seem to have done is to have taken a look at the original poster's magelo and give advice based on where he's at ;)<br />
<br />
I can speak on this stage of the game with some confidence, as its where I'm at.  Contrary to popular opinion, people like us don't have FT-800 items with 500hp/mana, 100 all saves, and 8 focus effects growing on trees waiting for us to pick.  We have to choose between these qualities in our gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I been in few VT run and try save up points; I want everything like FT/focus/hp, but I better focus in one area first rather than spread out<br />
<br />
if I choose to get FT15 path(items list from Juujuu, with FT+HP); those are highly competitive and more expensive item, and I will end up less hp for same point spend ; <br />
<br />
if I just simply go get every good pure hp item(100hp's), it easier and cheaper to get but almost not chance on high quality FT gear(item with FT+HP); but I have more hp at the end<br />
<br />
also similar if want get all those nice focus item, well I can't eat them all at once so ignore focus item first<br />
<br />
so I feel my hp/mana is enough for heavy duty during raid(only 2 shaman on at most); that is why I try ask here help decide if FT15(with hp at same time) is good path</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I would not worry much about FT in your position.  Focus effects are lovely, pick items with those and hitpoints to boot.  I generally stay away from FT items in hopes that those lazy clerics pick them up and hit full mana more often so we can kill stuff.<br />
<br />
My only advice on focus effects is to try and get ones that do different things so one item won't override another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If your magelo is up to date, I think it would be pretty short sighted for you to take up some mission to obtain FT15.  <br />
<br />
Perhaps it might be in your best interest to spend points on solid but very low point cost items that would get something reasonable in all your slots.  You are wearing some items that could probably be upgraded at very low DKP cost (cloak of the maelstrom, spiderfur belt, black sapphire electrum earring, tobrin's mystical eyepatch...).  <br />
<br />
Your mileage my vary, depending on your play time and your particular points system...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Looking at your magelo I would say you need more mana and FT.  You have the same HP as I do, but about 1k less mana and 7 less FT.  Mana is a really great thing to have but it isn't crucial to have a lot of it.  FT, on the other hand, is very nice.  I got the FT3 range off of burrower last night and it definately a big bonus and I'm glad I got it.  Your gear should be balanced between HP, mana, and FT, and right now you are way overbalanced for HP.  That is just my opinion though, your mileage my vary based on play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am at the stage where I need to ease back and try to make sure that the nex upgrades that I get have focus effects.<br />
<br />
I hit effective FT 14 without trying (FT9 + MC3 + lunar whispers). Infact I would have hit raw FT15 awhile ago if I had wanted a High Priest shield rather than a 41% Haste shield.<br />
<br />
ATM I have 30% Beneficial spell haste (VT legs) and 20% longer buffs (8th shawl). But now I will have to turn down upgrades until I can get Improved Healing 4, Mana Pres 4, Detrimental Spell Haste (for Debuffs), Spell Extension Items (benefical/detrimental or both).<br />
To get those will mean turning down lots of perfectly good gloves/face/earrings/cloaks/rings with lots of HP/Mana and/or FT. (Those slots are the only ones that need upgrading on me ATM).<br />
<br />
I am thinking of holding out for a Crown of Ambivalence as that is one of the only two items in EQ that will extend Torpor/Quiesance. And maybe the Terris-Thule Mask for IH4 and Carved Bone Ring for Mana Pres. (Or a combination of VT items that would give me a higher saving for both Detrimental and Benefical spells).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I haven't run out of mana since getting Cann5 but I do run out of hitpoints constantly. Given a choice between say a FT3 or a 100hp item for a slot, I'd take the hitpoints every time.</div></div><hr />
