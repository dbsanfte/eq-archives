<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The Taliban and Al Queda cannot stand nudity and consider it<br />
a sin to see a naked woman that is not one's wife.<br />
<br />
Next Saturday afternoon, at 2:00 p.m. EST, all North American<br />
women are asked to walk out of their houses completely naked to<br />
help weed out any neighborhood terrorists. Circling your block<br />
for one hour is recommended for this anti terrorist effort.<br />
<br />
All men should position themselves in lawn chairs in front of<br />
their homes to prove that they think it's OK to see other women<br />
nude. (Since the enemy does not approve of alcohol, a cold six-pack at your side is further proof of your anti Taliban sentiment.)<br />
<br />
Notify the appropriate authorities of any people who do not<br />
participate. Your efforts to root out terrorists will be greatly<br />
appreciated and indicate your desire to demonstrate your<br />
patriotism.<br />
<br />
To achieve 100% participation, forward this note to other<br />
similar minded patriots.<br />
<br />
Remember: Be Patriotic - Be Safe - Be Naked</div></div><hr />
