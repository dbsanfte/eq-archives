<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long time guild friend has talking to me, telling me to get to his group because he wanted a haste. 'Mate, you do realise there are haste potions? f**king hell!! Was the reply... <br />
<br />
He is wiling to pay massive amounts of cash for:<br />
<br />
Haste Potions<br />
Gate to Innothule Potions<br />
Regen Potions<br />
<br />
And he is also gonna dump cash into my bank in order for me to train from level 80 to 160+ in alchemy<br />
<br />
GO FRIENDS!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Atlet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Lucky :)<br />
<br />
Not many are willing to purchase our haste potions due to the cost / alts most have.<br />
<br />
Then again, you charge extra to friends?  Hehe even ones that are willing to pl ya skill? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not charging extra :P <br />
<br />
Where did i say that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>brett_sc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">&quot;He is wiling to pay massive amounts of cash&quot;<br />
<br />
Just means he really, really wants them. Whether you actually accept what he is willing to pay is another issue entirely :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">:P Went i meant massive amounts of cash i mean he wants huge quantities of them, im talking 30/40 stacks of haste potions and 20 of regen, and another 20 stacks of gate potions... wanna do the maths?<br />
<br />
/em is rolling in platinum</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Lots of people have plat to blow :) my guild is the same way for Calimony potions (i.e. Complete Heal potions if you have 2).  I charge out the ass for those (600 because farming IG's SUCKS) but it's worth while that's for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dont Farm IG's! Too hard! Farm Gornit, 7 min repop and drops them about 1 in 2/3. Plus exp from SF clops :).<br />
<br />
p.s. he has lots of plat cos he buys it with £ lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no xp<br />
<br />
always camped<br />
<br />
<br />
Nope, I'll do IG's ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
Definitely say Gornit.  Gornit is a 2 ebolt kill, or a slow and some bracer blasts.  Ice Giants resist or take limited damage from JBB, and are typically just as camped in my experience.  Camping Gornit while pulling Seafuries for exp is much better in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I've been getting a yellow (or more) a day while killing seafuries AND camping Gornit at 53 AND earning over 1kpp each session.  (This is actually a low estimate, as all the seafury gem drops go to my spouse who is an enchanter.  You would likely earn ~2kpp a day selling all loot.) YMMV<br />
<br />
If Gornit is already camped, politely ask the camper how long they'll be there and ask for a tell when they are about to leave. Check in every hour or so with a friendly comment just to keep your name in their mind.  Kill Seafuries (or the Allizewsaur) until then.  If the Gornit camper isn't leaving soon, ask them if they will let you buy the toes for a few pp each.  They sell for around ~1pp to a vendor.<br />
<br />
Once you have the camp, save a few of ALL the variety of toes.  I've been camping Gornit for some time, and sold different toes to mages and other questers for ~100pp for two toes several times (their offers, not my greed).  I've also GIVEN away toes to those who ask nicely.<br />
<br />
My alchemy is at 102.  Eventually I'll max it with Grow potions.  I have a mule (named Toeholder) who is stuffed full of toes (all bank and inventory bags) right now, so I no longer keep them myself.  I sell them to vendors, after asking any other fellow Mystics in the zone if they are seeking out toes.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If he is willing to dump cash in your account so you can get your skill up, he is paying a major premium for the potions.  My 2 coppers now thrown in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He likes me :) what can i say? He'll quit the game long before i do, he wants to give someone some enjoyment before he dumps EQ :P</div></div><hr />
