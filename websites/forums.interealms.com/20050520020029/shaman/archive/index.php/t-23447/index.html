<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im thinking of getting my guild to start doing some raids in tier 1 planes. Im wondering how many people of which levels will I need to kill Grummus, the PoI mob to get flagged for the Factory, and the Behemoth, and possibly Terris Thule. Any advice or strategies I should know about the encounters before I suggest this to anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  Get lots of clerics<br />
2.  Get a great tank<br />
3.  Work your resists<br />
4.  Prepare to fail alot<br />
5.  Wait till OoW comes out, hit level 70, and zoom to Time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">IINM, Magnetic Behemoth allows for 72 muldoons. If this will be your first time - BRING 72.  Even if you have to invite friends of the guild, do so.<br />
<br />
Explain (as was mentioned above) that this may not go well. You will always have some bitchers and moaners. That's fine, what you are doing is identifying a strategy to take him down. Because eventually you'll be whacking him with 36 and not 72.<br />
<br />
Be concerned but not obsessed with loot. You aren't going to lose a raid simply because the MA doesn't have Uber_P}{4t_L3wtz_01.  Eventually also (and this will happen sooner than you realize) what MB drops will be rotting or going to alts.<br />
<br />
There was a very good thread about progression from Crushbone to Time. Look it up.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've done Grummus with about 35.  The clerics, two of the tanks, and about 7 other people were EP or Time geared (about half of the raid.)<br />
<br />
Generally, you won't resist his AoE spells.  The best thing to do is time MGB EE, SoTW, and Paragon so that they hit when the big AoE does.  <br />
<br />
Look on Illa's for more info, I don't remember the timing of the AE spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the factory, i'd say around 20 people is enough, if decently geared and skilled.<br />
<br />
MB is one of the hardest mobs pre-Rallos Zek.  I'd say you would need 50+ if your guild hasn't done much PoP raiding.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule isn't too hard.  Just bring 4 good kiters, and plenty of wizards.  TT's DPS is laughable.  Plus you can debuff her before you engage.<br />
<br />
If you'd like more specific info, tell me and i'll post it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and check out www.scienceofwar.net/strats/   ...great webpage for what you are looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the tips guys. Although, my guild isnt exactly equipped very well. Mostly bazaar and LDoN gear I think. A few people have ornate though.<br />
<br />
Loot isnt an issue. We will most likely roll NBG.<br />
<br />
Ill check out that site, thanks for the link Foramorm.<br />
<br />
...doh, I dunno if all that many people in our guild have MGB. I dont yet. Guess I better get working on that, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For druids, Spirit of the Wood and Mass Group Buff should be top priorities.<br />
<br />
For clerics, healing AA's, EE, and MGB.<br />
<br />
Beastlords need to have MGB and Paragon.<br />
<br />
Anyone that is able should have Radiant Cure as well.<br />
<br />
Paladins, Enchanters, Clerics, Shaman, Druids, Rangers, Beastlords should all have MGB..<br />
<br />
Sorry for rambling, i'm tired ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, guess I gotta work on Radiant Cure and MGB then. Thanks for the tips :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You'll love radiant cure after you get it.  No more mem'ing cure disease or remove curse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">6.  Start farming GoD minis and random drops.  Gear your people up that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Danemoth Spiritconvoker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yeah, thats probably a good idea. After reading through that website, I somehow doubt my guild could handle grummus. Without slow he'd tear through our tanks. Maybe getting more people into LDoN would help too to get their 1495 point armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Grummus is easy, you just have to make sure you have enough healers to keep a MGB HoT up, and that you have a good tank, and decent DPS.<br />
<br />
You should probabbly have a guild vote or something, and decide who your guild's main tank will be (if you haven't already.)  He needs to be skilled, and active player.<br />
<br />
Then, focus on gearing him up.  A solid tank (or three) can make or break a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The science of war site is superb and their tactics are mostly very solid.<br />
<br />
Grummus:<br />
Fairly easy tactically, but you need a decent enough tank, enough DPS to kill him before the dots kill you, and some mgb heals over time can really make or break the raid. Probably want about 40+ people levels 60-65 including a core of 65 Warrior MT and a few 65 clerics for the first goes, but is doable with around 30 at your level once you know what you're doing.<br />
<br />
Terris Thule:<br />
Very easy mob for even a small, moderately equipped guild. Its all about the tactics and timing, so be prepared to wipe a few times at first learning the script, but once learnt its a doddle. Key tip: Illusion enchanters as ogres and have everybody standing by enchanters for the butterfly phase as they AE stun.<br />
<br />
Probably want 30+ for first attempt, 24+ subsequently.<br />
<br />
Xanamech:<br />
Easiest of the lot and really good fun clearing up to him. I'd suggest doing this as your first raid. 24+ for first attempt, 18+ subsequently.<br />
<br />
Manaetic Behemoth:<br />
He's a toughy and with your levels/AA/gear you will likely want 45-50 people at least. I wouldn't even attempt it until you've done all of the above at least twice. Once you've got the hang of it 30-35 is probably enough, any less than that and handling the spiders plus getting him killed fast becomes very hard without some EP+ gear.<br />
<br />
Don't forget you need the PoN maze before you can do TT. Also, try raiding some of the other mini-named such as Vahksiz the Shade (PoN) and the manaetic Prototypes (POI factory).</div></div><hr />
