I can't resist, i am too proud about it:<br />
<br />
Last Sunday, at the 6th of April 2003, me and 8 more fellow members of <br />
Thunder on the Innoruuk Server managed to get me this famous last 8th Cudgel :)<br />
<br />
Hoorray!<br />
<br />
<br />
It was an easy cakewalk because of using all the tips here in this forum.<br />
<br />
We used a 65 Shadowknight to pull, he brought VS and 2 Arisens, we killed them easily.<br />
Than after Rile spawned again (for trading in) my Level 61 Iksar Monk<br />
 Zargh Shadowfist pulled the last 2 Arisens.<br />
Exxos went into the room, only one respawned mob out of range, so he managed to give <br />
the old cudgel and the looted head without any problem.<br />
The rest was killing the pulled mobs, and after finishing we gated and ported out.<br />
<br />
Thank you again fellow Thunders. :)<br />
Hakuna Matata!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">A couple months after the 6th cudgel went live I finished the quest.  Still holding the 6th cudgel.  After at least a year of needing to do the hole I completed the hole on Friday Sept 13 and killed Neh on Monday Sept 15.  Now almost 7 months later I still need the tear from fear.</div></div><hr />
