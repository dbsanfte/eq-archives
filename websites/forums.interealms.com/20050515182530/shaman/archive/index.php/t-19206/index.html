<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I got Bane finally, and I like it.  <br />
<br />
I like most the ability to damage mobs via a different line of resist.  So, if other zones like Veksar pop up, I have a pretty tool to respond.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm curious if folks who got Bane also got Anathema?  Was it worth it? or is that doubling up really a waste of points?<br />
<br />
I did buy Odium because it was so darn cheap, which may have been a mistake.  Anathema is a bit more, but I've typically subscribed to the school of thought that you should always get all your spells, whatever they may be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I didn't bother buying it and saved up for Bane first. Don't think I'll bother getting it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Apothian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I ahve Anthema as well as Bane and I think its not an urgent priority.<br />
Its nice when you rarely can have spell gems enough for it but your gaurenteed to get aggro.   I kite with my roommate sometimes (65wizz) and I cast BoS, ASoN, Bane, Anthema and sometimes Bane of Nife.  This KILLS mana  but there is no way he is ever getting aggro back.<br />
<br />
Its not a must for 65 unless you solo alot of undead ie Veksar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got both and enjoy both. Specially in ldons.<br />
They will also be useful on mobs that are very poison or disease resistant. Bot wind etc..<br />
And we can do some damage on bigger named that resist our current dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I bought it right after I bought Bane.  Whenever I'm really stacking dots on a mob, I prefer to do Bane/Blood of Saryrn/Ancient Scourge, but if I'm fighting a mob that absolutely must stay rooted (pofire magma guardians or doomfires, for example) then I do Bane/Anathema/Blood of Saryrn, because ancient breaks root with its DD component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I broke down and got both Bane and Anathema.  I've been playing around with them a bit.  I think Bane and Blood of Saryn is a better two DoT combination since Blood of Saryn can be mused on alot more monsters simultaneously, very handy if you are doing big pulls in a normal LDoN adventure.<br />
<br />
Bane and Anathema seems superior though on hard missions where stuff doesn't die so fast and you don't have a whole mess of awake monsters in camp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice for soloing or kiting.  I got it and use it for kiting or root/rotting in PoFire to keep my DPS up.  I'd say it's nice, but certainly not a must-have by any means.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you solo a lot go for it, if you do not you will not miss it. Or at least I don't but them i rarely even use Bane in groups  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got it, use it when soloing and root/rotting. Blood/Bane/Anathema. No DD root breaks that way. Stuff dies fast. For actual exp groups I might use Bane, Blood has too much aggro, other dps spell would be a nuke, usually poison, or a rain. If I feel like going nuts and no enchanters I just use rains. So it's really only useful to me soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I bought anathema mostly for the mobs that resist posion a lot (lot of ssra bosses).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zammatacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I bought them both, mainly because I'm one of &quot;those&quot; that has a goal of a 100% complete spellbook.<br />
<br />
I know to some it's a stupid goal.  For me, it floats my boat.<br />
<br />
Be safe and well in your travels everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I got it, but I can't say that I have had many occasions to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got it recently and I have not decided whether I like it or not.  You can stack it with bane on high hp xp mobs on occasion and draw less aggro than using saryn, but deep down I still think straight up nuking is probably more efficient aggro and time wise, if not mana wise.  Anathema is less efficient on mana than Bane by a pretty large margin too.  <br />
I basically got it for those times when MR based spells are the only real option for damage, like certain PoP giant types etc.   Also I 2 box with my monk sometimes and needed a lower aggro damage source, because its very difficult for the monk to take aggro from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I got both, if for no other reason than it makes soloing in Veksar a snap, heck I dont even have to have dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">also bought both, just had to have a complete spell book.  It works well in certain situations where pr/dr dots wont work.  It also adds to my arsenal of DoTs that DO NOT break root, which is useful when I VP3 root kite at tables in PoFire.  <br />
<br />
There are uses for it, but they're not widespread.  I'd say get it if u feel like it would be useful to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I bought Bane, Anathema, Odium and Curse - the latter two just for the sake of it. I do sometimes use both Bane and Anathema, but mostly just use Bane.<br />
<br />
It depends on the situation. If mobs last just long enough for Bane and/or Anathema to last 5 ticks, then I tend to keep Bane and Anathema up. If Bane is resisted, I can still do decent damage with Anathema, but the mobs die too quickly to make Blood of Saryrn worth casting.<br />
<br />
If mobs are taking a little longer to die, then I use BoS over Anathema.<br />
<br />
Note: If Blood of Saryrn only runs for 5 ticks (same duration as Anathema), or less, then Anathema is more efficient in terms of damage per mana. It's still only marginally more efficient than Velium Strike, but I prefer dots to nukes because I can be doing other things.<br />
<br />
For PoFire kiting groups, I pile on the damage as many dots as I can (and have fun seeing if the druid can hold agro from me :)). Similarly for soloing, but without using dots with the DD component that can break root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>soldieint</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Bane is ghay, why not lower the resist check on it and give it a 3 sec recast time insted of those 24 sec... It allrdy cost alot of mana  to cast...shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I've gotten both Bane and Anathema.  High mana cost with long recast times, but even so, I'd recommend them both, especially if you ever hunt alone... With a Rallican's Steel Bracer (or other BA4 item), I've seen ticks for over 500hp using Bane.  Stacking Bane, Anathema and BoS on the Ogres in PoTactics and they melt even before VP3 fades...<br />
<br />
Also, curse dots carry less agro than poison dots.  So while using Bane in a group you can land it earlier than BoS and avoid agro...and unless you're in a fast killing dps group, land it early and it may even have a chance to run its duration.<br />
<br />
They check against magic so Malos helps on resists...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">If i do Bane + BoS I seem too draw agro more often than I do with Bane + Anathema . Yes i bought it and I use it semi often .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">There are uses for it, but they're not widespread.  I'd say get it if u feel like it would be useful to you.<br />
<br />
I agree. I wont get it due to the resists. It's a Curse is should have a - MR but not.   In Pvp its still useless for me so never bothered.</div></div><hr />
