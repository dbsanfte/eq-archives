<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just bored and wondering if any of you guys have ever collected/painted/played Warhammer 40k. I used to from about 11-12/13 and i collected Blood Angles (Might be called something different in USA, i'm from UK-Nottingham). I even created a playing filed thing about 2metres squared. Spent like 80 quid on it then decided to quit, never used it and its still in our Garage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I play ... I collect Dark Eldar and Orks primarily ... my brother has a Dark Angels and my buddy has Blood Angels (yes... they're called Blood Angels here in the US as well ... tho I just call them &quot;targets&quot;).  Been playing for 7 years or so myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe, but remember Blood Angels were noce the head of all angels (inc the blue commoners, for their names). They used to be annoying though cuz warhammer red paint is pathetic ( needs 2-3 coats to make it look half decent). I used to be quite the paniters too, used fiery orange to tint and everything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I remember spending un-Godly amounts of money on Warhammer, and then getting approximately 1/3 of it back when I sold the set after I got bored.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey good memories ! 6 or 8 years ago i was deep into it , but mostly warhammer , i am more medieval .... had wood elves , chaos , necros ..... started some tyranides for 40K as well . the best part was painting a full army and battling it against another painted army in a specialized shop , it was pretty nice )<br />
<br />
Hadd.<br />
i still got all of my figs , somewhere in my parents garage i presume ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ive still got the board and all my Tyranid models... like, 5k points old rules. Gave up when new rules came out, decided it was waste of money. Forked over more than 200 quid easy, sadly. Gonna keep them though, i have fond memories</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">i loved space hulk too , made up for fun games with friends :)<br />
blood bowl was fun but never really caught my attention too long ... <br />
i used to play necromunda too , have like 3 different gangs ready to battle )<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent all my hard earned money on Warhammer/40k many years ago.. I learnt a very valuable lesson. ..Dont spend all your money on a game, hang on what are sony charging me, damn thought I had it figured out by now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Charrles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love this game, but as others said it is expensive. my friends and I often end up using substitute miniatures, because one of my friends has collected stuff from 40k, warhammer, and a million other games, but we only have 3 complete 2k point armies, dark angels, space wolves, and tau.<br />
<br />
We generally play large battles, with up to 6 people, so we don't have enough armies, so we improvise. I enjoy painting miniatures myself, and I would probably collect them even if I didn't play 40k, but I can't really afford a whole army, and how can I tell which army to make when I haven't played them?<br />
<br />
I mostly keep my miniature painting and 40k playing somewhat seperate, I get 40k miniatures and use them if I'm playing the right army, but I'm the kind of person who can't settle with one choice until I've experienced everything.<br />
<br />
I love the game, but $20+ per squad is a bit much, I mean I'm looking at maybe $400 for a full army. And that's just one set-up can't even change my army much there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I love Warhammer/Warhammer40K.  EQ is a very fun game, but nothin seems to get me goin better than putting brush and paint to stuff.  It is quite a release.  As a matter of fact on my desk right now i have a Furioso Dread and a Skaven Screaming Bell.  I paint while I med, lol.  Sometimes I go all out and canni up, but takin a break to paint actually seems better than straight grindin'.  <br />
