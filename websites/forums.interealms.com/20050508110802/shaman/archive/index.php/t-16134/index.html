<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the deal with the pathing on our pets? Do they intentialy make out pets retarded or what. I mean im trying to solo in tactics today, i saw a necro and a mage aggro kite up and downt he stairs so i figure, hey, that looks fun. So i fo out and get a serrated dirk and pet pet gear and begin my lil kite ( beats root and rot ). So i do the same thing both the mage and necro do, i get aggro and sick pet on and go downt he stairs. Halfway down my dog turns loco and just runs up and down in the same spot, stuck. This isnt the first time this happened either, its been happening forever, i remember back when doing low 50's in neriak was the hot ticket, my pet would run off and get lost when i saw a mage pet just follow a straight path to the target. <br />
<br />
Mage and necro have always to me seemed to have smart pets that fro the most part dont get lost or stuck in stupid places. So whats the deal? Is there a reason that i missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I always figured it was because the pets were on the ground. Shrink our wolf and he can't climb even the tiniest of stairs but shrink a magician/necromancer pet and they path the stairs just fine.<br />
<br />
They just need to make levitate work on pets and it'll all be fixed. Plus a flying doggie would impress the ladies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thats a possible answer actualy. More then a frustrated rant i just need to understand it. Its dumb stuff that have no reason behind them that i cant deal with :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">so, grow the pet a few sizes?  it would be an interesting test.  i hope the added size doesn't cause agro-range problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't grow our pet.<br />
<br />
Casting grow on our pet = shrink.<br />
<br />
Thx sony</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes you can....<br />
<br />
Grow once = shrink<br />
<br />
Grow twice = shrink<br />
<br />
Grow three times = grow<br />
<br />
Grow 4 times = grow<br />
<br />
and so on and so on...sometimes takes like 10 casts to hit max size, but they can indeed be grown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm, how big is the max size?  You see, there's this wolf in BoT deep south....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ribbon of Empathy = the win<br />
<br />
It can be used from inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The ribbon is nice, but it only helps to get your pet from point A to point B - it won't help it run up and down stairs when agro-kiting.  I have a Silverflank Belt in inventory for those few times it's needed - it's better because of the insta-cast.<br />
<br />
I'll have to try the grow trick, should be fun to have a huge wolf pet and shrink me and lizzy...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I honestly think our pet has its patthing issues so Its less usefull than mage, necro, bl pets. Maybe some kind of balancing issue? You think it would be fixed by now if they wanted to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Soulcraver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Jasha,<br />
<br />
Silverflank belt is Nec/Mage useable how is a shammy using it.  And it is two second cast not insta cast.  And you can't summon once the pet is on some mob's hate list, so it won't work for this situation either.<br />
<br />
My observation is that the all shammy dogs were hit by cars and knocked senseless and could never find their way ever since.  P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sarridon,<br />
<br />
you're right about the NEC/MAG thing, i was confused and was thinking about my 54 nec... i wonder if shammy can use from inventory like the prenerf fungi staff.  it's been so long since i used it, i just looked at alla and the cast time was changed from instant to 2 secs...<br />
<br />
anyway, thanks for the correction, this will teach me to respond to a thread past 2 in the morning :)<br />
<br />
but the point is, for agro-kiting, a ribbon or silver belt won't help.</div></div><hr />
