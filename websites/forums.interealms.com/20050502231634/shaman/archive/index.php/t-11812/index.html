--The Problems with Everquest and the High End Game. <br />
<br />
By-Sneekii-Feenin Ro <br />
<br />
For many of you out their EQ plays a large part in your everyday life. If fact odds are if your reading this you probably encountered this essay while surfing EQ related sites. Everquest for many is an escape. For some it is their life. For myself EQ is my leisure time. EQ keeps me home from the bars and spending a lot of money. Before I played EQ I would normally go out to local bars and nightclubs 3 to 5 times a week. EQ has given me a hobby that is relatively inexpensive compared to most others. I started playing EQ in 1999 and continue to play to this day. I am a 28 year old Customer Relations Manager for The Germain Motor Corp. with a 3 year old son to an ex-girlfriend. My EQ playtime is roughly 3 to 5 hours a night 3 to 4 times a week. We all know that many have succumbed to the lure of EQ regardless of Age,Title,Race,Gender, or Location. The reason I have provided so much information on myself is so one can better see my position on this subject. <br />
<br />
EQ in general is a fantastic game which takes you into a fantasy world shared by many others from around the world. When EQ first came out it was filled with danger and fear of the unknown. You had to tread carefully and keep track of where you went and how you got their. Monsters and creatures loomed at every turn. While many of these aspects remain today their impact has been greatly lessened. Now we jump ahead 3 years to the current state of EQ. Today EQ for me and many others consists of one of two things. You either spend your time slowly grinding away at levels or you adventure with friends or guilds after dragons and other boss type encounters. Many people reading this might be asking themselves 'What is the problem?' . <br />
<br />
--THE PROBLEM <br />
Today in EQ over 80% of the gaming population has achieved the level of 50 to 65. Now by the time they reach these levels they generally have had their fill of experience grinding and desire to encounter high end content (Dragons,Bosses,Gods etc.). The problem is that High end bosses and dragons are not available. <br />
<br />
Generally most Dragons,Bosses,Gods, and other high end raid type encounters spawn one to 2 times a week. When they do the guild with the most players that can get to them the fastest get to kill them. We will call this the Dragon Race. To have a shot at encountering these high level events one must participate in this dragon race. To be successful at this a guild or group must be online for numerous hours tracking and running from encounter to encounter trying to outrun others and even if they succeed they usually have others breathing down their back and hoping that they will fail and sometimes even helping them to fail. I fell this problem came about when travel became easy in EQ. No longer did people have to travel but simply ask to be teleported. <br />
<br />
As I stated earlier my life is rather hectic and I do have obligations and such that I must attend to outside of the game as do many others. Even with those obligations I feel my playtime is above average compared to many. With EQ in its current state friends or guilds cannot plan out any raid attempts and are left with experience grinding while the groups and players who play quite a bit more go around killing boss after boss 30 min after they spawn. I personally don't recall any fantasy book or movie having the fearless adventurers turned back by a ravenous force of campers or charging into the dungeon to kill the vile dragon only to find that he was not home. What this effectively does is cater to the powergamer and clockwatchers and takes away from the casual players. As bad as this may seem their is a solution. <br />
<br />
--THE SOLUTION <br />
The solution to this problem is rather simple and has already been experimented with by Sony. The solution is to make all Boss,Dragons, and God type encounters triggered either via quest or some form of turn in. This works very well with Ragefire and enables someone who does not have the time to sit in a zone for 18 hours watching for a spawn and hoping he has enough friends on to kill the beast. This takes nothing from the heavy players since they still play more which equals more shots at mobs. What is does allow is people to take on more challenging content when they are the most powerful and on their own timetable. Now I know many of you out their are wondering how to balance this? <br />
<br />
Balance is simple. Lets use the well known Vindicator or Kael. Now he actually spawns quite often however he is highly contested. To spawn Vindicator perhaps one much acquire an item that drops off of ANY mob in the zone. So for a guild to be able to kill vindicator they would be required to spend time in the zone killing other giants and taking faction hits to get said item and spawn vindicator. This would also balance the faction system and prohibit cross factioning to kill the rare bosses. Lets also use another example in Lord Nagafen of Nagafens Lair. Lets say we place a scared peasant NPC outside of the zone who is looking for his daughter and fears she may have been taken by nagafen. All that he has found so far is half of her pendant. Now lets say that any mob in Nagafens Lair can drop the other half of the pendant. Once acquired you hand the pendant to the peasant and he asks you to kill nagafen to help get his daughter back. The shortly after Lord nagafen will spawn with a full Fire Giant spawn as well. Obviously these are just examples but they do show how such a system could be put in place and how a great deal of storyline can be added to the game. <br />
<br />
While reading this many people might say that by adding such a system you would have too many boss mobs and dragons being killed and loot entering the world too fast. Well to ensure that this doesn't not happen you simply control the d\frequency of the item you need. If for example the necklace only drops 1 or 2 times a week then you will only have naggy dieing 1 or 2 times a week. The advantage however is that people can form and schedule with friends for such an event. <br />
<br />
Now I do understand that these guilds and groups that continually farm these events and encounters would not welcome such a change. What needs to be understood is that EQ is a game for everyone and should not be geared towards powergaming. That being said powergaming still rewards someone by giving them more time to get items to spawn bosses and attempt them. The key to this system is placing the necessary quests on random things and in areas where people of the appropriate level can gain experience while doing the quest or searching for the items. <br />
<br />
-- THE RESULT <br />
The result of such a system would be grand. You would see more roleplaying enter EQ. Guild fighting and shouting across zones would lessen. The days of 90% of EQ high end content being gobbles up within 72 hours of a patch would be gone. Powerful guilds of freinds and people who work well together yet might have busy lives could attempt and defeat these encounters when they want as opposed to spending hours waiting around hoping for a chance. I also feel we would see less and less frustrated people leave EQ. <br />
<br />
THE DOWNFALL <br />
The downfall of this system is that the players who continually farm these encounters would not be able to kill as many and would need to devote resources to something other than killing dragon after dragon. However they would still have the advantage of acquiring and doing these quests more often and still get a chance to kill more creatures. <br />
<br />
CONCLUSION <br />
In conclusion one might say that this system would create a sort of harmony among EQ players. Guilds would send out their troops in group format to different zones in hope of gaining an item or items that would allow them to try an encounter on a Dragon or God. Since the drops would come off random mobs one could not camp a certain mob but would gain experience in certain zones while hoping for these items. It would also allow people to fail or succeed at their own pace. Hopefully at least games in the future will handle this scenario correctly and succeed where EQ has failed.<br />

DISCLAIMER: I did not right this..Sneekii wrote it...I liked the idea somewhat and thought it might make a good discussion.   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All you did was remove the race to the dragon and replace it with a race to kill the trigger.  Or if you make the trigger a drop from a random mob you just vastly increased the time it takes anyone to kill a mob by having every mob require a time sink farming crap mobs to get a rare component.  Those mobs that can drop the component will be farmed heavy by those wanting to kill the mob.<br />
<br />
Nothing changes, its still the same crap if not worse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You didn't fully read it. The idea is that people can't just come to kael kill vindi and leave. It requires time in the zone and not just certain mobs but ANY mob can drop the item for the vindi spawn. So it's not like killing Prots of Zek only. That would unfortunately be a huge change in EQ's style though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bolthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Disclaimer:  First I didn't write this....I copied it from the Fennin Ro server board.  :)<br />

<br />
All you did was remove the race to the dragon and replace it with a race to kill the trigger. Or if you make the trigger a drop from a random mob you just vastly increased the time it takes anyone to kill a mob by having every mob require a time sink farming crap mobs to get a rare component. Those mobs that can drop the component will be farmed heavy by those wanting to kill the mob. <br />
<br />
<br />
So how would this be any different than waiting 72+ hours for a rare to spawn?  Depending on the drop rate of the item needed to spawn the rare/boss mob, there might be more of a chance to kill it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bahamute</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I dont think that is a good idea. Say some of the triggering peices were not that hard to get. I would think guilds would just farm the crap out of them. This would take away from lower level people who level in these zones. I would hate to be in kael and some guild come and and kill everything to get some turn in peice. <br />
One thing I really dont like the thoguht of is that some people could farm these peices and sell them to guilds. I think this would further ruin chances for other people. <br />
Not a good idea. Everything is fine the way it is now. I dont mind the race to get X mob. Makes things a little more fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, its 4 am so this might just be fuzzy thinking, but what if...<br />
<br />
If you participate in the kill of a big mob, you get a flag.  Once flagged, you can't kill that mob again until someone else has at least once.<br />
<br />
There would have to be some tinkering to make this work of course.  Anyone who took agro during the fight would have to be flagged not to be able to attack the mob the next time (even if they die or LD). <br />
<br />
Also, the flag would need to expire after a certain amount of time, in case there is only one guild capable (or interested in) killing a specific mob.  (Say, one day after the second spawning of the mob). <br />
<br />
It seems this would reduce the amount &quot;mob hogging&quot;.  A decrease in spawn times for some mobs might be necessary, but at least it would level the playing field a bit.  With a little ironing out could this idea work?<br />
<br />
P.S. as far as the questing for the right to kill a mob idea goes, I personally don't like it.  Just adds yet another time sink to the game, as well as the other arguments already mentioned above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There is no DOWNFALL to this idea.  If this proposal had a DOWNFALL that would mean that it was no good in the long run and would collapse.<br />
<br />
The term that the author means to use is DOWNSIDE.  A good idea or proposal can have a DOWNSIDE and still be viable.  <br />
<br />
I know that this seems nit picky, but I am a former college English professor and this is a common mistake that can lead to misunderstanding.  No slam here Bolthor, some of my best students used to make the same mistake.  At least you are thinking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually there is a much easier solution to racing and unavailable game content.<br />
<br />
Each boss should spawn every 3 hours (before you panic, continue reading).<br />
Every boss will have 3 aggro lists:<br />
(1) The aggro list we know that it exists, no change will be made to this, none is needed.<br />
(2) Temporary perma aggro list<br />
(3) Perma aggro list<br />
<br />
How it would work? Simple, same concept as the way Vox/Nagafen handle 52+ players. <br />
<br />
If a player aggroes this mob he will be on regular aggro list AND temporary aggro list. Temporary aggro list is only wiped if mob is back at it's spawn point, full health and no detrimental effects, or the mob despawns (AoW, Bertoxxulous, etc ...). Even if players is dead, logged out, zoned, whatever ... temporary list is maintained while mob is aggro and/or has negative effects. <br />
<br />
The moment mob dies, temporary list is moved to permanent list. Permanent list is erased once a week to &quot;simulate&quot; mob spawn.<br />
<br />
What will this accomplish?<br />
<br />
When a player gets on aggro list AND this player is on permanent list, he/she/it is teleported to her bindpoint. That player has to wait until perma aggro list is cleared to fight this boss again.<br />
<br />
How feasible is this?<br />
Pretty much very easy. Code base already inplace for &quot;banning&quot; players (Vox, Nagafen &amp; Coirnav). Rampage list for mobs in Ssra is already beyond player death, logout or zoneout. Basically if you on AL rampage and you die, when you get rezzed back, welp ... too bad, welcome to rampage again. This mechanism could be used for temporary list. And of course character flags can be used for permanent aggro list.<br />
<br />
Result:<br />
(1) Every guild has access to EVERY SINGLE boss mob. No more racing, no more competition for entertainment content in a PvE game. <br />
(2) Mobs will still be available to guilds like they would spawn regulary.<br />
(3) People could actually enjoy the entertainment value of EQ instead of molding their lives around the endgame. Get home from work earlier because important mob is up!</div></div><hr />

Make the item No Rent and No Drop...problem solved. :)<br />

<br />
Depends on how often the piecies are coded to drop. <br />

/shrug<br />
<br />
Just seems like it would be more fun and add a different perspective to the game, if you had to actually had to do things to cause rares/boss mobs to spawn rather than sit around checking spawn point after spawn point to see if there is a rare up. If there is a rare then ya have to try to get enough people together to race and kill it before anyone else finds out it's up. If someone else finds out it's up you have to race through the zone to get to the mob and hope the other guild doesn't train you in an attempt to get it for themselves...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SOE is already doing this in much of their newer content - particularly for encounters designed for small forces (1-3 groups).<br />
<br />
Consider the Plane of Innovation Dragon, Xanamech. You have to farm items from the zone and hand them into the gnome. Then you have to escort the gnome to the dragon. This requires a few hours time to complete. Consequently, big guilds are not able to zoom in and knock off Xanamech every time he is up. This allows smaller guilds (like mine) to plan a raid on Xanamech and fit it into our desired schedule.<br />
<br />
Consider Dromok Tok Vo'Lok, the named froglok in Plane of Storms. To spawn him you must clear the frog cave. This requires time, and prevents big guilds from killing him just because he is up and easy.<br />
<br />
Consider the final encounter in Hate's Fury. To fight the captain of the ship, you must collect 4 items from the zone and hand them over to the gnome trigger. Again, this prevents high end guilds from bottom feeding off of the boss of Hate's Fury. The only people who will be able to kill the Captain of Hate's Fury are those that really want to spend time hunting the zone.<br />
<br />
I really like content of this type, and hope to see more of it from SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The following concepts should never have entered the game in the first place:  rare spawn, random spawn, RL timed spawn, rare drop, random drop.  If you go on a quest that requires you to kill a mob to get an item - it should always be up and should always have the item.  Anything else is complete and total stupidity.<br />
<br />
&quot;Items will enter the world too fast&quot; is BS.  This is a game - limiting items by random spawntime is a half-baked idea and Brad should be drawn, quartered and have his head stuck on a pike on the Golden Gate Bridge for allowing it to be a major part of the game's design.  Item availability should only be limited by the skill of the players, not an artificial time barrier.  If every player has an epic at level 5 - good for them - they were skilled enough to get it.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, a system like this would require talent and ingenuity on the part of the programmers.  Not gonna happen at Sony.</div></div><hr />

Make the item No Rent and No Drop...problem solved<br />
<br />
How would that work???<br />
<br />
No Drop does not prevent selling (see MQ), besides you are not buying the item so much as the trigger effect of that item, which works when ANYONE hands it in.<br />
<br />
And the No Rent thing. Well, that's just dumb. It's the equivalent of making Naggy have the ability to poof at any second. <br />
<br />
&quot;Woot, we have just farmed SolB for a week and got the pendant piece! Better not go LD... Err, is anybody else on to help me fight him??&quot;<br />
<br />
I wish this idea would work, by the way, but it wouldn't - you are just replacing timesinks... although the one upside is that you could guarantee that your guild would have something to raid once you had all gathered...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Overcrowding is a serious problem.  This is especially true since the new levels trivalize so much older stuff and cram every second-tier guild into the same spot.  Since they canned the &quot;virtual encounter&quot; concept (I don't know if they canned it on play balance grounds or techncal ones), it is hard to know if VI considers it to be a problem. <br />
<br />
I say just pop every mob every 6 hours or so, but once you engage [defining engagement to avoid exploiting the system is tricky] it you get a flag that lasts, say, a week or so [could even vary by mob].  So long as you have that flag, you will be banished a la Naggy/Vox if you engage it again.  You could not have the newer mobs give flags on failures so people can try a few times to figure them out or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would think the primary reason the Dragons spawn on long timers is to controll the rate at which high end items enter the game.  From a game standpoint,  you do not want high end items flooding the world or people will just quit.<br />
<br />
If you increase the overall rate of availability of the big Dragons, regardless of method, then you have little choise but to reduce the rewards from each individual kill in order to balance the rate at which items enter the game.<br />
<br />
If nagy spawns 1 time each day then a lot of times nagy is killed it should drop almost nothing.  This resolves the problem of how fast items enter the game but the encounter is no longer balanced from a risk / reward standpoint.<br />
<br />
I personaly feel that EQ already has a big problem with becoming cartoonishly overpowered and high end drops already enter the the game way to fast.<br />
<br />
Each server has a life cycle which starts when it goes lives,  thrives as people advance towards the end-game, and then degenerates into a power trip that only a 12 year old lEEt d00d can truly enjoy.<br />
<br />
SOE has done a great job continualy extending the life of the game by adding massive amounts of new content and items.  If the original praposal was adopted, then each server would compleate it's life cycle all the faster and I just don't think this is in the economic interest of SOE.<br />
<br />
Think of all the time spent by a large number of guilds farming in NToV or ST and so on.  IF drops where dramaticly increased by improving the spawn rate then guilds would have progressed much more rapidly throught this area of the game.  Their is a very good reason SOE puts up all kinds of chalanges to be overcome, and that is they extend the life of the game.<br />
<br />
The downside of the original idea are far more extent then argued.  The current system does create problems and races and frustrations but the cure proposed would kill the patient.<br />
<br />
Any solution to this problem must at a minimum<br />
<br />
a) not impact the rate at which items enter the game.<br />
b) not distroy the risk / reward balance of individual<br />
encounters.<br />
c) not drive large numbers of high end power players out of the game.<br />
<br />
I personly think the long establish EQ servers are starting to reach the end of the life cycle.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Part of the problem here is when Sony decides to do there patches.  Lets say they down the servers at 4am pst for 5 hours.  So everything is repoped at 9am pst.  Well, guilds who are PST based are basically hosed.  Why?  Cause people have lives and Eurpoean guilds have 7-8 hours head start over PST guilds at taking bosses that spawn at server reset.  At last reset a eurpoean guild did vindi/statue/AoW, Rumblecrush, and IV before many EST based guilds were going.  And now these mobs (like RC) that are on a set timer, will always pop before PST based guilds can get them.  Why can Sony down servers at noon pst?  It will give PST and far east players a chance at the bosses up at server reset that europeans take for granted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree.  I am so sick of hearing how tough things are when EQ is far easier than it ever has been.  The point that is completely missed in the original post is this:  There are more big mobs in the game now, as more people have started playing and levelled.  The REAL problem is that so many people are 50 and above... which was casued by Sony giving in to the whiners and making this game too easy.  I remember when you had to work your ass off to get to 50, and I was stupid enough to do it with 3 characters, which took me a hell of a long time.  Now you can get someone to 50 in a week without breaking a sweat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pure and simple , i dont kike it. The thrill of these encounters is the hunt. ITs the race and the tracking of the mobs that brings so much satisfaction when you take these mobs down , if you could just spawn them , it would cheapen the experience. Right now they feel like  entity of the game , they come and go at a interval and you get your shot or not depending on how you move , like true hunters. It just makes it too easy to have a group farm up pieces to spawn these events. Ragefire was needed , a year waiting list for a epic mob was absurd , but this is not the problem we have with dragons and bosses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">the one positive thing with triggered mobs would be that it would eliminate the KS question (since atttacking someone elses quest mo has always been a big offence under PNP).  Have a &quot;safe&quot; (aka unkillable) triggermob that accepts the piece, spawns the mob and puffs.  The mob stays up for a fixed period of time (your &quot;attempt time&quot;).  You kill the mob, fine, the triggers goes away until the mob is due again.  You loose, your mob despawns and your trigger is back.<br />
Regarding the rareness of trigger spans, do it on a system similar to the new rage spawn.  It takes time to get the pieces, and dedication by a guild. Make killing Zlandi or RC more then an exercise in positioning &quot;tracking pawns&quot; in the appropriate places.</div></div><hr />

The Xano dragon only requires spending time collecting the first set to release the gnome. After that you will pick up at least one set of components while escorting him and most likely more.

Litch,<br />
<br />
how do you prevent that gnome from warping/poofing along the track? three out of four times we try this the gnome poofs somewhere along the quest route (same spot where a lot of pets get lost) and we don't get a dragon trigger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The fact that you need to spend 45 minutes escorting the gnome is a decent enough deterrant it seems. Xanamech is a last resort for you now. The loot he drops is mediocre for big guilds, but is primo for small guilds. If he was just up and standing there waiting to be killed, he would be another Va'Dyn or Restless Burrower (mobs that small guilds could easily kill for nice loot, but can never find up).<br />

My point is that PoP and LoY seem to have some thought put into this problem, unlike Luclin and previous expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Litch,<br />
<br />
how do you prevent that gnome from warping/poofing along the track? three out of four times we try this the gnome poofs somewhere along the quest route (same spot where a lot of pets get lost) and we don't get a dragon trigger.<br />
<br />
I would like to know this as well. My guild has done him three times now. First time we got dragon nicely. Second time gnome poofed shortly after starting. The last time gnome poofed right at the gate to the dragon room. That was pretty lame following him for almost an hour just to have him despawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Escorting is easy. The number one thing you have to remember is never never never block the escortee, in this case the gnome. Getting in front of him will cause him to warp and possibly poof or warp so far ahead he gets killed. Also the general strategy is just to assign at least an enchanter to him to mez him if he gets close to the fighting then memblur and let mez wear off when the fighting has moved on. We usually kill way in advance of the gnome because we know exactly where he is going and he slowly follows with mezzing as needed. Again, do NOT block him or you will have problems. That's the same rule for any escort quest.<br />
<br />
edit: oh yeah also in the gnome dragon escort case, you want to mez him right before the room and clear the room and get ready. Then memblur and let mez wear off. Once he releases the dragon do NOT memblur him again or you will not get your flag. You have to make sure he doesnt get killed at this point. I forget if he attacks you or the dragon but don't let him die. If you don't care about the flag then by all means let him die after the dragon pops. For other escort quests if the escortee is not mezzable just have someone aggro and tank then memblur when ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">i like that idea to a point. i personaly hate the time consuming part of eq (tradeskills  the such sitting round hours with nothing to kill cause  we got every thing  worth killing yesterday) i would like to see more loot added to   what have been called trash mobs nothing great leave that to the boss mobs  but something would be cool .<br />
<br />
the origonal idea would be encreadable  for this game if  the mobs still spawned normaly.  dain in icewell is a perfact example  he spawns normaly but he can be triggerd  with one of the final steps in the shawl quest. but his bigged drops depends on the spawn of another king (that cant be triggerd to  get the belt<br />
<br />
if ya kill the race ya kill the game for somepeople aginst  guilds that are not just a bunch  of half wits(guild with the honor to back out if you beat them with the force) i truly enjoy the race<br />
<br />
some should remain race only  a 30/70 (trigger/race) deal would be great</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Several good points were made on the rogue board about this.<br />
<br />
Most of eq is not PVP and thus shouldnt be a race against other guilds, if you want that, go to a PVP server where it truly is a race.  For those of us who want PVE which is what the servers are then we shouldnt have to race for spawns.  There is no real competiton in racing to a mob first, what does that prove?  That your guild has more time on its hands?  You getting there quicker has no bearing on your leet uber skills or that you are better than anyone else.  Not everyone has the same desire to play the game as a race, why should we have to play your way?<br />
<br />
The top guilds grind through the content at a speed no one else matches, how would it shorten the time that non uber guilds eat up content?  Sure they might get more loot but how does that hurt anyone else?  Arent we all in this game to enjoy it and kill dragons or whatever boss mob?  If my guild was able to get to uncontested spawns whenever they wanted we still would be leaps and bounds behind the uber guilds because we still wouldnt spend the same amount of time raiding and it wouldnt shorten our stay, it would lengthen it because we were having more fun.<br />
<br />
They need to come up with a way to give everyone a chance on mobs, simultaneous versions of the same zone or whatever.  Everyone deserves a chance to have fun, not just the people with too much time on their hands.</div></div><hr />

Folks, EQ end-game is for single guys/girls who have heaps of free time.  Being in a relationship or having kids really should exclude you from the 'uber side' of EQ as there just isn't time.  Even if you play at night for 3-5 hours, there is an opportunity cost there.  Whether that is hanging with the woman or doing the dishes, or playing with the kid; there is only so much free time at night.<br />

<br />
Exactly !   But why should it be that way? Why not give those who don't have a lot of time a chance to experience killing a high-end mob?<br />
<br />
I like the idea of 30/70 triggered spawn/timed spawn thing....that would give everyone atleast a chance to have some fun in the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No Drop does not prevent selling (see MQ), besides you are not buying the item so much as the trigger effect of that item, which works when ANYONE hands it in.<br />
<br />
And the No Rent thing. Well, that's just dumb. It's the equivalent of making Naggy have the ability to poof at any second. <br />
 <br />
<br />
Good point.  Maybe use the triggered/timed spawn concept instead....although it would still allow for farming and selling of the items needed to trigger the mob.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think having the mobs spawn more wouldn't necessarily fix the problem either, you would still have people farming the mobs for items to sell or for twinks. <br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine the following:<br />
<br />
You talk to Yeliank who has a problem he would like you to help with. He asks you to prove your allegience to him buy brining him a couple items from Kael. You collect those items and return them to him...he then sends you to kill Vindi or Tormax. To get either of those to spawn you have to give an item from Yeliank, to one of his agents in Kael. Once the item is turned in Vindi or Tormax spawns, allowing the smaller guilds/ alliances in the game a chance at a rare spawn kill.  Yes it would be a time sink BUT it would allow the smaller guilds or people with less time on their hands a chance to experience more of the game content. <br />
<br />
The items needed for the quest could still be semi-rare drops from any mobs in the zone, which could control the number times the mob could be spawn and the number of items coming into the game. And it would allow everyone at least a chance at getting stuff they could only dream of having.</div></div><hr />

Don't take it the wrong way as in, shut your mouth and quit if you don't like it.  If this game is truly as miserable to casual gamers as people want to make people believe, why do casual gamers even play.  If all the casual gamers who don't like the rules of the game were to quit, then Sony would have a reason to make these (or some) changes.  As long as you people who are so unhappy keep paying every month, they have no reason to make a change like this.<br />

I wouldn't expect such sweeping changes to be made to the game at this point in its life.  Good luck on the crusade.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bolthor is so in love with his own idea that he ignores basic problems of balance in the game.  If  it becomes so easy that even casual players can take part in the high end game, then their simply is no high end game for the power gamers who spend far more time playing then I ever will.  The problem with his approch is not some 30 / 70 thing or NO RENT or NO DROP thing,  it is simply balancing the needs of different kinds of players within the same game environment.<br />
<br />
I will never be an &quot;uber&quot; shaman and that is fine.  This is a reality that I can live with and still have a great time playing EQ.  I can even experiance the very same kind of encounters that the power player experiance, it is just that the names on the mobs are different.  I can feel the same kind of joy at a new item that was hard one.  The same grin is on my face as I accomplish another personal goal.<br />
<br />
I can understand the frustraition of trying to remain comparitivly competitive with those that are &quot;uber&quot; but is is simply not going to happen if you have any kind of life outside of EQ.  I just try and remeber that it is a game and it should be fun and not work, and I try very hard not to spend much time doing activities within the game that I don't like.<br />
<br />
The other night I had my first trip into HoT and it was a blast.  The fact that the ubers did it some significant amount of time ago does not have to detract from the experiance if you keep things in perspective.  If people call you gimp just LoL and agree.  How can you take seriosly any insult about your pixels?<br />

<br />
<br />
Because, like anything else, it's a reward based on what you put into it.    There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.  You gotta do the time and the work to get there.  If you don't want to, and still want the rewards? LOL Give me a break.  It is a matter of priorities.  If my daughter were still young, I wouldn't play EQ the way I do.  When my husband didn't work, I didn't play EQ as intensely as I do now.  I joined a high end guild once I was ready and able to play the high end game, and I raid an average of 30-40 hours a week.  Don't try to tell me a guild that raids half that time deserves the same shot at things my guild gets.  You deserve to get back what you put into it, and a guild who puts more time in gets more rewards (Uber mob kills/loot), just like a player who puts more time in gets more rewards (exp/loot).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">You have the wrong idea here Megara.  It's not about the fact that your guild raids more often, and therefore deserves more uber loot.  That's completely besides the point.  With the proposal that Sneekii has mentioned, your guild would still continue to get more loot because of the amount of raids you do.  However, a guild that raids a lot less would still have a chance at the same bosses and loot that your guild does.<br />
<br />
The Dragon Race is about how the spawns work.  How the uber guilds have every boss timed, and just go around zerging them 10-15 mins after they spawn.<br />
<br />
I'm in a small guild of very close friends.  We are all casual players and raid only twice a week.  I personally play around 10 hours a week.  Our guild raids at around the same time every week.  We're capable of taking down big bosses, but they're usually never up, why?  Because some high-end guild, that's on 24-7 zerged the boss at 12pm, when everyone in my guild was busy doing things in RL.  Have you every tagged along on one of these uber guild raids (maybe you're in one of these guilds).  It's a joke to see them rush to get everyone buffed and organized into a raid of like 60 people, only to run through a zone of greenies, and zerg a boss.  The funny thing is that after they killed the boss, everyone was complaining how the boss always drops crap.  Well crap to them = great stuff for me.<br />
<br />
Spawn times that are tied to real life time in EQ are a bad idea.  In fact they should never have existed, a boss should always be up, but you must quest to have a chance at facing him.  That would solve lots of problems with The Dragon Race.</div></div><hr />

But those people would be wasting valuable time getting zero loot or exp while others will be fighting somewhere fitting for them.<br />
<br />
One of the most uber guilds on my server just killed everything in ToV &quot;just for fun&quot;. While it probably was fun for a guild that has access to the elemental planes to waste dragons like they never existed it does affect other peoples chances of trying some encounters that are SUITABLE for them. And this is just because some bored kids(?) killed everything they found up. Thats not good. If those ubbers had to spend maybe an hour or two killing stuff that gave them nothing at all before being able to spawn a dragon I bet they wouldnt do that. They would stick to content that is SUITABLE for them.<br />
<br />
And the argument about not making people leave the game I just dont buy. Sometimes I myself would love to be able to say &quot;I am finished&quot;. If the friends you have made in EQ are true friends I am sure you would be able to &quot;hang out&quot; with them even if you dont play EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Okay I wanted to say I think this analysis is not only proposing a bad solution, but for a nonexistant problem. The problem to me is obvious. Not the high end game.<br />
<br />
Okay the way I see it there are 3 types of game players.<br />
<br />
Casual: This person plays the game and savors it, because he really only plays if for an hour or so at a time, and a few times a week. He doesn't care about uber loot, he doesn't care about having the best win percentage or being the best AWP whore. He plays for enjoyment and nothing more.<br />
<br />
Game junkie: This guy loves games. But at the same time he has a life, and while he does spend a ton of his free time hacking monsters in Everquest, he doesn't spend 18 hours a day doing so. As far as where he is in Everquest, he most likely has a mid 50's character, and is in a guild with mediocre strength.<br />
<br />
Full Fledged addict: This guy lives and breathes everquest. he quits his job, dumps his girlfriend, closes all the shutters and locks the door so he can play everquest until he collapses from fatigue (which takes a pretty long time when you're sitting on your ass). This is the guy that gets into lvl65 guilds, this is the guy who joins guilds of incredible power, and this is the guy who gets to see the 20% of everquest nobody else gets to taste.<br />
<br />
The problem with everquest is that it caters to the first and the last categories of gamer. The Casual player can pretty much be entertained by a game on any level, which is the only reason why Everquest even appeals to them. The Hardcore addict gets to go through exciting quests, adrenaline pumping action, and epic battles. But what does the Game junkie have? he likes this game, and wants to taste so much more of it, but because of his life he has hit a wall. He jsut can't stand grinding away another 10 levels, but all of those thrilling quests, amazing battles, awesome items and great guilds are out of reach.<br />
<br />
So basically my point is Everquest, especially post-PoP, Is basically designed for the hardcore player, and those of us who are above casual but can't meet the extreme of Hardcore are left with so little content it's frustrating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">THE problem is that the servers are too full. Ever wonder why they quit showing the amount of people on each server? Highend game wasnt designed for 80%+ of the population to be 50+. Highend enounters need their spawn times at least reduced by 50 %. And I do agree this only makes it worse. &quot;Mob only drops item 1-2 times a week&quot;. /sarcasm on.<br />
Sounds like that would realy solve everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">:mad: Full Fledged addict: This guy lives and breathes everquest. he quits his job, dumps his girlfriend, closes all the shutters and locks the door so he can play everquest until he collapses from fatigue (which takes a pretty long time when you're sitting on your ass).

<br />
I find this statement fairly offensive.  What is this notion that your only a pure casual gamer if your mid 50's with moderate loot?  Or that if your level 65 and in a top tier guild you cant have a life, job, family. relationships, etc.  The people you are describing in that sterotype probably represent 0.01% of EQ players.  <br />
<br />
My guild, which one of only two Guilds on the server in Elemental Planes, is made up of almost every type of player you can think of.  Most are married or in serious relationships, alot have children, alot have regular jobs and responsibilities that adults do.  Raids start around 8ish EST and end around 12, so I would guess that atleast 50% of these people have 3-4 hours of play time on most nights.  I would say that is not excessive.  How much time does the average person sit in front of the TV every night? Pretty close to that and honestly what is the difference?<br />
<br />
You can say the same thing about just about every guild on any server.  They all have great diversity of the kinds of players they have.  Some players dont have as much time to play, some dont or cant play as much because of various reasons.  Some have ALOT of time to play, perhaps they are students, maybe they are just bored homemakers, maybe they are just filthy rich and never need to work.  Who cares?<br />
<br />
To me what sets a guild apart from another is the leadership.  Having played this game for 3 years and being in several guilds I have seen both good and bad.  All guilds have their drama but the ones with strong leaders who keep the guild focused on the direction needed to advance and can keep the rank and file members convinced that direction is best are the ones that suceed.  Ya, there are other things but I think everything feeds off strong leadership.<br />
<br />
Yes, this is just a game but it is a compedative game.  People are naturally going to compete with each other.  This brings out the best and worst in us all.  However the fact remains that in order to advance in EQ and to see the &quot;20% of the game only a few see&quot; requires time, sacrafice, strategy, and enough other like minded people will to commit all of these things.  It is up to each individual to deciede whether or not they can afford the time away from their Real Lives and those responibilites.<br />
<br />
This whole post is way off topic I guess but I am tired of this hatred towards those in the high end game.  There are alot of legitmate complaints about the way EQ is designed.  I dont like the fighting and racing over mobs.  Sometimes its kinda fun but most of the time its frustrating and ends up in name calling, training, and just general ugliness.  Without a complete and total overhaul on the way EQ works (which IMO will never happen) this just wont be solved.  The only way I can think of is for there to be SOE enforced Calenders or Rotations for contested mobs.  Well just my opinion :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Although I think you're overreacting, I can understand what you're saying. Honestly I would love to be in a guild like yours, because there are none of them on my server. All of the &quot;uber&quot; guilds on Tunare Dont just require level 65 characters, but mandatory raiding (up to 90% required attendance) which is done multiple times each day from about 6 est to 12est... on weekdays. Thats about all the hours I'm awake after coming home. I'd say its pretty hard to have a life when you do that.<br />
<br />
If you're in a guild which instead recruits large numbers so high attendance isn't required, then more power to you, but that's far from common from what I've seen on my server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I read that article.  Here is a paraphrase of that article, oddly enough written by Gilbert and Sullivam over a century ago.<br />
<br />
See how the fates their gifts alot.<br />
For A is happy - B is not.<br />
Yet B is worthy, I dare say.<br />
Of more prosperity than A.<br />
<br />
Is B more worthy?<br />
<br />
I should say.<br />
He's worth a great deal more than A.<br />
<br />
Yet A is happy.<br />
Oh so happy.<br />
Laughing ha-ha.<br />
Chaffing ha-ha.<br />
Nector quaffing, ha ha ha.<br />
Ever joyous, ever gay.<br />
Happy undeserving A.<br />
<br />
If I were fortune - which Im not<br />
B should enjoy A's happy lot.<br />
And A should die in misery.<br />
That is assuming I am B.<br />
<br />
And so on, I hope you can see the analogy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Has anyone who thinks this is a good idea ever done Tunare?  Done her twice?  done her 6 or 7 times?  The thought of potentially depopping an entire zone to get a trigger item would make all high end encounters just like her.  She's got some great loot, but the 4 - 6 hours it takes to clear the zone EACH time you kill her make Tunare one of my least favorite mobs.<br />
<br />
And how would you handle ToV?  A trigger item for EACH dragon?  Would you HAVE to trigger an Aary before you did any of the dragons behind him (as he's tougher than any of the others, except Lady M and Lady N).<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, I think that mob competition leads to the kind of discipline needed to make a successful kill.  You need to understand the strategy of the mob you're targetting and people can't take the encounter lightly.  If someone screws up the aggro on AoW, who cares, it's just another trigger item....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The problem with this solution is that it will take less time for other guilds to reach high end content. which makes the problem even worse.<br />
<br />
You wouldn't be contesting for boss mobs, but those 60+ exp zones are going to be crowded as hell.  Right now there is still level separation between 50 and 65.  There ARE casual gamers out there that aren't 65...quite a lot actually.<br />
<br />
If the casual gamers (like me) have better access to &quot;dragon loot&quot;, exp'ing becomes easier, levels are quicker, and pretty soon EVERYONE is 65 and in the same zone.<br />
<br />
The fact is, Everquest NEEDS separation of levels at this point.  You can't everyone online the same level or you end up with a situation like Pre-Kunark era...  everyone and their brother in LGUK camping the crap out of it.  You old-timers remember how crappy that was?  Ugh... definitely don't want to go back to that!<br />
<br />
Another reason is that the developers simply can't keep up.  If high end mobs were triggerable, the top guilds would get continued shots at them until they were &quot;solved&quot; and put in farm status.  Then you have the power gamers ripping through content faster than they can develop it.  The idea about using flags for these mobs &quot;seems&quot; like a good idea.  But I'd think twice... no...3 or 4 times before using the flag system again.  It has definite drawbacks, but it solved the problem of level separation quite nicely for PoP... much to the casual gamers discontent.  And having another mob drop a triggering piece for the mob... well, that just moves the bottleneck back a step.  If it's random drop off a random mob, you have guilds wiping out entire zones, killing the game for exp'ers.  If it's a random spawn off a named, you have campers.  No viable solution there.<br />
<br />
I think it's a great idea because I would like shots at dragons without racing to the keyboard after a patch... but practically speaking... we, the gamers, would run EQ into the ground.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">&quot;If you don't like it<br />
Quit&quot;<br />
<br />
Is this the attitude y'all take to life?  If you don't like something quit?  Seems like it would lead to very few social relationships if you ask me.  In a community situation (and I consider EQ a community) people who are unhappy don't just quit, they instead try to make improvements to the system.  I really wish people who embrace the &quot;just quit&quot; attitude would take a minute to think about what they are actually saying, which is more or less that everyone should play only until the moment something in the game changes which they don't like, at which point they should either suck it up and stop complaining, or quit.  I'd instead argue that they should complain, though perhaps not in forums like these but rather in direct posts to Verant themselves, so that they can change things to make them better for the community.  Of course, boards like these can be of great help in organizing such efforts.  But then again, that's just my opinion, and maybe its too optimistic.  I mean, VI will never change shaman Kunark spell drops, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Frighten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">MAybe I am totally off base here, but wasn't LDON designed to help eliminate this problem? From everything I have experienced it is an instanced encounter that can have any number of seperate groups/raids in it at the same time. I have heard that the raid section is screwed up, but I have never tried so confirmation on that is sketchy at best.<br />
<br />
While I am sure that people would get bored of the same areas to raid, it makes the need for new/different spawn implementation (is that the word I am looking for?) non-consiquential. It seems that if everything worked as it was designed, then this would not be an issue. It would also give SOE an easier time with expansions (having to just add more areas with different mobs and encounters.<br />
<br />
To SOE's credit, there have been attemps to fix this problem, but sometimes things don't work as designed.<br />
<br />
Since I am in a small guild, we have raided a few decent named mobs, but there is nothing more frusterating then getting the force together only to find that there are no encounters available. If more though had been put into LDON, they actually could have had some of the epic mobs in Raid type LDONs (ever looked into the bard epic? Either kill 2 of 4 dragons (perma camped) or spend 100kp or more on scales). Things are not balanced for the 3 types of players, but it wouldn't be difficult for SOE to at least try and make things better with what they already have implimented.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Part of the problem here is when Sony decides to do there patches.  Lets say they down the servers at 4am pst for 5 hours.  So everything is repoped at 9am pst.  Well, guilds who are PST based are basically hosed.  Why?  Cause people have lives and Eurpoean guilds have 7-8 hours head start over PST guilds at taking bosses that spawn at server reset.  At last reset a eurpoean guild did vindi/statue/AoW, Rumblecrush, and IV before many EST based guilds were going.  And now these mobs (like RC) that are on a set timer, will always pop before PST based guilds can get them.  Why can Sony down servers at noon pst?  It will give PST and far east players a chance at the bosses up at server reset that europeans take for granted.<br />
<br />
It annoys me enough having patching in the middle of my day in Europe.(I work nights) Do you realize if they start patching at noon pst, that it's 7pm GMT. If you figure it would be a &quot;5 hour patch&quot; which actually takes about 7 hours by the time you can log on, then it would be around 2 am GMT by the time they are finished and most Euro based people wouldn't log on.(which would make a whiner like you happy) After enough patches like that I think they would lose alot of people in the Euro market cause they would get sick of not being able to play on a patch day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Someone in this thread had the idea to flag people after getting a kill on a major mob.  I don't know about the system working on all things, but think this may be good with special PoP+ bosses.  I know many if not all servers are overcrowded as is with elemental enabled guilds.  Somewhat how Time keeps track how long your instance is, but in reverse.  If your raid kills Fennin, then need to wait a few days to do it again, but it'll be up the next day (or 8-12ish hours) for some other guild.  Only issue is how to implement it since the event is triggered with a mob.  But that's just an example.<br />
<br />
I understand the challenge and fun for some in terms of racing against other guilds.  It still applies to some extent since guilds will still want to kill it if they aren't tagged with a kill yet.  But I really think the racing frustrates more people than anything though, even to the point of causing some to quit.  What can be even more frustrating is the waiting to try it again.   The challenge should be doing the actual event and killing the boss, not waiting.  That's boring.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing Time a true instance.  May mean your guild having to group up outside in PoT or something, but you know people do pay to play, if they've reached this far, they should be able to see what they worked for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">It's a pretty interesting idea, but I can see a problem which no one here seems to have mentioned.  Who is going to farm the trigger item?  <br />
Up until recently, I was one of three 'raid trackers' in the guild. I had tracking characters in zones all over the place. I'd spend at least 1-2 hours a day tracking for targets, running here and there.  The same deal for the other two people doing this.  All the while I was doing this, guildmates were xping, or rushing to do LDoN.  No one ever offered to help us trackers, even for those zones that it would have been easier for them to do it.  The most help we got was &quot;BoT names are up&quot;.  Yeah, when aren't they? Moron.<br />
Now exacerbate this problem by needing to farm trigger items.  People want to go have fun and xp/quest whatever when they're not raiding. Most people just want to sit back and let 'someone else' do the work and call them when it's all ready.  Even in most hardcore raiding guilds, you'll find a core group of people who do most of the work checking spawns etc while everyone else is off having fun. Now, you're asking these 'core people' to perhaps have to spend hours upon hours (maybe more given the kind of drop rate you're hinting at?) killing in these zones to get a drop.  Sure, you can try to force the rest of the guild to help, and then within a few weeks, you'll see less and less people logging on, because it's no fun having to farm items just to raid.<br />
At least 'only' needing to track mobs, you can still have fun later on that night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Best solution IMO would be to incorporate lockouts ALA GoD expeditions with the ability to port people to zone in, or to another zone.<br />
For those that don't know:<br />
In GoD at present after progressing far enough into an expedition of certain types, if you leave the expedition, you may no longer rejoin any expedition of that same type again until your lockout period has passed.  For Tipt and Vxed, it's only 6 minutes.  For Ikkinz trials, you have to wait day(s) for the lockout to expire, so you can't keep restarting the same trial to farm it over and over for loot.<br />
I think everyone know what happens when you aggro Naggy/Vox at level 53+.<br />
<br />
To combat rampant competition for mobs, a solution would be:<br />
-make dragons/other named mobs spawn much more often (like every 3-6 hours)<br />
-anyone that gets on the named mob's aggro list that already is on the lockout for the mob gets booted from the zone.<br />
-anyone that gets on the named mob's aggro list that doesn't already have a lockout on the mob gets a temporary lockout of a week for the mob.<br />
-if the named mob dies, the lockout is made permanent for the week<br />
-if the named doesn't die, when it returns to spawn point clear of aggro, the temporary lockouts are cleared<br />
<br />
This way, if you help kill a named, you can't help kill it any more for the week.<br />
High spawn rate ensures everyone has a chance at killing the mob.<br />
This would affect both people online and offline (to prevent helping then going LD to avoid lockouts).<br />
Aside from the quick spawn time, two guilds both prepping to kill a mob won't be as inclined to **** up the kill for the other guild by trying to KS, seeing as they'll be locked out as well if they don't succeed in the KS or train attempt or whatever.<br />
<br />
This is of course, assuming that some good old competition for mobs isn't totally evil.  :)<br />
I've had my share of competing for mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Yeah but what if an uber guild farms so that each member of their guild has one of the &quot;half pendant&quot; items, and then just kills the mob for days straight, keeping other players out?<br />
<br />
Also, wouldn't the uberguilds just sit in the zone it drops off of randomly, and kill everything in sight, making exp'ing with a casual group in said zone impossible, and thereby creating another problem?<br />
<br />
It's a good start toward a solution, and a solution is definitely needed, but it has a few kinks to work out imo.<br />
<br />
But I do love the lockout feature, and wish it was applied to more areas.  Don't love flags quite as much :)<br />
<br />
It's a real balance that needs to be struck between too much farming and not enough casual access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Flagging is a bitch.  If a guild could bank flags in some way, that would rock so as to minimize the need for backflagging.  For example, my guild has been farming Time for about 2 months now.  We've had 2  guildmembers come back from multiple month/year afks that want to raid with us again.  This means we now have to take our entire guild back to Fire, Air, Water, and Earth to reflag those 2 people.  Either that, or we exclude them from 1/3 of all our raiding in the week (we raid Time 2 of the 6 raiding nights we do a week).  *joy*<br />
<br />
Lockouts are annoying as hell in GoD.  You can fail on a trial, and still be locked out for days.  *joy*<br />
<br />
What sucks more than lockouts is the raid size limit.  To be able to raid the super high end GoD stuff, a guild needs to be equiped in full Elemental Plane gear or better.  Maybe the casters can get by with VT gear, but a warrior that doesn't have 10k hps / 2k AC is pretty poorly equiped in terms of tankability in GoD.  To be able to get this well equiped, you need to build your guild up enough so you have 60-80 people online every raiding night so you can actually farm the Ele Planes and Time for the gear you need.  This means your guild needs to have about 100-120 people depending on how often everyone logs in for raiding night.  And once you get geared well enough to be able to raid GoD, you get kicked in the nads by a 54 person raid limit.  So now, you get to tell 20 of the the 70 people that logged in too fuggin bad.  The 32 person limit in LDoN is pretty sucky too, but at least in theory you can split your guild in 1/2 and do 2 LDoN raids at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This issue was addressed long ago. Mobs spawn randomly within 24 hours of a server reset. This prevents Asia and European based guilds from hogging rares, and historically with Vazaelle it was the asia guilds not the European ones that were doing this. <br />
<br />
SOE is scheduling the down time for the hours where the least number of people will be on. Peak load hours for most of the servers start about 3 pm Eastern and go till about 11pm Eastern.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">This thread is still relevant however. Untill they get their stuff sorted out for GoD, the one common goal a majority of people have on every server is plane of time. The direct result is that you get there, the rotation is already running at full capacity. <br />

High end content needs to be instanced, period. At the very least plane of time requires better instancing implementation.</div></div><hr />
