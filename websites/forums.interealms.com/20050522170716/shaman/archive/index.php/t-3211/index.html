9.  You ain't got that much money to waste.<br />
8.  You ain't got that much time to waste.<br />
7.  You still can't figure out how to use the Nexus portals.<br />
6.  Learning more zone names, npc names, and items makes your head hurt.<br />
5.  After spending so much time getting AA points for nearly useless skills, you're just plain worn out.<br />
4. You'll never see Vex Thal, even though you paid for it, why pay more to keep Fires of Heaven busy?<br />
3.  You'd rather get your Kunark spells first.<br />
2.  You're not sure that you want to see shamans get shafted again after vapid Velious and lackluster Luclin.<br />
1.  You're tired of buying unfinished products from VI.</div></div><hr />

4. You'll never see Vex Thal, even though you paid for it, why pay more to keep Fires of Heaven busy?  <br />
<br />
For 95% of all of the EverQuest players, this is so true.<br />
<br />
Or better yet, &quot;By the time you get Vex Thal Keys for your guild, VI will have already released 3 more unfinished expansions.&quot; :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Earring of the Solstice is probably a fun quest for tradeskillers, but I see it as more of a plain old money sink (and a potentially unbalancing one at that.)<br />
<br />
I decided yesterday that I'd try to get one.  A few hours later (and 13k poorer), I had it- from my perspective it's basically a 13k vendor item... with some running around involved.  <br />
<br />
It's a hella-nice earring and I'm glad I got it, but ask yourself if you think it would make sense for Verant to put this earring on a vendor for 13k.<br />
<br />
They'll need to be careful when rolling out these tradeskill based quests- especially ones with results that are basically an upgrade for 95+% of the players.  It sure didn't take long for this one (which required nine grandmaster tradeskillers, rare components, etc.) to become a commodity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Nothing is to stop you from Grandmastering a trade skill.  For example, a grandmaster potter in my guild traded idols and steins for all the other gifts for her earring.<br />
<br />
I liked the teamwork, my guild did an &quot;assembly line&quot; for a week or so.  We were able to make everything in house reliably except for the Robe (our highest tailor was 175).  <br />
<br />
Those without trade skills did the foraging, the collecting, the imbuing, the buying, the traveling to pick up items.  Those with minor trade skills helped out with the lesser combines.  With my 140 brewing I was able to make mistletoe tempers and I made around 300, with my 175 smithing I helped make silver chains for the robe.  With my low jewelry skill, I was able to help out and make champagne magnums.  Being bound in the firepot room, I went to RV and bought grape yeast, went to Freeport and bought elven wine and mistletoe, and made many trips to EC to buy scent of marr.  I made celestial essences until my fingers nearly fell off.<br />
<br />
It was a great whirlwind of fun and I was very impressed by the capable people in my guild, those that led the effort and those with the hard to get skills that made it happen.<br />
<br />
Average guild contribution for earring: 5K<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to the next one!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">grin, I knew these trade skills would come in handy for something one day!<br />
<br />
<br />
200 smithing + 5%<br />
180 alchemy +10%<br />
167 baking<br />
165 brewing +5%<br />
164 pottery <br />
158 tailoring +5%  (tailoring is the DEVIL)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and I spent most money/effort raising tailoring too, tailoring is depressing..    I'm the highest tailor in my guild by FAR, and I'm about 5 for 100 on robes lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">guess I should say I knew they would be useful AGAIN someday...    because I made about 30,000 selling cabilis scale mantles to vendor first month of sullon zek :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoP is hard cause VI already said that they were makin EQ2 even though they said they were not going to make it and you have all of these 2nd generation MMORPGs comming out soon SWG included.  <br />
<br />
But if enough people tell me how wonderful PoP is I will probably end up buying it anyway.  Especially if my guild decides to raid there.</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen VP, but paid for it...<br />
Never expected to go there, but now only the tooth is missing.<br />
Sure I'm 2 years late, but hey, better late than never?<br />
<br />
There's players out there who haven't even seen the planes, but paid for them... I'm pretty sure they still bought the expansions (hell, I did buy kunark and velious without having been to a plane, so should I have felt ripped?)</div></div><hr />
