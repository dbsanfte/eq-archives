<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After playing my alts for a a length of time, I realized:  even after 150+ days played, 60 character levels, and countless interactions . . . there's still a lot I am learning about this game.<br />
<br />
Much of what I have to learn concerns other classes, but there are just so many little things I've never seen, done, or heard of.<br />
<br />
That, to me, is what really makes a great game -- something you can play for almost 3 years and still not experience all of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just found out you could put your horsie bridle in the ammo slot, fun fun fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Wholeheartedly agree.<br />
<br />
I'm sure I'm still ignorant to a lot of things that happen that I should be learning from each day, but there isn't a week that goes by that I haven't learned something new from either playing or surfing the boards.<br />
<br />
Trouble is, I think I'm forgetting much faster than I'm learning. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can put horse bridals in ammo slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye, bridles can go in AMMO.  When I first bought mine, I thought, oh great, another inventory slot for a right-click item to take up.<br />
But then I spied &quot;Slot:  AMMO,&quot; and there was much rejoicing (yaaay).<br />
<br />
See?  Ya learned something new ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, mez still learning.<br />
<br />
/bonk  mez just learn dat bridal go in AMMO slot *giggle*<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL !!!  I figured out the same thing just a couple days ago.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This will make me sound more of a moron, but until 2 levels ago (level 55 now) I thought that AC was related to HP, like Wis or Int is related to Mana.  Thinking more AC = more HP, mainly because i always casted, HP buff, AC buff, stats (sta, and agi included).  Than would check my total hp thinking the AC had a hand in it as well.<br />
<br />
Found out otherwise when someone said,<br />
<br />
him - No need to cast agi on me, all thats important is hp.<br />
me - Never heard a melee say that before.<br />
him - Its an AE caster that hits really weak, so all thats really important is how much hp you have.<br />
me - But...agi = ac<br />
him - yeah...<br />
me - so the more agi you have, the more ac you have, thus the more hp you have.....<br />
(after that point i got the embarrasing explanation)<br />
<br />
Didn't much affect my game play since I just buffed people fully anyway.  Haven't played a melee up until that point so i wasn't really focused on hp/ac.  Sometimes you miss things that are right infront of your nose.</div></div><hr />
