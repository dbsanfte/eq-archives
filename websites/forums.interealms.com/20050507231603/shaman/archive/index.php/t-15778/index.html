<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GallaenaCT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hope that duel-box is the correct term for what I want to do.<br />
<br />
My small, family-type guild on C-T seems to be winding down, and I don't really have the heart to find another guild. Besides, I'm sure that the big guilds won't be knocking down any doors to get to my 61 shaman with substandard gear and few AAs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I recently upgraded my computer so I can handle 2 copies of EQ running at the same time. <br />
<br />
Is it possible to run 2 copies of EQ, now that it runs in a window, OR, is EQW still required to run 2 copies of EQ?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance!<br />

You can run both on the same machine, but its a pain in the ass.  Unless you just use the bot for buffs ect.  I recommend EQW's as SoE's version of windowed really sucks lol. its great for reading the internet, but thats about it hehe :)<br />
<br />
Another tip, is copy your whole eq directory, and paste it in another one called Everquest2  or whatever.  Turn sound and most options off with the second &quot;box&quot;, this helps.  This way also enables you to keep seperate options for each.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
:-)<br />
<br />
I've actually ran two copies of EQ from a single directory on my lowly 1.4Ghz machine and it seemed to run fine. What I did was crank my resolution to 1600x1200 and then ran each copy of EQ at 800x600 so I could keep both windows of EQ side-by-side so I could see everything.<br />
<br />
Do turn off your sound though in at least one of your copies. I've not actually ran two copies in an outdoor zone which I imagine is going to be a little choppy if you're under a 2Ghz. But in the dungeon-type zones it was fine.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heya Galla. =) <br />
<br />
Yeah, it's very doable on one machine. I do this quite often just using the regular EQ copied into separate directories and 2 desktop icons to fire it off. <br />
<br />
If you have XP, you'll want to enable alt-tabbing for EQgame.exe though.</div></div><hr />

Gear comes with being in a guild that can get it.  Finding the guild that fits your playstyle and times is the challenge, you will likely find them while grouping with others, don't see many unguilded shaman around on ct shouldnt take too long :)<br />
I know how you feel, I had to make the same adjustment back in the low 50s when I went to a raiding type guild. Take some time off from guilds, eventually you will want back into a guild or get an invite to one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The key to running two copies of eqw is all in your settings. I've got a p2 450 I'm running 2 copies on as we speak, and also able to surf the net while I med. I have everything off, except for troll and wood elf models for my shammy and druid's mounts respectively. I'm running at 1024 768 for my video mode, have sound off and every other setting is minimized. I zone slow as hell, but I'm used to it. I also run a second box with same options but which is a p4 2.4 gig, and the only real difference I notice is in zone speeds and load times when booting up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is impressive.  <br />
<br />
EQW is the only way to fly.  I actually prefer running 2 instances on one machine to split machines - mostly because my 2nd machine can barely run EQ.  Its always fun to forget about your 2nd box toon with the sound off and switch back to discover you ran him into the ocean and he drowned :).</div></div><hr />
