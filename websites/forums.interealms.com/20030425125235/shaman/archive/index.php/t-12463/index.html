When turning in envy/woe and Marr's promise over and over for epic, do I need to get my faction to Max ally, or just get it up to ally? Is there a diffrence?<br />
<br />
Also curious if anyone has done it by this method recently and knows if it still works.</div></div><hr />

Yes and you will need to get to max ally. Trust me on this. :)</div></div><hr />
