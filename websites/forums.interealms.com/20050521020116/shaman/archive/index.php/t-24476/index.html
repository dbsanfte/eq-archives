<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">To get access to Time do you have to have been in attendance on the 4 EP God kills AND killed Rathe Council?<br />
<br />
I got an item from Fennin Ro and I assume I need one from each of the other gods?<br />
<br />
I am sort of assuming there is no piggy into Time?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need a piece from Rathe, Coirnav, Xegony, and Fennin.  No piggy in Time and you must be level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Rathe Council is one of the 4 elemental Gods:<br />
<br />
Xegony<br />
Corinav<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
The Rathe Council (part of Rathe Council requires key to POE B, no piggy into POE B, you must have a key a la Carprin)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mystical arbiter of earth in PoEa gives you a passkey of the 12 (PoEb key).  You can check it by typing /key to see if it shows up.<br />
<br />
You must hail the planar projection from killing each of:<br />
<br />
Fennin Ro<br />
Xegony<br />
Coirnav<br />
Avatar of Earth<br />
<br />
The Avatar of Earth is spawned by killing the Rathe Council in a set period of time.  (7 minutes, I think--it's been like a year since I did a rathe raid).<br />
<br />
Hailing each of the four PPs gets you an item.  The item is equipable as a shield (with a cool graphic!), though it has no stats (sorry, don't remember names--been too long).<br />
<br />
When you get all four shields, you combine them in a special jar.  The jar is a real bitch to make, mostly because it requires uncommon/rare items from each of the various zones pre-time.  The good news is that you only need 1 per guild--it's not destroyed in the combine, and it's tradeable.<br />
<br />
When you have combined your key, then you have to zone into time via the PoInnovation.  Find someone who is flagged to open the factory door.  In the first room, go LEFT (not right as you would to the MB).  Go talk to the NPC robot and say &quot;yes&quot; when he asks if you're ready for transport.<br />
<br />
It transports you to a zone with basically 1 path.  Go to the big, cool-looking machine in the middle and click it.  Welcome to PoTime.<br />
<br />
You can now click the sundial in PoTranq for access to PoTime at will.  You don't need to keep your key with you--you can bank it.<br />

<br />
Not really, as long as you plan ahead and save them as you go.  The components aren't that rare (except Air parts), they are the same ones used to make the ceramic focus totems.  Just make sure you save them as you go and you shouldn't have a problem by time you need them.  The jar combine is no fail as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">For the oddylic vial, I think thats the name, we had to go farm frogs in water since we had never seen a single of that drop during our normal raiding. The others we had sitting in the bank tho. Yeah it's 1 of each of the 4 elemental glazes which is essentially an elemental pottery item from each plane. I'd assume thats not an issue for him since he's asking about being 15%ed into time I'd assume the guilds already raiding time and already has a vial made.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for answers - I got it straight now.<br />
<br />
My guild is strictly casual (sounds weird :) ) and part-time raiders - killed Arbitor a couple of weeks ago (but I wasn't there) and just got our 2nd FR kill tonight.<br />
<br />
Hopefully a couple of the guilds also in EP's will be leaving for Time soon and below us they are struggling to get into the EP's so we may have a good run over the next couple of months :)</div></div><hr />
