<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Raekwonn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello<br />
I have changed my mind on becomming a recruit for KoE from a selected member (hughhill) and Iyleah Alt of Leader to your ally guild<br />
<br />
KSing my friends camps in Guk, this kind of sh!t isnt cool and Jice already has a very bad reputation <br />
<br />
Thank you for letting me have fun while i was recruit (thanks lewz thanks blaykz) GL to you all<br />
<br />
- Raekwonn<br />
if you would like to talk to me im on Raekwonn or Degenerate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pullign a fully popped room with no one within a mile of it is not KSing.  Ninjapulling, maybe, but not KSing.  There is no way in hell a 54 Warrior could KS even a bare naked 60 monk, so lets get the hearsay correct.<br />
<br />
Calling people a faggot idiot over public channels and sending tells asking me if I am queer and suck cock however, are most definitely harassment.  Unless of course your friend was attempting to elicit some gay cyber, of course, which I will only do for Wulfran.<br />
<br />
Your pals were being retarded long before I ever arrived and made no effort at being civil.  I stood and stared at Mr Ghoul lord for a full 5 minutes before my IVU wore off (I was looking for the KOE people to come hang out and be social) and none of those guys so much as poked their heads in the room.  Sorry they lost out on the uber 100pp Bazaar yak sale, but if obnoxious gay bashers make up the bulk of your friends you probably wouldn't have liked KOE anyhow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tannin Steelblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dont know this guy at all but Jice i gotta say we need to party some time your good people.  Wonder who the next I hate Jice and am gunna say it in a public place is gunna be.  and in the good words of the group The Toasters   Don't let the bastards grind you down..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I seem to remember that if you are camping the Ghoul Lord, you should be in either the ghoul lord room or in the immediate hallway right outside it. If you aint there, you aint camping it. Besides, if the mob is up and not engaged, it is fair game. Calling camps is the lamest thing that happened to this game.<br />
<br />
Heya Jice, lets go kill some stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Canelek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guk?? Oh good lord please....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fazzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you look closely at the footage, you can see Jice on the grassy knoll KS'ing Lee Harvey Oswald.   Oswald petitioned, saying he had the JFK camp, but VI said no, JFK was a wandering mob, not static, and therefore could not be camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shyvalya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Umm I like camp calling actually, as it is respect to let people on their way to a mob get to it and try it. If a group however is not going to engage it or get to it, then there is no camp and therefore is no KSing or as I see it even Ninja pulling. I think Jice is in the right to pull any mob that is not engaged. That has allways been a part of EQ. KSing only can occur if a mob is engaged already. If he sat there for 5 min and no group came in and got him, then seems Jice got to him first. I may be a nobody but I still agree with the pull. It was good. Yes sometimes toes get crushed, but EVERY player does it now and then. As with others Jice, come group with me if ya ever need a fake cleric, I dont mind having you as my tank, puller, or just plain group leader.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are bent out of shape over losing a mob in a 3 year old zone when the person complaining was: <br />
<br />
1.  Being an ass to the entire zone<br />
<br />
2.  Complaining over losing a spawn they were camped HALF THE DAMN ZONE AWAY FROM<br />
<br />
3.  Plainly PL'ing.<br />
<br />
Then I want to thank you for getting this out of the way before you joined.<br />
<br />
<br />
Silliness.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">ROFL Fazzar, I almost busted a gut.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">See, there WERE more than 3 shots fired!!!<br />
<br />
Jice clearly works for the CIA or the mob.<br />
<br />
btw, what makes Wulfran so special!?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your friends did nothing but give us shit all night, because we killed his mobs that he was FD'd in front of, interrupting his PL session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That Jice has a &quot;bad reputation&quot; is your opinion, but I would guess based on hearsay. Jice will be the first to tell you he can be an asshole with the best of them when the situation calls for it and usually the object of his attention deserves it. I suggest in the future, you give someone a chance first hand before condeming them as have a &quot;bad reputation&quot;. <br />
<br />
Given the account of what happen in /ooc, etc, unless you were in Lower Guk last night, I don't think your friends gave you a true picture of the entire story (very often the case in situations such as these) and you might follow up with them with some pointed questions. The spamming in /ooc would not have been acceptable under any circumstances and was uncalled for. <br />
<br />
We thank you for your interest in KoE and wish you well in the lands of Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I just want to say hi to all my friends in Primus Exodus who are obviously watching this thread and have nothing better to do than  post stupid threads on Veeshanvault about it.<br />
<br />
I hold the officers in KoE in very high respect and I don't presume to speak for them, but I think they have far better things to do than cater people with Lower Guk spawn disputes for a mob on a 27 minute timer dropping 3 year old loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Consider the ludicrousness here.<br />
<br />
The VV thread was started by a troller who doesn't even know the parties involved, over a post by a KOE Recruit who wasn't even there, in a zone we all only take alts to, and who's retarded friends who spammed an entire zone with their redneck cock posturing weren't even in the room the mob was in.<br />
<br />
No offense to Dar and his lifestyle choices, but I think there are things that run in the family there beyond being canadian, because Toker sure is good at reaching around a long ways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>razma taz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Raekwonn who?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">What makes me so special is that... um... I'm the prettiest male tank on the server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Until you shave your legs...Aranuil has you beat for 'pretty', I think...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Yeah wulf -- he puts pink flowers on a pink bp -- you just wear miniskirts -- I think he's got you beat :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Shyvalya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I forgot, as for Jice being an ass, most of the GOOD players in the game are hardasses because they know the stupid crap in the game just ruins it. Telling someone not to act like an idiot to the whole zone, or not to be a baby about one spawn that does not take forever like Rage used to, is not being an ass, it is the sign of someone with his or her head on their shoulders and a mind inside. I would much rather be in a group or guild with this kind of person. Jice is not the leader of a great guild because hes a sexy dark elf, but because he knows how to play the game, and he does not need to cry over a dam game. As for calling Jice gay for playing a female character,,, I have 2 on Veeshan, and I am nowhere near gay. It is called RPG, so play a role, just not the one of a dork. Enough said from me though. See all you real players in the GAME.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Jice just likes hitting F-9 and watching the DE ass wiggle...I know the truth... RP...riiiiight</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Shit Kilorn figured me out.<br />
<br />
Guess that measn you like looking at the big sweaty barbarian man ass wiggle Kilorn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Not really..but bearform gives me a woody...that's ok, right? I mean...right, guys? Hey guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">bear form?<br />
<br />
This thread just took a turn for the worse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Hammerstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Jice what the hell is wrong with you? Bringing my family into this is right up your alley. Atokal is my RL brother as is Kilrain and none of us are gay.<br />
<br />
Dar is gay and so WHAT?<br />
<br />
Please take your gay bashing and BS and shove em up yer ass.<br />
<br />
Toker may have been wrong in taking that to VV but so what and Aranuil you are contemptable. Nice bringing the flamefest here you trolling toad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Awewa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Speaking of Contemptable.. look who showed up...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I would agree with Jlove.. <br />
<br />
I think locking this now rather than later is the ticket.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Baracus Baraculous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If Jice or Atokal brought something to Flamevault, why the hell are you bringing it here?</div></div><hr />
