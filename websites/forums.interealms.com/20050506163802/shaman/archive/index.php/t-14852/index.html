<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 3 accounts, a 55 shaman, a 44 SK, and a 34 Cleric. I'd like to get the cleric to 49 ASAP, for obvoius reasons - 90% rez, Cheal, etc. I soloed the cleric in Paludal, etc til about 24, and then continued her in Unrest and Nurga til 34. At this point, soloing toe to toe with my cleric seems somewhat inefficient and as a result, I've been grouping her with my SK and letting her soak up whatever exp she can get. Usually it results in her getting 1% per kill in various places (Gunthak beach, Nurga, etc) where most of the mobs are light blue to my SK. As I said, I'd like to get her from 34 to 49 asap, and I'm wondering if anyone would have any experience in doing something like this, who could suggest good spots for grouping her with my SK. I'm not certain what kind of exp she would get per kill if I just group her with my SK in some spot like Nadox, using my shaman to slow the big mobs (those are yellow to my SK). My goal is for her to get 2% per kill if possible. <br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well i am have been leveling up my cleric by grouping with her for a few months, she is now 51, I am 65. Not sure if its the big difference in our levels but I have yet to find anyplace where the cleric gets more than about 1% reg exp per kill grouped with me. That is with the mobs being red to her and dark blue to my shaman. I would suggest finding that one spot that is failly quick and easy where the cleric is getting that 1% per kill and just grind it away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The exp in Umbral Plains is pretty godawful at 64, but once the cleric could group with the shaman for exp, I took her there to get the poor naked thing into some nice Moktor armor.  Cleric got decent (barely) exp, a bracer of sense, and a near full set of free (and fairly nice) armor.  I'm glad I did this back when the little runt got exp for it.  I hate spending plat on bots.<br />
<br />
After 46 it gets a LOT easier, as PoP exp is still ridiculously better than you can get anywhere else.  Sit in Justice or Nightmare, whichever you favor, and race her to 49 in half the time it took to get levels before 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You could make use of the memblur effect of Atone.  Pull the mob with malo, let your pet beat it down to almost nothing.  Root the mob and back the pet off.  Then have the cleric cast atone until it sticks (if the mob is naturally non-KOS to the cleric, have the cleric get initial agro with the pet by tossing some gimpy level 1 nuke or tapping it with a hammer - you'll know atone stuck when the mob goes from KOS to non-kos).  Then either finish it off with a hammer or a nuke.  I figure if you find a dungeon with mobs a couple levels above the cleric and a good ZEM you'll get pretty decent xp per kill.  Not sure if this is going to be faster than just grouping cleric with a melee and PL'ing using the shaman though.  <br />
<br />
I've found that grouping my cleric with a rogue and having the cleric &quot;root tank&quot; for the rogue  also works quite well when the mob is pulled/slowed with an out of group shaman.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah.  I got my 2nd box cleric from 30 to 44 in nurga &amp; droga (I wanted the faction hits anyhow, so seemed like a decent spot).  Seemed to get about 1 level per few hours on the cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">34 to 44/45'ish will fly in Kaesora. Everyone seems to forget the 18% exp bonus in that zone.<br />
<br />
That's where I did low 30's to 45 with my Cleric. After that the PB Thief camp in DL will take you to 50 easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Oh yeah.  I gave my soulstripper to the cleric as soon as he could use it.  Upped his DPS and improved his tanking quite substantially.  Get him an excellent weapon and the PL will go faster.  With an SK to do the tanking, you might want a big 2-hander or other weapon with a better ratio, since the lifetap proc will be only half as useful if the cleric's not taking damage.<br />
<br />
Might even want to get him a cheap haste item.  SCHW or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>nornez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Find a spot (I have said it before &amp; I'll say it again, for grinding &amp; getting thru levels to 50 I love DL) have the SK pull &amp; tank with shammy slowing &amp; I would think a good chunk of the healing so the cleric can nuke away &amp; just before the mob is dead FD the SK &amp; the cleric should get all the XP.<br />
<br />
I do this with a 65 monk friend of mine when we need to PL any friends alts from 48 to say 56 in POI &amp; it works awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What I do with my lowbie cleric is to pull 3-4 mobs, root them, epic them, and zone.  The cleric taps each one and reroots as necessary.  With my shaman out of zone, the tap is enough to get XP for my cleric.<br />
<br />
DSP at the Sanctus Seru zone is my favorite spot for this.  The camels are still red and yellow to my low 20's cleric, but one epic will eventually kill them.</div></div><hr />
