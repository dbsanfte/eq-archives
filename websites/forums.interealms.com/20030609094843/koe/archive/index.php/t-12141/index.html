<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chadias Spirithealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to stop by and say hiyas to all my old friends. I also wanted to thank KoE for Saturday nite letting Ravi ( Angelsent ) and I tag along to get flagged for PoNB :) I had a blast. I never really knew Moony existed except on the boards ... but he was in my group =P lol Sori stopped by our little mini group and asked if we wanted to join in the fun ... so we went along. Of course we are the only 4 in The Honorable Few with those flags LOL. I would love to join you guys if you go exploring in there sometime. If Im not on as Chad then it will be Juustin. Also thank you for awarding me that Twisted Bow :) A huge upgrade. Thanks Orris :) Ravi and I were talking about that during the raid there ... how good it was to see some old faces. Im just glad Sori stopped questing so much and started getting the XP lol <br />
 <br />
Take care and hopefully see you guys soon. Let me know if you ever need another druid or tank. Ravi now has lvl 57 and her cleric is 58 :)<br />
