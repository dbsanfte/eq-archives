<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was in LoY finishing up pure blood, the damn black vial is annoying.<br />
i noticed something ...<br />
i cleared the nautilus room 8 times ...<br />
no named.<br />
i did get the blackened vial though.<br />
later i went to droga, with 2 necros and a SK.<br />
we camped the 5 north most spawns next to FM. the guy who drops the BP and the 10/18 club and such.<br />
we cleared all 5 spawns befor anything in the area repopped.<br />
we did this 10 times, not one named. i /ooc'd if anyone got any nameds to pop.<br />
one guy who camps king like its his god given right said &quot;not since 2 days ago&quot;<br />
i did a spit take, that was not possible. so i wait a bit longer we clear spawns 12 more times.<br />
nothing, so ... i do a /feedback<br />
this is on Drinal, if anyone on any other server is having the same problems post here please.<br />
this is frustrating, because if it can happen in LoY and revamped Kunark zones, what stops it from hitting PoP or Luclin wich is heavily raided, and keeping triggered mobs from spawning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ is based entirely on a random number generator.  It's incredibly streaky.  Bad luck~<br />
<br />
And raid mobs are not random spawns from PHs, they're timed spawns that show up at a certain time +/- x more time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have had real bad luck in Droga in the last 2 weeks.  Weeks prior named were spawning every 5-6  I have gone day ( 6-8 hour of gaming time ) without a named spawning.  I don't know maybe SoW has been nerfed too but it does seem like the spawn rate is higher now.</div></div><hr />
