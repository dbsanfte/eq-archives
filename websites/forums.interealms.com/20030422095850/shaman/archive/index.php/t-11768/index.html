Eventually I want to get a Blessed Coldain Prayer Shawl :) ....but for now?<br />

Thanks for advice and comments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I went for the ODS...<br />
<br />
But that was a personal choice, I like to solo a lot, which means I do everything for my group - mana is more of a concern than if I am just slowing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally I went with the Death Watcher's Shroud for the AC.  I can always make more mana.  Would rather avoid damage.  But as Tal said, it's a personal choice. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Those 2 work out about the same in stats, the DWS has a little more mana and ac, but the hp work out about the same.  Mana pres 3 is very nice too.  If you're actively working on your coldain shawl (i.e., you intend to actually finish it), you might be better off getting a Crystalline torque for neck slot.  It's 12 ac no stats, but it's a lot harder to find a good neck slot than a good shoulder (especially if invest a lot of time in the coldain shawl).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am an AC oriented shaman but I would gladly take the ODS over the DWS.  The mana saving is noticble and my kill rate improved when I first equiped the ODS.<br />
<br />
Jaruden's comment about the Crystalline torgue is also very good and somthing to consider.<br />
<br />
A good way of thinking about the ODS is that the 10% mana savings on every spell is the same as making your mana pool 10% bigger without having to also increase your mana regeneration rate to fill it up.  So if you have 180 wis and a bunch of +mana items then ODS is worth perhaps 20 adition wisdom or more in effectiveness.<br />
<br />
I will also be replacing my ODS down the road with a thurg shawl ( working on 6 now ) and I wish I had the Crystalline Torgeu instead of the ODS.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i use death watchers. i dont have any mana issues really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gruel Dorfbeater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you are eventually getting a coldain prayer shawl you might as well go with a Crystalline torque and Death Watcher's shroud... that way you won't have to make a choice later on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for advice and suggestions.<br />
I like the Crystalline Torque suggestion. I may keep my Death Watcher's Shroud and try for that.<br />
<br />
But am I correct that Mana Preservation 3 only works on Spells lvl 60 and below? Or does it work on all spells up to 65? This might be the deciding factor on weither I get a ODS or Crystalline Torque, unless I find a good cheap deal on either of those.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

I had an ODS on loan for a long time, and really enjoyed using it.  At 60 or 61, I replaced it with a DWS that I won using raid points, and turned in the loaner ODS for someone else to use.  Once I had Torpor, the mana savings wasn't as important as the AC to me.<br />
<br />
I randomed the DWS once I picked up my 8th shawl as a bonus loot item to those who came to help on the final battle. :)  Probably should have sold it, but I hate selling stuff anymore and I was happy it went to a friend.  So now my shoulder AC is back down (even lower than ODS) but my other gear has improved to overcome that.  Plus 8th shawl&gt;&gt;&gt;ODS. ;) <br />
<br />
It is a personal choice, as many have said.  Both are decent shoulder pieces.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
