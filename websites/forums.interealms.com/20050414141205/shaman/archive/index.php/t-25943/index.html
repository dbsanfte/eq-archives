I am an ogre so started kos to them, but 85% of my guild is doing good so I just figured it would be easier if I was on good faction also. I have turned in 5 tokens for faction and done 16 solo tasks and am still dubious(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you get 33 crystals for most missions, it only takes 4 to get the spell.<br />
<br />
And I started out duboius, and 4 norrath tokens later was indiff.<br />

<br />
Well, make sure you're reading the task that you accept for the solo ones.  I made the mistake of thinking they were all for Norrath's Keepers, and then realized after I had completed like 4 or 5 that I had been doing a Dark Reign task!  Oops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks much for the info! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my guild had posted this first thing this morning...I promptly went over and checked out what they had for sale....<br />
<br />
the gear looks good for the most part, (think OoW tier 1 without any foci)....but the Augments are really what caught my eye. both the good and the evil vendors appear to sell the same items for the same points, just with different names.<br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna start spending alot of time in DoN missions. the augs I looked at are unbelivably cheap to obtain for what they are. some of them are really interesting... (+12 to all SVs, 36% Haste, and numerous others which are really comparatively cheap.)<br />
<br />
these look to be a good way to fill in the effects for gear....though some of these augs will kill the tradeskill augment market.<br />
<br />
and as far as faction goes....it looks like token turn-ins give sizable faction bumps, or maybe it just seems that way after going through the hellish OoW quest faction...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Are there any augments for spell haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yep, spell haste 5 augment in there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BA5 augment to for only 300 crystals or so I forget.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">*looks hopeful*<br />
<br />
Faerune augment?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't recall seeing a Faerune, but that doesn't mean it isn't in there...I didn't have time to go through each and every augment/item, but I will later, when I have more time to do so. I sorted through a few of the items randomly and found things that really caught my eye.<br />
<br />
there are multiple augments with similar effects, so there are benefits for working on one side, getting the augs you want, then working for the otherside for preference.<br />
<br />
and the task progression benefits are nice....I could use 250 more HPs any day.</div></div><hr />

You can't beat that much extra resists.  It will help out a ton</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well, as a barb, I started out apprehensive to both merchants, so I can check out both of their wares.<br />
<br />
their inventory is EXACTLY the same, save the items themselves have different names.<br />
<br />
going more thoroughly through the inventories, there isn't a Faerune, sorry glori :(, but alot of the foci were listed by Nytemare.<br />
<br />
I'd include lifetap augs and such, because I find myself meleeing more often than not lately, unless we're raiding. (my average hit is more than the melee's average crit for in EXP groups now, /boggle)<br />
<br />
125 pt lifetap augs and everything...definitely some really useful things in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So a warrior could put EB x2 on his 1.5, and Chaos Strike IV on something else!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If I'm not mistaken the augs were intended to be tied to faction, so that if you lost faction with one camp your augs from it would stop working.  Was this idea dropped?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">no, I don't believe thats how it works, the rewards for working for a specific side are not the augs persistantly working.<br />
<br />
the benefits for choosing one side over another is the +10 to all stats, and +250 HP, I believe.<br />
<br />
I suspect ALOT of people will be pissed if they tied augment functionality to faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">/concur<br />
<br />
Rewards are tied to faction, not the Augments ....<br />
<br />
The current list of rewards goes like this:<br />
<br />
+10 to all stats<br />
+250 HPs / mana / enduarace (+spell)<br />
+5 buff slots<br />
<br />
I am still working my way thru the rewards :D<br />

Paladin in my guild has a Chaotic Strike IV + EB aug in his Epic 1.5..<br />
<br />
W/ LDoN Augs, warriors were able to have 2 Anger3 augs buy 1 type 8 and 1 type 7 (or 4?).</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a sellback.  It's 50% though iirc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">think it's closer to 70%... I remember clickin on the 55 hp augment that I bought and I could resell it for I think 200 (think original price was 250 or something like that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">If it's the 285 crystal 55 hp augment listed earlier in the thread, if it said 200 resell, it's at 70%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, other than not being able to get missions or loot from the 'other' camp, are there any known ramifications for selecting one over the other? I've only done Wayfarer stuff so far, and don't want to hose myself accidentally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Can't really hose yourself, since the faction is reversable.  It would take like two weeks if you found some reason to have one instead of the other.</div></div><hr />
