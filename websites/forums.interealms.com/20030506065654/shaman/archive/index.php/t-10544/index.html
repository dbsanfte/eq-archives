<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Brit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">At 65, everything in the old world is either blue and summons, or light blue and gives crappy exp.<br />
<br />
Everything i've found so far in PoP either comes in pairs (shaman have no harmony type spell), or is light blue, or has buttloads of hps, resists, and hits for 700 a pop.<br />
<br />
If I can pull it single, root it, and it don't summon; I can kill it with root-dot. The problem is that I haven't found a steady supply of mobs like that in PoP, and it makes it impossible to solo anymore.<br />
<br />
The frogs in storms and the like are now random unrootable, and they seem to have put things like that in all the spots that were soloable.<br />
<br />
Where and what are all the 65 shaman soloing these days?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't done them, but the suits of armor near the zone in to Halls of Honor can be root-dot'd.  They don't summon, but do have a lot of hp.  I've done kited these in a tankless group before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Verant doesn't want us soloing in the endgame.  Therefore, they didn't set up any nice places for us to do it (such as FG for SoL).  Everything you do will be slower in exp than grouping and much higher risk.  This is why things come in pairs, can't be snared/rooted or are assisted by everyone and their brother.  I mean the trees help the animals in PoS....... what is this, PoG?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think finaljustice is right.<br />
<br />
It makes me very concearned about leveling my shaman up because I solo most of the time.  It is not that I am an antisocial grumpy bear ( very true thow ), it is that I like the freedom to go AFK at the drop of a hat to deal with wife / kids.<br />
<br />
I quite my monk and the game at lvl 54 when the big nerf hit and he could no longer solo.  If the Vision is so narrow as to not make room for a solo play style in PoP then I will work hard on doing lots of things I always wanted to do and just not level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sand Giants in BoT, can generally be solo pulled, just watch the pathing.  They are something of a melee beating, but with the right gear and proper tnargs thrown in u can kill them.  Its not fast, certainly a decent grp will get faster xp, but its not horrible either.  And make sure u have some cleric hp buffs on or u gunna go splat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">ogres in PoTa are pretty good xp, along with spectral and some gem drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Why would a 65 shaman ever solo for experience? People in Plane of Valor will send you tells the second that you log on begging you to come join their group.<br />
<br />
And that is assuming that you don't turn them down, since you already have something better to do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A 65 shaman can solo in PoV, certain places in PoS, CoD, and PoT.<br />
<br />
Solo exp at 65 is still roughly 1 AA every 50-60 min, which is better than what most groups can pull.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I solo because I like it :) and the freedom of action I gain from going solo.<br />
<br />
I also find soloing more interesting if I am just grinding exp then an exp group doing the grind.  The tasks are more diverse and chalanging when soloing and a lot less buffing.  The dog never complains about what buffs I put on him.<br />
<br />
I love to raid and I love a group with a goal / dungeon crawl.  Exp grinding in a group just stinks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In PoV, you can root rot golems in the desert, along with lightcrawlers.<br />
You can also do the same, or slow/tank razerfiends.<br />
You can also easily tank frogs and larvae in PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Normally I would rather group than solo, since I enjoy the social interaction and the exp is about the same.  However, I have found that the golems in PoV are quite easy to kill by root dotting.  I try and get a virtue before I do it, though, since I only have about 3600hp self buffed and that goes down pretty quick when a golem resists slow.  Kei also helps a lot, as does my horse.<br />
<br />
We finally got around to killing grummus tonight and now I'm flagged for CoD.  I went and played a bit in there for a bit with a group, and things look as if they should be easily soloable.  Everything but the named is slowable and rootable, as well as being susceptable to poison (didnt try disease) and having crap for HP.  Only problem I see is that there isn't a lot of room to move around.<br />
<br />
I have somehow managed to miss all our AD kills, so I am not flagged for HoH yet.  However, a guildie shaman tells me that he solos the guards near the entrance easily and for good exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Brit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nothing wrong with grouping, but a lot of the time I need to be afk like 10 mins out of 30 doing things around the house while playing. This would be bad for a group, so it's just best if I find a nice spot to solo and pull things at my leasure, rather than bother a group with all the afks.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove used to be my hangout, but it's all green and light blue now, and I haven't found a place in PoP that is like it.<br />
<br />
I think i'll try either the frogs in Storms or the golems in Valor then. It sounds like those are my best shots. I've tried the worms in Valor before and always get an add from somewhere. :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is places to solo at 65, just not very many and you sometimes need to get creative. Lately I've been solo'n a camp of skelles in POV, I have to break the house by pulling with root, rooting another one real quick, then bringing the 3rd to my camp, then rooting him and camping out real quick (or gating and running back). Kind of a pain to do, but once the camp is broken its real easy. <br />
<br />
I solo for the same reasons a few of you have already stated. Its a personal challege, its you VS the game. Sometimes your abilities are really put to the test. You have a lot of freedom with your time and playstyle. You can go AFK at anytime if out want, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mazirus Slaymaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">saying PoT helps none at all... say tactics or torment or something to show which yu mean :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ineluk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">he said ogres .... i think and thats tactics... soloing in torment is not funny =p<br />
<br />
I think really good solo exp is PoV Razorfiends/golems or tactics ogres and HoH various mobs. Cod is also not too bad</div></div><hr />

I dont know about you guys or your guilds progressions in POP, but i can assure you that later on in the game there is some GREAT solo spots.<br />
<br />
Halls of Honor for starters.. i can solo any trail area with no hassle. And if you are one of those people who is to scared to take two at once, root one and move the second about 500 feet away (which you have TONS of room to do) and root that one, camp out and come back and kill the second one while the first goes home.<br />
<br />
You can also solo in Plane of Fire and Plane of Water zone in as well.. <br />
<br />
So you can leave that &quot;SOE does not want us to solo&quot; BS at the door. As for getting the flags to these zones.. well, cant help you there.<br />
<br />
Hope this gives yall something to look foward too. And yes, the EXP is outstanding in all three zones.</div></div><hr />

Plane of Water zone in you say?  wanna give a bit more info on this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I dont know where you solo in PoW though :)<br />
But if you mean the 2 guardians at zonein.. yea, maybe. But that place is ranjah teritory on AB ;) <br />
Fire is a good place to solo anyway and if your not in e-planes, go to tactics, levi down to the arena/pit and solo at zoneout.. No risk, just root/dot all you like. The only pita down there is the flying guys who cast spells.. Otherwise there is no big problems..</div></div><hr />

Oh, and everyone is flagged for elemental planes.  Actually all characters created after the PoP release have those flags at creation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm still searching for good spots myself.  Valor Gamite frogs and Planarian larvae are easily soloable if you are careful, but they don't seem very efficient for exp.  Outer Cave is also a decent solo spot, but honestly it is much better w/ friends &amp; it is tough to catch it open.<br />
<br />
Oh, and everyone is flagged for elemental planes.  Actually all characters created after the PoP release have those flags at creation.<br />
<br />
Just because many of us aren't flagged for the elemental planes doesn't mean those with advice for the zones shouldn't post.  Someday you may get flagged Tier4 and will want this information.  Please stick to the forum topic and keep the negativity to yourself.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok you obviously didn't read Kong's post at all.  I'll spell it out for you - he stated that, seeing as how parts of some elemental planes are soloable, SOE wants us to solo in PoP.  This obviously isn't the case.  Please read before responding, it would help out discussions alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">No Schpleef, you obviously didnt read the first post here that asked <br />
<br />
&quot;Where and what are all the 65 shaman soloing these days?&quot; <br />
<br />
That statement makes it viable to say that e-planes are good solospots I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Here's the line I was responding to:<br />
<br />
So you can leave that &quot;SOE does not want us to solo&quot; BS at the door<br />
<br />
This is evidenced by the fact that I quoted it in my post.  Please, go read an internet newbie FAQ on forum posting or something  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">And don't be so afraid to solo things that summon.   We have torpor/Q for a reason.   Add in Tnarg and you can heal considerably more than most anything outside of PoP can hit for.  Root Rot is IMO the most boring thing you can do with the game.   Unless I am at death's door almost half the fight I tend to head elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Schpleef, just PRIOR to where you quoted the bit about Elemental planes was a piece that said <br />
<br />
Halls of Honor for starters..<br />
<br />
Now ok you need to kill Aerin Dar for that key (requires a raid guild/BIG pick-up raid) OR do the alternate entrance quest (which requires a fair bit of camping but IS doable).<br />
<br />
Or did you miss that part about HoH before you got uptight about the Elemental Planes thing?<br />
<br />
I agree with the &quot;So you can leave that &quot;SOE does not want us to solo&quot; BS at the door&quot; statement.<br />
<br />
And I don't have Elemental Plane access yet (just PoV/PoS/HoH/BoT/PoTactics).<br />
<br />
Edit: And yes you quoted what was said but you quoted it OUT OF CONTEXT. Perhaps you need to re-read the internet posting FAQ before you start rudely mouthing off at people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Zhom, you were rude to me first, as was Frekkels.  I'm not gonna turn this into a flamewar, so I'll leave it at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure what planet or alternate reality you are inhabiting... but...<br />
<br />
1) Frekkels politely asked you to keep your negativity to yourself AFTER your sarcastic comment &quot;Oh, and everyone is flagged for elemental planes. Actually all characters created after the PoP release have those flags at creation.&quot;.<br />
2) My &quot;rudeness&quot; in telling YOU to go read an internet posting FAQ was in direct response to you FIRST telling Frekkels and/or <br />
salorm to go read an internet posting FAQ....<br />
<br />
Keep making an ass of yourself if you like, but please at least try to get your facts straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Frekkels politely asked you to keep your negativity to yourself AFTER your sarcastic comment<br />
I didn't feel that Frekkels was polite about it at all, guess its a variance of opinion.  My sarcastic comment was not directed at Frekkels, therefore did not warrant a rude response.<br />
My &quot;rudeness&quot; in telling YOU to go read an internet posting FAQ was in direct response to you FIRST telling Frekkels<br />
FIRST telling Frekkels - exactly.  I wasn't talking to you, but you responded anyway, and I felt that was rude.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I offended you, you seem like a really nice person who just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.  I'm sure you're very good looking also, and make a lot of money.  Good day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">The problem with the HoH trial areas are the unrootables that spawn.   Aggro kiting them necro-style if the actual trial room is empty might work if you have fast casting focii, but it is at the very least a major pain in the ass.<br />

I usually just move to another spot when that happens.  Wizards hate me =)</div></div><hr />

The Stormriders in the First Upper CourtYard in BoT are dead easy to solo in teh face .... pull with Malo, slow on Inc and ya good to tank em.<br />
<br />
They reasonable XP, reasonable amount of HPs and hit worse the female pallies ....<br />

They also drop Specs and Ethreals every now and then.<br />
