I thought it might be rather neat to talk about a zone from a shaman's perspective, as in discussing tactics and strats with the shaman in mind.  I'll start with PC since most people have been here and it also seems to be one zone that most people have alot of questions about.  This thread could also serve as a guide for new shamans who are looking for a place to hunt (10-20) here at the Crucible.<br />
<br />
So feel free to respond with your thoughts on the zone. (Good or Bad)<br />
Your tactics on soloing and grouping here.<br />
Any tips or facts about the zone you want to share.<br />
And any questions you may have overall.<br />
<br />
This thread can help serve as a warning for new players who are entering this zone for the first time and want to avoid the problem areas.  It can also introduce the zone and explain where the obvious camps are.  There are also a few quests that involve this zone, so if you are familiar with them feel free to post information about them as well.  That way as Shamans hunt in this area and collect items they can hold on to them if they are part of a quest they are interested in.<br />
<br />
Most importantly this thread should apply to the shaman class and offer a unique look at the zone through the eyes of a shaman.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Mob Information:<br />
The Reishicyben (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7183) - Drops several items including Ancient Sensate Cloak, Ancient Sensate Eye, Ancient Sensate Shield, Fist of Horn, Fist of Wood.  The shield is not bad for a non twinked shaman and this encounter is alot of fun with a group who is fairly new to the game.  Older players mind find it boring.<br />
Ch'ktok (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7244) - Drops Ch'ktok Legplates, Herikol's Katar - Nothing of use to a shaman but another fun encounter if you can find him up.<br />
<br />
General list of creatures available to kill (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=148)<br />
<br />
Mobs range in levels with the Mud Burrowers,  Sensate Reishi sporelings,  and Muck Diggers being the lowest.  Sensate Reishis, Sensate Reishi juveniles, and  Sensate Reishi sprouts are next in line.  Wetfangs,  Outcast Shiknar, and fiends come in next, with the bandits being the higher end mobs.  You will find that alot of times the bandits are the most heavily camped and it might be best to hunt the fiends until they are no longer worth your time simply because of the abudance of them compared to people camping them.  The shiknar are also usually undercamped and a fairly valuable place to xp up until 15 or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogrok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am letting out a secret I have held for a while, or so it seems.  I have met only a handfull of people who know about the great exp and loot machine known as the outcast shiknars.<br />
<br />
With a full group at 15 head north north east out of Shadow Haven, up the ramp, accross the bridge, left (toward B2), right at the first tunnel, immediate left, follow the left wall around the cavern, then through the tunnel to the north.  Here you will find the Shiknar.<br />
<br />
They are staggered nicely with a couple of wanderers.  The tunnel to the left leads to the big Mushroom (The Reishicyben), and that is usually the one I take.<br />
<br />
Each full trip up and back will translate into one level up.  The items that drop are all worth at least one gold (the shells are worth 5).  The stackable legs are nice.  The barbs are throwing items (monks and rogues love it).<br />
<br />
You can do this over and over again, fast and furious, leveling in about a half hour each run, until the low 20's.<br />
<br />
I like it better than bandits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't know why of all places they decided to make Paludal amongst the highest xp mod zones because I think it's a pitifully boring dungeon.  But anyways, it does have insane xp and 'Paludal' is the answer most everyone will give to someone seeking fast xp up to 25ish.<br />
<br />
Some recommendations:<br />
<br />
At the lowest levels solo or group vs the mushroom on the ShadeWeaver side thingies...they're not social but shrooms in general seem to hit fairly hard.  Unless you're very prepared, I wouldn't mess with the bug thingies as they're highly social and can swarm if enough are near.  Not much strategy here...just be the shaman...nothing in this area is aggro unless someone has trained phlergs to the ShadeWeaver Thicket zone.<br />
<br />
In the very low teens you can do phlergs with a small team or group if you're careful.  Phlergs are aggro and social.  Depending on where you're hunting them a variety of tactics come into play.  At the level you ideally hunt them in some kind of group, you'll likely be tackling them on the &quot;path&quot; up near the bandit camps...where it's easier to isolate singles.  Rest high up on the &quot;wall&quot; by the &quot;path&quot;.  Watch for roamers.<br />
<br />
In the mid teens you could possibly solo phlergs if you're careful, know what you're doing, and have good gear.  I don't care for soloing so a duo or group would be more ideal.<br />
<br />
Once in your mid and high teens you could get lucky and get in a bandit group - or continue with phlergs.  It's ideal to be at a bandit camp as soon as you can, IMO.<br />
<br />
Anywhere near 20 and up you should be doing the bandits in a group.<br />
<br />
The bandit camps also involve little strategy.  It's reasonably safe pulling with few roamers that are usually easily dealt with.  The big concerns here are courtesy - ie, usually groups stake out a &quot;camp&quot; and it's not friendly to pull from another's camp.  It's also good to warn if you generate a train - rare, but it does happen.  The zone to ShadowHaven is near the two more popular bandit camps (go figure) so no real need for strategy exists...just chain pull and if things get ugly you bail.  Even if you die the xp is so good that the xp loss is trivial.  Many will bind at the soul binder in ShadowHaven for quick turnaround.<br />
<br />
Note that if Paludal is extremely crowded (as often is the case at the bandit camps in particular) then the xp may not be that great at 20+ because even with the xp mod if your group isn't pulling frequently you're not getting xp.<br />
<br />
Also note that I constantly say that Paludal requires little strategy.  I believe this to be true.  You won't gain and skill at practical and safe dungeon hunting and you won't be pushed to explore your class to leverage all of your abilities.  It's more of an excercise in harvesting easy xps.  I'm not necessarily saying this is bad - just stating how I view it.<br />
<br />
Back in my day, sonny, we had to deal with constant trains, living in fear, and all that happy crappy in the carnage laiden dungeons of old!  We didn't have no stinkin' Paludal XP Factory to fly through 15-20 levels in a matter of days!  We had keys and Befallen and wells to fall down into...we had Unrest and mega trains...we had boss mobs slaughtering people left and right trained to the zone in CrushBone....we had massive trains and aggro in BlackBurrow!  Damn younguns nowadays have it SO easy!  Anyways....I've done Paludal here and there so don't mind my hypocrisy or my rambling.<br />
<br />
While one can make lots of levels in a hurry in Paludal I would advise, that unless you've already seen the world, to get out and try many places instead of spending 20 levels in Paludal.  EQ has tons of great content at those levels...many places to see and experience!  If you only do the Paludal Express you can miss out on so much.  I only did a little bit of Paludal with Zhahz mixing in a few other places for variety.  I've taken some of my alts to the low end Paludal since then since the xp is sickening.<br />
<br />
There is a lot more to the game than fast xp in Paludal.  Say it with me....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ghurosz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I started in Paludal Caverns at level 6 last night, at the zone to Shadeweavers Thicket, hunting the mud burrowers.  At level 6 they range from blue to yellow.  My Shaman is twinked, though not obnoxiously so (with random loot I had laying around from other characters' spoils, and the benefit of having all spells available for my level).  Sometimes I had to pull two due to the spawn location, and they are social so they will aggro (good thing the zone is right there).  In a matter of approximately 2 hours I went from level 6 to level 10 (including a quick gate home to train meditate, already had level 9 spells on me).  I plan on logging back in and moving further in to tackle some of the mushrooms and more bugs until I am level 12-13 to start taking on the Phatog Phlergs (sp?).  Once I reach 16-17 I'll try to get in on some Bandit groups if any spots are open (who doesn't like a slower?).  If that doesn't work, I'll go to an old-world favorite: The Estate of Unrest.  Any untwinked character could jump into PC at level 6-7 and work all the way through level 22-25.  It's not the most exciting dungeon, agreed, but I've been playing since day 1 and my only reason for going to PC is fast xp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my experience hunting bandits in PC, with a well balanced group, they drop too fast for slow to make a noticeable difference. My twink cleric hardly had to toss a heal in the 7 levels he hunted there. He spent a good deal of time meleeing/nuking. Perhaps before the heavy twinkage, it might have mattered more. But with increasingly superior weapons serving as little more than twink gear, the bandits aren't standing a chance!</div></div><hr />

Shshsh, don't tell anyone they won't actually need a slower.   :D</div></div><hr />
