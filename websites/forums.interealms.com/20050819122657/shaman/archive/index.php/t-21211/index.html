<br />
I realize a bunch of you are probably in college, but I've always wondered how many other 16 year olds are running around. Likewise, I've wondered how many people can still balance EQ around RL jobs and commitments (ie. family, etc), well after their college days. People my age have homework, but with 1 or 2 free periods every day + a 5 person rotation, we really don't have jack or **** left to work on at home during the weekdays. Study for a test every 2 weeks is about it.<br />
<br />
How old are you, and how do you work EQ into your RL schedule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi garf , <br />
             Im a 28 year old male from Tennessee . I work what is in my area a pretty standard job in a factory here . I am a weilder by trade and work &quot;normaly&quot; 40 hours a week . At times that can be upto 60-70 overtime pending . <br />
Im not what you might consider a &quot;super smart&quot; guy . I graduated high school and then learned my trade on the job . I play EQ almost every night and I have done so for nearly 5 years .<br />
I usualy get on at around 8pm est and play till 11-12 ish .<br />
<br />
Hope that answers your question appropriately .</div></div><hr />

I was playing probably too much EQ; now it's only Mon and Wed nights (guild raid nights) and I try to squeeze an LDoN or two in while 'working from home' during the day; I stopped playing on weekends or the other evenings to do more with my wife and house/yard work (although I'll get on if she has other plans).</div></div><hr />

I go to college full time, am in my 3rd year.  EQ is my stress reliever (ha, thats what I tell myself anyhow).<br />
<br />
I play in a guild that raids 5 days a week and yet I still am able to get good grades and do my homework.  Oh and have a semi decent social life, well...as much of a social life as I care to have.<br />
<br />
I use to play a lot more than I do now...I log in at 6 every night and log off around 12.  Don't play Sunday's or Thursday's, and usually don't play till 5 on Saturday.<br />
<br />
I have me a schedule that I like to abide by and still get on with a normal life.  I don't like to change it! ;)</div></div><hr />

This makes it hard for me to play as much as I would like.  Sometimes I will be able to log on and play 2 hours and sometimes I wont be able to sign in at all.  Work and school always comes before EQ though.  Plan on moving to EQ2 once it comes it if its as casual friendly as they are making it out to be :)</div></div><hr />

One of the things I have always liked best about EQ with regard to other games I enjoyed in my past like Quake 2, Half Life, Diablo 2, etc etc is that EQ seems to have a MUCH lower percentage of &quot;snot nosed punks&quot;. Even a majority of the teenagers who play EQ are good folk, courteous and respectful. The punks and griefers dont usually stick around long, because its just too easy to ignore/avoid them and they REALLY cant make much of an impact on the blue servers.</div></div><hr />

On a RL note, that ITT thing, you might wanna honestly do some reasearch with the companies that supposedly hire from ITT, NOT the school its self.  I live in Oregon and around here ITT is kind of a joke....its not as great as its made out to be, in fact more companies in Oregon higher graduates from Comm. Col. than ITT.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">36 years old, software engineer, created this char the summer of 2000.  My only kid is in high school and my husband works nights sometimes, so I get to play around them.  EQ gets depressing, though.  I am in a Time raiding guild and I really don't have - no pun intended - time to exp and raid all the time, but I hate to leave because my guild has good players and I find most other content in game boring now.  But many of the kids playing this game don't seem to get family and job have to take precedence sometimes.  <br />
<br />
I really disagree that EQ players are more mature kids.  I have met a lot of high school and college kids on EQ that made me want to stop playing.  The game seems to attract people at that stage where they think they know everything but actually know very little. :(  I think some of these people are trying to feel better about themselves by worrying about how uber their character is, which saddens and rather frightens me, since it's just a game.  And striking a balance where it's a game, but it's a game worth playing well, is something that's too rare.  I see a lot of laziness and people who want things handed to them or simply cannot play their character - then I see people who can play well but act as if EQ were really terribly important when it isn't.  Just ask yourself this:  if you knew you were going to die in a month, would you play EQ or spend time with your family?  And if you said EQ, would you please consider getting some help?  <br />
<br />
Frankly, trying to fit EQ into my life with family and work is stressful and has made me consider quitting mroe than once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started, ****, April 2001? So I was...13...or something? Hah, I remember playing back then. I was terrible, but a few knew I was young(er) and they accepted me into their guild and learned me a thing or two (Obsidian Fear was the name).<br />
<br />
I have no problem admitting I had my application rejected by two guilds. IMHO, one was because of how I acted, and another was rather shady (long story, and a few inside friends told me I was hosed - *shrug*).<br />
<br />
I think EQ is the best way to spend your early teen years (if you have the excess time - I juggled sports, going out, good grades, etc, so it IS doable), being around a large amount of adults who aren't cuddling you and all that bull**** will make you realize a thing or two. You aren't known by your age, and you're not cut slack by random strangers. You're known by how you play and how you interact with others - there's no way to judge anyone based on how old they are (since it's unknown information) - everyone is weighed and criticized(sp?) the same. You're forced to either adapt to a more mature type of enviroment, or be known as the server clown. Not to mention how fast a bad reputation can spread across a server. Christ,  that stuff is like a freaking wildfire. Expose yourself in the wrong way to enough people and you'll be blacklisted, no second chance, even if you ARE just a little kid learning a thing or two.<br />
<br />
You can either take it, or you can't. If you can't you flame and bitch and die out somewhere in the mix. If you stick it out (through your complete idiocy) you end up learning a thing or two. I find kids my age who play high end EQ tend to be quite well spoken and level headed. There are a few exceptions (Hi Wildbug), but for the most part we're a decent crew. I'm night and day from where I was 3 or so years ago, and I attribute a large portion of this change to EQ.<br />
<br />
Whatever, maybe I'm full of **** after all :).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">The reason I feel EQ attracts a more mature audience, including youths, is because in my personal experience, the punks come, and the punks go, but they are the exception, not the rule. I am willing to bet that if you played with 100 random players, you would be SHOCKED at how &quot;young&quot; some of them are, because they act very mature. By the same token, a lot of &quot;adults&quot; can certainly act like children.<br />
<br />
I guess my point was that per/capita, EQ has a WHOLE lot less snot-noses than, say, those L33t h4X0rs of Diablo 2 who always threaten to blow up my computer, LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Pande...and the rest of the xteaming scum of Norrath...i am still hopefull (even though i know it will NEVER happen) that the devs will hardcode the server to lock the teams up.  Make the blues stay with blues/yellows with yellows/etc etc...like RZ.  If that day ever does happen...god help us all, there will be a new meaning to pandemonium on the server hehe :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I am 20, and I am surprised at how much older you guys are than I had thought, but i presume that it could possibly be because the majority of teenage players would rather spend their time grinding or raiding all summer long instead of wasting precious exp time having an intellectual conversation on a board that doesn't give you any in-game rewards in return... but that is just speculation.  A lot of teenagers are actually very well spoken... they just get the bad rep bleed from the majority of that age group.  I hated being a teenager, and was glad when it technically ended a few months ago, lol.<br />
<br />
I started Everquest in Beta (leaving UO was a no-brainer since the Rep patch destroyed that game for me), and left around late Velious Era, and returned late last year... and I'm surprised at how many more friends I made and how many more guild invites I received.  I'd like to think that I've matured over the last 5 years... kinda mad at myself in retrospect for subjecting some of the older folks to my tomfoolery at that time.<br />
<br />
I finished with a 3.5 GPA and a 1280 SAT, but cannot afford college, so I'm sort of saving up while I work as an assistant manager over at a small apartment community.  I'm also A+ certified, if that counts for anything!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do classes attract a certain age group ?<br />
<br />
Interesting question, I would definitely say so.<br />
<br />
*Generally* speaken, the older You are the more stuff You gotta do IRL (responsibilities like job, family, kids etc.) and the less time You have for EQ.<br />
So I can imagine that older people tend to chose classes that are not dependant on finding a group quickly and who can solo better, so You can set up quickly for a one or two hour session.<br />
<br />
I also know for a fact that parents wiith young kids like 'feign' classes like monks, necros or SK's.<br />
You can imagine why  :D</div></div><hr />

I've been playing Everquest since the earliest days of kunark, over all that time constantly remaking characters and then creating new ones.
