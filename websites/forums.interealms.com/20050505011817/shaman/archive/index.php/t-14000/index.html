<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">No, I didnt use Search.  Ive got about 5 minutes before I have to run out the door to work and was hoping that I would be forgiven and have my question answered.<br />
<br />
At what level does it become possible to solo guardian worms?  My Magelo is in my sig. <br />
<br />
I ask because a a guildie was hunting shards last night and he and the cleric that was with him killed a guardina worm.  And it dropped Torpor.  Now...instead of being a nice person and givng it to the guild for the 2 shaman that still dont have it (one of whom is 62) he decides to give into his greedy side and sell it in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
It sat on his vendor for about .005 seconds before it was snatched up for 45K, as Rodcet seems to have a serious lack of Kunark level spells lately.<br />
<br />
So...do I have to have Torpor, or even an incomplete heal before I attemp wurms?  Or should I just keep saving and curse my guildmate forever?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a catch 22 im afraid. You need torpor to solo a guardian wurm at least, which is of course why you are trying to kill it :)<br />
<br />
At 60 you can duo with a mage, good warrior, even a ranger. They must be proficient and decently kitted out (not so much the mage). Im still trying too ;) Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Currently my guild ( a bit on the smaller side, But a great family) Is targetin' those guys :) Why not get a small group of your good freinds together to kill them? It doesn't just benifit you if torpor drops cause the GW's  have spells they need as well.</div></div><hr />

It was his spell to sell, why expect him to donate it to the guild?  Especially when that 45k will go a long way towards 63 to 65 spells.  Should he have given guildies 1st shot at buying it?  Sure.  But giving away a spell worth 45k and not getting anything in return is asking to much.</div></div><hr />

But giving away a spell worth 45k and not getting anything in return is asking to much.<br />
<br />
As a warrior he does not need spells.  And I know things about this warrior that I didnt make known during my first post.  Like the fact that I had a CoF that my SK (who is not guilded) won on a Naggy raid.  The warrior in question was using an FBSS at level 56 for his item haste.  Now...my level SK could certainly have used the CoF, but because the warrior in question was one of the higher level warriors in the guild and still using 22% haste I made a gift of the CoF to him.  How much does a CoF go for on your server?  On mine it still sells for 60 to 80K. (this was about year ago....)<br />
<br />
The warrior in question is also incredibly wealthy.  He has incredible gear, wonderful weapons, and (as I see it) another 45K is as a few hundred gold is to you or me. (He gathered his wealth in Seb at 60, when that was as high as you could go; nine months or so of daily grinding there will make anyone rich)<br />
<br />
The only reason that I included the story about him getting Torpor was because Im still kinda steamed about it.  I would have liked to have it, but am still a level away from where I could use it, whereas there are shaman that are in thier 60's that still have not gotten the spell.  If he had given it, or hell even SOLD it to the guild I would not be nearly as upset about the situation; as it is im ready to put him on my /ignore list.<br />
<br />
But back to the question at hand: Thats what I was afraid of.  And getting a group of people together is proving to be difficult as of late.  My guild, with about 3 exceptions (Im one of them :(..) is flagged for PoV/PoS.  They are always there now.  Even the level 50's that my guild flagged hang out there in guild groups.  Getting them away from that to go hunt in Skyfire (a zone that sucks mightily) for spells that many dont need anymore is proving to be a difficult task, which is why I was wondering when it is possible to solo them.<br />
<br />
Ah well...back to cash farming to save up for it if I ever see it pop up in the Bazaar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">*** are you talking about Redchief.  You are in a guild for a reason, to help your guildies and to get help back in return.  <br />
On a spell that rare I would definitely expect him to donate it to the guild.  I would do the same thing for the warrior if, for example, a fleshgrinder dropped in CT that one of our melee's needed.<br />
Now im not saying every single drop you ever get should be given back to the guild, but when torpor drops and you know TWO shamans in you're guild need it, you do the right thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What goes around comes around, by acting that way he is less likely to get help when he needs it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You need torpor to solo a guardian wurm at least<br />
Not entirely true, but close enough :p  I didn't want to buy torpor and malo, only to have to upgrade them at 65 - so I did it the hard way, and was 65 for a good 2 weeks before getting Quiescence.  During that time I was able to solo GW's just using KM, and with of course a Virtue and KEI.  Even then, it could get close if I had bad luck channelling off those 10 second KMs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Next time in your initial post, you should be more clear on the facts.  Like the fact he was a warrior and not a shaman.  The fact that you had previously gave this person a CoF.  This kind of information can change the entire perspective of the situation.<br />
<br />
Now, maybe i'm wrong, but joining a guild does not entitle the guild to all your high level drops when your soloing/duoing w/ someone.  If you gave something to him personally, then it is not unrreasonable to expect him to return the favor later on (which he did not).  So he has lots of PP.  I dont know what it goes for on your server, but on Saryn a Blade of Carnage goes for about 350k, and a Sceptre of Destruction (which probably doesnt drop on Rodcet anymore) is closer to 500k.  These are the best droppable warrior hate proccing weapons in the game.  Where is a warrior going to get the kind of pp necessary to pay for them?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, giving you a copy of Torpor would have been the least he could have done for the CoF you gave him.  But expecting him to give 45k to his guild seems unreasonable when he would get nothing in return.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Gosh, I really don't understand this point of view at all.  No one in my guild would ever even think of selling Torpor if it dropped.  In fact, they'd probably call me on the phone and tell me to hurry up and log in cuz they had a spell for me:)<br />
<br />
Even if I didn't need it, it still wouldn't be sold, it'd go into the spell bank for future shammys who need it, because the guild is stronger if people have all their spells.<br />
<br />
I don't quite get the point of being in a guild where people would sell stuff they know others need.  In my guild we are all friends and don't use pp as a means of exchange.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agree that it'll come back to haunt him.  And who needs his help anywho right :) You'll get it and brag about how you went and oops it dropped right away OMG! Gee that was soo eaasy, I sure am lucky. . .I was havin' the hardest time gettin' it. . . my freinds couldn't get it to drop either. . .whew! I'm sooooo happy /guilt trip neener neener off :b<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, from my side, I can kinda understand it, if not condone it. Being a 3-boxer, I'm responsable for getting all 3 toons equiped and with spells. Only one toon counts on the raids, for the chance of loot drops, even though I still buff, heal and what not through all 3. That's including spell drops and such.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, if I had another Torpor or Malo drop for me, I'd be hard pressed as to what I would do. I've told other guildies where I got the spells from, and they haven't bothered to make the effort. I spent over a week and got extremely lucky. Why should I help them, when my toons don't recieve any in return?<br />
<br />
Knowing myserf, I'd give to guild anyway, being the sap that I am.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Gosh, and if you were there helping the cleric get shards, you would have got the torpor I bet.  I am sure there was more than just a cleric and warrior killing the GW, as they are pretty tough unslowed.  Doubtful if it could be done duo with a cleric/warrior.<br />
<br />
I finally gathered enough components to make malo with research.  Did I sell it?  Nope, it was donated to a shaman in the guild that needed.  If I didnt play a shaman, would I have sold it?  Yup, probably so.  Because many non-shaman really don't appreciate having spells like malo/torpor.  I know I didn't until I started playing one.  Yes, I knew malo was important, but I just saw torpor as another heal, so what.  Now that I have torpor, I dont know what I would do without it.<br />
<br />
Now as far as the CoF thing goes, that tosses a twist in things.  Specially since people typically don't give things like that away.</div></div><hr />

I just said screw it and got some twink gear for my ranger and decked out a few slots on myself that were lacking....Pox of bertox??? 60k (no joke) and the person said FIRM on the 60k when I offered 10k.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">60 shaman/60 monk should work fine if you have Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Postul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have been killing these the past few days. I two box with my 62 Shaman and my 61 Ranger. Shaman unbuffed has just over 2k hp with 965ac and 235 wis. Ranger unbuffed is around 2500 hp and 1001ac. So its safe to say they arnt the strongest characters on my server. Only buffs I use are the shaman and ranger buffs. With one exception I always have KEI and the shaman. I also have a lizard to sit on. But the wurms are VERY VERY ez to kill with these two. As far as solo I cant see me even soloing the wurms safe at 65. I have to give credit to the people who solo them. They just have to be flat out better geared and a better player then myself.<br />
<br />
But as far as doing the wurms duo. As long as you have ghetto shaman CH and some form of a semi decent tank you should be able to own them. So I would wait until 58 grab a 60 or 61 melee and then mess with them. <br />
<br />
I have read alot of stories about these. From people who solo and duo. I was scared stiff the first time I pulled one with what I have read. I was shocked to see I finished the first battle full health on both toons and 3 bubs of mana left on the shaman with no cann during the battle. <br />
<br />
I only hunt the VP entrance. In the 20 plus hours I have killed them I have never got a single add once. All I do is snare with the ranger 4 to 5 times to grab nice agro. If your looking straight at the VP entrance. I pull them to the left side. Up the hill that is next to the entrance. Pull the wurm back to the flat there and slow and cripple it. At 62 I have no need for any type of Malo spell. They almost never resist. I have had one resist slow 3 times. That one I did hit with Malosini. I cast Kraggs Mending once the ranger is in the 60% health range and reslow at 50%. If I want to end it sooner I plague and bane at 50% as well. I have no PoX yet :/ Ranger has never been below 30% health and the shaman has never gone under 1 bub of mana. Only time he is ever that low is if I need to rebuff mid battle. <br />
<br />
Now with all that being said. I have killed on average of one per hour. That doesnt mean I see one every hour. That means if I spend 8 hours there I see about 8 wurms. I can go a few hours without a single wurm spawn then 3 or 4 will spawn within 30 minutes. So they seem to run on a cycle of some sorts. With the 20 or so wurms I have killed. I have yet to see a single shaman spell. I have not looted a single good 60 spell that I could sell for 10k or more. Its an awfull camp with horrible return. But in this day and age in EQ its all I have. I havnt even seen torpor for sale for close to 2 months and the last one I saw was 45k. So I will be sitting at VP entrance until I either loot torpor. Or I loot enough spells that I can sell them all and buy Torpor Malo and Pox. Either way im in for a long haul :(<br />
<br />
Good luck to any shaman camping these. I hope you all have better luck then myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">It seems a lot harder than it really is...<br />
<br />
   I started trying at level 60 and was never quite able to pull it off. Once I got to 62 and the new quick heal it became much easier.  First kill was rough, had to root the wurm and let my pet tank him until I could get some health and mana back. Every other fight since then has been fairly straightforward. Had KEI blow during one fight, didn't make much of a difference. On 2 separate occasions hit MYSELF with epic dot and didn't have any problems.<br />
 <br />
   I would start off with trying the GWs that spawn at VP... dealing with the wandering ones near the Ragefire spawn point has its own set of problems. Typically I set my pet at the back part of the finished area a top VP entrance. Just hit him with haste, if I happen to have some extra weapons I give those to him. For personal buffs, virtue is a must for me at this point, preferably have KEI but isn't needed. Hit myself with focus, regrow, sta, VoTB, regrow and Lev. Cann back to fm. Float down to front of VP and wait until the wandering mob is away from the GW. Pull with malo(not needed but makes life easier), pull him along the side(doesn't matter which side) root him, then slow, cripple, insidious decay. Keep him rooted while you regain mana, if needed root again. Once root breaks and you're ready pull him back up on to the top of VP. I usually position myself with my back to the dragon statue. Dogdog should be as close to directly behind the wurm as possible otherwise he tends to push the wurm too much. Keep torpor on yourself at all times, if you're running close to full health hit cann4 a bit. I have cann5 and usually hit myself with Tnargs mending after using it. Just cycle through dots as needed, bane, pox and epic. If running a little low on mana drop bane out for a few. Epic is a pain in the butt to land sometimes due to the casting time but nothing beats free damage. Generally takes me 5-7 minutes. Usually reslow between 45 and 60%.<br />
<br />
       One thing I have noticed... there seem to be 3 different variants of GWs. All con the same, but some run low 30s dps, others mid 40s and still a tougher crowd that runs in the high 50s. The high 50s variant can be very difficult.<br />
<br />
     In my experience doing it without torpor would be sheer luck for all but the best equipped, KM simply takes too long to cast. As is I have to use a wicked bone atlat(casting haste) to get torpor in between hits consistently(don't have quick buff yet). Affliction haste and efficiency are the other focus effects I have. oh yeah and have a horsie too!!<br />
<br />
   Usually run between 3900 and 4700 hps. Using VoTB and virtue my ac is about 1130. Have about 3600 mana. Don't have any avoidance or mitigation AAs.<br />
<br />
Good Hunting!! Its a fun fight and quite an accomplishment.<br />

<br />
Get to lvl 58 and Kragg's Mending, then you will be able to duo GWs with any decently equipped lvl 55+ melee.<br />
<br />
Just make sure to have kei or better, then you wont have mana problems if you canni IV as often as you can between heals and reslows (won't need many reslows anyway).<br />
<br />
Use your pet with 2 weapons and haste as an additional source of damage.</div></div><hr />

Remember, there are TWO varieties of Guardian Wurms in the zone.  There's the normal sort, which is about level 54 and the ones that guard the VP entrance, which are level 60 and drop our spells.  I think you'd have to be DAMN lucky to drop slow on a mob 6 levels your senior with no malo, on the first try.  This was probably on the lower mobs.</div></div><hr />

Like I said, I may have gotten lucky that day :) I don't argue that.  The GW's still conned red to me at 54.. they were the ones that wandered by the Ragefire camp where we were helping a cleric friend collect shards for his epic.  :)  The pally was pulling them as he saw them.. but I seriously doubt he pulled any from the VP entrance... once again, :) it was probably just one of those lucky days.</div></div><hr />

Revenge is a dish best served cold.  I'd wait until his epic battle and load Annul in the place of Slow.  When RF doesn't get slowed (or you annul it) and everyone dies, ruining his epic run for that time, you explain what you did and WHY in /gu.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the guildies who didn't realize the signifigance of the Torpor drop . . . the &quot;right&quot; thing to do would be to explain to your guild leader why you won't be assisting this person in the future with their endeavors.  If the person is the GL or an officer, I'd find a new guild.  Then again, my guild has VERY high moral standards, IMHO, and they would potentially be guild removed for not offering in /gu before selling.  Basically, all spells are offered in /gu regardless of price/rarity/etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Postul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">This is a repost of mine off another GW topic. Just so everyone knows what they are up against if they plan to use the guardian wurms as thier source to aquire Torpor and Malo.<br />
<br />
<br />
OK here is my latest update. I spent a week camping the guardian wurms at VP entrance. 12 hours on the first day 6 hours or more on the other days. In that weeks time I did not loot a single copy of Malo or Torpor. I have killed around 40 to 50 wurms. On every occasion when I left the camp I waited for it to fully spawn and tried to always leave when there was a double spawn of the wyverns next to each other. That way when I would come back I could tell if someone had killed them since I had been gone. Now its possible that they could have been killed and respawned in the same manner but not likely. Which would lead me to believe I had more then 80% of all the guardian wurm spawns during the week. Once again this is just speculation though I cant be positive as I didnt sit there 24 hours a day.<br />
<br />
Also during this time I saw Talendor pop on my rangers track. Got the guild there and 8 of us dropped him. He dropped Voice of the Berserker. No Malo no Torpor.<br />
<br />
Spells I looted worth anything were PoX Tigirs and Word of Redemtion level 60 cleric group CH spell. Thats in nothing that makes me feel my weeks worth of time there was well spent. All in all im furious to have spent so much time there and got what I consider to be nothing in return. All I have is a mule full of spells that will take forever to sell. I dont have the use or Torpor or Malo and will never have it. Once I sell the garbage I have im sure not gonna buy Torpor and Malo when 65 is just around the corner and im gonna need to break the bank once again for Q and Malos.<br />
<br />
So to any of you looking to use the guardian wurms as a source for these spells. Your gonna have to be real lucky as some of the people have posted here and hope to get the one in a million drop off a early kill. I for one wouldnt waste my time knowing what I know now.<br />
<br />
O ya one last thing. This morning before I logged out of pure anger. A cleric that had been letting me know he was in the zone for his epic fragments. Was nice enough to let me know that Talendor spawned again last night while I was there. Not sure how I missed him on track. But I knew he was killed because the guild shouted they were pulling him to rage spawn point. Talendor dropped Torpor for his guild last night. I spend a freakin week there hours on end and even kill Talendor once and another guild walks in kills Talendor and gets what I have been searching for in a few minutes time while im in the zone.<br />
<br />
Good luck to anyone that has to use this as a source for these spell.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Perhaps he needed the cash for something else for himself. You call him greedy yet you 'expect' him to give you an item that sells for 20k plus? The irony is delicious.<br />
<br />
Now that said, it would be nice if he gave it to you... but I certainly wouldn't 'expect' it, nor would I call for him to be /guildremoved for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The fact that the guy was given a cloak of flames from this guy does make him greedy. If I do you a favor like that and you repay me by thinking of yourself thats messed up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Torpor isn't a nice item.  It's a spell that changes the life of the Shaman who mems it.  Most of us think of guilds as, &quot;primarily a group of friends wo like adventuring togather and helping each other out.&quot;  Selling the spell in the bazaar isn't the act of a friend.  Selling the item to you &quot;for a reduced rate,&quot; isn't that nice either, but it beats the hell out of the other option.  <br />
<br />
The only thing worse than something that you want but can't have, is when it's THIS CLOSE and a &quot;friend&quot; snatches it away from you, to sell it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have yet to see a single shaman spell. I have not looted a single good 60 spell that I could sell for 10k or more. Its an awfull camp with horrible return. But in this day and age in EQ its all I have.  <br />
<br />
I'm in same boat (5 gwurms only so far though) but I refuse to spend hours camping for something unless I have fun in the process (I play to have fun and do not raid).  So, I basically check tracking in the SF zone occasionally and if one is up, go beat it down.  I also refuse to drop the 50k+ the spell gougers are asking for something that is class defining and not resellable- this is a game design flaw that SOE needs to fix and I choose not to subsidize this behavior.  I'd be happy if I could turn in the worthless ethereal parchments rotting in my bank for a chance at L59/60 spells from an expansion 3 or 4 years old- after all, L61/62 spells should be more powerful than L59/60 spells right? :P<br />
<br />
For those that care, 60 shaman (JBB/horse, no epic, no malo, no torpor, absolute garbage for gear in most slots) and 54 sk have no probs killing gwurms.  I just hate getting 9pp and wurm meat for a mob that's hitting for 500+ X 2 and that summons w/ a 100ish fire AE.<br />

i saw that spell 50K few days ago (rathe server),<br />
but IMO it s not worth that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>shamy60</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">**izmalis** you could hunt in plane of growth whit your SK,and in maybe less than a month you would have enough cash to buy torpor,imo.<br />
<br />
even whit the all zone agro POG mob, it s still worth it to hunt there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>bluntgone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">seriously, if you can get into pov (upcoming patch should fix that) forget buying torpor. i myself paid 50k for torpor and bought malos and q 3 weeks later for 25k and 34k. if you expect to hit 65 any time soon just wait. rune spells on my server are low, q sells for less than torpor, and they're just getting lower. i regret buying torpor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sadly I spent 2.5 hours in PoG recently w/ a group of guildies hoping to get armor drops for myself and the SK.  We fought at west wall near zone in and chain pulled everything, including the named horses.  Not a single piece of armor dropped.  I think we netted a little over 2k in that time, which isn't even as good of plat as you make in LoY these days in that amount of time (Hail, Dulak!).  I used to love PoG, now it's pretty much the empty, useless zone they always wanted it to be apparently.<br />
<br />
I also refuse to drop 50k+ on spells from an expansion nearly 4 years ago- there have been enough changes to the game that I fail to see why shamans out of all classes get gouged the most on this issue.  Not having an epic or awesome ND gear due to not raiding I can live with, not having the very spells that my class is balanced around is utter bs.  And don't bring up the cruel joke that is spell research. :(<br />
<br />
