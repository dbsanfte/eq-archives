<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Things I would have liked to see in the expansion:<br />
<br />
<br />
1.  Tintable armor/robes- Hey, you questsed/killed for it, right?  Pick a color the first time you equip it.<br />
<br />
2. Varied graphics for weapons- It just sucks that to get decent stats on a weapon, you have to accept the model VI gives you.<br />
      <br />
      Dwarves are supposed to carry large axes.<br />
      <br />
      Every barbarian warrior should have th option of a hammer.<br />
      <br />
      Trollie weapons should have a minimum of three nasty barbed<br />
      hooks on them.<br />
<br />
      Dark elves ought to be able to choose some sort of light (as   <br />
      in small) saber grapic.<br />
<br />
<br />
And, no, I wouldn't want to administrate/provide database storage for any of this.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More customization of any sort would be a plus.  <br />
That's the one thing I miss about UO..we actually had a mall to shop at!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Quinnell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">One of my favorite things in Gemstone3 were the dye merchants and merchant caravans that would randomly show up -- allowing players to customize gear they owned and buy some interesting things that would just be new to everyone.  I imagine the way EQ does it's database, simply colorizing things would even be too complicated.<br />
<br />
That's truly something that is missing from EQ that would be awesome -- hope they figure it out someday.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, anyone else spend any time in Elanthia?  I'm curious because the other day I got an itch to go back and see how Simultronics was doing with Weihmar's Landing and how they'd developed the world.<br />
<br />
It's VERY different than I remember it.  My restored character (how'd they find him??) got gersmacked someplace that he used to hunt regularly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well DAoC you can customize not only your character but also your gear...you can dye each piece of armor as you wish...shields and cloaks.<br />
<br />
Some nice things...Guilds can get an Emblem which can be placed on shields or cloacks...:D I would love to see this in EQ...How great would it be to see the KoE Emblem on the cloaks of all our members..:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We have to have cloaks first, Barain.    :D</div></div><hr />
