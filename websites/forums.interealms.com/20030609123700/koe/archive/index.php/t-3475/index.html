<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this is the official announcement of my intent to take over the GEB camp in Solusek B.  I want to do this early early next Saturday, for a few reasons.  First, I've noticed that these camps around here are usually camped later in the day.  If this camp is already camped, we can choose to go to another for exp or such, it depends on what the group wants to do.  Second, if suddenly a lot more people (centered around KoE) start cycling through this camp, we want to hold it as long as possible through the day, not through night.<br />
So far I think this will definitely work.  2 enchanters are interested for the break of the camp (Moebeus and xacnar) and xacnar will stay for the whole camp.  Yes Xacnar, I am humbled to have an excellent enchantress.  Plus Mei as the cleric, and me and tank/nuker, and I hope one or two more people would come, this would make a great group for the camp.  Then, as the GEBs start dropping (hopefully) we can kind of cycle through people so that KoE holds the camp for anyone who wants GEBs.  I myself will probably stay for a while, after a few GEBs drops.  I hope that people who want the GEBs will state their interest and watch out for us on Saturday for when people cycle through.<br />
:D :D :D :D :D :D :D :D <br />
<br />
New:<br />
As for loot rules, this is NOT a Koe led event.  It was an attempt to gather members and others at a place to party and kill.  However, it seems as though non-members aren't allowed to lead events, only sign up for them, therefore this will be the last even led from me.<br />
Because this is not a KoE led event, I cannot enforce KoE loot rules.  Here is how I think I will run it.<br />
Need does come first.  I think that it is only fair to give a caster these boots who would immediately use them than to give them to a tank to sell for a few k and leave the caster shoeless. (erm.. so far my pet is the take I think.  I don't think he'll be needing those :P )<br />
First come first serve.  If you are there from the beginning, meaning you were there the longest, then you have a higher chance of getting the boots as others will not be placed in priority who have not been there as long.<br />
If there are severally needy casters that came at the same time, most likely we will revert to rolling.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
My ISP has seemed to go down on me.  totally.  Maybe it's because I don't pay the bill, but I don't know :P<br />
I'm really sorry but I won't be able to get on for my event.  Right now I am using another computer with a stinky dial-up.  My cable modem computer is the only one with Eq, and the stupid cable modem service has gone out.  I'm really sorry about this, and sorry about cluttering up the message board with non-KoE events in the first place.<br />
This is also why I was not there for the Vindicator take down, sorry :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you need a tank I'll help ya.  I usually play saturday's so I could be there for pretty much the entire camp.  I personally don't need the boots for my main so I'd just be there to group with you all and for the XP. If a pair came available that no one could use I could take them for a cleric Zyhri and I will be working on shortly, but other than that my pally already has good boots. I'm thinking you'll want to keep this KoE first, but if you need help I'll be there :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nemar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh yeah, I am definately interested in the GEBs.  I will try to be on as early as I can that day.  Possibly 10am EST.  I'd be psyched to get a pair of these!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Too early for me.  I'm west coast and I really don't like setting an alarm on Sat just to play EQ.  I won't be available until at least 10am PST.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seraphima Angelique</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I'm on and you need a cleric for this lemme know. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well Moe seeing as Yadilu did not want you on the first post, it may be that she does not need you again. :)<br />
<br />
****************<br />
<br />
Here's the deal. <br />
I appreciate your offer Moebeus, I think your contributions would be key to the success of the break, especially if it's only 3 or 4 people who want to camp him. But, I think we really need an enchanter who wants to camp him with us to stay, because the only challenge in that camp is crowd control. If we had no means to apply it, I don't think it would be very successful. <br />
Therefore, I don't think we should even try without an enchanter who will stay (not to harp on you moebeus, I realize you already have the boots). So far only me and Mei are interested in camping the Lord for some GEBs. Anyone else? <br />
<br />
********************<br />
<br />
Let me explain something to our recruits. Yadilu is not a member of KoE. You will know if we are because it will say so under our name. So if you are hoping to get into this camp and group with KoE, so far no KoE has signed up and the one who did, a lvl 60 Enchanter, has been turned down. So Mekil this is not a KoE raid and will not follow KoE loot rules.<br />
<br />
It is one thing to come here asking for KoE assistance, but Yadilu is posting almost as if she is making a KoE group and this is not the case. So I want to be clear. This section is for KoE raids to the public. It is also for other guilds to post who wish to include KoE in it or ask for our help. All of this should be made clear in the post.<br />
<br />
As to Yadilu: The difficult part of this is not the camp. It is breaking into the camp. An enchanter of Moe's capabilities would have ensured your success. Turning down any help like this is simply not wise. But have it your way. I also suggest you make it clear that you want KoE help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">As there was no actual date or time posted on the first posting. I said that when I found out that info I would let you know if I could be there. <br />
<br />
With that said I will do my best to be there at this time. But unfortunately I can not guarantee it right now with my daughters schedule as it is.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this changes your plans any. I will really do my best to get there as soon as I can though.</div></div><hr />

The break-in is the fun part.  After that the key is staying awake - this camp is THAT boring.  No need for an enchanter if you are going to just stay in the Freeti room after the break-in, since, once you break the room and spread the spawns the rest is kill, rinse repeat as the re-pops occur.<br />
<br />
On other word for those new to this camp.  Yadilu speaks as if, once you get the camp, GEBs just rain down from on high.  Not so.  The Freeti has PHs and doesn't always drop the boots.  In a full 8 hour day you'll be lucky to see 2-4 pairs of boots.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">BEMIDIAN!!   T_T<br />
You TOTALLY interpreted me wrong!!  I did not mean to turn him down at ALL!!  I noticed the lack of KoE posters, and I was kind of dissapointed.  I kind of wanted to just say that I will be camping this guy (if not with koe, with a few RL friends) and KoE people are welcome to come and help if they need the boots.<br />
As for Moe, ALL I was trying to say is that he would ensure the success of the break, but he offered to break, and I accepted that more then anything.  But he already has the boots, so he will not be staying with us for the time it takes to get them when he has them already.  THEREFORE, I was asking if any enchanter wanted the boots and was thereforer entitled to stay and help.  I don't think the camp (unless with more people then I saw signing up) can succeed holding the camp without an enchanter.  That's why I was worried that when Moe left, after many spawns we would become overwhelmed.  I severely apologize for the image I created and I sincerely hope you do not think of it this way at ALL.  You almost made me cry Bem when I read your post because I never want to seem like that :(<br />
And Amarin- sorry, I tried to say &quot;if they do&quot; whenever I mentioned a GEB drop.  My goodness, I'm so sorry that post had so many fallacies... T_T <br />
I try to be perfect, but it always leads to the ultimate downfall...<br />
sigh.. so much for a sponsor coming forward for me now... :P<br />
<br />
Moe- I WAS NOT turning you down.  after reading my post, maybe it did sound like it.  I appreciate your offer MORE than I could ever express it!!  I guess I just assumed that because you have the boots you weren't intending to stay for the camp, so I was a little worried about crowd control. But I guess it depends on how many people we have there.  I am SO sorry and for some reason I have a feeling that you will always look at me differently now.  I'm sorry that its too early :(  If we have no force to break it up we might just have to postpone it anyway.  I can't express my sorrow for a post that should have never been stated as it was.<br />
<br />
One more thing.  Bem, I realize that I am not KoE ( :| ).  This is actually one of the main reasons why I try to plan and post for things under the events section.  I just want to play and group with others, and they could benefit from the camp too.  I would give them the boots in a snap rather than I.  But whenever I am in game, I rarely end up doing something with KoE members whenever I ask in tells, or as someone to ask in /gui if they needed my assistance.  If I see a keeper in the zone, sometimes I'll end up doing something with them (Asied actually ended up helping me the other day, thanks soo much), but rarely can I find a good full keepers group to do stuff with.  So I kind of use events as a way to try and do more stuff with you all.  I guess it kind of backfired... sorry about that, maybe I should shut my mouth a little sooner and think before I speak..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This sounds great.  Id love to come and help out, havent been on a genuine camp in a long time. I'll do it, if not for the boots for the experience, since I've barely been in that zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Moebeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">No real offense taken.  I don't have GEBS but I also have no need for them for my main or any current alt.  I just offered my assistance to break the camp since that is the tough part.  Once broken a single group can hold the camp without much difficulty even without an enchanter from what I've been told.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Amarin Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/agree Crazy Moe.<br />
<br />
Actually, with the right levels the camp can be broken with a single group without an enchanter.  I did an efreeti run with other KoE several months ago in which we broke the camp with 2 pallies, 2 shamans and 2 druids.  No clerics, no enchanters, all under level 55.  Creative use of root parking did the trick, LOL.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They're in good hands with me.<br />
<br />
Everybody seems to forget that they do have an enchanter, albeit one without a pair of boots.  I forgot to mention that I will be rolling or accepting boots if they are given out, not sure how it's gonna run without KoE loot rules in effect, but I am hoping to come away with a pair.<br />
<br />
I'm an enchanter, and a darn good one at that.<br />
<br />
Oh, and Bem, was there really a need to be so hostile?  We wouldn't be posting here if we didn't know at least some of the guild members, and I haven't seen any flame yet, so if someone wants to do an event with KoE and their friends, why not post here, not that I'm even in KoE for that matter, so feel free to put me in my place, but just something I was wondering.<br />
<br />
I thought I was enough to break camp, but I'm only level 51, so maybe we may as well be without a chanter, don't know, never done Djorn camp before.  I do know that I'm darn good, though.<br />

Just a few thoughts from your local neighborhood chantress.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yes, it really just depends on who shows up.  It seems that so far we are getting a pretty good group, so with some skill we'll probably still try.  If you are on Sera I'll give ya a tell, thanks for offering assistance for some time!  It's not obligatory either though, if you suddenly go on a raid or something then, don't worry about it.  I understand Mei, sorry you might not make it.  Glad to have two clerics with the possibility though.  Fedora- I trust your judgement, darn good cleric :)  51 is perfect.  Level 60 just means a little more experience and maybe longer lasting spells.  I'm positive that we can do well with everyone including you though.  I didn't mean to exclude you, just trying to make up for my mis-information about Moe that Bem pointed out..  <br />
I really did take Bem's post to heart, and it was kind of agonizing.  I'm the kind of person who almost becomes depressed when, because of my actions, someone else is impaired.<br />
But yeah, I didn't mean to sound like I was a KoE member, I was inviting everyone here to share the chance when it is rare to get in a GEB group.  Ususally you have to plan one like this.<br />
<br />
Sorry to keep going on about that. :)  I'm also the type of person who tries to make many rights make up for a wrong, therefore explicating many many times and I tend to ramble.. bah must stop writing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hostile? I wasn't trying to be that, but was certainly trying to be abrupt. We have many KoE recruits that come to our events page looking to find events to group with KoE members in their pursuit of membership. They expect to see events posted by KoE members that are open to non_KoE. From their comments in this thread and the previous thread it appeared they believed that this was a KoE sponsored raid. I wanted to ensure they knew it was not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nekky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree Bem</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I am extremely sorry.  I have posted raids before that I hoped to lead to do something with other KoE members and no one said anything about it.  I don't ever remember reading something that only members were allowed to post here...  I'm really sorry, I can't help it, I am an active person.  Thank you for setting me in my place.  After this I intend never to post a new thread under the events again, unless for some  reason my faction with KoE hasn't been too tainted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well spoken, Bem, as always.<br />
<br />
I might be available for this - my 45 mage needs gebs pretty bad, I've just been lazy about getting him equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>xacnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Since this forum can be a very good place for KoE and KoE hopeful raids to begin, if you were to change the forum guidelines to where if you are not a KoE member yet, you should declare that somewhere in the subject of the beginning post.  Here's an example:<br />
<br />
Vox - 9/21/01 - 8:00pm NonKoE<br />
<br />
That way, petitioners with ideas could voice them and maybe organize a raid, hoping for KoE members to attend.  I think that it would be a good way to critique recruits, as their organizational skills for a raid may be of interest to a guild.<br />
<br />
I'm not KoE, though, so I should probably clam up.  I'm just trying to help.<br />
<br />
And, Bem, you had some good points; you just scared me with your first post.  You sounded mean, but then, I can be hypersensitive sometimes.  I've grouped with you ingame, and I remembered you being a nice guy, and by the sound of this more recent post, I was right.<br />

ACK!  clamming up now...<br />
