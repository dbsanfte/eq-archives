<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">STA affects Hitpoints. But to me it seems it depends also on Level, Class AND the total number of Stamina how many HP you get out of it.<br />
Does anyone have a Link or can write down in what way STA affects hitpoints ?<br />
<br />
Why do i ask? When you Level up you get an amount of Hitpoints, which depends on your basic Stamina (without buffs or items). So my thought is...if i put 5 AA on STA on Lv 51 it raises my base Stamina, thus each time i level up after 51 i get more HP, then i would have gotten without the extra stamina from AA. That could make some nice more HP per levelup from 51 to 65.<br />
<br />
Please enlighten me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It depends on your level.  it does not matter how much stamina you have at a certain level.  Basically once you get 65, you will be getting 3 hps per stamina point.  Also, when you get ND1- 3 that factors in a little bit on it too.  I'm not sure of the exact values and to what level you start getting a stamina point bonus.<br />
<br />
Basically, you it does not matter if you put 5 points into stamina right now, once you hit 65, that will equal 15 more hps to you.  Not more hps each time you level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Stamina does not effect how many new hitpoints you get per level - that is constant.  All shamans of the same level will have the same base hitpoints, modified by stamina.  For example, at level 65 with ND3 I have 1435 hp naked (barb with base 105 stamina).  1000 of that might be base HP, and the other 435 I get from my 105 stamina.  An ogre shaman would have a little more hp than me, because he has higher naked stamina.  He might get 1000 from his base hp, and then 550 from his 140ish stamina.  However, if we both had 305 stamina (the cap) and the same raw +hp gear, we'd have the same hitpoints since all races get the same benefit per sta.<br />
<br />
As for how much HP each point of stamina yields, it varies by level.  At level 60, shamans get exactly 3hp per 1 point of stamina.  All int and wis casters also get 3.  All melees get 5, except for warriors, who get 6.<br />
<br />
The formulas are as follow:<br />
<br />
Priests and Casters:  Level/20 (3.25 at 65)<br />
Melees:  Level/12 (5.416 at 65)<br />
Warriors:  Level/10 (6.5 at 65)<br />
<br />
I have natural durability 3, which adds 10% to the yield of any sta bonus I get.  This leaves me with a 3.575hp per sta yield.<br />
<br />
Buffing myself with primal essence (20 sta) takes me from 201sta to 221sta, and takes me from 3223hp to 3295, a 72 hp bonus, or 3.6 per sta.  I then took off some of my gear and left my stamina at 175.  Giving myself 20sta gave me 71hp, or 3.55 per sta.<br />
<br />
Past 255, stamina returns start to dwindle.  Buffing myself from 261 to 281 stamina gives me only 36hp, or 1.8 per stamina.  Basically, half of what it should be giving me.<br />
<br />
Hope that helped.<br />
<br />
edit:  I would recommend against putting AA points in to stamina.  It has very limited returns after 255, and it is not difficult to hit that number with self-buffs.  Once you have gear that caps your stamina, those points you put in to stamina AA are wasted.  Spend them on run3 and regen3, which are never obsolete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well I think that explains it pretty well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks guys =) helped a lot <br />
gonna stick with rs3 and regen 3. When i created my shammy (barb) i put all into STA since barbs have fairly high WIS compared to ogres / trolls. Right now im at 170 WIS without KEI since i put much efford into HP / STA gear. i think ill raise WIS then with some AA i dont mind getting AA exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think a broader point Janheim was making, and that I agree with entirely, was:<br />
<br />
Don't put AAs into stats until you've got everything else you need.  Eventually you're more than likely going to be maxed out on stats with buffs.<br />
<br />
Those AA points you spent on WIS could better be spent on SCM, or something similar to make a more efficient use of your mana.  Do run3 and regen3 then move onto Archetype AAs.<br />
<br />
AA points into stats until you've got all the others you need are a waste, at least in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just being none helpful but enlightening.  Barbs have only 3 more starting wisdom points than ogres.  Just trolls have lower wisdom by around 13-15 points, when compared to a barb.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sta (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=407&amp;highlight=stamina) <br />
<br />
The above link to The Steel Warrior (http://steelwarrior.xwarzone.com/index.php?s=)  message board contains the formula that Magelo uses to compute hp's for warriors.  The only change for shaman(I would assume from appearences) would be in the levelmultiplier variable.  The formula is as follows:<br />
<br />
HP = TRUNC[ 5 x ND ] + TRUNC [ Lvl x LM x ND ] + TRUNC [ TRUNC [ ( STA - TRUNC [(STA-255)/2] ) x Lvl x LM / 300 ] x ND ] <br />
<br />
the TRUNC[(STA-255)/2] value being =0 if sta &lt;255 (that part just mean in fact any STA point after 255 give only half benefits).<br />
<br />
with ND multiplier due to AAs (=1 without hp-giving AAs) and LM based on class and level :<br />
<br />
Warrior: <br />
Level 1-19: Levelmultiplier = 22 <br />
Level 20-29: Levelmultiplier = 23 <br />
Level 30-39: Levelmultiplier = 25 <br />
Level 40-52: Levelmultiplier = 27 <br />
Level 53-56: Levelmultiplier = 28 <br />
Level 57-59: Levelmultiplier = 29 <br />
Level 60-65: Levelmultiplier = 30<br />
<br />
<br />
I would assume you can get the complete info, including the levelmultiplier for shaman from Magelo.  I would check it for you, but Magelo does not like my comp/browser for some reason.  Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't know about rogues and hybrids, but that's wrong, since monks get 4hps per 1 point of sta at 60.</div></div><hr />
