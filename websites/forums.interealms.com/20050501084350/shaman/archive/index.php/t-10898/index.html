<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorgryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Wonder if it is going to finally make its appearance in the upcoming LoY expansion... since they haven't put it in yet, that would be a good time to slip it in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Given that they will be announcing 'New Spells' on Feb 21, it is fairly likely to be the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm sure it will be, otherwise they probably would have taken it off of the live spell list by now. <br />
<br />
I'll go ahead and predict that the spell will either be a quest that can only be done if you buy the new expansion or, like the low lvl PoP spells, no drop. Can't have people not buying the expansion, after all. <br />
<br />
Me cynical? Nah!  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I predict: storebought nodrop spell.  The intent is for every shaman to rush out and buy the expansion en masse.<br />
<br />
And it'll work on me, still can't get a copy of Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd like to see a lower level version of the malo/malos line: unresistable. Doubt it will happen but you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd like to see a lower level version of the malo/malos line: unresistable. Doubt it will happen but you never know.<br />
<br />
wouldn't this be a bit pointless? If they did do it it would most likely be -20 tops from all resists which wouldn't really have much effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">weissblau:  &quot;I predict: storebought nodrop spell. The intent is for every shaman to rush out and buy the expansion en masse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh, that would piss me off so much.  :(<br />
<br />
BTW:  Quick AA question- what's the AA that extends Torpor?  I'm wondering if it might be worth it to grab that one for Stoicism before I get 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think it'd be a useful tool telosk. Everyone knows how difficult it can be to obtain Malo. An unresistable lower lvl version that had some effect would definately have been valuable to me a few years ago before I was 60 and got malo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'd prefer an AE version of Malo that maybe debuffs less (-30 at least). Or even an AE Malosinia version that does -50, but resistable.</div></div><hr />
