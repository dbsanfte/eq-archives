------------------------------ <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
** Spells ** <br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
** Items ** <br />
<br />
- Added 'focus' effects to over 150 existing items <br />
- Mischievous Chainmail armor is now Dwarf wearable (for those lil Bristlbane worshipin' dorf rogues) <br />
- Changed several of the new cultural chain skirts from Leg slot to Waist slot <br />
- Keys for Veeshan's Peak, Sleeper's Tomb, Vex Thal are now no-drop on the Firiona Vie server <br />
- The key to the Plane of Air should now disappear when the character leaves the plane <br />
- Fixed Sifaye, Owlbear Feather, Grimling fang and Rockhopper talon darts to use the Throwing skill rather than the Archery skill <br />

- Smithed Acrylia Chain and Plate armors are now magical <br />
<br />
<br />
** NPCs ** <br />
<br />
- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their spells a little more carefully. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Quests ** <br />
<br />
- Arbogast and Miller should be responding properly now <br />

- Enchanted HQ Ore can now be worked into rings, jointing, sheets, bricks, and blocks in a standard forge <br />
<br />
<br />
** Pet Changes ** <br />
<br />
With this patch we've made some rather sweeping changes to the way pets work. <br />
<br />
- Pets will not attack mesmerized creatures. Pets basically treat mesmerized NPCs as if they were dead <br />
- Pets are neutral to NPCs. Monsters will not attack pets first unless the pet is being aggressive to something <br />
- Pets take 75% of the experience from a creature if no player does damage to that creature <br />
- Pets take ZERO experience from a creature unless no player does damage to that creature <br />
- The exception to the above rule is Dire Charmed pets, which will take a share of the experience scaled by the amount of damage they do. In most situations (with an active party, for example) the Dire Charmed pet will not take experience. Like all pets, they will take 75% of the experience if no PC does damage to the target. As long as a player does damage to a creature, a Dire Charmed pet will never take more experience than it used to. <br />
<br />
- Charmed NPCs will now respond to the /pet report health command <br />
- /pet sit down command should now work on charmed NPCs <br />
- Fixed a bug that was preventing reclaim energy from working on Magician Epic pets. <br />
<br />
<br />
** Miscellaneous ** <br />
<br />
- Fixed a bug that was causing a person that logs out with &quot;damage shields: OFF&quot; to be unable to see damage shield even when they turned them back on <br />
- Fixed a problem that was causing crashes when /following someone on a horse if they went out of range <br />
- Fixed a bug that prevented targeting an invisible NPC from horseback, even with See Invisible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very sucky about the Plane of Sky. Thought that place would finally be doable. ;(   Got 4 keys in the bank too.<br />
<br />
On another note; They did come out and say that the 150 focus items going in this time are for low &amp; mid levels mostly.  They'll be adding high level focus items to high level and end game encounters in the future.  Probably after they see how these effect the game and re-tune the high end encounters for the use of the Focus items in them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the casting time on pumice stones are gonna get a few negative feedbacks =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wow, insta-click dispells nerfed.<br />
<br />
Gonna make PvP interesting, no more getting rid of buffs if a person has plenty of clicky items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;Rich Waters sent us in a clarification to our earlier guess work regarding what focus items will be in today's patch.<br />
Here's what he had to say: <br />
<br />
Level I, II, and III focus items are all going in this patch. There will be new focus effects added for future items to use after we see how these work out. <br />
This means items will be going in today for all levels of players. &quot;<br />

From EQCasters</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">heh, added a cast time to golem metal wands and egg shaped pumice..  not enough that they no longer drop in the game?    <br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought pumice was buyable in Freeport.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their spells a little more carefully. &quot;<br />
<br />
Bah and i loved wizs that chain cast force shock on me.<br />
<br />
&quot;- The Shadowbond series of spells can no longer be dispelled by the Necromancer&quot;<br />
<br />
Amazed that didnt get nerfed ages ago as it was obviously wrong. <br />
<br />
Glad im not on a PvP server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Damn, the Plane of Air keys was a bug? I thought they changed that on purpose. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Some friends of mine spent all day yesterday getting PoA keys for a raid this Sunday. I have a feeling they'll be a tad bit annoyed when they log in :(<br />
<br />
I don't know about that caster thing. I liked when things repeatedly tried to fear me instead of doing something nasty like dotting ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Overall dis is a very nice patch :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hope Harness of Spirit and the Rage line will stack again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Does this mean mobs will finally stop trying to turgor me?<br />
<br />
&quot;<br />
- NPC casters should be a little bit smarter now. They will choose their spells a little more carefully. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Expect a patch to the patch. (What a shock I know)<br />
<br />
I logged on my Enchanter. First, the cursor is now a teeny triangle.  My AC 6 + 65 rings? Gone.  My Ornate Runed Shield now has the inventory graphic of a head.  My Tradeskill trophy? A sword.<br />
<br />
Caught a fish in Cobalt Scar. The icon? A rune.<br />
<br />
I was not alone in experiencing &quot;The Vision&quot;  But hey, as long as we pay our $12.95 a month VI has no incentive to test patches. (A definite DAoC &gt; VI thing which I hope WoW also uses)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Other than pet changes, there's really nothing special about this patch.  Least, to me, personally.  Guess I'd feel differently if I were a smith.<br />
<br />
The NPC changes do concern me tho.<br />
<br />
Ah well, we shall see once servers are back up :)</div></div><hr />
