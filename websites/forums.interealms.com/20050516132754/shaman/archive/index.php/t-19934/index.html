<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">You know, like Gore or Sont or any of the kunark dragons. or the reavers in CoM or even RD in HoH.  Anything out there working with a -40 mod on this thing?<br />
<br />
Im thinking tash stick+malos+ Nihil.</div></div><hr />

Since when. I have slowed one before :)</div></div><hr />

neh'ashir, ghiosk, rak would be good wannabe non-flagged-immune reavers to try-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah, I'm a schmuck.  I was thinking you were talking about the reavers before they die and spawn the spirits, not the spirits (ghiosk, rak, and the like).  just chalk it up to me being a troll =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hail,Yeah, I'm a schmuck.

You aren't a schmuck.  I believe Litgruv was talking about the (flagged immune) black reavers.  There was a patch that made them slowable for a brief period of time, then they were changed back to being immune (their current status).  I've slowed them too during this time, &amp; was shocked when it landed (beneficial mistarget is the only reason it happened the first time).<br />
<br />
Jade reavers went way down in price during the time Black reavers were slowable (on my server at least), as pretty much any duo of slower+melee could clear them all w/o any danger. :D <br />
<br />
I would add Klandicar and Zlandicar to the list of mobs to try slowing with Balance.  They are obviously slowable, but very tough to land Turgur's w/o extreme debuffing (OoS, Tash, Malos(inia) ).<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would add Klandicar <br />
<br />
Have slowed Kland several times with just Malos / tash.  Never had a terribly hard time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I want to see Tunare, Vyemm, Velk, and PoEB minis up here, that would hold promise :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Try Gauker Sandstorm in BoT.<br />
<br />
That sucker is tough to slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Sont isn't hard to slow, he just dispells himself a lot so it wont stay on him.  PoEb minis would be a good one to try though.  Have yet to have turgurs stick.  What about Mith Marr.  I've heard he is slowable w/ turgurs, just extremely hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've landed Turgur's on Birak once.  I've never slowed Galronar with either slow.  I usually slow Birak and Awisano easily with Grummus.<br />
<br />
A beastlord on a raid of ours slowed MM once.  I couldn't land Turgur's though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">MMarr is def. magic slowable, it just takes forever.  Worst part is getting Malosinia to stick, getting the actual slow to stick isn't all that bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've slowed klandi a lot with just malos/ini/tash<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure zlandi slows pretty easily.  Also gotten magic slow on mith marr before.  I also magic slowed 2 of the 3 poeb minis last time we were there (granted they were below 60% by the time it stuck) though I can't remember which ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>robxiii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sont dispelling himself won't dispell slow, but it will clear out Malos I suppose QQ</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sont's self-dispel removes disease counters as well.  Best bet is to junk debuff with decay before you slow; his dispel will then remove decay and leave turgurs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sont isn't hard to slow, he just dispells himself a lot so it wont stay on him.

<br />
Sorry i meant Sev.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know who might be fun to try now ?  Wushi ( sp?)  I tried him along time ago and i think i could have got him if i could have slowed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
I've slowed klandi a lot with just malos/ini/tash...<br />
Right, which is not what I was saying.<br />
<br />
I was talking about slowing them w/o any outside debuffing.  Adding Tash, oos, Malosinia will obviously make it much easier.  I'd be interested to see if we could land Balance for possible solo kills.  Both Klandi/Zlandi are easily single groupable w/ traditional debuffing.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
