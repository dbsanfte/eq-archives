<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK it wasn't offensive, <br />
It was well within the size restrictions.<br />
It was my sig for at least 4 months on the crucible.  <br />
WHAT in GOD'S name made you nerf it THIS time?  <br />
<br />
I'm really upset this time and am considering not making any more contributions to this forum.  I feel like I'm being picked on in particular and I don't like it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I have noticed alot of removed sigs lately, but, maybe he had never really noticed it before and when he saw it was you in gnome form thought it was using the exploit that people had been doing?  Cause, I could see him blocking exploits, if that is why he killed it, even though you had that pic long before the exploit was around.</div></div><hr />

Sorry Land, I dunno why yours was removed.  I can't imagine Sunmoon picking on you because of a gnome picture.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Guys, you may have read the wrong requirements or something, but if your sig was just removed and it's been here 4 months, then you got lucky and I didn't see it.<br />
<br />
The sig limit is no more than 250 pixels wide, 100 pixels high and 25K in size. It can be wider if it is tasteful and doesn't exceed 25K. I'm going to be removing a lot of sigs in this thread for that very reason.<br />
<br />
Once I launch the new version of the boards (it's in beta now) it will automatically restrict sigs so I don't have to manually do it. I think the sig limits I allow are more than fair to show your stuff without cluttering the board.<br />
<br />
I hope you can agree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Last thing I'd like to have is cluttered board due to signatures :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think there are 2 problems.  One is that the rules for sigs are unclear.  For example, until this post I had no idea the limit was 100 heigth.  Secondly, the help faq is difficult to find.  Not the one linked about, but the one that has info on creating a sig img link in your profile.  Often ive had a sig removed due to size, but not recieved any info on what exactly was wrong with this size other than it was to big.  Then had to try and find the help file to figure out how to do it all over again.  That on top of unanswered pm's can be frustrating at times.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It's been there since the boards were re-built back in March?<br />
<br />
That post has been there since march.<br />
<br />
[Edit - But I do agree that you should be pointed to that post when your sig is nuked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>thyyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most of the signatures are at best a waste of bandwidth anyway...<br />
10K would be more than I want to download...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The problem with removing signatures is I have to remove so many. It really sucks having to type in all that information. Again, once I upgrade the boards soon, this will be automated, so it will be easier and more informative.</div></div><hr />

your sig is to big Gloriana <br />
&quot;It can be wider if it is tasteful and doesn't exceed 25K. &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Gloriana's sig is an example of one that is wider, still under 25K and looks nice. There is no need to remove it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">BTW<br />
<br />
I was joking in case you missed it.<br />
<br />
I know for a fact that Gloriana's sig is fine cause it was made with Sun's size requirements.  There is a thread somewhere on the board where she talksa bout it and plugs the guy who made it for her.  I still gotta see if he will make one for me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I like Gloriana's sig..  <br />
<br />
But who decides if it's &quot;tasteful&quot;? <br />
<br />
Must have to read someone's mind, when determining if your sig will be considered &quot;tasteful&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Standardizing the sig rules would be a better idea unless you are willing to tell us what you consider to be tasteful.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cp..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Bjarni Bludfrost</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">/em casts &quot;resist fire&quot;.<br />
<br />
yeah, i want to spend my bandwidth downloading a 800x600, 200k sig of some lev. 10 shaman alt. character who posts 6 times in a single thread...  think about it before you do it...<br />
<br />
art work and all things considered being cool, but a big sig is like shouting or my reference to big/expensive cars and penises.<br />
<br />
bjarni<br />
<br />
*your fire resistance fades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I'm guessing that Sunmoon decides what is &quot;tasteful&quot;, given that it's his board and he can do what he wants with it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Angryor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">&quot;I'm guessing that Sunmoon decides what is &quot;tasteful&quot;, given that it's his board and he can do what he wants with it &quot;<br />
<br />
Understood, let me be a little more clear.<br />
<br />
If I am making a sig file and it might be a bit bigger than the size limits, how do I know that Sunmoon will find it &quot;tasteful&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Angryor:<br />
<br />
Dont make it more than 100pix tall, or 25k in size.  Those are the 'hard' caps.<br />
<br />
Probably anything that flashes, involves fluorescent colors, or otherwise resembles clothing from the 1980s would NOT be 'tasteful'.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">What's wrong with my leather tie?!?!?!!?<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: oh and is it one or the other or both?  Meaning: can it be over 100pix tall if it is under the size limit?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I really really really thought my sig was the right size.  If it wasn't the right height, it was only off by perhaps 2 or 3 pixels, which I honestly can't tell.  As for how big it was?  Under 10k.  <br />
So honestly I was shocked it was nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>bobdz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">i hope my sig is tastefull :\</div></div><hr />
