<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy all!<br />
<br />
I've spent the last couple of times I've been on down in Veksar trying to solo the highborns.  I want a pair of those gauntlets!  I can successfully solo the regular Highborns, but its a 8-10 minute fight.<br />
<br />
All damage comes from my pet (alpha'd and hasted) and epic DoT.  My tactics so far is to pull with Malo, then Slow on inc.  Cripple as soon as the slow lands.  It's then a constant juggle of epic dot, canni, and torpor.<br />
<br />
I've tried adding in JBB or Ice Strike, but I often have to duck out to cast torpor on myself or pet.  I'm usually between 40 &amp; 50% mana when the fight is over.<br />
<br />
I tried a Highborn Commander (lvl 63), and got him to 60% before he got in a really good round of attacks and dropped me from 75% to about 30% in one round.  That was all she wrote after that.<br />
<br />
Self-buffed, I can get to over 2700 HP, and 1020ish AC.  Maybe I need to get myself raid-buffed, and have a boat-load of mage goodies.<br />
<br />
Is there a better way to solo these guys?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did it pretty much the way you did, and that Highborn Commander is PITA to kill.   I would recommend getting at least Anathema and try it again.   If you level to 64 and get both Bane and Anathema they should be cake to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Level 65, about 3500hps self buffed, I use Malos / Slow / Cripple / Epic / Velium Strike. Takes about 5 mins or so. Not really worth solo'ing though. Make friends with one of the numerous necros who like to solo here, (or a slay undead 3 pally) and go to town on em. I haven't bothered getting the LDON dots yet, but that would certainly help as well if you are dead set on soloing. Virtue, BSS, KEI make things a little faster. So does a ceramic rod of storms (ups Velium Strike damage) but I don't use one much anymore due to stat loss.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get Bane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rakji</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get Bane.<br />
<br />
I agree 100%, it makes such a difference soloing in Veksar and places like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Howdy Korman!  If you want a partner for either EC ldon (to get bane) or for this camp, lemme know and I'll come with ya.  I still need bane and a pair of those gloves too.  My solution to the problem of not having enough DPS for this camp is to bring my boxed druid.  It's about all I can do, since I still haven't gotten around to finishing the epic.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the offer!  I haven't been on as much recently, RL's been quite busy.  Both of us and a boxed druid would be a pretty good setup.  I'll holler at you the next time I see you on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">God, get a partner. Shamans suck on killing those, add in ANY one other class and you will kill em 3X faster. Even if your partner wants to roll on them, you'll get a pair faster. I have never understood shaman's fascination with inefficiently and slowly soloing everything that a good duo/group does 10x better :P</div></div><hr />
