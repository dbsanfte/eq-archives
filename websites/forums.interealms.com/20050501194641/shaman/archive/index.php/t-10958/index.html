<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My broom of trilon is nerfed. Seriously, was reclaim energy that powerful VI? Really?<br />
<br />
Sheez, I've had that thing for years. Literally years. And before anyone says &quot;it's a mage item so you should have expected a nerf,&quot; ask yourself, who cares? It's just reclaim energy. Me getting back 50 mana from my pet isn't 1 percent as game unbalancing as CoD.<br />
<br />
Oh, and thanks on the stealth nerf to my GM event lfay dagger. Was all/all fear proc; just a toy but I liked it. Looked at it recently, melee only. I didn't know too many shaman-usable fear proc'ing weapons. And well, it was something many didn't have even if I NEVER used it. <br />
<br />
Oh, and once again, thanks for the Affliction change. It's fun working toward a goal and seeing it vaporize.<br />
<br />
Anything else you wanna tell people Absor? Guises? Pre nerf CoS's? SoF gonna be rogue only? I have an eyepatch of plunder for fun. That's really a melee item, so tee it up and take a swing.<br />
<br />
I am SICK of stuff changed retroactively. When this happens it means YOU, THOSE WHO CODE AND TEST THE GAME, FAILED. I pine for the days of &quot;... think of it as those who got there first getting lucky.&quot; At least you knew where you stood -- get it and it's yours.<br />
<br />
I'm probably gonna walk out to my car after work and find my Jeep nerfed to a Yugo with an explanation about how this vehicle functions better relative to gas consumption, and given the state of unrest in the oil-producing Middle East, you should have expected a change in your mode of transportation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah it's been changed now for a while.<br />
<br />
I agree that it's really not much fun to play a game when they change the rules in the middle.  I don't know why we put up with it.  If we were at a friends house playing monopoly and they just decided to up and change the rules in the middle of a game, I wouldn't put up with that.  I know you own boardwalk and parkplace!  BUT since this is my house, I decided it was overpowered so I think now you can only change 1/3 the rent! teehehe.<br />
<br />
I don't think I would finish the game, nor play it with them again.<br />
I'd be wary playing any game with them in the future.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The reason they changed this iirc is because of the mana free effects from the Planes armor and the free mana that would result from being able to reclaim mana from a pet that you didnt use any mana to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They like to keep you on your toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Let me know how teh Yugo drives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They nerfed reclaim energy on non-mages because of the ability to reclaim spirit call pets. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye Arriana and I used it for that when I thought about it, pre nerf. They could have just flagged SC pets unreclaimable. :(<br />
<br />
Always the answers are too sweeping. If you don't want chanters soloing mini's in BoT, don't nerf affliction foci, change the environment, change the spell, change the mob. Don't drop a nerf bomb.<br />
<br />
Same with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">mormegil,<br />
While its obvious we dont exactly see eye to eye on a few things but....this quote made me laugh out loud....very funny man.<br />
