<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I'm trying to improve my gear, I have epic/jbb already... don't worry about price, I'm not rich, but if I do the sow potion grind/other money makers long enough I can come up with any amount of money, and I will if need be.<br />
<br />
Right now, (in case the numbers are inaccurate here) I have 910 AC with my AC gear on, and 202 wisdom at the same time, this is fully self buffed. I also have 1669hp (again, self buffed) and I can get M/F/C resists above 100 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
My Magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=136832)<br />
<br />
If you folks could take a look at my magelo profile and give me suggestions... I am looking more for things that I can quest rather than have to raid for (Although I know raids are necessary at some point, I don't have unlimited time to play this either)<br />
<br />
Like I said, price isn't an issue, nor is effort - I'll work hard/camp it long if I have to.<br />
<br />
Let me know what ya think! :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Top of my head suggestions...<br />
<br />
Neck : Ivory Imbued Collar (chardok)<br />
Face : Crystal Spider Eyes (velks)<br />
Ring : Velium Fire Opal (jewelry) and/or Shadel Bandit (fungus grove)  keep the others for resists though at the least. ;)<br />
Arms : Barbed Ringmail (velks)<br />
Gloves : Crystal Chitin (velks) or Coldain Skin (kael quest/kill quest NPC)<br />
back : Ancient Seahorse Hide (Sirens Grotto) or Heiro (seb)<br />
belt : Chitinous (fungus grove) or Spider Fur (velks)<br />
boots : tribal war boots?  (chardok)<br />
shield : sarnak battle shield (chardok)<br />
range : goranga idol or divine inspiration (maiden's eye)<br />
<br />
All the stuff listed above you could camp while doin xp in the zones listed.  All but the Divine Inspiration is droppable as well if you can find it for sale and afford it if you feel like skipping some of the camps.<br />
<br />
My opinions are weighted towards ac/hp over wisdom, as if that's not obvious heh.  There's better you could get also, obviously, but the stuff I listed is campable at 54 with a single group for the most part, chardok and velks are also good xp spots so you get a double bonus there heh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it is a mistake, but I am using my epic shield... almost as bad (at least it has better AC though). Last night I was wandering around in lguk slaughtering everything and I killed the magus and looted an SMR, however, and my plan was to sell it and buy a CC shield (I think that's the velks one). If I time it right I can get even more because some people on my server get desperate and offer in #market something like 12kpp for the SMR because they don't want to camp it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">off the top of my head, with price no issue?  Here is a list of buyable non-raid stuff then.<br />
<br />
Chest - Fungi tunic<br />
<br />
Back - Lodizal Shell Shield / Heirophant's Cloak / Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak<br />
<br />
Shield - Orb of the Infinite Void, Sarnak Battleshield if price really is prohibitive.<br />
<br />
No reason to wear velium diamond ring unless you are raiding...get a shadel bandit ring or a 6ac/65hp one, or better yet, do the Chardok quest and get the second ring.  Upgrade 8th ring to 9th if you can - 9th has hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Range - get a Talisman of Benevolence or a Divine Inspiration.<br />
<br />
Feet - Barbed Dragonscale boots, Matchless/Peerless dragonhorn boots<br />
<br />
Shoulders - Death Watcher Shroud, Matchless/Peerless Dragonwing Mantle, Imbued Granite Spaulders<br />
<br />
Earrings - ones from Cazic Thule or ones from Chardok - earring of twisted leaves, earring of purity, earring of cleansing.<br />
<br />
Neck - dragon talisman from WW, Shrouded Medallion/Medallion of life from ME, Ivory Imbued Collar from Chardok, one of the shaman wearable necklaces from Cazic Thule.<br />
<br />
Face - Crystal Spider Eyes, enshrouded veil, Death Mask of the Elyasians.<br />
<br />
Arms - Crystal Chitin/Barbed Ringmail<br />
<br />
Hands - Crystal Chitin/Barbed Ringmail<br />
<br />
That should get you started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neck : Ivory Imbued Collar (chardok)<br />
<br />
Not sure I'm willing to give up the see invis and 15sv magic on the sabertooth necklace I'm wearing...<br />
<br />
Face : Crystal Spider Eyes (velks)<br />
Ring : Velium Fire Opal (jewelry) and/or Shadel Bandit (fungus grove)  keep the others for resists though at the least. ;)<br />
<br />
True, I need to get some AC on that hand, I am thinking about upgrading my coldain ring to the 9th ring and doing all the quests again for the 8th on my other finger. Sooner or later I will also do the 10th ring but that's gonna be hard to get support for without at least being higher level. Any of you know if the regen on the 10th ring stacks with regrowth? I have been told both things.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arms : Barbed Ringmail (velks)<br />
Gloves : Crystal Chitin (velks) or Coldain Skin (kael quest/kill quest NPC)<br />
back : Ancient Seahorse Hide (Sirens Grotto) or Heiro (seb)<br />
belt : Chitinous (fungus grove) or Spider Fur (velks)<br />
<br />
I'll look into this stuff :D<br />
<br />
boots : tribal war boots?  (chardok)<br />
<br />
I'm torn on this. I guess what I'm going to have to do is just lose a backpack and have a slot in my inventory for my sow boots - I rely on them WAY too much to not have the instaclick ability.<br />
<br />
shield : sarnak battle shield (chardok)<br />
range : goranga idol or divine inspiration (maiden's eye)<br />
<br />
Yeah, saw Divine Inspiration on Allakhazam the other day, along with a lot of other good stuff in ME... I hate that zone, but looks like I'm gonna have to go there.<br />
<br />
All the stuff listed above you could camp while doin xp in the zones listed.  All but the Divine Inspiration is droppable as well if you can find it for sale and afford it if you feel like skipping some of the camps.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's always a good thing to get exp at the same time :D<br />

Only thing I'm not sold on (Even though we all know the advantages) is the AC of this item. I have a friend who is willing to GIVE me the thurg quest bp MQ, and the AC on that obviously would be a lot better than the fungi. What do you think?<br />
<br />
Should I get one and just wear it for when I'm in between fights and regenning from canni? Or is this something that most of you wear all the time?<br />
<br />
Everything else looks good, time to start saving/spending :D</div></div><hr />

You are using 8th coldain ring while weilding epic shield.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">wear it all the time.<br />

I am level 60 with torpor, canni5, innate regen3 and a Skyshrine BP and I still find myself wearing my fungi from time to time.  I would wear it over *any* other BP until you get level 60 and torpor.<br />
<br />
edit:  if you friend wants to give you a thurg BP mq for free...  Take that too.   Keep it in your bag.  Buffing people with your BP sta buff is nice and it will give you a BP to wear when you make it to 60, get torpor and if you don't have a vindi BP or SS/Kael quest bp.<br />
<br />
More edits:  Did I read that right??  Do you only canni between fights?  I canni all the time, during, after, before fights... whenever I am not FM.  That's why the fungi is so valuable, all the time regen, that stacks with regrowth.</div></div><hr />

Fungi (well, get the multiquest, free sta never hurt anyone).<br />
<br />
Fungi was the single most powerful item I ever wore (after 60 it became less powerful since I had torpor).<br />

I'm always surprised at shaman that don't see the power of adding mega health regen, since we have the ability to convert hitpoints to mana.<br />

<br />
No, I canni all the time, but I have made it a rule that I won't canni less to less than 80% health during a fight unless it's just a HUGE fight and it's that close, then I'll canni as low as I need to go for the mana necessary. I try to avoid canni'ing too much while fighting because I hate being stuck in the spell recovery time just as root breaks. <br />
<br />
This is talking about soloing, when in an exp group I canni as long as I have health to do it - but my threshhold is usually about 80% health because I'm usually fighting in the arena with one group, and we all know what a Veteran is like when he resists slow a couple times and decides the shammy is an easier target than the MA. This is also why I prefer AC so much, it's really nice to lessen the damage I take from these guys.<br />
<br />
Also, like I asked earlier, do any of you know if the 10th ring regen stacks with regrowth/fungi?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hitpoints = mana waiting to happen <br />
<br />
Don't take me wrong, I see the power totally. The thing is, which is better to have - 15 extra points of regen every tick, or simply take 20 less points of damage every tick - which with more AC is actually realistic in my experience, at least when going up against giants in kael (where I've spent a lot of time lately).<br />
<br />
Nothing like seeing a mob that normally maxes for like 157 (or whatever) hit you 3 times in a row for 24, 89, 32 or something.<br />
<br />
Or better yet, the Veterans... normally max for 222 if I remember correctly... that was when my AC was low (something like 760?) but now with 924+AC (when cleric buffed+my own buffs) they still occasionally hit for max damage, but are much more likely to hit for 180s or lower. <br />
<br />
See where I'm coming from?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'm not sure what the difference between 21ac and 35(?)ac would actually be, so I could be totally wrong about this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The 10th ring has lots of stacking issues.   It stacks with fungi, but not with regrowth, afaik.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry about the 10th ring stacking too much unless you really think you have the guild support to do the ringwar for you, it is not a trivial thing for most people.  There are other good rings.<br />
<br />
Regarding Fungi vs AC.<br />
/shrug.<br />
<br />
If you really want AC then wear the thurg quest.  <br />
<br />
I would suggest that you could more than make up the ac difference between fungi and thurgadin quest BP by getting a range item with ac, a shield with decent ac, a neck item with decent ac, and a ring with some ac, etc.<br />
<br />
again.  Pre-60 and Torpor.<br />
I would wear Fungi over any BP.<br />
<br />
free innate stackable regrowth &gt; 14 ac.<br />
Get a Divine Inspiration and there ya go.  15ac.<br />
<br />
Regen works for you all the time.  When your group is fighting and you are healing, rooting, canni, slowing, dotting, buffing, etc.  Regen is working for you.   AC is working for you only when you are actively getting hit.  I do get hit a lot, but certainly not every tick.<br />

<br />
Canni button is 3.<br />
I am not joking when I say that the writing on my keyboard over the number 3 is faded.<br />
<br />
I am canning less with Canni5 though.  I gotta be at full health pretty much to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a vindi bp and it sits in a bag unless I'm raiding and need the resists/hp badly. <br />
<br />
Fungi &gt;&gt; all pre 60<br />
<br />
the relatively small bit of ac that you lose is way more than made up for by the innate 15hp/tick regen.  You shouldn't be tanking every single mob, and those that do turn on you ideally should be turning back to the MT relatively quickly.  <br />
<br />
15 raw ac alone isnt going to make a big difference in how hard a mob hits you.  It's the added up ac/agi/hp from your whole set of armor that makes the difference.  Trust in the wisdom of so many other shaman and get a fungi if it's within your reach. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Its possible that I'm being unspeakably stupid, and if I am please correct me, but why are you carrying something that's only stat is negative, and has no positive effects at all in your ammo slot?<br />
<br />
As for the fungi - give it a go.  It makes a SERIOUS difference to your mana pool.  I was sceptical given the low AC, but tried it and I am a convert.  I routinely canni down to 40% health now (clerics hate it!) because with bearform, regrowth, fungi and Force of Nature (ranger buff) I am regenning upwards of 35 per tick.  That means that I can canni away 1k HPs and know that I will get them back in about 3 minutes.<br />
<br />
I am not in uber gear by any means (I have only one piece of planar/velious armour - a rune etched bracer) but self buffed I have 902 AC and raid buffed I have gone up to about 970.  More than enough to take the battering we get after a couple of failed slows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ammo slot gives no stats.  Things in ammo slot are pretty much corpse holders.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>vaniar luclin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If the only thing thats stopping you from going to the fungi is the AC I would definatly make the switch. I wont say AC doesnt matter, but you have to see it through the law of diminishing return.<br />
<br />
As near as anyone can honestly tell All Wis casters, and maybe Int casters to but not my area of expertise, hit a point that gets commonly refered to as a Soft AC cap.<br />
<br />
This is not to say you CANT get more AC, what it means is that after a certain point the amount of AC required to alter the damage you are recieving is exponentially greater than the return on the investment.<br />
<br />
I can tell you that since 60 lvl (course 60 lvl has something to do with it as well) I have noticed very little in the damage recieved after 1100 AC at 1200 I still took as much damage with a very very minor difference over a 2 hour samples soloing in the same area only adjusting ac and trying to keep agi as close to the same score so I could take dodge into some account.<br />
<br />
The big deal seems to be just plain not being hit vs. actually lessening the damage you recieve. <br />
<br />
Unless you find yourself soloing casters alot you really can afford to focus on Wis/mana/AC instead of resists. <br />
<br />
I would definately shelf the Sabertooth neck for an Imbued ivory collar. <br />
<br />
Id try and grab a pair of Coldain Skin gloves (these really arent that costly considering thier stats to a shaman) <br />
<br />
If you have to buy the gems you might wanna let the thurg BP go and just put the cash else where, course that depends on gem availability to....<br />
<br />
Take the boots off man. You'll get used to either pullin em out of a bag or just go without the bag. I havent ever left my boots behind, but I havent worn mine since about 52 lvl, just keep em handy taken out of the bag or putting them on if you really want em for a specific reason isnt that hard. Get a pair of Tribals (AC, Wis and resists) or the ones from ME (these arent that uncommon at the cento camp, they rot alot)<br />
<br />
Quite frankly Id drop both those rings for a ring of winter/dezok begirding (sp)/ shadel bandit/ burning ring/ dizok signet ring of service combo <br />
<br />
Id focus on Wis/mana/HP combos.  Resists are resists your gonna need em, but you dont have to wear em. Most people I know in raid guilds (myself included) carry 1 or 2 bags of resist gear with em at all times, if your not a big raider (you seem to be focused on soloing) dont worry about the resist gear so much unless you really find yourself constantly needing it (in which case I have to wonder why)<br />
<br />
AC will take care of itself as High lvl gear becomes available. If you arent in a situation where you are raiding/looting high lvl gear then you most likely dont need to focus on the AC side quite so much. <br />
<br />
You need to look at items that will give you a maximum return for each slot. Sometimes you will find that sacrificing 3 or 4 ac for a total of 12 more stat points will get you alot farther. Maybe even look into one of those common 5 ac 4 to all stat dragon talisments in West Waste (they rot alot more than you might think).<br />
<br />
Some of this info may be to much or to little but based on what you posted about soloing or spending long hours camping quests points to a Shaman that isnt in a power guild, but plays alot and wants to be as uber as he can, its going to be expensive or take you a while......<br />
<br />
If you have access to www.allakhazam.com do a search for yourself based on what you want to focus on. I would sudgest lookin at things other than AC as a defining stat though Wis = mana, mana = mana, regen = mana, HPs = mana, big mana pool = more potential for you to play.</div></div><hr />

Yes.  It is called the Fungus Patch Vest and you get it via a quest on luclin.  It is only wearable by large races and has a recommended level of 51, but is also droppable.  It sells for much cheaper than a true fungi.  I've seen about 10-15k.<br />

My ogre shaman has used a bunch of BP's, including ikky BP and fungi and froggy and barbed ringmail and I don't know what else.  Regen is king -- infinitely better than anything else unless it's time for you to bust out your resist gear.<br />
<br />
I had my Temple of Veeshan (COV) dragon quest BP in my bag for months before I actually put it on because it had little value to me compared to my fungi until I got torpor.  Once I had torpor, I didn't miss the fungi a bit.  But until then(and it can take quite a while to get torpor), there is no substitute for a fungi, period.  Ikky BP until you can afford a fungi.  I'd go so far as to say don't buy anything else for your character ever until you have the money for either.  With the nerfed drop rate of fungi's, you're very unlikely to be looting one anytime soon, so think in terms of paying cash.<br />
<br />
As far as wearing the SOW boots, I have NEVER died because I didn't have them on.  I travel with all my bag slots full, and when I see the SOW icon fading, I hit &quot;I&quot; to click open inventory, then open my second from the top bag, lift the boots out, pick up the TOPMOST bag and put them down in that inventory slot and click them to activate SOW, then put them in the second bag again and hit &quot;I&quot; to close inventory.  It takes maybe two seconds -- more than enough time before the icon fades.  I can do it while running, whatever, and I'm not one of those coordinated Quake-types who can circle strafe and all that; it's just that it's very easy to do.  And plenty quick enough. <br />
<br />
When I've had my top slot open, I've just don't have to lift the bag up before clicking the boots, eliminating a step.<br />
<br />
If you are worrying about having an easily accessible instacast junk buff because of concerns about mobs that dispell, get a goblin skull earring, or just lose a single bag(my top bag is a disposable spit -- cool for making food on the run, and it only costs a couple plat so i can destroy it if I like) and put your boots in your empty inventory slot.  You can even hotkey them so you don't have to open inventory at all.<br />
<br />
On your equipment, I'd definitely get the crystal chitin gauntlets.  They're plenty good enough even at 60.  I have my ToV gloves, but keep them in the bank -- the crystal chitins are better.  And they're only a few thou.<br />
<br />
The crystal chitin shield is nice, too, and also usually cheap these days.  AC 19 wisdom 8 or something like that, and I think maybe 10 versus cold?  Kinda guessing; been a while since I wore one, but I liked it a lot.  Definitely SBS should be seriously considered, too.  Those hitpoints and the AC are probably better for you than more wisdom now.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd dump the flayed turmoilskin belt, too.  Mine is in the bank.  I like the spiderfur belt better because it has 40 hitpoints.  That's a nice boost in hitpoints.  And the belt is dirt cheap these days.  <br />
<br />
Sabertooth amulet and velium diamond rings seem weirdly out of place.  Get an imbued ivory collar and either a shadel bandit ring or a AC 6 hp 65 ring(the shadel is much better).  Shadel rings are actually a pretty common drop, but nobody ever wants to kill the bandits, so that's why they haven't flooded the game.<br />
<br />
As far as the MQ'd BP, riotous health for no mana is a huge boon on raids, and you'd like the stats.  But for most people, the gems are worth more than the actual thurg armor you use to make them at some point.  Black marbles go for 15k for 3 on my server; it's a personal call as to whether you want to spend that kind of money, I guess.  Personally, I think you would be much better off applying that 15k to the eventual purchase of a fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, except for maybe one or two dirt cheap pieces like the ivory collar or the new ring, I would probably not buy a single thing, and just focus all my saving and earning on buying a fungi.  No item you get will have anywhere near the impact on you of the fungi.<br />
<br />
Fungi + JBB + epic = holy trinity pre-torpor<br />
<br />
Each of those three items drastically increase your power, and together make a powerful synergy.<br />
<br />
JBB + epic + torpor = holy trinity POST-torpor<br />
<br />
But you can worry about that once you actually HAVE torpor.  ;)<br />
<br />
Fungi is still good even if you have torpor for some experience camps, but it isn't as insanely great as it is pre-torpor.  Shamans don't really have much in the way of mana or health problems post-torpor -- and if they do, they need a complete heal or an evac to solve that problem, not anything a fungi could supply.</div></div><hr />
