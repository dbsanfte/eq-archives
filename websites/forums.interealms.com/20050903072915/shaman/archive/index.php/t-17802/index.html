<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wraith_DoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My college blocks access to multiplayer servers as well as file sharing programs.  For instance I'm not able to connect to any eq servers, gamespy servers, novalogic, battlenet servers etc.  Makes for a boring game life in the dorm room.  Does anyone know if there is a way to work around this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humlaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if nothing else, the school should have a free dial-up isp for students.  Try this, or some other dial-up isp of your choice.  Frustrating when you have a high speed connection in the room, but sometimes the only viable choice.  Good luck.<br />

normally what they block is icmp (pings, traceroutes etc) which prohibits using alot of those applications, eq being one of them. If you can convince them to unblock you for one reason or another you'd be golden. to find out if its an issue for you just try and see if you can ping yahoo.com from your computer.</div></div><hr />
