<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pztagane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit 35 and decided to go get the SOW boots and start the epic! Also my fungi staff started working and I died when I couldn't escape without sow ;p.<br />
Anyway, the point is I did up to the boots solo (almost) and quickly by using the Timorous Deep firepot room to get around. Of course I always used the excellent walkthrough from this very site.<br />
<br />
1. Bind in Tim Deep on a spire above room. Port to Ogguk invis. This lands you safe just near the Ferrott zone. Zone out and run past guards and enter Rathe mts. Kill the Wicked guy and the Goodly chap, run around to the cyclops hill and take out Blinde the Cutpurse.<br />
<br />
2. Gate to TD and port to EFP safe on dock. Hand in gem etc<br />
<br />
3. Gate to TD and port to Erudin. This puts you safe (maybe a wandering guard not sure) on the dock, just in time to miss the boat :) On the Erudin - Qeynos leg the boat doesn't stop at wisp isle so just jump off when near. Do the Invis to animals practice session etc.<br />
<br />
4. Gate to TD and port to Halas. This puts you on the dock in Halas near npc's, so invis if evil. Find the spirit in WK, hand in gem, then items for the shield. He took off on me when I handed the shield items and didn't respond to hails, but did give me the shield when I woke up and said the correct phrase as I ran along after him<br />
<br />
5. Gate to TD and port to GF. Run to MM. Here I had arranged for some help, but in fact, when I got to MM there were quite a few 50+ farmers more than willing to help out. So my suggestion, if you have no one to help you, is just to play in MM during peak hours and ask for a hand.<br />
<br />
6. Gate to TD and port to West Cabilis. Invis if non-Iksar. This places you safe just next to the LOIO zone. Zone out and head to EJ for new booties. I wasn't brave enough to take the shortcut through Cabilis invised ;p.<br />
<br />
Did this in one night and although pretty obvious just thought it might help some one else.<br />
