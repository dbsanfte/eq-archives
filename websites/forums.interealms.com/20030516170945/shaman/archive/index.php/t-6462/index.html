<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Surprised myself by leveling through 41 in just a few hours of gameplay at the corrupt guards in WC...<br />
<br />
Conned dark blue through 41, but turned light blue at 42....<br />
<br />
pulled with slow, helped me pet barsh em into the ground....never got below four bubbles of health during entire level...<br />
<br />
Easy to break camp...simply root one and let the other follow you far, far away....when you finish the first and are ready for second, simply start walking back to the toll booth, when he sees you , he will come....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I just dinged 41 and thought I might give this a whirl.  I was curious what the spawn time was for the guards.  Also, I've heard that rangers in  East Commons and Druids in West Commons are good exp at this level.  Can anyone confirm?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The druids are a bit harder than the corrupt guards, particularly the camp is harder to split due to their ability to cast, and they spawn a bit faster....I tried them a couple of times at 41 but found it a bit difficult to keep the camp split for more than three or four spawns without running out of mana....<br />
<br />
if you are able to handle it, they certainly are better loot, as the corrupt guards must be very bad at corruption, usually they have only silver coin and rusty weapons...in my experience with the camps on another character, the EC druids are a bit easier than the WC pair...</div></div><hr />
