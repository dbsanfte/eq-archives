<br />
Can anyone tell me if there are faction hits and if so which and off which mobs.. <br />
<br />
Most mobs like me in there but some are kos.<br />
<br />
Has any Karana people spent some time in here and/or killed anything?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The only zone I've seen with faction hits is Plane of Justice.  Nightmare, Disease, and Innovation have no faction hits that I've seen so far.  Knowledge and Tranquility are non-kill zones so beats me if they have faction.  <br />
<br />
I've not spent a lot of time in Justice, so I can't tell you for sure what factions exist there.  Maybe someone else can...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They were named similiar though.  One was creatures of Justice, and the other was something else.  I have no idea what mobs are on what faction.<br />
<br />
If you attack rats apparently, the guards assist them.  If you attack a prisoner, guards assist them.....</div></div><hr />
