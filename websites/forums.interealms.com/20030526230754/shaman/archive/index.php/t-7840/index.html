<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rolano</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other night we were prepairing for a bard track raid.  I was in the bazaar and had noticed that Tigir's Insects was for sale. 5500pp...<br />
<br />
I bought it thinking that it might be somewhat usefull that night going thru the juggs area. It was, altho not as mana efficient as if both of our oracles were there, but useful none the less.  All goes smooth down to tracks area and we knock off jumpy and look twards the seb procector.  He drops and well ding.. ConG me on another copy of Tigir's Insects.  sheesh.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Track died that night also ----cong bard!<br />
<br />
<br />
Guess I cant complain, I did loot Pox --  Torpor and Malo were gifts to me from my guild. And the first 2 parchments that I turned in were Greater Immobilize and True spirit.<br />
<br />
Now to just get some more AA and scribe that copy of True Spirit... I want to get Cani5 before dinging 61.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry about the no real usefull information in this post.. Just wanting to state my dealing with spells.. since eveyone else has...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">tigirs insects is very common to see atleast 1 drop on any given run thru juggs. It sticks around 5k on my server too, but who knows why. 1 trip to juggs = free copy. Congrats tho, on your copy, and congrats to your bard!</div></div><hr />
