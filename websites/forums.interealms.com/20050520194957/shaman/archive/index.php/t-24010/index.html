<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moragan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heyas all, <br />
<br />
Im new to these boards.  I have a 40 shaman and want to know how that differs from playing a 65 shaman.  I want to make sure that I have the right skills built up for when I get there.  I know i got a long way to go.  <br />
<br />
I just really would like to know what spells are used regularly and which are not.  Any input would be appreciated.  I want to make sure I got the right spell skills in place before I get there and find myself stuck sitting around raising one set that I havn't in the past.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Torp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well there will be a ton of info... but the main thing is NEVER use your mouse.<br />
<br />
Mouses slow stuff down so much. Everything should be doing stuff through keys. Mouse is for checking through inventory but not combat.<br />
<br />
Set your spells to the number pad on the side of your keyboard 1-9 and use the big 0 key for sit/stand. use 1-9 and 0 above your alphabet keys for hotkeys. get used to doing shift + number to switch hotkey sheets.<br />
<br />
use n and m for cycling pc/npc targets (others will say tilde (~) but that  isn't as smooth in my experience.) use f7 and f8 to target near npcs/pcs. use f1-6 to target group members. don't make group messages for heals unless you keep stepping on the clerics toes... its annoying. get used to using /tar aswell<br />
<br />
actually... when travelling it is sometimes worthwhile to use mouse look to strafe... but that and searching through inventory is the only time!<br />
<br />
Do everything fast. always pay attention. when people ask you for buffs, do them as fast as possible, and get stuff done ahead of time (buffing/slowing) and whenever you are sitting around with extra mana don't be lazy, dot or nuke (atleast in exp groups, in raids .... well I don't want to talk about raiding).<br />
<br />
But yea... learn to never use your mouse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">don't make group messages for heals unless you keep stepping on the clerics toes... its annoying. <br />
<br />
well said and i agree with almost everything you said 100%, except the above point. i don't grp with any healers that dont have a heal message</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you slow, that is your job, that is what you live for, and buffs. Get used to Ferine Avatar rotations on the rogue :D. quickness is everything, a shaman who takes forever to slow a mob... is not a good shaman..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What makes playing lvl 65 (70) shaman personally fun is that you can adopt almost any role in group. Of course you have priority duties like slowing/buffing, but with current AAs, focis and gear available you can be decent healer, dps, offtank mobs, CC, puller etc. And as newest CR, with Call of the Wild :) (have been clicking clerics quite a punch since I got it). Pick a role and shaman can do it, except maybe main tank...heh.<br />
<br />
So you shouldn't be tied to &quot;one button syndrome&quot;. A good and active shaman in exp group makes a huge difference in its performance. So depending how many of those roles you can adopt and more actively you use all your skill/spell arsenal in group, the better you are. Nothing beat that feeling when you single handedly save the group with right reaction. <br />
<br />
On raids its slow, buff, spot heal and sometimes dps. Once you have slowed the mob, at least in my guild shamans are kind of &quot;free agents&quot; - personally I usually keep clicking Trushar/FA on all melees and spot MT/RT.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">10 Things I have learned about being a shaman (65+)<br />
<br />
1. We don't don't have enough spell slots (never enough.)<br />
<br />
2. Slow A.S.A.P<br />
<br />
3. Canni when ever you can.<br />
<br />
4. Canni AA skill is the most usefull AA ability we have<br />
<br />
5. If you get a lot of resists on slow - Malos first (I have GoD slow and am still Malosing in some zones.)<br />
<br />
6. Always keep at least 2 heals mem'd even when grouped with a cleric (You never know when they will go LD or lag out)<br />
<br />
7. Avatar is enoying as hell (But tanks like it! I hate clogging up a spell slot required for it though)<br />
<br />
8. If I am sitting around doing nothing, I am most probably LFG!<br />
<br />
9. Listen to the voice of experience (Shaman's are great class when played well! Occasionally someone gives you an idea or tells you something you didn't know.)<br />
<br />
10. AGI does nothing yet tanks still ask for it no matter how many times you explain its a useless buff. (Don't Figure)<br />

Oh yeh Shaman bots give shaman a bad name</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm a big mouse fan. I use it alot.  Then again, I'm a twitch gamer (Half-Life, etc).<br />
<br />
I do exceptionally well (well, IMO) in groups and raids and basically, i do this:<br />
<br />
I mouse wheel back so I can see all around me.<br />
I use F8 to cycle mobs.<br />
click macro1 to slow(clicky stick)<br />
macro2 is a direct heal (w/grp message)<br />
macro3 is a hot (w/grp message)<br />
macro4 is a channel message, &quot;mob = slow&quot;.<br />
the rest are your choosing.<br />
<br />
Get used to moving with WASD, w is forward, a is left, s is back, d is right.<br />
<br />
using WASD, you can hit a macro and not even need to look,plus easy access with your left hand to shift + # for macro sheets (i never use more than 2 macro pages).<br />
use Alt Key + #.  it IS your friend. the majority of my casting is by holding ALT and hitting a number to cast...much easier. use mouse to look AND strafe (hold mouse2/right click down and look around, hold it down and left click tolook around and run).<br />
<br />
Most of mymacro's are easily done with my left hand.. and im right handed and awful speedy atthis. Don't bother with a sit macro either. waste of space.  just hit ctrl s (or maybeit's alt s).<br />

<br />
Just lately I got a nice &quot;new&quot; feature to my UI's Target window. It now shows &quot;My target&quot; and &quot;My target's target&quot; this is extremely handy feature to have:<br />
<br />
Keep incoming mob in target and when mob gets tank to its target hit slow at once. This way you can avoid the &quot;non-tanked mob syndrome&quot; and slowing still is fast enough, especially if you have GoD slow. Btw...with GOD slow I have removed malo/malos from my spellbar...It gets resisted were rarely imo (Mem it if someone starts to whine about DD resists :))<br />
<br />
Also this target window naturally helps you to keep eye on potential spot heal targets (target's target remember) and with assist button you can switch target when needed. You dont have to guess when spot is needed or agro jumps, you can see it. In case of agro change on raids shamans are actually the healing force that can switch their target fast enough and maybe save the &quot;new tank&quot; - For some reason it seems clerics are pretty slow to do this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Learning aggro and how to control your aggro is quite important, but more so on raids.<br />
<br />
I agree with the not using the mouse too much, i have about 7 banks of hotkeys, and have two sets for groups and raids, swapping them over depending on the situation.<br />
<br />
Best general tip I can give is that shaman are multi-role, and able to step into many different roles. Learn your spell lineup, and the different uses, and you can be extremely effective in groups.<br />
<br />
Oh, and find a mentor that you can discuss things will. I'm always happy to help out shaman with questions, contact me on &quot;;tell nameless.kumoe&quot;<br />
 and I'll help where I can. Being in New Zealand, I might not be on though.<br />

<br />
Gonna hafta disagree with you on this, it may just be preference. If the mob isn't beating on the tank, I assume its on a caster or healer, and I slow. Make sure you have as many hps as you can get, because you want to slow early, and your gonna take a beating sometimes. Another thing, get used to standing next to the tank to slow if you can, this keeps the mob from 'ping-ponging' after you, and away from your tanks. If something does start hitting you, do NOT run around, remain clam, toss a heal on yourself and stay there and let the tank do his thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">...to save cash :<br />
<br />
The level 65 spells are a carbon copy of the level 60 spells. If you're leveling fast enough, just skip paying the cash for malo/torpor in favor of malos/quiessence. If it takes you a while to level, it's probably best to purchase these spells for your trip from 60-65.<br />
<br />
Likewise, don't buy Avatar. Put the money toward FA. Don't bother buying the disease dots if you're 100% group xp'ing. But learn to love the poison dots. Check out the medicine cabinet for essential information about skills, spells, and AA routes. <br />
<br />
The level 1 (or whatever) root spell is great all the way up to the endgame. It's supercheap on mana (practically free) and it's your only source of crowd control. Become a root artist and you will save the group more often than not on heavy pulls.<br />
<br />
At level 40 start thinking about doing the Stoicism quest. It's pretty easy and Dulak is good xp for you up to 50 solo. Stocism is the first of our Heal-over-Time spells with excellent ratio. <br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup...I forgot refer to case when mob is pulled normally and you have time to monitor that target window. If raid/group gets &quot;trained&quot; i.e. multiple mobs are in camp already, its just slowing everything as fast as you can.<br />
<br />
Without that feature in target window you are mainly guessing what is happening...or hitting /assist button constantly.<br />
<br />
Its part of shaman's life to get beaten (to death) every know and then, but with good tanks that won't happen too often. Still you have to be ready for that i.e. get all defensive AAs, consentrate on HP in your gear etc. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Snoww's guide to shamanhood<br />
<br />
1. You are many things but firstmost you are the link between the spirits and the real. You make all around you more powerful by linking them with the spirits. Do not fall into the trap of the bitter spirits and focus on what you cannot do. Because there is little that a motivated shaman with many friends around cannot do. <br />
<br />
2. The people who cary big sharp things are your brothers, guard them well. Watch over them and make sure that they are protected by all the spirits you can call. No matter how small the spirit is or how weak they seem to be affected by them. Others will be able to force the spirits out with more powerful majik but sometimes brute force is not around and the spirits fill the gap like water into a hole. <br />
<br />
3. You are not some small puny thing that stands in the back. We are kin to the bear and wolf and when the pack hunts we walk beside them with hammer in hand and blood on our lips. Curses flow from us to weaken and slow our foes, and the call of the wolves will not be stood against for long. Allow the spirits to take from your body so that your spirit will become stronger and use that power often. It is your right to change the material to the spirit withen yourself just as you are changing your spirit to the blood and bone that keeps you here. <br />
<br />
4. Be prepared to accept the anger of your foes at all times and do not shirk from the beatings you will recieve. Stand tall and bellow back your anger at thier temerity to strike a holy guide such as yourself and fight with the fury of the rabid bear when you have the will to summon it. You will never be a warrior with blades at your beck and call, but the spirits will sustain you and the meele will follow you like puppies to the mother wolf.<br />
<br />
5. All of your skills can come in time of need. When you look upon the cantrips and charms of the spirits remember that to ride the eyes of a monster is a usefull skill to have. It gives you information that will help you seem the wise and mystical person that you should be. Call a wolf from the material world for a bit and learn the antics of an animal charmed. It will let you see into the eyes of the enchanter as they control the great beasts of the world. A rain of poison can be an effective punishment for those that offend you but only if you have the wisdom to place the rain where it does the most damage to the foe. A blast of the artic air of my homeland will numb many it strikes but the cost of calling it from so far away is paid in time. To cripple a powerful foe seems like a leaf in the wind at times. But when backed with the tornado of many warriors even a twig can be driven into a mighty oak. <br />
<br />
Shamanhood is a subtle calling. Never to be understood by the many. They see our great works from time to time but most prefer the hand of the gods coming down to heal or the breath of nature itself blowing across thier wounds, they will never notice the small spirit of renewal easing thier aches or see the Shades of warriors past giving thier health to the wounded in a slow measured pulse.  The slow distruction of a foe from the insides from poison and disease will never be as flashy as a thunderclap from a great wizard. But the end result is the same. A monster dead. To be a shaman is to walk the annels of times slow passing and while our actions may come swifty in the heat of battle.<br />
<br />
The true measure of a shamans worth is in the quiet times when the brothers wolf and bear remember us and say with great reverance...Where he walked.... The ground stood still.... waiting for him to pass over it... Where he walked the armour stopped it's jingle and the men of battle all cheered, for the spirits walk with the shaman and the shaman walks with us all. <br />
<br />
Be a shaman.  Walk tall with brother wolf and sister bear beside you and the world will tremble where you go. Do not sit in the back of the lines waiting with the learned for the monster to die, instead crest the wave with the bloodlust upon you and call the spirits to make you strong and to weaken the foe from within.<br />

<br />
One point I disagree with though are the group spell messages.  I did away with those a long time ago because I have mapped my spell gems to my numpad keys and so spam them.  If I need to cast a heal, it's going to be cast the split second the gem is ready so I don't want to spam my group with the heal message. :)<br />
<br />
I nominate Snoww's guide as the new Shaman description in the EQ manual!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love the spam messages. <br />
<br />
If you want to cast without spam use the Alt keys It helps a ton. But messages give people information. With the spam message there is no ambiguity.<br />
<br />
What I still wish we had was a phrase ignore. As well as a limited Test parse restructuring. Tha is client based.<br />
<br />
So if someone said sow plz. I would have shown on my screen Please may I have a spirit of the wolf cast upon me. <br />
<br />
Or heal me!!  Would say  &quot;let me die&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of course my emote for Bane is like..<br />
<br />
/pause 1, cast 4<br />
/say With my last breath I spit at thee %t<br />
/gsay  I curse %t to %o dying day...<br />

-----------<br />
Umm, don't know why this poster said this.  Poison has no use outside of soloing and some raid targets.  Use sparingly though as they all have horrid agro.  Disease dots work very well on raid targets as well as solo targets - Disease is your best ratio dmg, but takes forever.  Get the ldon curse dots, they make dotting in a group worthwhile.<br />
<br />
I agree with posters above: use hotkeys, but dont over do it.<br />
<br />
DO NOT make a message that indicates you are attempting to slow a mob.  Use a key to slow (mine is 7) and then another key to indicate whether it lands or not.  <br />
For me, <br />
8 = /g &lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt; Slowed with Turgur's Insects; <br />
5 = /g &lt;&lt; %t &gt;&gt; resisted my slow; heal accordingly.<br />
<br />
Slow + root + cripple = Enchanter that can't cast C<br />
Heal over Time + ~CH + quick heal = Cleric that can't rez<br />
Dots w/ debuffs = Necro that can't FD<br />
Good defensive AAs = OT that doesn't die (unlike rangers)<br />
<br />
9 spell slots = All of the above in 1 package.  Remeber, shamans have been a solid class since Kunark.  Do not expect any handouts or upgrades ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grammaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow Snoww.  That guide was impressive.  Well written and such a good perspective.  You deserve some more Lady's Mantle to eat!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have a 40 shaman and want to know how that differs from playing a 65 shaman.<br />
<br />
At 40, you have some of the tools that you will have at 65, but by no means all. Let's go over the differences quickly:<br />
<br />
1. Slowing. As I recall, you have a 51% magic based slow at level 40 and no disease based slow. Your magic based slow will max out at 75% at level 60. Also, you don't have unresistable debuffs until level 60. That's the bad news.<br />
<br />
The good news is that mobs don't hit all that hard at level 40 and have lowish resists, so your tools should be adequate for now and will scale up nicely with monsters' abilities as you level up. Your slow will be your most important tool at 65 and your signature spell -- when it is not mitigated, that is, but that's a different story.<br />
<br />
2. Healing. Healing is one of your weaker abilities at 40. A level 40 Cleric has his 7.5K HP Complete Heal and you have your, er, 300HP Greater Healing. A bit unbalancing. On the other hand, you have Chloroplast and it's a powerful spell at that level if you let it do its job right (hint: don't heal to 100% during the downtime).<br />
<br />
The good news is that you will get much better at healing at 58+. Our 10 second mini-CH is nothing to write home about, but it wil be situationally useful for a few levels and then you will get Tnarg's and eventually Quiescence, which will make you a passable healer up to and including PoP. If you go to GoD (where you wil get spell upgrades as well), things may be different, but that's yet another story.<br />
<br />
3. Mana regeneration. Canni 2 is a decent mana regeneration tool (get used to hitting it over and over and over), but Canni4 will be much better and Canni5 is a godsend. The difference in mana regeneration between a level 40 Shaman and a level 65 one is huge.<br />
<br />
BTW, by the time you get Canni5, you will want to make sure that you don't go under 1.5-2 orange bubbles of health when you take 1924HP damage from it, preferably self-buffed. Might as well start working on HP (and to some extent AC) items now. With today's Bazaar gear, there is no reason to drop below around 200 WIS (which is where the WIS/mana ratio gets poor anyway), but otherwise it's HP, HP and HP. Well, and STA if it's not maxed :)<br />
<br />
4. Root parking. Functionally, a level 40 Shaman and a level 65 one do the same thing when they are on root parking duty - hit Root and back off. The difference is that XP mobs tend to have higher resists at level 65, but then your Root will have a built-in resist adjustment by then, so it's a wash. On the plus side, you will have Virulent Paralysis, a nifty Disease based AA Root, which is hard to resist. You can use it for crowd control or for root dotting - quite useful either way.<br />
<br />
For now, just learn to root park and you will be fine.<br />
<br />
5. Buffing. Level 65 buffs are obviously better and last longer than level 40 ones, although some stat buffs become irrelevant as people approach 305 [note: things are a bit different in OoW]. With appropriate AAs, Shamanic buffs last a long time except Ferine Avatar, but that's life.<br />
<br />
6. DOTs. Bane and your post-60 DOTs do not have a damage component, hence they don't break Root. Makes root-dotting much safer, especially when you get VP3.<br />
<br />
Finally, to address the issue of which school of magic you will want to have maxed first. Alteration is the most important one (slows, heals), but it will be maxed in no time because of Canni. Conjuration (DOTs) is nice to have maxed for DOTs, but it's not a game breaker. Evocation (nukes, AE rains) can be situationally useful in groups, but it's frosting on the cake, really. Abjuration is limited to the rarely used AC buffs (do not stack with Virtue), self-only AC/stats buffs (shortish duration) and resists, which are all situational. Divination is mostly Invisibility, so it tends to lag behind.<br />

Just wanted to add to this that the level 56 root (Paralyzing Earth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=133&amp;source=Live)) is a very nice 3 minute root.  It's ability to last so long has allowed me to CC pretty decently, and it usually lasts close to full duration.  The only time that it seems to have issues is with mobs that have really high magic resists, even after malosini (the best I have for now).  But then you are going to have problems with the plain old root spell on those mobs as well, so I still would choose this root as my favorite until I can get Petrifying Earth (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3196&amp;source=Live) with a negative 30 resist adjust.... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
In regard to root. Maybe it's just me, but I've always had resist problems with the higher root spells... except Spell: Root. 3 minutes is a nice duration but usually minimal. You usually don't want a mob rooted that long if your group is worth their salt. I like to pull mobs away from the group so they don't get free hits on those unengaged. Thus, the 30 second low-level root is perfect for a Malo+Slow, You will get the aggro, but mob should never summon as you've done no actual damage. Once slowed, the mob is yours and headed straight for you when root breaks, which should be soon. Standing away from the combat, this pulls the mob out of harms way where he can be rooted again while you slow another or just keep the chain casted root on the single mob. Either way it's cheap mana-wise. A 3-minute root is nice until you root a mob too far away and DD doesn't seem to break the root while it summons the casters.</div></div><hr />

This is why, even with 6 Shamans on the raid. I'm the one spooning the MA and spamming debuffs!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Functional differences between a level 40 and a level 65 shaman are mainly the following:<br />
 - Slow will become more powerful.<br />
 - Haste will become more powerful.<br />
 - Root will become so cheap that the only cost in rootparking is time and health lost, not the mana for root.<br />
 - Your heals will loose power compared to cleric heals. HoTs partially make up for this.<br />
 - Regen will decline in usefulness.<br />
 - Your ability to tank will decline but the increase in slow will make up for this for quite a while.<br />
 - Your damage, especially your melee damage will make less and less of a difference to a group.<br />
 - AAs can make additional differences but this differs wildly depending on how many you get at what levels.<br />
<br />
Thus your role shifts from doing everything to a support / healer / debuffer role. It is not all that much of a change really and rather subtle - the main difference you will notice is the damage part and the power of an unmitigated 75% slow.<br />
<br />
In between you will also have a Stoicism/Torpor area where you will alternatively yell &quot;YAY I HAVE ENDLESS MANA&quot; and &quot;I WANT TO RUN AGAIN&quot;. That does not change your role in groups though, except for being able to berate tanks that accepting the slow and snare is all for the best of the group.<br />
<br />
Basically unless you have been tanking and DoTing in groups a lot your role will not change much. And unless you have been one of the wisdom/mana shaman you will not have a need to develop new skills at all, merely nuances in old skills, such as learning to rootpark while snared. When you start getting some AAs is when the real learning begins, such as when to use canna 5, how to use Virulent Paralysis to kill annoying group members and how to use Spirit Call to supress summoning.<br />
<br />
Changes in the spell lineup will also be rather small. For me its usually Cannibalize, Heal over time, Heal, Malos, Malosinia, Slow, Random slots (used for damage spells or buffs usually, Root would be in here if I did not have a root ring).<br />
<br />
I suspect for you it is Cannibalize, Heal, Malosi, Slow, Root, Damage Spells / Buffs? If so that lineup will not change much other then adding over time heals and of course switching them out for newer and better spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have a 40 shaman and want to know how that differs from playing a 65 shaman. I want to make sure that I have the right skills built up for when I get there.<br />
<br />
If you want the right skills to play a good shaman, I suggest you solo all the way to your mid 50's.  I'm not a big believer in telling a young player what spells he or she needs to be using or how to use them.  I don't think people learn as well when they're spoonfed things that they don't yet understand.  Experience is always the best way, and there is no better experience than being tossed headfirst into the pool, so to speak.<br />
<br />
So, I'll just suggest a progression for you.<br />
<br />
In your early to mid 40's, head to the Luggald caves in Dulak's harbor and try solo'ing all the way to the back of the cave.  At the higher levels, mobs will resist slow a lot and you'll be dealing with high agro and lots of mobs.  These mobs don't yield a lot of experience, but you'll certainly learn something about control, agro ranges, and efficiency.<br />
<br />
At 44, find the elementals in Nadox.  They're terrific experience (the best experience from 44 to 49 actually), but more importantly, if you're running the cycle of mobs quickly to maximize your experience, you'll find yourself 60 life 60 mana after having finished killing the last mob in the cycle and the named instantly spawns from the corpse of the elemental you just killed.  Are you a fight or flight shaman?<br />
<br />
From 49 to 57, you'll never find faster experience or money than when you solo the nobles in Highkeep hold.  Learning how to be efficient yet effective will be key.  Can you deal with 3 green guards interrupting your spells while you try to lock down 2 angry nobles?  When puppy bites the dust after finishing off the first noble, and you're 50 life 50 mana, will you dare to stay and test your mettle?  By the time you've left this camp, if root hasn't become your best friend, I'll eat a shoe.<br />
<br />
But not only will you'll be dealing with lots of mobs and a fast cycle of mobs in HHK, you'll also be dealing with moronic people trying to bum buffs from you or steal your camp.  So, will you give up your camp, or will you flex those burly muscles and show that pesky druid he can't killsteal your mobs?  (hint: chain nuke till you've done over 50% damage - they can't keep up with the mana reqs.) And when you log on and somebody else is sitting in that middle room, looking smug, can you negotiate with the guy to get part of the camp or will you just create more problems later on?  People problems are a large part of the highend too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you get the basics down, there's not a whole lot that's different.  Just stick with it, don't rush through it, and enjoy the game for what it is - a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I love the spam messages. <br />
Snow<br />
<br />
<br />
I however do not like spam messages, its cluttering and unless you change it regularly it gets repetative and rather old in my eyes, ( my opinion obviously ) but then again usually when i am in group or raiding it is more often than not with the same people so it is entirely unessesary for me to use spam messages, they expect me to do my job just as i would expect them to do theirs. <br />
<br />
One thing i suggest is when and ( if ) you start raiding regularly set up a new chat window and get all the shaman in it to do your slow and resist messages there, the raid will appreciate it and you can keep an eye on things most of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Well there will be a ton of info... but the main thing is NEVER use your mouse.<br />
<br />
Mouses slow stuff down so much. Everything should be doing stuff through keys. Mouse is for checking through inventory but not combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
um this is more than a little wrong, first off if you scroll out you can target mobs easily with the mouse,<br />
second of all the extra bank of 12 macros cannot (note thats CANNOT) be used with any keyboard comand in game. and if you dont know how to use your extra macros yet its time to learn.<br />
<br />
alt+m opens your actions menu<br />
click the speach balloon to open the macro page,<br />
on page one you can make all 12 of these into custom macros that have one character trait not found in standard hotkeys...you can use them to interupt a macro in proccess.<br />
make one of them called &quot;Clear&quot; or something like that and put the /ti comand in it.<br />
now you can have a page full of raid related or group related (or both since you can put the /g and /rs comand in the same macro) and all of those macros you wish you had room for on a permanently accessable page you dont need to swap back and forth on.<br />
the canX5 macro? (remember you CAN intterupt it before you post that you cant use a macro to cast cani 5 times cause then you are stuck with it running when the puller brings adds)<br />
<br />
yes the nearest target key is well suited for targeting, so is cycling through the targets and the last target toggle, it hardly make the mouse usless. some times when theres 5 mobs hanging out the mose it the right choice for a target.<br />
<br />
<br />
all that said, <br />
<br />
get hit now, you will want that defense later on,<br />
work all your spell related skills, shaman use them all.<br />
learn to solo<br />
learn to group<br />
learn the powers of different classes, knowing what somone else is capable of gives you a massive advantage, when you know that class X has Y power that compliments one of your skills you are that much better than the average player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">stopped reading after the never use a mouse comment.<br />
<br />
only hotkey i use is F8. cept for bringing up inventory, AA, etc type windows.<br />
<br />
the HoTT window makes it even easier for a mouse using shammy :)<br />
<br />
sry, no real help here, prolly would give bad advice anyways.  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
