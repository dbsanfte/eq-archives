<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Start out at the mushroom temple.  You should be able to pull single shrooms.  I usually slow, debuff, tainted breath, and melee. Wasn't the fastest route, but I managed to make some plats and get to 34 here.  Once you hit 34 you will shred through the shrooms (dogdog rocks!).  <br />
<br />
Once I hit 35 I started trying the tribals.  They are just past the temple, near Griegs end zoneline.  They were difficult, but the money is just unbelieveable!! They drop acrylia, which can be sold to players for 100-300 pp each.   4 hours of hunting should net you enough acrylia to make 1k.<br />
<br />
I just dinged lvl 40 and will be here till they turn lt blue around 44-45.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About the tribals. <br />
I notice a faction hit with these. Will I become KOS with these if I continue to kill them? The best thing with this place is that nothing will agro (except wolves and lightcrawlers), and that is a good thing when solo.<br />
<br />
If the tribals will start jumping me whenever they get close, I think I will ignore them. Otherwise they should be the next step after the shrooms and Zelniaks(sp?)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did zelniaks at about 37/38, and moved onto large zelniaks around 39, just dinged 40 and they still work okay. Work from the Sanctus Seru zone, I just buffed myself to the hilt, summoned pet, kept myself and dogdog hasted. Just run up to the zelniaks and start beating, back off at about 25-30 percent and let dogdog have it, canni, med whatever. On Large's I pulled with Tagars (34 slow), and did the same thing. The wonderful thing about zelniaks is there are a buttload of them, and they ARE NOT social at all. You can kill one and have another walk by with no problems...<br />
My favorite spot for this was straight out east, and a hair north of the SS zone, when the path divides up. There is a semi-valley, more like the foot of a ridgeline there. Its between the forest and the hills. If you kill all those, head over the hill into a deeper, full of zelniaks. The only downsides to either are was an occasional wolf or lightcrawler add (and occasional named zelniak or wolf, which drop items for Twighlight Armor). The wolves are annoying at this level, the lightcrawlers only a minor nuisance. Names can be pretty tough if they take you unaware, I rotted them abit sometimes. Also, note that there is a huge concentration of lightcrawlers aproximately ESE as you head out of SS. I got over a yellow an hour (as a barb at 39 on larges), solo, with very little trouble.  I have nice gear for my level (925 ac 1250 hp buffed)and a REIF and an Ikky, so your mileage might vary, but I think its a good spot, nonetheless. The most important thing for me that was downtime was almost nil for me (a med break about every 20-30 minutes, for about 3-4 minutes, I really just blew more mana cause I wanted a cigarette), because I get sick of medding with a quickness.<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is WOW.<br />
<br />
At level 34, I was in HHKeep, taking the lookout room, and every 6 gobs would be 1/2 a blue bub...<br />
<br />
I decided to hit Dawnshroud...UNBEFRICKINLIEVABLE.<br />
<br />
I'm not concerned about the loot...but the XP!<br />
<br />
Every 10 kills is a Yello Bub. That's fungus shrooms, blood starved wolves, lightcrawlers, and large and regular Zelinaks...<br />
<br />
WOW.</div></div><hr />

Even though I am amiable to them (I killed rockhoppers for 5 levels), some of them still come after me.  Most dont though, and I haven't seen any use for this faction anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Yathandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I was in my 30s I found that if you can get some druids to group with, you can &quot;herd&quot; zelniaks with AE and dots.  It was so much fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quick little problem...<br />
<br />
I had LUCKILY been in the Nexus when Aego had been cast, so I had 2288 hp's...<br />
<br />
I was hanging out at the entrance to Neth Lair, taking out Shrooms and wolves. I see what looked like a group of people being chased by a wolf. I conned him, and he was dark blue, so I rooted him, thinking I was helping this group...<br />
<br />
Apparetnly it wasn't a group, but ONE person running from a group of what appeared to be rangers and other NPC's. When I started attacking &quot;a wolf&quot;, I had slapped a couple DoT's on him, and pet...<br />
<br />
All of a sudden, I look up and see my 2288 HP's down to about one and half bubs.<br />
<br />
Seems that Ranger NPC and his friends were hitting me for 111 hp's at a pop...and I was taking it with a smile.<br />
<br />
I ran to zone, since there were about 3 of them...They aggro'd on my pet, and I got away...but a warning...<br />
<br />
Be careful! I don't know what all this was about...but it's not nice to play with Ranger's friends!</div></div><hr />

sorry but ... what DSP are you hunting in? The exp in DSP is mediocre in my experience, and the goblins in HHK yield more exp per kill from 29+. However DSP has MORE mobs which are easier to kill. That, and including how easy it is to make a group, is the only reason I go to DSP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My experience with DSP is that at 29-high 30's Zelniaks to Large Zelniaks are about a 1/3-1/2 a blue each. It is a fast grind, especially in the area next to the Shroom temple. I never bothered with the shrooms, there was no point. Just slaughter Zelniaks.<br />
<br />
At 43 I went back there just to see what things were like since I'd seen a number of other there in the low to mid 40's. But the exp just wasn't worth it anymore. most of the Large Zelniaks were dark blue still and the wolves and blood thirsty trap wolves were all dark blue. But you spent too much time tracking them down or waiting for the traps to reset.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, if you're interested in leveling like made from lvl 29-late 30's, DSP is a fantastic spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would do mushrooms at lower levels, they can be single pulled with spell and drop mushrooms which sell for around 5 plat.</div></div><hr />

Where is the mushroom temple?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fathum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The mushroom temple is straight out and a bit to the right if you're at the NL zone.  Or if you want, you can follow the zone wall to the right and you'll see it.  Its a big brown castle looking place.  The shrooms spawn inside.<br />

It was a blast chain healing when we got in trouble.. lol.<br />
