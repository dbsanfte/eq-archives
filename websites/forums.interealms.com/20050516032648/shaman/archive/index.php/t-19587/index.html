<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just musing to myself a bit about using shamans as healers in raids.  We have just about zero usefullness right now after the minimum number of shamans have been reached.  On the other hand, upwards of 20% of your raid force MUST be clerics.  Neither situation is particularly useful.  Most guilds are desperately seeking more clerics, just to have enough on hand.  This causes a bit of feast or famine.  There's either not enough(raid night) or too many(every other night).<br />
So, it might sound a bit out there, but would it really be that overpowering to let shaman heals over time stack?  You could have a greatly reduced requirement of clerics.  Got four 'extra' shaman but are short of clerics, just strap all 4 into a hot chain.  The resulting healing would allow you to increase time between ch.  Maybe not in very high end content, but would give a useful role to the majority of shaman out there.<br />
Obviously this would require editing the spells and moving them to the 'bard box', but doesn't seem like that big of a challenge.  It might need some kind of cap on quantity as well, though its hard to see it ever being as powerful as a single ch.<br />
Thoughs, observations, reservations or just plain arguments, lets hear em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">On content where 20% of your raid force needs to be clerics, a 300/tick heal will do absolutely nothing.  In addition to that, in my guild, we have one cleric that is assigned to cast divine intervention and bulwark of vie as needed - they aren't looping.  This cleric usually keeps supernal elixer on the tank, which is a 500hp/tick heal and doesn't stack with quiescence.  Also, do you really need more than one shaman to sustain quiescence?  Mine lasts 8 ticks, and I know that is more than most, but even with just SCRM it is easy and almost manaless to keep up a 6 tick quiescence by yourself.<br />
<br />
I don't know what stage of the game you are at, but in PoP there aren't many encounters where just one person is taking damage.  There is almost always at least a rampage tank, and quite often an AE.  Clerics usually have MT healing locked down, so I make myself useful blast healing the MT and healing AE damage (quiescence is excellent for AE healing).<br />
<br />
If you tell me what kind of stuff you're raiding, I'd be more than happy to give you my input on how a shaman can make himself most effective healing (or doing other stuff) for that encounter.  A quiescence loop, unfortunately, isn't going to be very effective =\<br />
<br />
edit:  I'm illiterate and completely missed the part of your post where you said this was an idea for quiescence to stack.  It's definately an interesting idea.  I've been thinking about balancing issues, and honestly I don't think it would be too overpowering.  Good idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Perhaps I'll rephrase that.  Didnt mean to have shaman hots stack with cleric.  I meant have shaman hots stack with each other, like our dots do.  Four extra shaman would give 1200/tic.</div></div><hr />

You phrased it fine, I just can't read :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do know the bard box only holds 6 buffs right ? <br />
Most bards I know twist 4 songs ... Then add in the new shaman ward for stamina regen thats 5 .. druids and clerics also get similar healing wards.  No idea what stacks, but ya my bard box is usually pretty full.<br />
<br />
No thanks I dont want to be in a Heal over Time rotation, if I wanted to heal I would have made a cleric.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">...No thanks I dont want to be in a Heal over Time rotation, if I wanted to heal I would have made a cleric.<br />
<br />
We know shaman were never meant to be healers, A_Turtle_Pet_01 already told us on TNZ  :rolleyes:. Like it or not, healing and healing in a raid :eek: is part of our class function.<br />
<br />
That aside, i would prefer direct healing or quick healing improvements above HoT-improvements. Too many HoTs and stacking those could easily trivialize encounters (especially older ones) even more.<br />
<br />
With direct heals you must have atleast a bit attention and timing, HoTs you could (theoretically) fire away at start of encounter and forget about them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The point that our usefulness on high end raids is limited, and that we are reduced to being healers, and that our heal is inadequate is a good one. I just don't think that stacking our heal over time would be the answer to that.<br />
If you make the mobs highly resistant, let them heavily mitigate, or be just plain immune to slow, give me something else I can do.<br />
My heals are subpar, my nukes are less than subpar, dots are usually out of the questions-what else is there for you to do?<br />
I also feel the &quot;if I wanted to be a healer I would have played a cleric&quot; sentiment, but the game is the way the game is. I'd be happy to have a bigger, more efficient heal to help me do something at lease useful on those anti-Shaman designed raid encounters.<br />
<br />
By the way, my guild is plagued with the whole lack of cleric problem. When we have the numbers, we chew through time like its nothing, when we don't (quite often) we get hung up in the early phases. Clerics say they are bored with their class. I don't blame them, healing over and over again for your whole career seems pretty uninspiring to me too, thats why I didn't pick a cleric to begin with. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Totally agree with your view on guid healing, even if my guild is far, far away from time ;).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, of course clerics should be in another league of healing than shaman and i even can accept, that druids have become better healers than shamans (albeit grumbling).<br />
<br />
But heal-wise i want two things:<br />
- having ALL necessary tools to efficiently assist heal in ANY possible raid encounter<br />
- being able to main heal in ALL grouping situations except the most challenging (i can live with a reduction in overall group efficiency with a shaman healer, but it should be possible in a reasonable way, when clerics/druids are not available). That should be true without being dependant on uber gear or a truckload of AAs.<br />
<br />
I don't think shamans are on this level of healing actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personly I think if the Bard window was opened too say 15 slots .. and Shaman ot's were moved too that window and alowed too stack with one anouther it would be REALLY cool . And we would have a vialble raid tool as a class .<br />
What a GREAT Idea !</div></div><hr />

    Too bad you have make a priest !<br />
<br />
Well for stacking Q it's not an option ,just due to the limitation of 15 buff . Mt don't have any room for that .</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Also, a tick is every 6 seconds. So, the heal pulse is far too far apart to make any difference on high end encounters where you run a pause 0 CH chain.<br />
<br />
Interesting idea, but I don't see it either being feasible due to limited buff slots or effective.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">not meant to be healers? we`re a PRIEST class? last time i checked we are healers. a shaman should with a slowed mob be able to heal effectively, the fact we need less healing power due to slow doesnt mean we are not healers. <br />
<br />
the problem is this balance of slow and healing goes badly wrong with hard ldon and elemantal planes. our balance for slowing and healing is wrong at this level, we cant heal enough even with our slows at this level. this is what, for our healing aspect, needs correcting.<br />
<br />
i still wouldnt want to be primary healer in agroup, but if noone esle available i atleast want the choice. (it sometimes nice just to be healer for a while)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I understand the people who say they don't want to be a main healer, be in a CH rotation, etc.  The fact remains though, we are a priest class.<br />
<br />
I do not know how many times I have ended up being a healer for a group during a raid.  It can be really embarassing watching people die in the group, despite doing the best to spam Tnarg's; especially knowing if there was a cleric or druid in the group, people would be alive.<br />
<br />
For large fights, clerics and even druids, are too busy keeping MT/rampage/ghetto mez tanks alive with CH chains.  This leaves shamans to spot heal those that get hit with AE's or those who get injured from getting agro for a moment.  Q is only good for a few people in AE situations.  AE's usually occur every 30-60 seconds.  If someone takes 25% of their health and you Q someone late, they'll be half health the next AE hit before Q takes into effect.  It's a godsend to have a paladin in the group for these situations, because they can heal the group so well with one single cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yes that healing groups is where a groups quin would come in very handy. at elast from ae that dont go off to often. otherwise we need a better direct heal. or some form of group direct heal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Obviously, something like this would be completely useless on no pause ch.  I cant speak from personal knowledge, but it doesn't seem useful for leading edge content at all.<br />
I was thinking more in line with mid level, lower upper level content where getting extra healing every tick is useful.  These are the guilds that are most likely to be short of clerics and heavy on shaman.  I can't see ANY amount of heal over time removing clerics from their post of supreme healers at the top.<br />
Thing is, people who play clerics are just like anyone else.  They want to advance, they want loot. Best way to do that is join the top guilds.  These are the guilds that have the most to offer, and are willing to offer it.  Puts a bit of a squeeze on lower level raiding.<br />
Anyway, nice discussion on what may be a whacky subject :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I can deal with not being as universally good at healing as a druid or cleric. What irks me is that our spot heal is weak, Q is basically useless because of massed heals and we do not get massed heals.<br />
Give us a 5 second cast, 600 per tick torpor with side effects for 300 mana and let us play caster healer. We still will not touch cleric or druid healing but we will have a role and could possibly let other classes save a few mass heals by keeping a CH chain up against AEs or something like that.<br />
Tnarg's could use an upgrade, but then half of our spells could. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Not that it matters, but a possible solution to the buff slot problem is to fix it so similar spells that have identical buff slot icons stack but occupy the same buff slot.  Put a multiplier on the buff slot icon for game mechanics, so the program knows to multiply the base damage/heal by that stack multiplier.  Change certain HoT/DoTs so they stack, so, for example, 4 shamans cast Q and it occupies 1 buff slot, though the game will multiply that HoT buff slot value by 4, the value of the multiplier.  If one Q expires before the others, the multiplier drops to 3.<br />
<br />
They'd have to treat and keep track of each buff separately as far as duration goes, so the game code would have to be tweaked a bit to take that into account and have it work properly.<br />
<br />
Obviously, things like BA focus effects that change the base hp values of HoTs/DoTs would mess with this.  One option would be to simply rule that if two buffs/DoTs land on the mob and the game code classifies them as &quot;stackable&quot;, focus effect modifiers are negated.  That would be one option.  The other option is that they will not be stackable unless they have similar focus effect modifiers applied to them; i.e., two shamans with BA4 casting BoS.  Focus effects that alter duration (SCRM. etc) wouldn't have a problem with this, for they only change duration, and the game program would have to keep track of each duration seperately anyway.<br />
<br />
Just my idea.  Comment as you will.</div></div><hr />

This is just an educated guess but I think that would mean a fair bit of code rewriting - not to mention everyone wanting to have HP buffs, AC buffs, mana regen and so on get special stacking too. I do not think it is feasible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">It would be much easier to just give us a semi-decent heal instead, something like 1700hp for 550m.</div></div><hr />

<br />
how about this (also on seperate post)both nice, quick but long recast. <br />
<br />
so heal 2.5k(possible 3k) 3 sec cast , but 30 seconds or so recast for 850 mana. at level 65 (tnargs being 62) the recast i think is the thing to balance it out <br />
it might need to be nearer 60 sec. and to get that mana back takes least 2 cast on new canni spell, and you wouldnt want to use on self, unless you really being hammered, quin far more effecient. even with 10 sec cast time the ch and 75% ch of cleric and druid can still heal alot more than we can overall in a 30 to 60 sec period (though i think nearer 30 probably fine). but it gives us a heal that can make a difference but needs to be used very tactically. and poeple would think yes shaman nice emergency heal.<br />
<br />
this fits our style to, we need to slow the mobs first , by this time the mob has done alot of damage often and this when best heal needed, cast best heal tank back up to reasonable amount and we can then likely heal ok once slowed with quin and turgs. <br />
<br />
and the dd, 1.4k 3 sec cast 30 sec recast for 460 mana. likely change all poison nukes to this. ratio. add one 65 <br />
<br />
i think these would certainly solve or short term healing and dps. but not hugely affect our overall healing and dps. fine tuning being in how long the recast is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
How do you get 100% extension on your Q?<br />
<br />
You're not going to land that lucky hit for an extra tick every time, shouldn't count on it :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">SCRM + Chrononostrum = 8 ticks<br />
<br />
SCRM + Eterninostrum is almost always 8 ticks too but you get the occasional 7 tick Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">chrononostrum = 25%<br />
eterninostrum = 20%<br />
<br />
75% 7 ticks with the sometimes lucky 8 for chrono<br />
<br />
70% 7 almost every time except for the blue moon 8 etern<br />
<br />
To put it another way, you get 8 ticks out of that just as often as we used to get 1800 hp torpors before all the buff extension aa's/foci. If we got lucky we did, but in no way could we count on 1800hp torpors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">With eterninostrum or chronostrum I always get 8 ticks.  I tested them a alot back in ldon beta to see if upgradeing to chronostrum would be worth it.  It wasnt for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You don't even need that high of focus effect to get a consistent 7 ticks, I still get an 8th tick about half the time with SCRM and the ldon aug (extended blessing IV).<br />
