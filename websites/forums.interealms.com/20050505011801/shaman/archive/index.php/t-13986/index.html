<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Please settle a argument for me between me and a friend of mine.<br />
<br />
Would you rather have a SK/Pally tank cause of their superb aggro control.<br />
<br />
Or would you rather have a warrior cause he has Def Disc when things get a lil crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you are talking about &quot;tanking&quot; in an exp group and only that.. (not pulling or else) then, imho, either of the 3 can do the job:<br />
<br />
warriors for their ability to take hits and their disc.. (i always appreciate when a tank &quot;/shield&quot; me when i gain too much aggro)<br />
sk for their snare/fear/fd/lifetap...<br />
pallys for their LoH, group heal...<br />
<br />
if you include pulling..  I would choose first SK, then pally, then finaly warrior</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just straight up tanking. While i agree all 3 can do the job, if you had 3 tanks LFG in BoT would you want the Warrior LFG or the Pally/SK lfg<br />
<br />
Personaly my argument is that a SK and Pally have the instant aggro control and warriors have to build it up. Not saying a warrior sucks as a tank, but being able to gain aggro on demand is better for a fast pulling, fast moving experinece situation.<br />
<br />
Thats my side of it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree Lit, its nothing against warriors - I think SOE really needs to take a look at them and do some tweaking.  If my exp group has a war tank I know I'll be getting hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Moggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I would say pally for the crowd control help (root/stun, good agro maker aswell :D) and for the healing support and maybe their rez heritage ;) :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

But the warrior's extra toughness doesn't do a lick of good if things are beating on me instead of him.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until the fix warriors taunt ability the only warriors I'll invite to tank for my group will be guildies with CHSD or other agro weapons. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Pally no question, They have way more group utility over an SK and hold agro way better then a warrior.  LoH is always nice too when fighting named mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the way i like XP is fast as possible, witch means no down time between pulls, <br />
if the cleric has to spend all her mana on one pull = bad, <br />
lots of med time = bad, <br />
classes that cant do anything without mana = bad, (wiz. druid) <br />
slow pulls = bad<br />
<br />
so the way i like it is as fast as possible, LOTS of DPS, <br />
<br />
MT= Pally for chain stuns, helps TONs with healing. <br />
MA = monk of course, single pulling, DPS.<br />
DPS, Mage, rogue, <br />
shaman, for slows, buffs, rooting adds, and debuffs, <br />
cleric for heals, stuns, buffs. <br />
<br />
warriors as MT's imo suck, unless they have something like epic to help with holding aggro, the mobs are always running form cleric to shaman, and turning on the rogue or monk who then take clerics mana for heals. <br />
<br />
SKs also make better MT's they can heal themselves and nuke at the same time, <br />
it makes a HUGE difference in clerics mana. <br />
<br />
two other of the very fastest XP groups ive been in was an AOE gorup in seb, 4 wizards, warrior, and cleric, <br />
warrior pulled EVERYthing his HPs would allow, cleric started a CH as soon as he was in range, and the wizards All AOE'd the most ive seen go down was around 24 in one round of wizard nukes, <br />
there have been some goofy changes to the spells such as nova that were used, its almost impossible to do this now =*(<br />
<br />
the best fastest XP group ive been in was an all pet class gorup, <br />
4mages, on beast and a necro. <br />
we were in POinnovation, killing yard trast, things would go down faster than i could get my second nuke off, that was the fastest lvl ive ever done, <br />
<br />
but back to your question, Pallies and SKs make much better tanks imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For normal exp, it's a toss-up in my mind as to which is better, SK or pally. If I'm healing, I'd prefer the SK if he has some nice life tap action going on, otherwise, a pally is very nice to have as well, due to the stuns, etc. There are warriors out there who have little difficulty in taking/keeping aggro, but they're few and far between. I enjoy grouping with all three, but you do have to adjust your timing if a warrior who can't take aggro quickly is tanking (or accept taking a small beating ;) ).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 I don't know about perfect, it sounds unfair to me. I once played a warrior to 13 on sullon, but if someone had told me &quot;don't worry if you ever decide to raid after 40 more levels, and you're the only warrior, you'll be needed&quot; then I wouldn't have bothered ever creating him at all.<br />
<br />
 Boring to play + only desirable on raids = how can anyone stand being a warrior?</div></div><hr />

That is a very good point, but think about this, when your in that situation and your with a SK, he can lifetap to keep himself going and counter the damage taken quite well and if its a Pally it can negate it fully by chain stunning the mob. I can duo in BoT with a Pally, non stop pulling and moving quite efficiantly. Pally just chain stuns and i keep Q on him and KM when needed and we are good with me on my horse and c3 on both. I cant do that with a warrior and to be honest im not sure if i could with a lifetaping SK. Im thinking the SK might go OOM from LTing too much, i dunno, but then again i do know i can effectivly heal all by myself.<br />
<br />
But i digress, point was that with the tools a SK and Pally have, they can effectivly save that situation too.</div></div><hr />

I think its a good balance for all 3 main tank classes, lets them all be useful, not just a fill in for a real tank, like they used to be<br />
<br />
My preference is SK first, Warrior second, then Paladin.  SK for snares, Warrior for raw tanking abilites, Pally if no one else is available.  Pally's downtime healing is nice, but shouldn't be necessary w/ a shaman in the group (this is a shaman board after all).  Stoicism/Torpor can generally cure what ails the people in the group under most circumstances.  Pally stuns are nice against casters, but definitely not necessary the way snare is.<br />
<br />
I think that's the problem... they're not balanced.  A class which is only useful under certain circumstances is not balanced.  My guild (20ish on during evenings) has 2 members who play warriors (levels 50 &amp; 55) regularly.  The others (ranging from 55 to 65) have given up because (a) we're not a raiding guild and (b) getting into an xp group is maddening for them.  We have one 65 warrior who plays him when we need him to tank on raids, otherwise he's on his 60 shaman (*cheer*) or two-boxing them both.  But why spend so much damn time leveling and equiping a warrior only to let him gather dust waiting for the occasional raid?<br />
<br />
I think Verant screwed up big time by reducing the differential between warriors and hybrid tanks.  People will argue that with the best equipment there is still enough of a difference to matter, but 95% of the player base isn't wearing that equipment.  They've got cultural armor or something equivalent and, ignoring spell casting, the classes very much merge into one.  Add the spell casting abilities of Paladins and SKs and the warriors get left behind in a typical xp environment.  Warriors' disciplines help bridge the disparity, but a discipline which triggers every few minutes is not enough to bring parity to the field.<br />
<br />
It's a shame, but verant needs to do something to make up for warriors subpar taunting abilities: Change the stamina multiplier ratio for warriors to widen the HP gap between them and hybrids.  Bump the AC modifier on warriors.  Increase warrior damage mitigation/avoidance.  If they won't fix their taunting abilities, make them more attractive meatshields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My preference is SK. FD puller, snare, does a pretty good job of keeping himself healed if he has to and I love that 200hp/100 mana group heal that they get at 62. Better than KEI for a shaman and unlike a paladin with prexus, they seem to be able to keep casting it as soon as it cycles. <br />
  Honestly though, I don't think it's a big deal either way, if there's a warrior around I know I'll take a couple of hits on incoming after I slow. But if the mobs hit so hard that this would be a problem, it's probably a camp where you want a warrior anyway just for defensive and the extra durability. I do know a couple of people (enchanters slowing mainly) that just don't want a warrior as tank in an exp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Personally i perfer haveing a wa the group dont matter to me if they cant grab aggro instatently as i can take a good beating.. but (BoT speaking anyways)  when that named pops i like to be able realy on that /def.. cause generally less it's a pretty good pally or SK (gear wise)  BoT named cream em in my expierence.. <br />
<br />
if it was betwean a pally sk and war all 65 with da uba gear. i would prolly pick war but wouldent really care which one..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You should have made three options of pally, sk, and warrior.  Honestly, the warrior option never had a prayer and everyone knows it, but I would like to see which people prefer out of the knights.<br />
<br />
I prefer paladin, myself.<br />
<br />
First of all, they have rezz.  In a long exp session, usually at least 1 person dies.  It is almost unavoidable no matter how good you are.  If you've got a paladin, that means you dont have to have a cleric along for rezzes.<br />
<br />
Secondly, they get HB and symbol.  It isn't as good as virtue or other real cleric buffs, but it is good enough, imho.  Once again, the reduce the need for a cleric.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, they get nice heals.  They have an 1100pt single target heal (I think thats how big it is) and then of course, the 660-pt wave heal.  When the crap really hits the fan, they have, of course, lay on hands.  All of these heals have saved my life or my groups life at some point.<br />
<br />
Fourth, stuns kick ass.  Their highest stun is, I believe, 10 seconds.  When a mob gets pulled and I get a resisted slow, you can bet your ass that mob is getting stunned, giving me more than enough time to try again.  On top of the damage reduction caused by stuns, they are also ridiculous aggro, meaning that I can dot and nuke to my heart's content without getting aggro.<br />
<br />
Shadowknight's definately have their strong points, but I don't feel that they are anywhere near as good in the kind of groups that I make.  My groups are usually me and 5 melees.  Almost always, there is a ranger and monk in there somewhere, so the SK snare and fd is a moot point.  Since the paladin can rezz, we don't have to have a cleric, so we get maximum DPS + fun.  I have found that people play better when there is not a cleric around for a cushion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, with raid exp like it is, the warrior will be lvl 12 while the pally/sk is 65.  Yeah, that'll work out well.  I guess the warrior could solo to 65 though.  Oh, wait...   :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>uklugh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">From my experience paladins have the other two tank types beaten by quite abit. When im grouping i generally have a paladin tanking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warriors do great in the traditional warrior/cleric/enchanter group.  I don't feel its as strong as the paladin/shaman/bard combo, but those clerics and enchanters have to get their exp somewhere, and warriors get it in the same place.  On top of that, I am more than happy to group with my guildie warriors.  I want them to have max defensive AA's and im glad to help them get there.  Trust me, warriors are not lacking for exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have a 63 warrior to go with my 63 shaman.  I get 3 tells a day asking my shaman to group.  I once got asked if my warrior could tank to help get someone flagged for PoV. ;)  I personally think warriors are fine for exp groups, but it seems like lots don't, or can only get guild groups, like you mention.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Traditionally I want a good SK or an average pally.  However, if I had my way I would do the tanking (soon as I can get Q though that will change).<br />
<br />
I can torpor tank all day long in t3 zones (cept tactics, icky slow mitigation) and still dot / nuke.  CoD its a little harder as you cant use a horse.  Unfortunately very few tanks like to let the shaman get away with that :)<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a really good tank can allow a shaman to unload good sustained DPS if he's got the right spells, AA, horse and focus items.  Poison dots, pet, and chaining ice strike with canni4 gives some really nice dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">A warrior with a ton of AA and good agro weapons anyday</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A level 65 warrior with defensive AA pts walks all over a pally/SK any day.  You have ample time to heal them, if you are smart about aggro you never get touched.  With an SK/pally you have to slow right away because they are dieing fast, with a warrior you can let a couple of mobs beat on him, building up aggro and it is no big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Pally for instant aggro.<br />
<br />
I tend to take a warrior tho as he is a RL mate, although that choice has become a lot easier since he got his Blade of Carnage from AoW :)  Aggro isnt so much of a problem now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I've said this before....but if the warrior does not have at least a BoW...then I can be guaranteed to take a lot of dmg using a warrior as the MT.  Even with a BoW, I expect to take a little bit of dmg.  But, with a pally I have noticed that I can malo, slow and cripple and almost never take any agro, even if I chain it quickly.  This is noticed esp. in the elementals.  I will take a pally over a warrior any day up there.  A few weeks ago, we had a pally and a warrior in the group, and we let the warrior tank.  We were killing things fast yeah, but I was blowing alot of mana having to heal myself and holding off on cripple till the mob was at 70%.  However, when the warrior had to go afk for 5 min, we let the pally tank and I never got hit.  Needless to say, the warrior didn't even mind when she came back and let the pally tank the rest of the way.  Worked out a hell of a lot better for me<br />
<br />
And on another topic, Rangers with their Hunter title are GOLDEN in groups.  ****, my good RL friend plays a warrior in the same guild, and we let him be the puller sometimes.  In fact, I'd almost rather use him to pull than anyone else.  Being a pretty competent ranger helps it alot, but where he makes up for it is using Harmony.  So, not only does he almost always get single pulls, but when the mob gets back to camp, using his Earth Bow he is doing hella nice dmg and isn't even a threat to get hit at all and take riposte dmg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know it's been touched on already, but how in the hell do you think a warrior will get to 65 with the aa he needs to be that MT if he can't get a group to save his ass?<br />
<br />
Perfect?<br />
<br />
The reason I play a shaman today(well, the reason I play him so much) is because I got so sick of dealing with the complete parting out and dicking over of my warrior.<br />
<br />
Ps. By &quot;before&quot; I'm assuming you meant during kunark, because before kunark and not long into velious knights were ok. Luclin is where they surpassed warriors..and they're still headed that way.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I just classify them as heavy tanks. Each has advantages and disadvantages.<br />
<br />
Shadowknights, have self taps. Aggro out the wazzoo and  Snare and feign. A well played shadowknight is a force to behold.<br />
 <br />
Paladins have stuns stackable with shaman buffs, Nice emergancy heals. A get out of jail free card And a mini res. But they really don't do comparable damage to a sk or a Warrior when they are stunning. Cause casting stuns doesnt let them swing nearly as much.<br />
<br />
Warriors, are getting the short end of the stick. But They are tougher. Defensive is a lifesaver, and a warrior with a good 2 hander and Offensive AA is a friggen damage Machine. But you have to get alot of AA to really shine. <br />
<br />
Thing is when attacking from the front, all the tanks dont deal all that much damage, but only the warrior can swing through the monsters defensive abilities.<br />
<br />
They all have advantages and Disadvantages. But Take a 65 warrior with no aa, a 65 SK with no aa, and a 65 paladin with no aa. And there are no real differances. All are weak and strong in different areas.<br />
<br />
But take a warrior a SK and a paladin with 200 aa each. The Paladin doesnt really get better at tanking. Or dealing damage. (except Vrs undead)The SK gets a truckload of damage potential Through crits and such. But the warrior. The warrior just keeps getting better at tanking and damage. Every thing they get AA wise adds to every other thing.<br />
<br />
And they can add Defensive, evasive, and agressive to the mix and sheild.<br />
<br />

Just let me get my warrior buddy A couple hundread aa. (Laughs)<br />

A warrior with eb is just as good as a pally/sk though imho, and tbh, if I'm playing the shaman, I'd rather have a good warrior over a good paladin/sk.  As the cleric, I definately prefer the good paladin/sk over the good warrior though.  Although healing gimpy knights that that have like 4.5k hps buffed scares the hell out of me =)</div></div><hr />

Thing is. . . /agree with warrior taunt<br />
And you have to have the pp to equip that warrior and than be able to play him/her.  Not somethin' alot of warriors can do :(  I feel thier pain it must be real frustrating for them atm.<br />
<br />
plus i have an sk alt so i'm biased :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Rignack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Honestly a Warrior with the right weapons and AA is far better then a Pally or SK, but finding those warriors are few and far between. There are far too many melee tanks running around in crap gear and weapons because they PLed so easy.  If I don't know the Warrior and/or have never grouped with him/her I would would prefer an SK because not only do you have MT but you have a puller and snarer for the dreaded running mobs, but again they may have crap gear the cleric spends twice a much mana chain healing.  <br />
<br />
In the end it really doesn't matter because you take what you can get sometimes and sometimes you will take anything that claims to be a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not nearly as different as many seem to think, yes chain stunning does cripple paladin dps, but if your paladin partner is having to chain stun, you probably better of fighting something smaller.  Otherwise yes SK's do have a small advantage against live mobs through dots and taps, but Paladins counter that to some extent with Pious might.  Paladin/SK core Axps are VERY similar for the most part.  The only time they are substantially different is vs undead with an Su3 paladin, with a good weapon the paladin can put out utterly brutal dps although it can be a little sporadic.<br />
<br />
Generally though vs live mobs, SK = slightly more offensive offering useful debuffs and taps along with slightly better dps.  Paladin = slightly more defensive offering nice buffs, stuns and heals.<br />
<br />
Generally I tend to prefer paladins admittedly though, especially if I'm playing healer, fake aego and resses jic are very handy. =)</div></div><hr />

I gave up pickup groups 3 years ago.  Best decision I ever made.<br />
<br />
I think the 'taunt' ability needs to be changed from an instantaneous effect to something more akin to a DoT.  Instead of just bumping the warrior to the top of the hate list only to be bumped the next time the mob is hit, it needs to keep him there for a tick or two.<br />
<br />
I was duoing with my shaman and monk and ended up picked up a random warrior who had LFG on for 10 minutes in Velks out of pity.  Granted he was a level lower than me (52 v 53) but couldn't hold aggro unless I let him have it (as the monk).  I even waited until he'd knocked 10% off the mob before engaging, and still had aggro by the time it was down to 25% at the latest.  It didn't really matter as a trio though.  Shaman never had to cast a single combat heal spell the 90 minutes we grouped, only two stoicisms over the duration on the warrior and never on me.  <br />
<br />
But its a shame that a warrior can't hold aggro at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Tolby Da Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">SK all the way, then pally, then warrior.<br />
<br />
An SK should have no problem holding agro either on ubers or in exp groups.  A few clinging darkness ( 5 mana a pop), a few spears and maybe use Aystole or better and after that its jsut a matter of Casting Zeffers Bite. If the Sk has Emp Sword or better, (or hell, Blindfoe or epic) with Ferine avatar your looking at a good proc rate on his lifetap, not to mention his self buff procs. If mana is a problem he switchs to Mental Corruption for extra mana gain or goes into Lich Form and keeps on tanking.  The thing I hated about playing my Sk was decideing WHICH spells to use for agro, and which to ignore.<br />
<br />
While I realize its a raid situation, A SK friend of mine with Good luclin/lower end PoP gear tanked  Mith Marr from 90% on down after Warrior MT kept looseing agro.  His magelo while really nice, is not would you would expect for an Sk that did that.  I will admit though, he does have 200 AA,  all the defensive and damage dealing ones.  Hell I can't think of anything he hasn't tanked at one point or another for his guild.  For a while, they didn't even use a warrior at all to tank anything, it was just him.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">you 'let' your melee pull ??? /boggle<br />
<br />
Seriously though, in my XP groups, I pull, pally MT's.  If you send a monk out to pull, you lose DPS on the mob in camp.  SHM DPS is low at best, as we need time for DPS to hit.  Therefore, once first dot is cast on the mob in camp, you're free to run around and find another mob while puppy bites on the one in camp with the 4 DPS classes.  Pull with slow, even if it resists, you still have no agro once the pal / sk have their way with it, which leaves plenty of agro to land malos / slow.  Have successfully been single pulling tactics, valor, storms, BoT, whatnot and while 2boxing the groups enchanter, it's really nice for mez timing / tash timing.  <br />
<br />
Warriors are best suited, as stated above, for raid tanks, while pallies, and secondly, SK's are best suited for XP group tankage.  Their agro is unquestionable, as both of the knight classes can keep mobs off of me during 2 failed slows, and a malos.</div></div><hr />

But, if I have to go and pick one of three, SK is the way to go.  SK frees up the need for an FD puller, so no need to go find a monk to hunt somewhere.  There is a slot saved for your tank or pali ;)<br />
<br />
Pali's aint clerics and lets face it, until we get Q, we are not the best healers if we are trying to slow a bad/unlucky resistor and are getting beat on and pali's, unless they blow LoH cant heal fast enough to keep us alive.  Keep the cleric in grp if you can.<br />

1 SK<br />
1 Bard<br />

<br />
Really comes down to that for me.  I try not to be &quot;classist&quot; since every class has its advantages, and there are real people behind every toon.   It sucks to be left out because of your class.  I think a lot of shamans on this board have forgotten what that feels like.  <br />
<br />
I've been a shaman from way before shamans were remotely popular.  Back when I couldn't get a group unless I knew someone because shamans sucked so bad.  Back when I used to hopelessly envy druids because they could do so many more things than I could that had group relevance, plus quad for mad exp.  <br />
I've been a shaman when you absolutely had to have a cleric for sebilis.  And I took a druid instead.  I've been a shaman when being the only healer in Seb meant someone was probably gonna die cuz there was no way! LOL!  I've been a shaman at the height of our powers when killing a velious wimp dragon was an awe-inspiring feat that drew flocks of shaman twinks.  I've been a shaman when slows were largely unneeded due to insane velious armor and wimy-hitting kunark exp mobs.  <br />
I've been a shaman where I couldn't get a Howling Stones group for 3 months after getting my key, because a druid was always a better choice . . cuz nobody would go without a cleric, and druids had evac . . which was needed, and you needed a chanter, which left 3 slots for tank and 2 dps . . . so no shaman room!   <br />
<br />
I've been a shaman in every time of the game, and now that we are at our most desirable EVER, i see people being classist against a class that has taken as much abuse as any vital class can take and still have members.  Have a little consideration folks!  I know you don't remember when shamans sucked, but I do!  And I am telling you, just because we own now doesn't mean that we always will!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">But take a warrior a SK and a paladin with 200 aa each. The Paladin doesnt really get better at tanking. Or dealing damage. (except Vrs undead)The SK gets a truckload of damage potential Through crits and such. But the warrior. The warrior just keeps getting better at tanking and damage. Every thing they get AA wise adds to every other thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
ND, CA, CS, PE - all make any tank class better at their job.<br />
<br />
PD/LR - both make any tanking class better at their job<br />
<br />
After those, warriors probably focus on some damage-dealing AAs (assuming they have Area Taunt, which is their fist prority).  Sks will be focusing on their tap AAs and DT AAs, which will improve their overall damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins will probably focus on the 6 defensive AA skills mentioned above (ND/CA/CS/PE/LR/PD).  After hitting the basic deensive skills, they will have a lot of choices: add a little bit of DPS with Speed of the Knight and Knight's Advantage (both add moderate DPS), or they might go healing route: Healing Adept/Healing Gift/SCM), or go the Slay Undead route...or improved lay on Hands/Hand of Piety (mana free group heal).<br />
<br />
I think that the big advantages that paladins bring to the table are the stun as the mob is pulled into camp (establishing solid agro AND stunnig the mob for a few precious seconds while Mal/Slow land), the heals (both down-time and emerggency) and the ability to rally shine when the crapola hits the fan: root parking, spot healing, stunning and LoH.<br />
<br />
I played a SK to level 54 - the whole dark knight thing jsut didn't suit my style - although FD was a blast.<br />
<br />
I played a warrior to level 61.  I realized that I didn't have the versatility that I wanted, aI was having problems with agro in pop planes, and I felt like the class didn't allow me full use of my skills as a PLAYER - the class is jsut too restricted.<br />
<br />
So now I play a paladin, currently level 63.   Plain and simple: paladins rock.<br />

<br />
First i think alot if this is due to people not quite understanding Warrior Taunt and when and when not to cast. Agro control is every ones job and not just the warriors.  However there are lots of Warrior / Druids out there that desided they wanted to play a warrior cause they hated being a Drood.<br />
<br />
But this is just my opinon.<br />
<br />
 :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I can 2 box with my shammy and my level 65 warrior i have not had problems with agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense, but two boxing isn't grouping: when you 2-box with the warrior you damn well better be able to manage the agro - its trivial to do when you 2-box.<br />
<br />
The problem is that it takes the warrior more time to get agro than it does for a paladin or an SK.  In a 2-box situation that time isn't critical.  In a fast-pulling group situation that extra time causes two problems:<br />
<br />
1) the warrior is gettign the snot beat out of him by an unslowed MoB during that time: its a mana drain on the healer.<br />
<br />
2) those few seconds add up to a lot of time over the course of the group's time together, making the group less efficient at killing over time, and therefore less efficient at gaining exp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">The only time I will prefer a warrior over a knight is I know said warrior is very very good.

<br />
I couldn't disagree with ya more, it all depends on the equipment. It's very hard for me to peel aggro from the warriors in my guild.. on incomming I malos, then I slow immidiatly after that and I almost never get aggro... (I don't dot, I usually just keep FA up instead just for the attack if nothing else..). <br />
<br />
Sks take more damage than a paladin, paladins take more damage than warriors. A paladin can spot heal yas, a sk can snare dot.. in this sense paladins are superior because sometimes (just sometimes) you need to switch targets and that dotted mutha is going to hit something.. <br />
<br />
On a side note, ppl kept saying a certain monk in my guild was amazing.. then I grouped with him.. I was main healer and a pickup paladin in the group was tanking and somehow *grins* he died.. the monk said he would tank.. WOW, when the pally came back I asked him to let the monk continue to tank and he said &quot;He gets aggro from me most of the time anyway&quot;.. I used targs in HOH to heal the monk once in a while..<br />
<br />
2nd side note =] Always make sure the warrior in your guild has groups because he will tank 99% of the encounters out there and you want him with as many aa as you can get him =]</div></div><hr />
