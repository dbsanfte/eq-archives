<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Platos Outamana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello...<br />
<br />
I currently have a 61 Rogue (and I mean BARELY into 61) and a 46 shaman...<br />
<br />
I am working on leveling the shaman and I have been grouping the pair...<br />
<br />
I know @ L60, the rogue got a lot of AA exp in Katta...Now that he is 61 and grouped, he is getting just a sliver, as all the mobs are light-blue and green...<br />
<br />
I do not plan on leveling the rogue anymore until the shaman catches up (I have two spells waiting for me @ 60 =) ) and I was wondering if it would be worth de-leveling the rogue to 60 and getting some more AA since I will be killing those mobs anyway....All I would lose if I un-ding 61 is a PoP AA point with helps raise my dagger proc from 263 to 350...One death would take me back down...<br />
<br />
 My question is would the rogue take a larger chunk of the exp @ 60 than he is at 61 while grouped with the shaman?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your Help!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I remember correctly after the experience change to groups over a year (2 years?) ago, all group members now &quot;supposedly&quot; get the total exp pool divided up plus the group bonus.  Does it work like that now in the exp groups I've been in?  Not really, 65's and 64's are gettinga  full bub faster than I am at 63.  <br />
<br />
My recommendation is if you don't really care about losing the level and the mobs are light blue/green to you, go head and delevel.  After all, 2 or 3 mobs will get you back to 61.</div></div><hr />
