<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krizaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently got my Rune Crafter's Helm due to the generosity of a guildmate :) <br />
<br />
It does have a rather plain graphic on my Vah Shir, but I am wondering if that guy in Icewell Keep, Royal Armorer Slade, can make it fancier...<br />
<br />
TIA<br />

Just for fun, I clicked Search and entered custom AND helm in the search field and got 6 results including this one:<br />

Not, of course, that it would do any good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krizaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Gee, pardon me for coming to the boards to ask a question :(  I came here to post after doing a fairly extensive search of the EQ websites, unable to find that information...<br />
<br />
Out of the thousands of posts there were 6 responses- it's not as if I'm asking something that is really obvious...<br />
<br />
I find the curt response really discouraging, and I dislike the attitude that I am somehow wasting your valuable time and bandwidth when a little courtesy and benefit of the doubt would go a long way towards encouraging me to become someone who may well contribute down the road...<br />
<br />
Unfortunately I'm finding this attitude beginning to prevail on a lot of the boards, which is a shame...<br />
<br />
BTW, I am one of the women who play EQ- admittedly in a minority in the EQ demographics, but we do exist :) <br />

This is a frickin' message board, ask away Krizaani.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is pretty funny, I've been playing for 3 years and no one has ever questioned my gender! Generally, the constantly being lost and obsessive concern with fashion tips people off.   I find it more amusing than anything else.  I did meet both Ooga (although he was pretty darned drunk) and Tanuden at the Seattle Fan Faire, so hopefully they will vouch my gender,  I mean, I have so much to gain by POSING as a woman on a message board!<br />
<br />
I guess you must have had a lot of prior mangina experience to be so paranoid.  Poor baby, did some pretty little wood elf try to slip you the sausage?</div></div><hr />
