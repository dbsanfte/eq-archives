<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What does it mean??<br />
<br />
I was in a large lab room with many dark lab benches, and as a med student (by the way, I'm not a med student yet), I had to go get a dolphin (living) and come back and examine it.  Of course, it didn't move at all even though it was alive.  I started examining its small eyes, and I tried opening its tiny eyelids with my fingers (I don't think dolphins even have eyelids-- I think I got the eyes that I saw from the piglet I dissected several months ago-- strange that it would pop up in my dreams now).  Then I noticed a larger slit and tried to open that and realized I was pushing off its head, so I put it back on.  The person next to me was examining a dolphin and it was talking to her in plain english.  I wondered why mine didn't.  I knew I was supposed to be able to examine this dolphin fully, but I was not prepared.  Then the professor came and I realized that it was the first day and we were not supposed to be looking at the dolphins by ourselves.  The person next to me was going to be my lab partner, and I was unhappy, because I wanted to be partners with my old bio lab partner and she was not there.  It was strange because I thought bio lab was over and we had orgo lab next semester (premed classes)... where'd this new lab come from??<br />
<br />
In the same night, I had a dream about being a shaman, and how I had this useless spell in my spellbook that I never used.  Then I had a &quot;lightbulb&quot; moment, and realized, hey-- what a great spell... group quiescence for only 40 mana more-- I should keep this memmed all the time!  But then I realized that I had no more spell slots.  I figured then that I should just unmem my fire damage shield (because obviously all shamans have the fire damage shield spell) and replace it with group quiescence.  I tried casting it-- it was lightning fast!  And the three people in my group who were at 98% health jumped straight to full health after one tick.  I was very happy.  I decided to change the color of this icon to white so that I would not confuse it with my single target quiescence spell.  I was considering possibly using group Quiescence instead of Quiescence from now on but wondered if the extra 40 mana would be problematic.  Others mentioned that they used group Quiescence in LDoN and normal Quiescence elsewhere.<br />
<br />
What a very weird dream night.<br />
<br />
I woke up thinking about DAoC midgard shamans and Frigging (their version of celestial elixir).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First, the dolphin dream. Examining your sexuality perhaps, envious of others sexuality, and wishing you were examining it with your old lab partner?<br />
<br />
Second, the group Q, omg dream on, they give us something to make us even better healers?  if so rare as heck and all that, casual players can't be healers and shamans you know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">FIrst dream :  It means stop eating food before bed.  <br />
<br />
Second dream:  It was just that, a dream.  <br />
<br />
Cynicism is fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it's all the turkey/leftover turkey from Thanksgiving.  I had 2 wierd ones last week, and I very rarely remember any of my dreams (these are the first 2 in about 6 months).<br />
<br />
First I was bowling, but I wasn't using a bowling ball, I was using giant french fries (don't even ask how I managed that).  It didn't seem to be improving my game at all though.<br />
<br />
Then 2 days later I had another one where I was back home, and there was a room full of water and a killer whale in it (think Shamu), but just a sliding glass door to keep it in.  I went to tell someone he was going to bust through, then noticed there was no ceiling.  He leaped right out of the water room and onto the floor of the room I was sitting in at the time.  I looked down (I don't know why I was higher up than it), and he landed in between Jabba the Hutt and another Star Wars character that I couldn't remember/recognize, and they all 3 began to have a conversation (but not in English).</div></div><hr />

Tryplathene? There is some weird chemical in turkey that is supposed to make you drowsy, something with a T, who knows, maybe it promotes dreaming too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, I'll tell you one of mine. It came to me after about my first month of EQ. <br />
I was on a quest. I had to bed six different women in 6 six different positions. My dream didn't actually start until the 4th woman.  My girlfriend at the time was number 5. Then I woke up. Perhaps because I didn't want to explain to anyone who number six was. Most of all to my gf. <br />
<br />
I do remember the battle music playing the entire time, tho...  Sure wish I'd finished it and gotten whatever that uber reward was....<br />
<br />
My friend said I was lucky. All he dreamed about was Unrest for months.  He never told me if he got erotic with the Hags...</div></div><hr />

Tryptophan (L-trypto) - what makes Turkey the win.</div></div><hr />

Supposedly Tryptophan is a precursor for serotonin, which is good for sleep and helping anxiety.  But it should not make you drowsy unless you have an empty stomach, and that is not the case on Thanksgiving.<br />

It's more likely due to the combination of drinking alcohol and overeating - not just turkey, but also mashed potatoes, ham, creamed onions, cranberries, sweet potatoes, peas, stuffing (or dressing, if you prefer), carrots, bread, pies, and whipped cream - all of which have the effect of puling the blood away from your brain to help your digestive tract do it's work, and the sugar/insulin effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
That made me hungry. =(<br />
<br />
<br />
My 'weird' dream: Dreamt this AM that I was at some company function sitting next to a woman I chased after years ago talking about the office situation, she went on and on about how bad hers was until I told her mine, at which point she quieted down about her situation.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">tryptophan is an amino acid that the body turns into seretonin as was said. seretonin is a nerotransmitter that gets secreted when we reach the deeper levels of sleep right before and during rem sleep that helps promote a re****l sleep among other things.the article you  presented is right and wrong. with most people they will be drowsy because they gorge on carbs and sugars during turkey day. but if you eat enough turkey, which is VERY high in tryptophan, you WIll feel sleepy after your body starts to break it down into seretonin. on the flipside you should get a real good sleep :)<br />
FYI, the outbreak of eosinophilic-myalgia happened only within people who used tryptophan from Showa Denko KK, and was the only time it happened. Figures the fda would take a very effective sleep aid with alot of other uses, off the market. Just another way to keep people dependant on drug companies imo<br />

sorry for da rant :)</div></div><hr />
