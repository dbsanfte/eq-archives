<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Knowing SOE they probably just made halflings do backflips when they cast now too, or something  :p  but ok - anyone seen the new animations yet? Thoughts / comments?<br />
<br />
Just wondering - I'm hoping they get around to fixing the 2hb animation and the frozen in place sitting thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They are working on the animations?  <br />
<br />
Please please please get rid of that lameass kneeling pose.  That looks completely stupid.  <br />
<br />
Maybe one day we'll be able to /sit in chairs and thrones and actually look like we are sitting.<br />
<br />
Fixing the Luclin graphics would be really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeha, was wondering if anyone had seen them yet. Here's the official word...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That kneeling pose is the reason I keep as many female graphics turn off as I can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the female kneel and lean to the side looks very nice for the ugly iksar lady.  It makes them look...well female.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My character on test is a Gnome. I see NO difference. Haven't tested barbarian, but I assume their females still riverdance their way through zones... nothing moves above the knee =)</div></div><hr />

That has got to be one of the funniest things i have read on the crucible :D<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If they chnage nothing else - please don't make me keep sitting like a girl ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">While they're at it I REALLY hope they fix the F'ing Drogmor animations.  EverRodeo sucks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Bear animation is of course, an item of great interest for me.  I'm one that likes having no sitting animation, so I hope that they don't change that.  I know, at least half of y'all out there wish they WOULD change that for bears, but I don't want to do that sitting on my butt, footpads facing forward type pose.  I am NOT a Panda!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They changed the turning and running animations.  Went live this morning.  Basically, the animations are just more fluid right now.  Nothing earth-shattering, but definitely an improvement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">What about the hunch back neck duck squat movement when chars are pivoting, especially with Wood Elves?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Jumped on my Bst on test last night   and thought i noticed something different there.    so yes Buz, I am pretty sure they did change that.<br />
Looks nice too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Barbarian Women are now POWER WALKERS (run animation is just a fast &quot;walk&quot;). &quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's live now, I like the running look, but it seems to me that the bear running is a little choppier than before (that's fine, the only time I watch myself is when I swim, which is STILL my favorite animation)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">iksars look gay now =( arms all stiff and noses up in the air. ARGH!</div></div><hr />

If the feathered Boa fits, wear it, Baby!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>lenardo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">heh from monkly busines :P thanks<br />
<br />
well they fixed the power walking barbarian women- they now RUN. hope they have a good support bra....., and the iksar run is back the way it was</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">yep, great, my iksar runs with her nose in the air and prances along on tip toes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Iksar &gt; ALL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Never understood why they call turtles Iskars.  A mystery indeed.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My beard/moustache floats about 6 inches in front of my face when I walk or run.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">frogs &gt; all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I hope they put the iksar animation back to how it was. My back looked hurt ( but i also ran in big dramatic yet slow motion pumps of the arms. <br />
   My woodelf ranger seems to need to find a restroom =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Other than looking like I'm chasing my beard while cutting myself in half with my own shield, it ain't too bad....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">What a horrible job! I'm usually the first person to defend SoE when they do good, but this was a major abortion. My beard floats off my face in front of me when I walk or run! Looks like a friggin' jawbone floating in front of me. C'mon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Cortez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The new running graphics are horrible in my opinion...my Barbarian runs like he has a bad case of jock rash and my Human toons look almost as bad. Certainly hope they change this - sent in my feedback tonight...doubt if it'll help but did it anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Did they even look at these before they went live? I didn't think it was possible, but these are even worse than they were before. I look like a complete and utter dork when I run. And when I turn, it looks like I'm hovering on the spot and rotating.<br />
<br />
What a steaming pile of feces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">The new animations are so bad, I could swear they are taunting us.  &quot;Look at the garbage we can spew and you will still play, nah nah!&quot;<br />
<br />
I now chase my floating beard around in a manner that is reminiscent of being kicked in the balls while at the same time being disemboweled by my shield.  Bravo SoE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Villianna Skye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I sent in feedbags,  bug reports, and petitions.  This is horrible!  When I first saw myself run/walk I immediatly went back to my old room in Halas and meditated for hours upon end.  I was too ashamed to come out.  I look butch.  I want my estrogen back.  I have a hunchback,  bowed legs, and this is worse than I ever imagined.  The robe classes have a bad case of there robes running when they are standing still or their staffs holding the front of their robes up.  You all aready mentioned the beards.   OMG,  have you seen the ogres?  They run like the hulk.  I find that part entertaining though.  <br />
<br />
Oh please,  Oh please,  give me my riverdance back!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I think this is the first feedback I have sent in.  Not only is my barbie power walking, she seems to have an accute back problem... Didn't came of my horse all night yesterday  <br />
If these animations remain I will be obliged to buy a horsie for my drood hobbit too as she seems to be getting ready for some ice skating contest without skates on  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">These are the times, when i am happy, i didn't activate new models ever, other than checking them briefly.<br />
<br />
Sure the old ones are a bit lame here and there, but you get used to it.<br />
<br />
After lurking several boards here are some random quotes (for fun):<br />
- &quot;My toon looks like Quasimodo&quot;<br />
- &quot;Looks like i got a staff sticking in my rear&quot;<br />
- &quot;Ogres look like they crapped their pants&quot;<br />
- &quot;Male casters got sliced robes at the sides&quot; (as if wearing a dress wouldn't be enough ...)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
The only more positive remark, i found:<br />
- &quot;Hm, there are 2 models, that seem quite OK ...&quot; (wow, the excitement).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I dont have any new models on either, Sharok, except for my shaman because of my horse. I cant use horse with old models.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Patch today fixes them with appropriate &quot;Woops&quot; message.  Apparently they loaded wrong files into the patcher for live servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">One shudders to think what they were doing with those &quot;wrong&quot; files they loaded in.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hey, I know, let's make his beard a pet!&quot;</div></div><hr />
