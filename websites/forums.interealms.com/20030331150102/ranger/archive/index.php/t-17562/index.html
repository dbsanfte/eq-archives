<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to Paldaan i decided to raid kael with guild. I have been researching some of the nice mobs to kill here. There are many but i am not sure what we can handel The Statue of Rallos Zek says hits for 1100 is this true? What other mobs could my guild handel www.raidersofvirtue.com The levels of most players are not upto date now but most are 50ish+ Main tank is 60 with 29 AA but mostly in offensive. Also a pretty low ac for what he should have. Can anyone tell me how hard the mobs we would want to kill in your eyes hit for and anything else needed to know.  <br />
<br />
Really appricate this thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you're unsure of what you can do, then just start in this progression:<br />
<br />
 - Move to one of the ramps up to arena<br />
 - Move into an arena corner and pull the various giants out there.  The harder ones are Veterans, Adjutants, and Senior Guards<br />
 - If those are easy, then try pulling Protectors of Zek (PoZ) and Kallis Stormcaller.  You can probably get these single.  If they're easy, then move on to...<br />
 - The mobs behind the door opposite Kallis and the PoZ.  These are trickier to pull, but Gladiators drop some nice stuff.<br />
 - Pull Guardians of Zek.  This will probably require your WAR to go /disc defensive, and you'll need some good damage output from the rest of your raid party.  Guardians tend to have the best armor drops (have seen 2 BP's drop off one guardian before).<br />
 - If these all seem easy, then you could try Vindi, but he's nasty.  My guild beat him with about 50+ level 55+, but you need good tactics and a good complete heal chain.<br />
 - If you can kill Vindi, then you can kill Statue of Rallos Zek since he hits about the same but can be slowed.<br />
 - After that you can try Avatar of War, but he's pretty nasty<br />
<br />
That's the progression I'd see in Kael.  Not knowing your guild you'll probably be able to pull Protectors of Zek and Kallis.  Guardians of Zek are probably too much for you right now, but having a 60 WAR helps a lot.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Luve</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You have to kill Idol before AoW. He's a slowable version of AoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well we did arena and a few protectos and killed them all i geuss vindi is next once we have  a better tank</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did you kill Guardians of Zek?  Or just protectors?  If you have any problems with Guardians, then you're not ready for Vindi.<br />
<br />
You need a good strategy for Vindi until you figure him out.  He rampages, so you need to get your aggro set up right.  He also has a pair of Temple Guardians linked to him, so you either need to deal with them, off tank them, or it might be possible to pull him solo without them, but I don't know the techniques.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Woodrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think Vindi is a bit beyond you atm.  It'll come with time and a few more levels though.<br />
<br />
Once you have tried Kallis and the protectors move on to the other named in the same area. Once you can handle them (and possibly multiple of them in the camp at once) its time to think about taking a break from Kael and start trying ToV. Your guild will probably be ready to try ToV once you get enough level 55+ characters to form a solid raid force.  By that point I would imagine that most of your guild will be equipped in Thurg armour or better. When you feel comfortable with ToV mobs and most of your guild have a reasonable amount of ToV armour then come back and try Vindi/Statue etc.<br />
<br />
Vindi is significantly tougher than the other arena mobs. As a rough measure for you, Wind of Tranquility had around 30 60+ players on our first Vindi kill.<br />
<br />
From having seen you guys in Kael a few weeks back, I would guess you are capable of handling the nameds in the arena but will need a few more levels and some more armour drops before you try ToV or Vindi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok well thanks for all info is there also any other places we can raid want to change this sats raid from kael lol but go back afterwards. Especialy since arena is taken a lot. Was thinking for a nice end mob which isnt that hard to get too but when we get there is doable by us<br />
<br />
thanks for so much help here guys</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Paldaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Spirit of Radir in UP is a pretty good one.  Or possibly a Kunark dragon.  The trick is finding a mob up to go after, though I think Radir in UP is on like an 8 hour spawn time, so he's up quite a bit.  Just getting to UP can be a challenge for some guilds *chuckle*<br />
<br />
You can always go back to the old reliable Hate/Fear raids.  Or you can try Chardok to try and eventually get epics for your clerics.   It takes a while to figure out that zone, and a lot of 55+ guilds spend some time there to do King/Queen/Prince for epics.  Nice stuff can also drop off of random mobs (of course, it was nice stuff a year ago.  Things can change quickly in EQ).  In fact, epic zones like CoM, The Hole, and Chardok are usually pretty popular for the lvl 55 range to pursue epics.  You might have an epic thread of what people need and that will probably help point you towards zones to raid.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Noron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the idea of UP and a kunark dragon. Where could i find info on ways to kill these. Also what is easyest kunark dragon? and what drops from the UP mob?<br />
<br />
We are doing Kael again this weekend so hope some nice chain drops:) Only plate has so far. We have a lot more clerics this time so we will try and get a named or 2. <br />

thanks</div></div><hr />
