<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Regnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi there, fellow Shaman. I have just re-activated my EQ account after letting it lapse for LONG time (just before Kunark). Well, I have all of the expansions now and picked up a copy of EQ Gold for my wife and the two of us are playing once again. She's a Barb Warrior and I'm a Barb Shaman (of course)! We're playing on Firiona Vie, roleplaying and having a great time at level 6 with our two characters (Summerbreeze and Winterfury).<br />
<br />
My old toons on my re-activated account somehow survived and I found that I'd left a level 21 Barb Shaman that is still around, on E'ci. So I've been playing that one for kicks, sort of previewing the way for Winterfury. <br />
<br />
I see plenty of posts regarding high level quests for 50+. Can anyone provide some good advice on quests for lower levels, like under 10 (for Summerbreeze and Winterfury)? Summerbreeze is a level 6 Warrior and Winterfury a level 6 Shaman. We are dead broke and trying to eke out a living, nice equipment gained from a quest would be very handy. Same request for Vexorus, level 26 Barb Shaman on E'ci.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance, it's a bit bewildering starting all over again, but we're having a blast exploring. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">search allakazams or eqshaman.com for quests. but i know there is one turning in wooly spider wool for cash.also one for bear cub pelts that nets you a little cash and some patchwork or rawhide armor. once you go to BB you can turn the fangs in to the priest in qeynos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Gnoll pelts... wooly spiders... bear pelts... mammoth tusks... Vengefuls... the bones quest in the river... there are some pretty good low-level quests in Everfrost/Halas, just go to Allakhazam in the &quot;Quests by zone&quot; section and read up on the two zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Regnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok, sounds like this Allakhazams site is worth visiting. Wasn't aware of the site, but will make my way there.<br />
<br />
I stumbled onto the bear pelt quest from Cindl the Tailor and although the polar bears are green to us, I note that turning in the pelts yields incredible experience, a gold piece and a piece of Patchwork armor. We are going to explore more of this type of quest, thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the full alla's site is:<br />
<br />
http://www.everquest.allakhazam.com<br />
<br />
And yes, search for quests by Zone :)<br />
<br />
Tis worth paying for a membership to this site for the extra features you get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok, so you have all the quests from Allakhazams, but here are some quest tips dredged from way deep in the memory banks:<br />
<br />
1. Do the initiate symbol of the tribunal quest - it involves heading to the bank in S Qeynos and back, but it is quite an adventure running thru Blackburrow at level 6. Assuming you are untwinked, the necklace is a good newbie piece, and the hammer it summons will allow you to start killing willowisps in Qeynos Hills soon.<br />
<br />
2. Once you hit about level 8 or 9, the 2 of you should be able to kill the rabid bears and wolves in Qeynos Hills. Take the rabid pelts to the cleric guild in N Qeynos (the thing that looks like a flying saucer) and hand em to the lady in leather gear (cant remember her name) for great exp, gold and faction, and a spell if i recall.<br />
<br />
3. Blackburrow will become a good hunting ground for you. Keep the gnoll teetha nd hand them in to the guard on the balcony in the arena in S Qeynos -he will give good exp, faction and moonstones. Take the moonstones to the pub near the docks in S Qeynos and give them to the barman in the back room - he will give you beer and exp. you can sell the beer or drink it! N.B. You can also hand the gnoll teeth to the lady in the Warrior guild (Margyn?), but the rewards, IMO are not as good as in Qeynos<br />
<br />
4. In Blackburrow keep the scraps of gnoll fur that drop like confetti and combine them 4 at a time in a sewing kit. Once you combine 4 you will get a gnoll fur patch - combine 4 of them and you will get a gnoll fur bundle, combine 4 of them and you get a nice newbie cloak. In fact, the cloak stats are only good if you are a true newbie, but it is a good way of getting your tailoring skill up - from memory, I was at skill 30 or so by the time i completed the cloak, and it did not cost me a cent<br />
<br />
5. Have a chat with the brother and sister who sit next to the entrance to surefall glade (names Miller I think), they can make you newbie armor such as boot, belt, cloak.<br />
<br />
6. When going to Qeynos, always deliver mail to the bard guild. The guy in the bank in Halas will give you mail to take to qeynos - it gets you gold and exp and faction. Also, always kill a few snakes in the area out front of qeynos - keep the snake skins in the bank cos you use them as a component in your AC buff spell that you get at 9 or 14, cant recall exactly<br />
<br />
7. Dont bother camping for the caster beads - I camped the goblin camp for hours and hours and never got the beads heh heh, only the broken ones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Regnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah, I did know about any of these quests, thanks! Summerbreeze and I are now level 11 (yes, I know, slow progress, but we are having a great time exploring and hunting in new places we've never seen before). We are playing on Firiona Vie in order to roleplay and to strictly adhere to non-twinked, earn-as-we-go rewards. I relish every new scrap of armor or weapon that we find!<br />
<br />
I will give these a try. Many thanks, and let me know if you know of any others that may be appropriate as we level. We signed up for Allakhazam too, btw.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No need to hurry with the levelling - smell tehm roses bro. <br />
<br />
You should now be able to kill will-o-wisps. They give good exp at your level, and also drop either a &quot;burnt out lightstone&quot; (destroy it), a &quot;lightstone&quot; (sell it to vendor) or a greater lightstone (keep it). When you have a few greater lightstones, head to the gypsy camp at the crossroads in North Karana. One of the gypst women, if hailed, talks about a &quot;concordance of research&quot;. Give her a Greater lightstone and she will give you the concordance, and some exp. The concordance sells to vendors for about 9 plat, which is good loot for a lowbie.<br />
<br />
Also, kill Bandits in the Karanas, and collect their sashes. The sashes can be handed in to a NPC in S Qeynos for exp and armor/weapons. The NPC is, from memory, located round the back of the arena, and is outside, not in a building, and has a barrow, but thats all I can recall.<br />
<br />
Once you both reach about level 19, you will be able to commence the easier Totemic Armor quests. Totemic armor has been superceded by better / cheaper / easier to get armor these days, and you can buy Totemic in the Bazaar for lest than the cost to get, but if you are on a RP type server, you may wish to undertake the Totemic quests as a &quot;rites of passage&quot; thing. The quest givers for the quests are in Lake Rathe - 2 barbarians in the village half way down the  West side will tell you about the quests. The ogres near the Rathe mountain zone will adjust your dufrenite, as required. From memory, bracer and gloves are the easiest pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One tip if you do the concordance of research quest,  the concordance is a container so make sure you have a main inventory slot open before you hand in the lightstone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Regnor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks for the tips, friends. Summerbreeze and I hit our 13th season tonight and have discovered a profitable business that has kept us in platinum. We hunt cats and bears in West Karanas and load up on pelts and then park our characters in the Bazaar overnight. I put up 11 HQ Cat pelts and asked 5pp for them (1 under the going rate). We also sold 2 MQ Bear for 10pp. Next morning we woke up with 65pp, which of course made us deliriously giddy. New weapons for Summerbreeze and I so that we can rotate our skills and keep them fresh.<br />
<br />
With our new magical weapons we traveled out to an island in Erud's Crossing that is teeming with Wisps. Many Burnt Out Lightstones later we were both equipped with Greaters and headed to Paludal Caverns where we helped the locals whittle down the mushroom and Fiend population. Exciting and dangerous. Although we did taste defeat a few times, ultimately we emerged victorious and well experienced.<br />
<br />
Several of the quests we have attempted were broken or simply not active. We traveled out to Lavastorm (what an exciting run through Nektulous Forest!), only to find that the Dwarf we were seeking at the Gypsy camp was nowhere to be found. Also, we managed to kill Trumpy Irontoe in S Qeynos but when we turned in his head to Byzar Bloodforge, we got nothing but wisecracks in return. It's a bit discouraging, but we will keep trying. We are having a great time pursuing them, if not succeeding with them.<br />
<br />
I will begin working on the Totemic quests. I am a Shaman and this is my destiny. Summerbreeze also needs to start working on armor quests for her Warrior. We are both wearing Patchwork and Tattered, so anything will be a significant improvement.<br />
<br />
Thanks again, I will continue to check in here for any further suggestions or details. Until then, a salute from the battlefield...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The bloodforge hammer quest is probably not broken. I had a similar problem when I first attempted it. The problem was simply lack of faction.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall there is a mini-quest in Kaladim where you can hand in some sort of belts that are dropped by Deathfist orcs, to raise various Kaladim faction. I laid waste to a few dozen orcs and handed in a dozen or so belts and then the quest guy for Tumpy's head was quite chatty to me and gave me the hammer</div></div><hr />
