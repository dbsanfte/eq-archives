<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When is the best time to solo for AA points.<br />
I am 53 with 99% of the level completed - and hunting successfully on the Seafuries, I can stay here on 100% AA or Ding for 54 and they mostly become light blue. Should I stay or move on.<br />
Am I right in believing that a higher blue mob will give quicker AA exp - or equal in the sense of time to kill V exp given would be the same work load.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Firstly, levels to 60 &gt; AA points<br />
<br />
Secondly, The amount of AA EXP required to make any level is the same as regular exp at level 51.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, lighter blue mobs give less aggrigate EXP than dark blue or white ones<br />
<br />
and finally, different zones give different percentage of EXP to AA EXP.  Therefore, if you are in a high AA EXP percentage zone and have your AA EXP off, then you're not making the EXP you could in a low AA EXP zone.  If you have 30% AA EXP on and are in a zone that gives 60% regular EXP, then the EXP you will get in regular equals 70% of 60% of the mob's total for your level and your AA EXP equals 30% of 40% of the mob's total for your level.  Yes, it's very complex.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is you should find zones that give you high AA EXP and has mobs you can handle, if you want AA levels.  Otherwise, find high regular EXP zones.</div></div><hr />

I almost fell off my chair when I read this... Is this true? I had never considered this. I  thought the zone exp modifier was tied to both normal and AA exp?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huh? That is not true at all. Zones have an Experience Modifier value, which affects experienced gained per mob. Whether you are putting your exp into AA or normal experience makes no difference. Zones such as PoP zones have an exp modifier of 145; normal old-world zones have modifiers of 75, and some zones such as The Hole have modifiers of 85.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ignoring the red herring for a moment, I wanted to add, that at level 53 there are few useful aa anyways.  Would be nicer if you could spend the aa as you earned them, so I think it would be better if you got 55 first, then farmed aa, because then you can get a lot of the more useful ones.  You have to fight things that are closer to your level though.  Fighting things that are one level from light blue isn't maximizing the exp/time ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, there are different modifiers.  Such as the Hole.  This adds to the regular EXP, but not AA EXP.  You'll find that there are zones that AA EXP crawls and others that it flies.  FG is one of those places where if you don't have AA EXP on, you're wasting your time.  Regular EXP isn't good there, but AA is really nice.  You'll learn as you go, which zones to concentrate on, for which kind of EXP.  BTW, The Hole isn't good for AA EXP...<br />
<br />
On the other side of this, let me reiterate....  regular EXP &gt; AA as long as you're below 60.  You gain so much in the 50's, that what you add in AA doesn't give you that much functionality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Where did you get this idea from Finaljustice?  Not saying youre wrong (tho I think you are), just I always understood it as Ripper posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are interested in doing some aa at 53 then I would try HHK.  53 is a great level for grinding aaxp in HHK and the experiance in HHK is much better then OoT.<br />
<br />
A lot of people will tell you to level first and aaxp down the road, but if you mostly solo and your gear is in bad shape, then it might be prudent to spend some time both imporiving your grear and grinding aaxp.  What is best for you will depend to a very large extend on your personal situation.<br />
<br />
If you have a group of friends that you group with all the time (at least 60 or 70% of your play time) then it might be a good idea to level up and get flagged for tier 2 planes.<br />
<br />
If you mostly solo and you grear is not great, you could very well do just as well grinding out a bunch of exp in HHK while you farm for better equipment.<br />
<br />
At 60 with torpor / malo / and 67 aaxp ( no epic ) I don't get aaxp any faster now then I did at 53 in HHK with zip for aa and junk on my big ogre body.<br />
<br />
The only place that I found that this holds true is for HHK where the experiance is just incredible for the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's what I've observed from 125+ AA levels.  It's pretty easy to go to a zone with a partner and watch how much your AA EXP raises, then go to another zone and see what happens there.  The percentage is regardless of the mob level, so a lower level mob gives less exp in both sides, but in the same ratio as a higher level mob does.<br />
<br />
One mistake some people made is the level 51 amount of EXP to get an AA level.  This doesn't mean that you get AA EXP as a level 51 shammy, no matter what regular level you are.  It simply means that the amount of EXP to get each AA level is constant, and is equal to the amount of regular EXP it took you to go from 51 to 52.<br />
<br />
And heck, don't believe me, go check it out yourself.  Empirical evidence &gt;&gt;&gt; forum claims.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hummm ...  Don't know what mistake you are saying peeps have made.  I think it is a commonly accepted fact that the amount of EXP to get each AA point is a constant.  <br />
<br />
And actually, I believe your statement that the amount of EXP per AA is the amount it took to level from 51 to 52 is incorrect as I believe racial penalties do not apply to AA.<br />
<br />
Anyway based on my experiences, this is my understanding of how EXP works. Feel free to correct me as something as basic as EXP should be understood by all ...   <br />
<br />
Based on the Zone Experience Modifier, the same level mobs in different zones can give different amounts of EXP points when they are killed.  But based on the level &amp; type of mob and the ZEM, killing that mob will reward a fixed amount of base EXP points.  <br />
<br />
Depending on the number of members in the group, group bonus EXP points are added.  Charmed pet and pet penalties are deducted. The total number of awardable EXP points resulting from the mob kill are then split by group members in proportion to level of the members.  Higher level players get more EXP points assigned than lower level group members. <br />
<br />
Level bonuses, if any, are then applied to the EXP points assigned to each player resulting in net EXP points that a group member gets for the kill. <br />
<br />
At this point it doesn't really matter how you choose to assign that EXP between regular exp and AAexp accept that the portion that is assigned to regular EXP is adjusted by a racial penaty, if applicable.  The portion that goes to AA does not get a racial penalty.<br />
<br />
It is my belief that a statment like &quot;different zones give different percentage of EXP to AA EXP&quot; and the confusing discussion that follwed it is like saying that the sun doesn't shine as bright when I have my sun glasses on.  Indeed the sun is just as bright whether I have my sun glasses on or off, but my perception of how bright it is changes.  That percention can lead to misinterpretation.<br />

<br />
I think your just seeing something that isnt there.  If you dont believe me go read the old EXP threads at SEQ where they figure out the various ZEM and xp per mob.  That is the difference your seeing.  Besides from what you have said it appears you havent done any sort of scientific data collection on this subject just what you have &quot;noticed.&quot;  There are too many variables I can see that would lead me not to agree with you.  I think it was ol Ben Kenobi that said &quot;Your eyes can decieve you... dont trust them.&quot;<br />
<br />
As for the original poster.  It is generally given advice that you should blow through to 60 as you can thus go for the BigCan.  I wouldnt have agreed with this in the past unless you had torpor in the bank, because it is such a rare and expensive spell, but today we have the CH line that can be used with it with caution.  I would say if you do anything you can do your first rank (run3/regen3) at 53 in HHK but after that blow through to 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rgol The Greatspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have noticed by testing in a duo group of 60/60 ranger/shaman that i tend to get lesss exp then him. So I would be guessing that it was because of my race penality.</div></div><hr />

Been to many years since I was last there but I swear it was a Lvl 30 zone.  Sorry for my ignorance<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First issue, the mistake.  Months back, people were thinking that they'd get AA EXP as if they were level 51 to the mob.  Each level of AA is the same EXP requirements as regular EXP level 51 for a race with no penalties.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the only true empirical evidence of this effect would be to have ShowEQ running, snooping your segment while you played.  All I know is, that if you fight FG, it's really poor regular EXP and good AA EXP (up to level 60).  Other zones are opposite, such as Sebilis, which is poor regular EXP and REALLY bad AA EXP. <br />
<br />
If you don't want to worry about this at all, fight in the Planes, which have great regular AND AA exp.  But if you're in a zone and have your slider set far to one direction or the other and notice that your EXP isn't moving that great compared to the level of the mob, try moving it the other way (and make a note to yourself).  Go to zones with good AA EXP if that's what you're after and ones without it, if you're after regular EXP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
to answer the initial question:<br />
<br />
i get 36-40% aa/hour soloing, ahem, light blues in PoD at 61 (as a necromancer that is, but shamans are surely compirable)<br />
<br />
i'd say wait till 60, and stick at 60 till you have scm3 and canni 5 (both essential imo, i'd get ND3 too, but each to their own), leave the rest till 65 as you'll likely farm aa faster then than at any other level</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry for the minor hijack, but this statement about FG brought up a question that I had.  I was planning on getting 61 (new pup and replenishment) then heading back to FG to pound out some AA.  Does the AA Exp really drop off that much from 60 to 61 on shrooms in FG?</div></div><hr />
