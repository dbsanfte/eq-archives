<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm 54, with pretty good gear (fungi, jbb, horse) but no epic.  I have a 39 druid on 2nd box for transportation, buffs, damage shields, evacs, and supplemental healing.  And a frequent hunting partner is a 55 ranger with decent gear.<br />
<br />
Recently, in an effort to get the druid to 39 and open up a few more ports (esp emerald jungle), we've been doing gimpy xp grinds in Jaggedpine on gnolls.  With the forces we have, we are able to pretty much chain kill gnolls with near zero down time.  We've noticed that the xp while quite good for the druid is a bit unexciting for the shaman and ranger considering how many mobs we're killing.<br />
<br />
So I suspect we need to find an xp zone with slightly higher level mobs.  To make best use of our talents, I think we would ideally want an outdoor zone (horses, rangers, and druids work best outdoors) with mobs slightly higher level than the jaggedpine gnolls, but not so much more difficult to kill that our kill rate drops excessively.  We're not averse to dungeons, but it has to be darned good to give up the benefit of the horse and still keep the kill rate up.<br />
<br />
Places we've been considering:<br />
<br />
 * the grey (have to get an EB item for druid)<br />
 * trak's teeth (foragers/named)<br />
 * karnors castle<br />
 * maidens eye<br />
<br />
Again, the group is - <br />
<br />
54 shaman<br />
55 ranger<br />
39 druid (boxed)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions/recommendations?  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The named cycle if you can do it with three could yield ikky bp for the shaman and seb keys for all if you don't have them already.<br />
<br />
The ranger and shaman might be able to get a hangman's noose for a haste item if they don't have better already.   The cycle is a lot of fun....especially if you accidently get a lot of adds and have to work to survive :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">We hit Trak's Teeth last night.  It is fairly amusing, but is a fairly terrible XP area.  My druid got a hangman's noose (shaman and ranger already had equal or better haste).  Ranger's twink cleric got a meditative blanket.  Druid got a seb key.  Only mobs in that zone that are blue are foragers and named.  Pull rate just wasn't high enough for good xp, since every pull required the ranger to track the mob down somewhere and bring it back.  Other than having lots of hit points and taking a while to kill, every mob in that zone seemed totally gimp.  I think they actually hit less hard than the jaggedpine gnolls.  If only there'd been more of them to kill.<br />
<br />
Maybe if we sat on the exact spawn location of a forager, assuming they have one, we'd do better.  If someone knows the exact locations where foragers spawn, please post it.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, then we went into seb so the druid could get key added to keyring and destroy the idol to save inventory space.  Ranger pulled 2 frog shamans.  We proceeded to fight them.  They were extremely challenging, since we had difficulty preventing them from gating.<br />
<br />
I think Sebilis is unlikely to be a good xp zone for us unless we refine our tactics significantly.  Need to figure out the best way for a ranger/shaman/lowbie-druid trio to prevent mobs from gating.  Also need to keep resist buffs up to prevent mobs from slowing us.  Maybe if I debuff mob resists the druid can stick stuns.  And I guess I could dust off that &quot;slam&quot; key also.  Not sure how rangers prevent gates.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any other suggestions, please do.  Trak's didn't quite meet my needs, nor did sebilis.<br />
<br />
I think we're going to do the grey next.  Maybe Velks spiders since both of us want to do the shawl quests at some point.</div></div><hr />
