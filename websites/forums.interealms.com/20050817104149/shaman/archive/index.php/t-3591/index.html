<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been lvl 30 for about 2 weeks now, about 2 blue away from lvl 31. Every time I go to bank, I chain cast an alteration spell (minor healing) to try and get my specialize: alteration up. I have  put points into specialize skill but have seen none of them increase in almost an entire level. Is it usually   this slow or am I just unlucky?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did you train 1 point into each of the others. Once a specialize skill (alt) reaches 50 it won't raise to 51 until a point is trained into each of the other specialize skills. Other than that I don't know what could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FilurGlamrist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If i remember correctly you have to put a point in all the different specialisations before they will increase. Just be sure that one you want to got above 50 is that first one that do.<br />
