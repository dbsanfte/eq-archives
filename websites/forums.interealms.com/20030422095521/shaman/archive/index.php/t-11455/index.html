<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm really starting to get the itch to try soloing the emp in Seb for torpor and malo. I've mostly been hanging out in PoG raising cash where I've raised 20k but the drudgery is starting to wear on me.<br />
<br />
I have run3, regen3, mc1 and 2aas unspent and working on a 3rd. I'm wondering if VP is worth the knockback effect that is has for interrupting the emp's gating attempt. If someone has this aa can you tell me how well it works? From my understanding it's disease based but is that just the root component or also the knockback component? Is the knockback reliable enough to interrupt a gate or too iffy to count on when you need it most?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Omniz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">VP is great for CC and slow resists, but I have not had much luck in using it to break casting.  This is on bigger mobs though (IE HoT, Kael, and some random PoP zones) so maybe thats the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It probably is a mistake if you have torpor.  If not then it depends on your play style.  That will be one of the next few aa i get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've solo over 15 emps so far and have never had him gate on me. Spirit call rules for killing him fast once he's low hps. BUT I'd get canni 5 before I got anything else. Trust me if you dont get canni 5 on your 23rd aa your making a HUGE mistake. Impacted the game more than anything I've had up till now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I can only back up what Hagle says - Canni V is completely game changing and makes everything so much more fun, much more so than torpor - which is still sweet :)<br />
<br />
With spells becoming researchable, it might be worth waiting a bit before worrying too much about malo/torpor, and just have some fun and get some more aa towards canni V.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GroutRavenPaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cann5 will change the game for you...for the better. Get it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Xrojbot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you fight the Emp in Seb in the area where the Blood spawns, right at the Door that leads to the Emps Spawn area, he won't gate, unless he is rooted.<br />
<br />
Slightly off topic, but someone told me this, and it proved both true and useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Get Cannabalize V first.  With priest spells being researched on Test, it's only a matter of time before all shaman have Malo/Torpor.  My guess is by the end of summer(Labor Day weekend in the states), prices will have stabalized for those spells if SOE puts research in live before the end of April.  But then again, I've only take one Macroeconomics class.</div></div><hr />
