<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got any links to some good PoTime strats, maybe a guild board (if you don't mind sharing) or something of the sort? I've been looking around and not come up with anything useful yet.  :confused: <br />
Most especially I'd like something that mentions p4. My guilds been trying to beat Tallon Zek for the last 2 days unsuccessfully. :( If you don't have a link, but have some advice to offer here, that would be most welcome too. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Oh ya.  That's just what everyone out there is going to give you.  Details on how to succeed in Time.  *** are you doing in Time if you can't learn encounters on your own?  Damn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Two whole days?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">here is your strat:<br />
Try encounter, learn and fail. res up, try again, learn more and fail. rinse and repeat til you have a succesful kill. <br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, thinking same thing Sciek.  I think our guild spent near 2 months (not every day, but rotation willing), getting past.  That included losing tons of members, and having to recruit and reflag, but hey.. like they said.  Try something, it dont work, die rez, try something else :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I try to offer what ever advice I can to people, especially shaman, but one thing I won't give out is strats on the top end encounters.  Sorry, but thats something I put a ton of time and deaths into learning with my guild.  A feeling most all guilds of Time level share, which is why you don't see anything posted about it.<br />
<br />
I wish you the best in Time, but you really should learn it for yourself, even if that means dying repeatedly for days or weeks.  Makes it that much more sweet when the mob finally rolls over dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh good luck with vallon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tz really isn't too tricky, you just need to use your head. Vz is significantly harder (imo the hardest of the lot Time wise). Your best approach is to start with Tz as the 1st of the Phase 4 encounters rather than doing Saryrn and Terris so you maximise your time on Tz then Vz attempts. While they are tricky the Zeks are beatable easily when you have worked out your strat. <br />
Like the others I won't hand you a strat either sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">good luck in phase 1! hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I should just post a complete spoiler here to make you ****whits look like morons. <br />
Denying spoilers is fine, making fun of somebody that apparently is new to the highend game and was asking for advice to help his guild, is not.<br />
<br />
There's a handful of guilds figuring out new encounters. The rest of you are just using...spoilers(Sorry, if your officers didn't tell you that). Whether these spoilers are given to your raid officers by &quot;good friends&quot; in other guilds or if it's posted on a message board, doesn't change a thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Giac spoilers are rarely any actual use (at least to my guild), the simple fact is that guilds vary so much in makeup and ability that there is no one way to win.<br />
<br />
The original poster having gained Time access would have to have beaten Rathe Council and Xegony which take similar working out to the PoTime gods so his guild must possess the relevant tactical skills. Lucy spell descriptions and good old fashioned try till you crack it will reveal a workable strat to any guild capable of getting there in the 1st place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's not his guild asking for *spoilers* though, it's him. He probably just joined a new guild and doesn't really know how it is to endure new/difficult Encounters. <br />
Making fun of him or his guild for wiping to TZ after 2 attempts is ignorant.<br />
<br />
thRover, TZ can be a bitch to adjust to. Find a good spot where to pin him and try to figure out how to keep the Slow and Deaggro buff off your MT to allow your damage dealers to unload their mana faster.<br />
<br />
If your clerics die after the MT, find a way to reduce their aggro(TZ is not the only one to have Deaggro buffs~). It depends more on the execution than on anything else, so stick in there and you will succeed very soon, I am sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lol, sometimes people are so ignorant in their behavior its embarrasing to be a human being.<br />
This is a place where people go for.... no, wait, I'm not just gonna assume you can figure that out its INFORMATION. :)<br />
If you don't have any, don't want to give any that fine just don't. No one is asking for spoilers, give as much advice/information as you can/want. There's an old saying that goes &quot;there are no stupid questions, just stupid answers&quot; I guess we can prove that over and over again on all the internet message boards out there. My bad for asking I guess. I'll keep asking other people, I know a few who don't mind helping other people out. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">This is a place where people go for.... no, wait, I'm not just gonna assume you can figure that out its INFORMATION <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
this is a class board not a strat board  :p <br />
<br />
and ceno that ige banner is nice addition to your sig ..... they paying you too?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There are spoilers online for just about every nitpicky detail about EQ.  Why does this particular request seem to hit a nerve?  Likely because open spoilers on how to get to/through time would open up more competition.<br />
Don't blame the poster for wanting access or assistance with getting there - blame Sony for creating the timed spawn limited content system in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">because its a  high end zone and people had to work their way upward to it  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and yes im aware that ssra ep and such was the top end at one point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Folks, people had to work their way into Sebilis at one time.  I don't buy this work through it attitude.  Class board or not, I want to play my Character the best I can and asking for advice should not get such cranky responses.  Even if you gave a complete spoiler on Time, it would still take a similar amount of work for everyone in the guild to adjust and learn.  The learning and earning process would still be in place.  And if they are flagged for Time, they will be there anyway, with or without a spoiler.  If they aren't, why does it hurt to give them some insight.  <br />
<br />
I am close to the point of not reading this board anymore, I'm tired of all the critical content one gets when they ask for help.   Just the other day, someone asked what the ultimate solo was for a time equipped shammy with 350 AA and the thread turned into a strip about peeps being able to get women if their toon was at that level due to play time requirements.<br />
<br />
EQ didnt used to be like this folks, it was a community and so was this board.  Now if seems more like a flame zone to me.<br />
<br />
Respectfully,</div></div><hr />
