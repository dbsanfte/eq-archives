<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maerjyon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Don't do what the motd says when you log in... all that I had to do to fix mine was /q out, and log back in. Granted, I DID switch accounts at the time, but it should work if you just log out (not all the way, just to the name/pw screen) and then log back in. No need to screw with texture caching or anything like that.  Worked for me on two computers, but your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />
