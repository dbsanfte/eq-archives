<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xtraez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys I've noticed in some of you guys Magelo profiles you've got some of the Rune Crafter's quest pieces. I'm into the process of upgrading my legs and arms and I think those would be great for me. I know how the quest goes and all and I have found the stones for the legs in the bazaar at a nice price but my question is how would a level 36 shammy with a small group get the corroded armor for the turn in? It comes from Kael and there's no way we'd have a chance in there getting em. So with that being said at what level did you get your Rune Crafter's items and if I was to buy some of the corroded armor how much would I pay for it? Also if that's out of my range can anyone give me some advice on legs and arms for my shammy? I'm using Giant Scalemail Sleeves for my arms and Soiled Breechclout for legs now. Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Styks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think i got mine at around 45+, the arms i had MQed.  In order to do the quest you have to be kindly to coldian so it takes some time killing giants to get your faction up.  The only pieces i'm missing now is the BP, helm, and bracers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are three types of Velious quest armor, Thurgadin (Rune Crafter's) is the easiest and lowest. It is generally obtained around level 45 and up, because to try to obtain the armor quest pieces yourself before then would be silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a full set of Rune Crafter's armor (although some of it is now in the bank)<br />
<br />
The only practical place to get corroded chain drops for the Rune Crafters armor is the KD arena (people talk about chain dropping in the bank area, but its so rare as to be not worth considering). <br />
<br />
In order to camp the KD arena you need a minimum of 3 people including a level 58+ tank level 58+ cleric and level 56+shaman, all well equipped. A solid group of mixed 54+ will also be ok. 2 groups of 48+ should also get by ok if they are well organised.<br />
<br />
That is what you will need if you want to get the drops yourself!<br />
<br />
If you are talking about multi-questing the armor, then the prices will vary considerably. The weaker pieces of armor are not particularly good, and could theoretically be purchased reasonably cheaply, like maybe 300 - 400plat? The &quot;cheap&quot; pieces would include gauntlets and bracers. Helm, sleeves and boots are better, and will cost more, 1 - 2k perhaps. The legs are quite good and might go for 2 - 3k and the BP is quite rare and reasonably good - I would expect to play 10k for it!<br />
<br />
The problem you will have is that KD is not overly camped any more - people have moved on to better armor - ToV and Ssara Temple etc. I think that you will probably struggle to find MQ corroded chain.<br />
<br />
You might be able to find some Barbed Ringmail Sleeves for the time being. Also, Jarsarth leggings are Ok, as are Kromriff Military leggings. Alternatively, I think Tin mail might be ok, but I am not sure on the availablilty / price</div></div><hr />
