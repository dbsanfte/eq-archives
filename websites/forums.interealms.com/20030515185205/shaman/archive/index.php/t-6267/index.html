<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it's not a great accomplishment, but I just wanted to say that I soloed Veltar 20 mins ago. He killed me once when I was 47 and I figured it was time for some payback, so I pulled with slow (no malo yet) and basically kept myself torpored while pet nibbled at him. The occasional plague when I had mana (no pox and no epic). Fight took 50 minutes by my parser, and the real thriller came when he had me at 41hp and I'd just channeled a torpor :)<br />
A little victory for me, and thought I'd share it with the people on this forum who've given me invaluable information and advice - many thanks!<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and did it with just regular shaman buffs. No Aego or KEI</div></div><hr />
