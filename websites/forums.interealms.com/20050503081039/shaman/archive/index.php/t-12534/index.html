<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Orball</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.<br />
I have noob question :)   I have only played mage and shammy.  I was wondering which classes can track and how they do it.  Just general info.  Thank you.<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rangers and druids (rangers get it earlier, druids at like 25.). The rangers one tracks further than the druids. It works by clicking track and theres a list of mobs in range. You click on there name and you are pointed in there direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i hear bards can track too . not sure how, never played one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i hear bards can track too . not sure how, never played one.<br />
<br />
Bards can track too, just like dr00ds and rangers.  Works the same way, just the range sucks and they get it really late in life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wudoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Rangers have the best track at 1st level...able to sort by distance, consider, and have a larger range...by far the best track available...<br />
<br />
Druids (at 20th) and Bards (not sure level) can only &quot;normal&quot; track which gives a list of mobs within thier tracking range in no particular order.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Think bards might track like druids just at a lesser range. I i was tracking you i would hit my track hotkey and it pull up mobs. If you were a mob and in range id find your name and click and it would say Orball is ahead and to the left&quot;  If i turned left the correct amount would say orball is straight ahead. Mobs can move but you'll keep getting message mob is behind you , ahead , ahead and to the right etc but wont give distance or height.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For druids (and probably bards) when a mob spawns, it spawns on the top of the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Track is a 35th level skill.  You get a track button, just like druids / rangers.  There's no &quot;Track Song&quot; just in case anyone was wondering.<br />
<br />
Skill cap is 100, or 25 less than a druid's.<br />
<br />
Range at 100 is... hmm.  Hard to describe.  More than visible range.  Very useful in zones with lots of trees or uneven terrain.<br />
<br />
And yes, latest spawns on top of the list always.  Very useful in catching things just as they pop, not very useful in finding specific spawns.</div></div><hr />
