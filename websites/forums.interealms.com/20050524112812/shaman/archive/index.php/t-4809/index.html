<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once upon a time, some kind soul posted a &quot;Slow Table&quot; on these boards which gave a run-down on which mobs (particularly high end mobs) could be slowed by which means (disease or regular) and which could not be slowed at all.  I believe it also included side info like which mobs were totally MR.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have a link to this info?  I know it used to be here, but I believe it might have been wiped when the boards were reorganized.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nice table, but I think they need to add a field for mobs that very hard to slow. Some mobs are immune to slow and should be listed unslowable. Others are simply so hard to slow they are virtually unslowable. They list Black Reavers in CoM as unslowable, but I have managed to slow two of them in the past. Two slows in 500+ Reaver kills isn't great, but it's possible.<br />
<br />
How did I manage to slow them? Malo, Tash, Occlusion... Slow. Reaver was more than half dead both times, but it felt good to slow it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks.. found it in the spell section.  Of course, I had scoured the general section and the combat and tactics section, but didn't think I'd find it under spells.  Go figger heh.</div></div><hr />
