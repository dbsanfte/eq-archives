<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any questions about EQOA?  I am enjoying it so far, its really EQ for the casual player, or EQ lite if you prefer but it has a lot going for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What are for sure the races there and the classes?<br />
Are there 2 human races?<br />
What is it like vs &quot;today&quot; everquest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQOA has a variety of differences to EQ today.  These differences are based mostly because it is on a console system.  I for one do not have a USB keyboard and I cant really afford one atm so communication is rather cumbersome... even using the button pusing responses they give you.  Here is what I have found different so far.<br />
<br />
*No Iksar, Vah Shir or Ogres races.<br />
*Yes there are 2 different human races.  Eastern and Western. with each belonging to Freeport and Qeynos respectively.<br />
*No Beastlord class.<br />
*No skill raising system.  You dont have rais that 1hblunt or sense heading. As you level you get ability points to plug into your stats.<br />
*Heavy anti-twink system in the game.  Level caps on things such as banded and leather.  You have to be 30 to wear banded if I remember correctly and to use steel weapons.<br />
*Cookie cutter newbie quests meant to introduce you to the game.  These are pretty well done I suppose but they are the same for each class/race combo.  The level 5 quest can be difficult if you cant find someone to group with and/or you dont have a keyboard for quick responses.<br />
*Mana bar changed to Power bar and is used by each class.  As a caster its used as you mana bar as a melee it is used for your various abilities such as the double attack skill for my paladin (Spiritual Strike).<br />
*Only have 5 slots to have things &quot;memed.&quot; I already ran into problems with spell swapping with my shaman at low level.<br />
*More action based game.  Power and hp regens faster than it would in pcEQ and things refresh faster.  I havent timed it yet but Lay Hands 1 refreshed every 5-10 min.<br />
* It is on Tunaria (ancient Antiocia) and it doesnt look familiar at all.  I realize the time difference between the two but the only thing I find familiar is some little things in qeynos (the clock) and free port.<br />
*There is no zoning.  The world is loaded as you wander around.<br />
<br />
um that is all I think at the momment.  I will post more in the future.<br />
<br />
Edit: oh a big one<br />
*Items have durability and HP.  As you use items in combat thier HP decrease and you have to get them fixed by the local blacksmith.  I havent had items degrade in durability yet but as they do they are supposed to degrade in performance as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">EVERY class gets gate at level 8.<br />
There seem to be class specific quests every 5 levels or so.<br />
The graphics are great, the animations are very good too.<br />
USB keyboard is a big help.<br />
Here is the first fan site I have seen, it has lots of info:<br />
