<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">In Feburary of last, I re-rolled my Troll Shaman for my current Barb Shammy.  The reason I did this, was because I didn't know much about stats at the time of creating the Troll (hehe, appearently I still don't).  I placed my starting points for the Troll into STR and STA.  When the Trolly reached lvl27, I began to realize that WIS was needed for my seriously lacking mana pool.  So I decided to re-roll with a Barb, and I placed almost all points into WIS.<br />
<br />
Since I started frequenting this board, I have learned that the concensus is HP &gt; all other stats.  Sooo... Would it be safe to assume that My Troll could have actually had better point placement with STR and STA than my re-rolled Barb?  I tend to solo more than group, and I always have my face in with the mob (warrior mentality methinks), so maybe the stats would have matched my style.  I never deleted the Troll toon (for prosperity reasons I guess), and I wonder if it actually might be a better toon for me.  I don't mind the drawbacks inherent with evil races, I have always liked the Troll look, and love the role play, not to mention I owe those Frogloks &quot;a gud barshin&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">starting points are moot. put it all in CHA.<br />
<br />
in the end they will all be pegged anyway, except for CHA. So i'd put the points there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Strength is worthless.  If I could redo my charactor, I would put everything I could into stamina, for HP.<br />
<br />
However, your starting stats aren't that important.  I will say that the only advantage I see in a troll shaman is the snare necklace.  Oh the things I could do, if I had snare!  I've often said that shaman would be way overpowered if we all had snare.<br />
<br />
As it is, so few shaman are trolls, it really doesn't matter that they get a snare necklace, I suppose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Starting stats are useful.  They effect how your character will play.  They effect what gear choices you will make.  Eventualy they wont matter.  <br />
<br />
At the high end we all have gear that pretty much maxes all of our stats.  Good gear is cheap and easy to get now.  Having a high natural wisdom allows you to focus on HP/resist gear along the way... whereas high natural stamina allows you to focus on mana/resist gear along the way.  Its just a choice.  You cant really make a bad one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cirys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are a genuine newbie or starting over from scratch, your starting stats certainly do matter.  <br />

If you're reasonably well twinked, they are less important.</div></div><hr />

Stuff that uber back in kunark for a shaman is sold for 100pp now, which also happens to be a lot easier to make than it was back then.  It's simply a fact that it WAS a fair bit harder 2 years ago than it is now.  Gear is a LOT easier to come by and far far cheaper all around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">well...it really depends.  are you planning on joining a high end guild and raiding, giving yourself access to items that come with huge stat increases?  or are you more of a casual player who won't have access to super high end items?  if the former, then starting stats don't mean a whole lot once you get up there.  if the latter, then starting stats can have a moderately significant impact on your character.  regardless however, the higher you get (and the more gear upgrades you go through), the less starting stats matter.  they just give you more flexibility in the intermediate stages.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The things that make a real difference lower down when you are levelling are regen items and focus gear, however, the biggest thing for shaman is getting your spells as you level imo ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cirys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gear is a LOT easier to come by and far far cheaper all around.<br />
<br />
No doubt about that.  I was stunned to see it when I started playing again recently, however, it doesn't invalidate the need to allocate your starting points intelligently if you are making a fresh start.  They do have an effect in that case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I would say hit the wis button then the stam button. Simply because you ARE a shaman, and if you are not a twink, you will not get ub3r stat gear until at least your 30s or so.<br />
<br />
One thing that pisses me off: Stats have minimal effects at low lvls b/c the equations they are used in (mana formula for wis, hp formula for stam, etc.) also have a lvl factor. So while your extra 25 wis at lvl 14 is nice, it really only equates to 25*.2*14. 70 mana is a lot...kindof. but think about at lvl 34, when shamans start getting decent and can AFFORD new gear. 25*.2*34= 170 mana. 100 extra mana. <br />
<br />
What i'm trying to say is, when stats are all you have, they mean ****. But when you can afford decent stuff, they STILL mean **** because you will hit your stat caps off the items in like 5-10 lvls anyways.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'm making too much sense to yall. But the only time the starting stats REALLY matter, are probably between 34 and ...maybe 49. Those lvls are the lvls where your stats won't be maxed probably and you will be getting good returns from your starting points.<br />
<br />
Charisma really is about the only stat that characters in EQ usually don't max out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ignore all those cha guys.. yeah if you play for lets say the next year HARDCORE nonstop then stats don't matter. Now if you aren't going to be going to poTime anytime soon then they do matter. 15sta at level 65 doesn't do much for me adds about 60 hps.. so I would say on a barb I would do all wis and 5 sta because cha will never help you, the wis will give you a bit of mana to work off of and the 5 sta is better than nothing.. <br />
<br />
I say wis because it's hard to get 355 wis IMO and from what I know it's not diminishing returns while after a certain amount of STA (which you can easily buff to) the extra sta does not give too much.. You also sometimes have to make a choice Wis or HPS items and with 20 in wis you can easily take the hps item w/o worrying about loosing too much wis.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to say that the guild I am in farms VT often and just got into the elementals and our best shaman does not have either wis or sta maxed.. so keep that in mind, 255 wis is not the end of the world..</div></div><hr />

<br />
you joke about it, but seriously...<br />
<br />
regardless of your sta, wis, etc being however shuffled around, you are still going to find a way to kill efficiently.<br />
<br />
the one thing that you can't do efficiently unless you have a max charisma is sell and make more money, and spend less money on items you do buy from vendors.<br />
<br />
I really think that if I had it to do over again I would use the highest cha starting shm, dump all points into it, and then get some steins of moggock to go with my cha buffs. that would be some uber buying and selling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys are just down right mean, hehe.  Tell ya what your going through a lot of effort to make a good shaman.  Now if you would just find one you like and level him.  Focus is they key and you seem to be getting distracted by all the fluff.  So pick a race stick with it, level, and get fatt looties.<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bigboyg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Wow, some of you guys need to start a new character without 5k in the bank.<br />
<br />
Starting stats are very important. I know, I rerolled twice before I got my current char. Sure, by the time you've got money and levels they don't matter, but they're STARTING STATS. They'll matter to you for a long while.<br />
<br />
Having no WIS as a low shaman is just a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If your intnetion is to get to 65 with lotsa AAs and be in a good guild, then yah, then the only way your starting points matter is how they are gonna help you as you churn thru the levels.<br />
<br />
WIS is one of the easiest to cap, and in the end, not super useful for shaman. Yah you have a bigger mana pool, but shaman are all about canni and regeneration. A good shaman can get by with 150 or less WIS all the way to 65+.<br />
<br />
BUT... Having decent WIS to start with means you can concentrate more on HP/Resist gear earlier.<br />
<br />
I put my ikky shamans starting points in Wis. I dont regret it cause i can put a lot of my rangers second hand gear on him (valorium rings, etc).<br />
<br />
If youre intention is NOT to be in a high end guild raidin all the time, put starting points into STA. Its the hardest/most important stat to get high for a casual player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">As some has said it depends on your situation. Roughly speaking the higher the level you are and the more powerful your guild is the less your stats matter. By the time your in the elemental planes and reasonably equiped from there you've easily got 200+ in wis from your gear and simular for sta. Personally i've got around 230 wis and 190 sta from gear and I've still only got 1 peice of elemental armor. 10 or 15 wis either way doesn't really make too much of a difference.<br />
<br />
On the other hand if you don't reach this stage the extra stats can be handy.<br />
<br />
One thing is sure tho gear and stats from gear gets easier and easier to get as time goes on in this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Depends- twinked or not?<br />
<br />
Nowadays there's so much chit out there to compensate that beginning stats are not as important.<br />
<br />
Back in the day my first character an erudite pally I put no points in strength.<br />
<br />
Second character my shaman I dumped all his points in strength.<br />
<br />
Third character a gnome warrior got all her points dumped into agility.<br />
<br />
I've never suffered for lack of wis (base wisdom for a barb shaman is 80  :rolleyes: ) and at 65 I can get about 285-290 wisdom with almost 5600 hp raid buffed and I'm still wearing a mix of SS armor and PoP armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">How many of you have been in fights where that extra 60hp from the starting stamina, or that extra amount of mana from starting wis, would've saved you? It just doesn't happen. <br />
<br />
IMHO, go Stamina as much as possible, and then a little wis. But in the end, it's just not gonna be a big deal. Do what you want, that extra little edge from doing the stats &quot;just right&quot; generally won't do you jack squat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Heyas,<br />
     Is there a &quot; Stat Cap&quot; per level (like in weapon skill)?  Some of Eilderts comments made me wonder.  Heck I only have 3 stats over 200 ATM (self-buffed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yes, level 60-, your cap is 255.  However, as you approach your cap, the benefits that you get out of your stat have diminishing returns.<br />
<br />
Level 61 - 65, you gain 5 points per stats to the maximum you can have, for a maximum of 280 at 65.<br />
<br />
Level 61 - 65, you can train one point in Planar power, each gaining 5 points to the max in each stat, for a maximum of 305 at 65 with PP5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sylino</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You want to know the most important starting stats?  Here's the secret: Motivation and Focus.  Make a Shaman of ANY race (they are all uber!) and love him/her like family, then STAY WITH IT!  That's all you need to do... the better you play the Shaman, the less you need to worry about stats.  Shaman are awesome and fearsome at all levels, and if you are having fun and loving your toon it won't matter how much starting WIS or HP you have.  You will level, rapidly, and love every second of it... you will slaughter mobs a level higher than you and laugh at them.<br />
<br />
Shaman &gt; ALL... and I just started mine three days ago.  I'm NOT letting him go for my mains for a long time, he's too fun and has way to much potential.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There IS a game from level one to 65, so yes, they matter.  They don't matter at all by the time you're 65, but you'll enjoy them on the ride to 65.  Of course, if you can peg all your stats to 255 at level one, then you can disregard  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm sure there are many many shamans who're not maxed in stats when they hit 60 or 65. I would venture most in fact, since the cap goes up from 255 at 60 to 280 at 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please remember that many of the posters on this board are a bit jaded coming from having played the game for 3-4 years, 100's of AA's, full spellbooks, and top gear.   <br />
<br />
The key in your case is your current level of your Barb Shaman.  If by using your sig (Shaman of the 51th Foozle) we can say that you are an lvl 51 Shaman ... then going back to your Troll Shaman is not a good choice.  By level 51, you will have options with spells and gear to overcome any stat issues.  But if your Shaman was same or lower level to your Troll ... then you could have a decision to make on what investment of time/effort you want to follow in either of them.    <br />
<br />
Nevertheless, the real issue in EQ is at this stage of the game ... Stat's really are meaningless.  STA really does not impact fatigue.  AGI impact on AC is nominal.  CHA (at least for Shamans) only influences vendor prices.  Etc - Etc. The game mechanics have allowed stats to blur more into marketing hype than meaningful determinates of Avatar performance.  In other words, Stat's mean nothing in Everquest today.   <br />
<br />
IMHO, one of the best things SoE could do for the game is to add value of stats back into the game.  Then the answer would clearly be yes ... your Barb or Troll's starting Stat's WOULD have an influence on your game play ... even at the end game.<br />
<br />

Edited because for some reason vB code interpeted 's for ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I put all bonus points into WIS for my Iksar Shaman. I should have put most of them into STA because that's where Iksars are deficient. So basically I did my stats completely wrong, but you know what? I had no trouble playing the game untwinked.<br />
<br />
So to answer the original question:  NO; they most definitely are not THAT important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Yossarian Runningwol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Back when I first started playing EQ (nearly 4 years ago) stats were of importance.<br />
<br />
Needless to say my first character, an erudite pally, recieved no points in strength.  My next character this one my shaman all points to strength (course this was back when ppl still thought shamans were tanks).<br />
<br />
My shaman's base wis is his starting wis...80 and of course back then there wasn't the WIDE array of items and yet he still managed.<br />
<br />
So IMO starting stats are really not important and especially not at higher lvls.</div></div><hr />
