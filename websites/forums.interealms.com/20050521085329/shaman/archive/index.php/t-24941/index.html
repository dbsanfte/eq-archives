You wouldn't see lvl 20's with 200hp gear because its all required level 65+, even ep gear is what required 63? Best hand me downs would mostly be early luclin or velious raid gear.</div></div><hr />

I tend to agree..we should be able to utilize handmedowns.  Most of the uber gear is level specific anyway, and I dont see much difference between that and buying twink gear for your lowbie from the platinum that your high level earns.Would be nice to pass our Jboots on to our new toon when we get AA's Run3.  It wouldn't scare off the newbies as much as inspire them to reach the upper levels, so that they can do the same.</div></div><hr />

 Oh yes there is a Complete revamping going down With EQ1, Look at your omens Disk, the pictures at the end the ones of the trolls marching out of Ner, and  Freeport Nuked to the ground by Sol RO, yea those.  There in detail on the SOE boards a few weeks back. Bacily its a COmplete recoding of the First game. From what l read  No hometown would be safe. Its a long overhauling there doing to the game, and the frist part of it was the Mistymoore Revamp. ( that goes live in december, which is the next scheluded patch is to happen) The mobs wondering out side in Lower faydark will stay, and wonder the hole zone. SO its a longer story as why they are changing EQ1, but thats what am waiting for now, and Real life is seem fun now that l met someone important to me. *-). <br />

<br />
There are almost NO new players entering EQ.  Play a new toon these days and see how many TRUE n00bs there are.  I just did with 2 different characters for the hell of it (level 1-35) and literally saw none.  I saw twinked toons running around in Blackburrow who were at 25% health and I thought &quot;I'll hit them with a chloroblast and get them back to fighting.&quot; when I did it healed them for 25% (when I asked them if they had Temp on they said no).  So the effect would be minimal to new characters.<br />
<br />
I have suggested this for a year now, and think it would be a great idea.  What it might do is scratch the itch for the people that have left for EQ2 to get an all access patch, which would be a huge boon for SOE.  I don't think it would have any effect on those who leave for WoW.<br />
<br />
It could also put the urge back to old time players that have tried games like Lineage2 and who aren't playing any MMO right now.  This would give them a head start and a fresh start on a new class of their choice.<br />
<br />
It would be pretty heady marketing IMO.</div></div><hr />

Yeah.<br />

I really wouldn't worry about the folks who left so much if I were SOE.  <br />
<br />
There's a huge potential market there, and the growth curve should theoretically continue to point upward as more and more folks adopt this style of gaming.  <br />
<br />
While that's happening to some extent, the amount of new player interest in EQ seems to me to be incredibly low these days.  That's where they need to work, and doing stuff like making everything droppable is about the last thing they should do, even within accounts.  <br />

They need to find the folks who haven't played EQ and market it to them in a way that makes them want to try it.  <br />
I think SOE has made a conscious (and correct, IMHO) business decision that EQ1 is NOT going to be marketed at the new players, but instead they are focusing their &quot;New Player&quot; campaign on EQ2. <br />
<br />
I think this is a great marketing move by them. Why invest resources making levels 1-50 in EQ1 viable again? You just arent going to get that many people who care enough. Put that company resource into making EQ2 as attractive to the &quot;Newbie&quot; as you can, but still attractive to the rest of the gaming population. <br />
<br />
EQ1 has a lot of content for people. The game has enough juice to carry on for another solid year or 2 without much additional expense. But they need to identify and focus on their target market and make the proper adjustments there. EQ2 is yet another option now, and THAT game needs to focus on ITS targets, one of them being the &quot;New Online Gamer&quot;. <br />
<br />
As long as SOE keeps YOUR dollar flowing into their pocket, I dont think they care if you play EQ1, EQ2 or any of their other options. What they are trying to do is prevent ALL their customers, new, old, and potential, from paying some other company those dollars. As long as EQ1 makes money, they will support it to a degree. After all, you dont kill the prime milk cow just because you have a newly birthed calf in the barn. <br />
<br />
If I have one complaint (or disagreement with their marketing strategy, I guess) its that I think they are trying to make BOTH these games appeal to too wide of an audiance overall. However, in a world where the almighty $ defines the direction now, its not supprising.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to comment on the actually thread topic, my bad Otanni: I like the idea of making SOME gears account-tradable, but not all. I think that would totally trivialize the 60's. The 50's are already trivial due to mudflation. Lets keep the 60's in the 100 hp/mana range, heh. I would like to see no-drop items made tributable though. I do not think that would interfere with the current &quot;NBG&quot; status of most no-drop stuff, as someone suggested above. But I am one of those &quot;I got every old piece of no-drop in the bank&quot; guys myself (although I turned in all my Hate gear long ago, heh).</div></div><hr />

I respectfully disagree with this.  As someone that has moved on to other games (DAoC, AO, SB, AC2, SWG, and now WoW), I have always come back to EQ.  People leaving EQ1 for greener pastures only to discover it doesn't have the same feel as EQ1 is, in my opinion, a huge market in itself.  I have left now for what I think is for good to play WoW, but as I posted above, there are a number of things that would make me re-activate my account one more time.  New players will probably not be attracted to EQ1 at all at this point unless they know people that play, given that WoW, EQ2, and SWG are out there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think those are all valid points, and I certainly wouldn't want them discouraging former players from returning.  <br />
<br />
I just think the MMPOG market itself should be growing more than it appears to.  This growth should result in more players funneling into EQ (and EQ2, WOW, etc), rather than having MMPOG games simply cannibalizing from each other.  <br />
<br />
If there is more growth in this market than it appears to me there is, EQ1 ought to get a bigger chunk of it than it currently is getting because it has a depth of content other games won't be touching for a long, long time.  (fix the animations though ...)<br />
<br />
I just don't see new players in EQ anymore.  Gart is over 5.5 years old now, and I'm still kicking, but it's really a different dynamic these days.</div></div><hr />

Great idea!  Then I can create uber secondaries, fully twinked out with old or loot no one wanted from raids.  Then pay to have that character moved to it's own account and ebay instant uber characters like a mad man!<br />

Ok, maybe I took that a bit far but that is probably the exact reason SoE would never let this happen. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly, the reason the game is starting to die down more and more, and has been for a while, is that everything is getting too easy. EQ has never been too hard. The closest thing to hard I have found with in EQ has been the sometimes very boring grinds.<br />
<br />
Single pulls are too easy. Some people may say that having 4+ mobs coming into camp at all times too hard, but really, it makes you actually work for the exp or the loot on a raid.<br />
<br />
Single pulls make the game much much much worse. I mean, a lot of newer chanters today dont know what to ****ing do if more then 2 mobs come during a pull in an exp group. What good are they? Hell, I can usualy keep a group alive if I get lucky on resists if we get 2 or more mobs incoming on a pull.<br />
<br />
If Sony dosnt demand that for good exp, you must be put in less than favorable positions, IE multiple pulls coming in, mobs that gate and bring friends, it just becomes dull and you have people that constantly suck ass.<br />
<br />
Of course you then have a lot of BoT/Karnors type zones, but I am sure the tards would eventually learn how to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Otani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree Froggar, the game has gotten too easy in a number of ways.  God, remember the trains in lower guk?  <br />
<br />
You had to learn your class, learn how to CC, learn what role you played in a well played grp in order to succede, and when you did win, the feeling of satisfaction at a job well done was half of the enjoyment.  And when you failed, the frustration and determination of wanting to do it 'right' kept you coming back.<br />
<br />
But that wasn't the point of my original post.<br />
<br />
I can now BUY 100/100 hp/mana attunable gear that is BETTER than most of the no-drop crap I have in the bank that I have accumulated on my toon over the years.  My only point is, I'd like to put that gear to use, rather than it wasting pixels in my bank.  I earned it, I got it, why can't I use it on a different toon?<br />
<br />
As far as paying to transfer that char off of that account and ebaying it...it should be easy to flag that gear with 'no transfer' flag once it has been given to another toon.<br />
<br />
Anyway, SOE will never do it, It's a pie in the sky dream.  So, no worries...<br />

You can already do this.  There's a hack for Macroquest that allows passing no drop gear through your shared bank.  It circumvents the &quot;NO DROP and NO RENT items cannot be placed in shared bank&quot; thing.  I don't think the creators of Macroquest condone this, but they can't really do anything to stop it.  I don't condone it either, but I also don't have any alts at all.  If I did have an alt, I might have a different perspective.</div></div><hr />

Great post.  MMORPG's have several glaring issues that hinder them from attracting new players:<br />
1) Recurring monthly fee<br />
2) Steep contiguous time commitments<br />
3) Rapidly outdated engine/gameplay (tertiary issue that I will ignore)<br />
<br />
#1 is a pretty big deal to many people, even when discussing a mere $15/month.  Why should I pay to play when I can get Halo 2 for $50 and not pay a fee? Etc etc...  Not much to be done about this- lifetime subscription maybe?  Still very offputting to people.<br />
<br />
#2 is a dealbreaker for the 25+ professional who just wants to relax for an hour or two after work in the evening.  This demographic has far more money than time.  The raid game is a non-starter for them, so are long instanced dungeons that eat up 3-4 hour blocks of time. Once they discover that this is what's required to progress, they give up and leave.<br />
<br />
I've been in WoW beta for months now and the game is getting more and more like EQ with each patch.  Slowing down progression, adding needless timesinks, tedium, etc...  At first I was really angry over what I saw as the &quot;EQing&quot; (is that a verb?) of the game.  Now I believe instead that Blizzard realizes that they may as well just go after the existing MMORPG crowd instead of trying to grow the market.  I thought WoW would break 1M subscribers initially, but in its current state it will prolly stabilize at 500K- no mean feat but hardly earth shattering.<br />
<br />
You would really have to break the MMORPG mold to create a game that is time friendly enough to attract new players but challenging enough to retain the current crowd.  The two are nearly mutually exclusive unfortunately.  Blizzard has created an evolutionary masterpiece, but the MMORPG Revolution has not yet arrived.</div></div><hr />

The problem is longevity. If they games dont have time sinks, and long committments, then a lot of people &quot;finish&quot; them too quickly and move on. Any game that wants to be around in a year HAS to have some method to keep its players logging in. Its not economical to pump out new content once a month, its probably not even possible to be that creative. <br />
<br />
If EQ1 had been much much easier, it would have burned out much much faster. The Diablo 2 model just doesnt apply to MMORPGs. Unless, of course, you want to pump out a free one with no monthly fee like B-Net. Already, I think a large reason we see such burnout in EQ1 is that the past 2 years have introduced many changes to &quot;dumb down&quot; the game and make it a LOT easier and faster-paces progression wise. There are still timesinks, but leveling certainly isnt a time-sink anymore.<br />
<br />
I am not going to say WoW isnt a great game. Nor will I say that about EQ2. I havent played either. I think Diablo 2 was a great game. So was Baldurs Gate and BG2. But I didnt play them for 5 years fairly steady. Lets face it, what kept me playing EQ1 for so long is LARGLY the time-sink involved.</div></div><hr />

You will definitely lose the crowd that has loads of time to pour into burning through content if there's nothing for them to do at level cap.  That market is pretty stagnant, however.  For EQ it peaked around 450K players and has declined ever since.  I don't think any other U.S. MMORPG even got that high, most are cannibalizing the existing customer base that loves the EQ model.  This has resulted in new games that the existing customer base wants to play but has not significantly attracted new blood into the MMORPG genre.<br />
<br />
 Lets face it, what kept me playing EQ1 for so long is LARGLY the time-sink involved.<br />
Which is why current and future MMORPGs are targeted primarily at your demographic.  The marketing apparently has shown that the potential for growth just isn't there given the issues I raised in my previous post.  Given that fact, you have a stable audience that has clear expectations about what a MMORPG should and should not be.  Update the graphics, remove some of the tedium and voila! you have a new MMORPG that will steal players from EQ1, DAOC, FF and L2.<br />
<br />
What you don't have is a game that will steal players from Halo 2, Half Life 2, GTA, Doom 3, etc...  And I don't mean to single out FPS, I'm simply pointing out games that will sell millions- the market is there but they haven't found a way to reach it yet.<br />
<br />
Halo 2 sold 2.38 million copies in under a week, generating $125 million in sales on day 1 (http://news.com.com/Halo+2+clears+125+million+in+first+day/2100-1043_3-5447379.html).<br />
<br />
That's why I consider a 500K subscriber game nothing special even though it's profitable.  Let me know when a MMORPG breaks the 2.38 million sales mark in the first week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Made the game easier and dumbed it down so you can get to the roadblock of locked content faster.  That was a double whammy that I think lead to at least my burnout on EQ.  Although I took 2 1/2 years to hit 65, but when I got there, I was done without performing sexual favors to get into an uber guild.<br />

Making it easier to get to the parts of the game that you can't get to.  Brilliant.</div></div><hr />

No way WoW will sell 500K units within the first week. Monthly fee's dont sit well with a large section of the gaming world. It is possible that WoW will have 500K units sold after a few months, but the real story will be how many subscribers they have after 6 months. If they are still growing after 6 months, I would say they are going to be a big success, but if they are seeing their subscriptions stagnate, or drop, then there could be trouble for them in the future.<br />
I know a regular group of people that log into DAoC, for the past 2/3 years now simply for the realm vs realm endgame.<br />
No one said PvP isnt good, its a question of how many people WANT to play that style of game. Look at EQ. MASSIVLY tipped toward the non-PvP style. But thats EQ. I am sure DAoC has quite a following for its Realm vs Realm aspect of the game, but just because I like onions on my pizza and you dont, that doesnt make either of us any better or worse. It makes us different. <br />
<br />
Again, this is what I am talking about when I refer to the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot; factor of a game. Lots of games can appeal to more and more people with some changes, and regardless of the financial result, I guess my question is &quot;should they?&quot; Do you know what some of the TOP TOP selling computer games of all time are? The Deer Hunter series. /chuckle, I rest my case. Different games appeal to different people. EQ1 has a following. can EQ2 or WoW take many of those people away? Who knows. But as each tries to appeal to more and more people, each will begin to resemble some &quot;middle&quot;, where a large chunk of the gaming population currently sits. <br />
I kinda think eq1 is a dead cause now for gaining new people. I do hope though that a proper successor to eq comes along one day .<br />
If there is one, its probably going to come from the people who created EQ in the first place. The name of this game is Vanguard. If they want more people in EQ1 they should stop releasing expansions that have little or no content for those under 45. It may be too late now but it was a critical error with GoD and OoW.<br />
Thats just it. SOE doesnt really WANT new players playing EQ. They want them in one of their other games, prefferably EQ2. They are hoping to grab some new people and hook them in for YEARS like EQ has done.<br />
You will definitely lose the crowd that has loads of time to pour into burning through content if there's nothing for them to do at level cap.  That market is pretty stagnant, however.  For EQ it peaked around 450K players and has declined ever since. This has resulted in new games that the existing customer base wants to play but has not significantly attracted new blood into the MMORPG genre.<br />
Still a helluva big chunk of folks Iz. Plenty of people to build a successful game around. Not everyone wants Diablo 2, just like not everyone wants Barbies Dream House.<br />
Which is why current and future MMORPGs are targeted primarily at your demographic.  The marketing apparently has shown that the potential for growth just isn't there given the issues I raised in my previous post. <br />
I assume you meant AREN'T targeted at my demographic, and I fully accept that assessment. I am NOT a part of the biggest, fattest, richest demographic in online computer gaming. But I am a part of a fairly sizable  demographic, plenty to have a game that appeals to our preference. If there is one thing that bugs me about the anti-EQ crowd, its how they bitch about INHERENT game traits, and want them changed and adjusted to fit THEIR specific style of play. At least now there are choices, and hopefully I wont have to listen to it anymore.<br />
That's why I consider a 500K subscriber game nothing special even though it's profitable.  Let me know when a MMORPG breaks the 2.38 million sales mark in the first week.<br />
Why? Why do you constantly come back to &quot;units sold&quot; as a basis for a games success Iz? Based on your theorys, Deer Hunter and Barbie Dream House are some of the BEST games in HISTORY! <br />

There is tons of content available for those under 45. New zones or new spells are not going to attract new people at that level. I seriously doubt that there is anyone out there who is saying &quot;WoW! The OoW expansion added 5 new under 45 zones and 60 under 45 spells!

<br />
What new expansions do is make the earlier parts of the game much easier, which is a good thing because good luck finding a group at that level. New content in those expansions is rightfully directed towards people allready playing the game, and most of those are 50+, probably 65-70. You expand the game for existing customers, new customers allready have a sea of content to choose from, they dont need more.<br />
<br />
Put it this way, if they made a new expansion solely for sub 45 players, how many copies do you think they will sell?</div></div><hr />

Yes I agree there's already a lot of content for under 45s, but that isn't why I was suggesting it. It's about inclusiveness and people feeling a part of things and not left out which is one of the main reasons people play social games like this to begin with.<br />
<br />
Also, I think Sony misunderstands the player base to an extent. They understand the need for high end content because many or most eventually reach the high end (Theoretically at least), but they don't understand that these same people often have low level alts which (even if it sounds silly) they take very seriously and want to feel a part of the game when playing that low toon.<br />
<br />
If they had just included a handful of minor spells for lower levels in GoD and OoW (and I agree they are not needed from a power point of view) and maybe a single lowish zone in each, it would have smoothed a lot of ruffled feathers.<br />
<br />
They need to understand it's not just a set of customers, it's a community. That level 23 over there has a big brother who plays a level 70 who has a room mate who is 35, and they all want to feel a part of things when a new expansion comes out.</div></div><hr />

True, though my point was only that content isn't necessarily required when the gameplay is enthralling enough. Also add in Planetside to this, absolutely 0 content but a fair few subscribers. But yeah it won't rock everyones boat and I disliked Planetside immensely.<br />

Based purely on the recent actions of the MMORPG game developers, your demographic, not mine, is the one most coveted.  I'm not sure why given the vastly higher pool of numbers and money in my demographic, but it is what it is.<br />
<br />
By the way, elementals opened yet? How about SRT? :)<br />
<br />
Why? Why do you constantly come back to &quot;units sold&quot; as a basis for a games success Iz? Based on your theorys, Deer Hunter and Barbie Dream House are some of the BEST games in HISTORY! <br />
Financially, yes they are.  Companies exist to earn a profit, or do you think SOE runs EQ as a charity?  SOE and Blizzard are apparently content if they can hit the 400-500K sustained subscriber mark.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure with those levels of subscribers they will be profitable- just not as profitable as they could be with some more changes.  Their actions simply reinforce my theory that their marketing has determined that the pool of people willing and able to play MMORPG's remains low but still profitable.  If Blizzard wanted a 1+ million sustained subscriber base they would have scrapped 90% of the changes they've made to the game in the last four months.  It stands to reason that since they've made changes to make the game more like EQ, the EQ demographic is the one they want.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mass appeal != good. It = good for some. There is no such thing as GOOD FOR ALL.<br />
I'm not aware anyone has stated otherwise.<br />
<br />
And don't get me wrong- I'm looking forward to playing WoW in retail with great anticipation.  I simply don't regard it as the One True Game.  It's more time friendly than any of the other current or future MMORPG's, but it's still a far cry from where it needs to be to sell the way a Halo 2 or Half-Life 2 will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">By the way, elementals opened yet? How about SRT? :)<br />
They didnt need to Iz, they made equal loot and XP available outside those zones in OoW. Just got a 195 hp/mana range item off a PG trial that I bet any basic, skilled group could do. A couple of those trials are basically doable with non-raid level gear, and drop Time quality items. Tons of EP level gear dropping in OoW zones too, or questable there. So yeah, I was wrong about the opening of teh zones, but ceratinly right on the availability of that level gear and XP. Honestly, last I checked, even ST wasnt &quot;opened&quot; but no one goes there because the loot and XP is inferior to other zones.<br />
Financially, yes they are.  Companies exist to earn a profit, or do you think SOE runs EQ as a charity?  SOE and Blizzard are apparently content if they can hit the 400-500K sustained subscriber mark.<br />
Of course they make a profit, but again, I will use the Barbie Dream House model. They could make MORE of a profit if they made &quot;Deer Hunter On Mars&quot; and took all the fancy models and had em prance across the screen for some nester in Tennessee to shoot at, but thats not a game I am interested in. The original EQ had a much smaller target market. As the game progresed, and SOE took it over, they began to &quot;Arcade&quot; it to attract a larger market. Ok, I dealt with it, since they kept pumping out respectable raid content. But if they are going to pump out a game targeted MOSTLY at the arcade crowd, I am probably not interested. Thats all I am trying to say. A company doesnt HAVE to target some lowest common denominator to make money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Sony's problem(s) with eq1.<br />
the game is now so easy there are complete newbies running around at lvl 65+.<br />
and by newbies I mean, the ones who follow the sos rogue around and then when they chain agro 15 mobs they run back to the raid instead of just dieing.<br />
the ones who dont know what a pbae is<br />
the ones who dont know that they get &quot;that&quot; spell...the one you are trying to get them to cast...the one you know they have even though you dont play the class.<br />
the ones with sneak who dont know about the secret handshake...and they are rogues.<br />
the ones who on raids say the following &quot;/rs whats ***?&quot; EVERY SINGLE TIME YOU USE A WORD OR A COMMON ABBREIVIATION THEY DONT KNOW<br />
<br />
and they do it 50 times a raid...even after you and every officer on has lost all patience and sent them direct tells to shut the **** up.<br />
<br />
endgame is now full of people who dont even know the basics of the game or their class because its so easy to get there.<br />
<br />
the flip side is the things SoE deliberatly makes insanly hard god spells anyone? pop backflags anyone? oow spells anyone?<br />
<br />
oow gets released and now people cant get their lvl 65 pop spells because noone is farming those mobs anymore...God spells are a joke, I only know one shaman with Balance and he farmed the hell out of god to get it. <br />
<br />
soe nerfs the grey because a few peeps with the skill to pbae (ok its really the chanters who need to be heads up but still) to the point where you cant exp in there because the mobs exp mod is so low you lose exp per kill (yeah I know thats not true) then they make zones like Greigs into hotspots...wait, GE is 90% 55 and under mobs...mobs that dont run when low hp...and have average resists...so with 2 chanters and 4 pbae classes you could pbae in a zone with a 180ish zem<br />
<br />
soe makes the game easy to play to the point that its to easy then makes parts so hard it pisses off those who have the skills and the know how. Ldon is a good example. sure I could farm ldon for eternity to get my rogue his MDoD from the EF one...or I could drop 50k or so for a weapon thats its equivalent in the baz. I can make 50k while I sleep...I cant farm the 4k ldon points I would need for the weapon and the 2 big augs it needs to be a good weapon.<br />
<br />
ldon would be fixed if they dropped the requirements for each camp and made it a general pool. because my toon needs 800 missions in ef somone else needs 600 missions from sro and so on.<br />
<br />
dont hold your breath that ldon will ever change. its a dead expansion and it aint getting any better.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but I think you are dead wrong on this one.  500k folks downloaded the open beta and played.  Several 100 thousand more wanted to get in and could not.  These are folks that in most cases paid $15 to get a fileplanet account so they could download the huge file in a few hours off the high speed servers.  I personally know folks that stuck with the &quot;free&quot; download servers and spent over a day downloading in order to get into beta.  This is a rabid fan community, not a bunch of drive bys.  Also, have you seen the number of international fan sites that are already up?  There are dozens.  Safe to say there are thousands of hard core players all over the world, pre-launch.<br />
<br />
500k at release, yup, low estimate in my opinion.  Does it really matter, hell no.  Regardless of the numbers, it will be a smooth launch and a great game.  Anyone who believes otherwise, well, prepare to be surprised.</div></div><hr />

This is the kind of thing I would prefer they NOT do. I really do not want SOE wasting programming resources on old zones. I would much rather that time be spent fixing the more current contents bugs and creating new content. <br />
<br />
I will agree that they could make the loot in  Original EQ zones, Kunark and Velious a BIT more attractive, and I think Fabled mobs was a fantastic step in that direction, but we all saw what happened there. It just wouldnt be reasonably possible to to this without a MAJOR revamp of the zones themselves, and speaking for myself, I have been to Lower Guk, Old Seb and Kael as much as I really care too. <br />
<br />
What would be sharp would be more LDoN options, a couple camps in Kunark and Velious with new dungeons, new adventures, and new loot. I think the original LDoN brought a lot of people into the older zones to play more. Another option would be expanding the &quot;hot zone&quot; concept more, to encourage people to explore without having to re-itemize and re-vamp. <br />
<br />
Its a real catch-22 situation to be sure, but speakin for myself, I think the future of EQ1 is in new content, not re-hashed old content. They re-did CT, Droga, etc, and still no one really goes to those zones much, except loot farmers. I think the same thing would happen to almost any pre-PoP zone they &quot;re-vamped&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I will agree that Blizzard has a rabid fan base, but you hav to agree that a LARGE portion of that fan base is in the 14-18 year old demographic, and these people will need to convince their parents to pay for subscriptions. This is Blizzards first attempt and breaking into the &quot;pay per month&quot; genre, and while I agree the game will be a success, and have an excellent opening, the real test will be how many accounts they have after a few months. <br />
<br />
500K is a lot of units. This isnt Diablo, with free B-Net. While I am guessing they WILL hit 500K, I am skeptical it will be the first week, despite these &quot;indicators&quot; people keep pointing at. Won't be long until we find out though. Tuesday is opening day, and if they have 500K by Sunday, I will gladdy admit I was WAY wrong.</div></div><hr />

Not sure where you're getting your demographic numbers from, but hey, whatever you say.  My friends and I, all over 30, have been playing Blizzard games for several years and I am yet to be disappointed.  And, I'm sorry if I missed it, but when did the EQ fan base get so mature?  Age alone does not indicate maturity or player ability.<br />
<br />
I think many folks think that the WoW fan base is simply the Diablo players (which I played for over a year, got 4 different characters thru the game, my main finished all three difficulty levels, go Paladins).  Take the Diablo, Warcraft fan base, and add all the folks that tried EQ or some other MMORPG but did not care for it, or played for some time and are tired of it and are currently looking for a new MMORPG.  How many 100 thousands of ex-EQ players are still looking for an MMORPG they can enjoy?   Quite a few I'd say.  Many will try WoW just to see if it is a better fit for them.  Some will think so, others won't, but the numbers will be huge.<br />
<br />
My buddies and I will be there on Tuesday.  Guild - Armoured Justice, current membership, 23, server unknown at this time.  Feel free to check us out and join us.</div></div><hr />

Left over a year ago, sold my account and my uber 100+ aa 65 shaman.<br />

Made a new one about three months ago. I watched movies while grinding solo for 1-58 then joind a group of friends in a tiny guild of casuals for 59-65. Have ALOT more HP now than I did before, at only half the aa. And I don't play near as often as I used to. <br />

Took me about 1% of the brain power to make a 65 shammy the second time. I chalk half of that up to prior experience as a high-end raider, the other half to being able to purchase 100+hp/mana and +10 to every resist on damned near every slot I have in my inventory. <br />

This is no longer of interest to me.  All they had to do to keep my crew and I was to open locked zones, or at least provide an alternate way in to experience the content we purchased.  They did not and WoW launches tomorrow.  Easy decision.  If WoW goes down the same road we'll dump it as well.<br />

A company doesnt HAVE to target some lowest common denominator to make money.<br />
Never said they did.  But if they want to make more money than what they can get from a narrow demographic they have to broaden their appeal.  WoW definitely has broader appeal than EQ, but not significantly so in my estimation.  Blizzard would need to remove most of the changes made in the last 3-4 months to capture more of the mass market.<br />
<br />
I'm eagerly waiting for the WoW sales numbers to come out next week, month and year.  I'm still predicting no higher than 500K subscribers once the game stabilizes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">The game has been dumbed down, I would say, because there are no zones made for level 70 players that actually force you to do more then single pull. Now, I do try to EXP in what ever zones there are, I do try to do things that most people do not. I try to do plenty of things just to do them, my gear isnt great, but I was merely saying, if I want good exp, and all of that, I have to get in one of the boring exp groups because thats all people do because thats all sony has ever given people to do.<br />

Oh, and I would like to know who gave me a neg rep bump for my post a way up.</div></div><hr />
