<br />
Just from reading all about it on The Crucible and various other forums im wondering if too much is expected of it.<br />
<br />
Hope for a lot of peoples sake it turns out to be as good as they hoped.<br />
<br />
Remember the pre DAoC etc and how that was going to be the answer to peoples problems with EQ.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah, same thing happened with shadowbane.  However, WoW has sustained its hype for longer than any other game I've ever seen, and its hype actually increases every day.  It is in open beta with the NDA lifted, and the only negative reviews I've seen are from the b.net kiddies that want a RTS game.  Also, unlike Mythic and whatever company made shadowbane, Blizzard has a track record of making nothing but excellent games.  Even if you don't like RTS games, if you have played wc3 you know it is a masterpiece of the genre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you will only be disappointed if you wanting a game like eq, wow is nothing like eq, and does not claimed to be, is it better thatn eq? undoubtly, but it is not the same as eq, it is a very different game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Blizzard has made nothing but fun games since day 1. One thing you have to do is let go of your desire for another EQ. Open yourself to new experiences and judge them on their own worth, not how they measure up to something else.<br />
<br />
WoW has alot of potential. Honestly it sounds more like the real EQ, then this over bloated, uncaring machine that EQ has now turned into.<br />
<br />
EQ .. Everquest.<br />
<br />
Where does quests fall into EQ anymore? Where can you do anything in this game at a 55+ level that doesnt require you to sit in some lame zone for 100 hours farming EXP and AA. The progression in this game is a torture test to get you the next AA or the next level so you can band together ( god forbid you want to be alone ) with 80 other people and kill uber mob_1 for uberloot_30  so you can kill uber mob_2 for uber loot_59.<br />
<br />
Look at the 1-50 game, then look at the 60+ game. <br />
<br />
In WoW, its more designed to be a smooth progression where your not tortured. Everything you do is quest related pretty much and those quests yield significant EXP and reward. So instead of going to Dreadland 2.0 or 3.0 and being tortured so you can get to the next level of content, you just smoothly progress through the game, atleast this is the goal of the game. That is the only &quot;let down&quot; they have to worry about as far as im concerned.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, WoW looks to be more interesting then any other online rpg on the horizon and i have always enjoyed Blizzards humor, imigination and game design. Im hopeful, but not getting too excited. Over hype is a bad thing.</div></div><hr />

Translation: <br />
It's going to be far too easy for a person to level a character...<br />
<br />
No thanks... I prefer a challenge, not a gimme.<br />
<br />
I have yet to see anything about WoW that would appeal to me, and IMO WoW is just being hyped up as much as all of the other EQ killers who failed miserably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm, i dont see how that translates to how hard or easy it is. No telling how hard or easy anything is going to be. I think we have to wait for that answer.<br />
<br />
Though i will say this much about the EQ killer comment. There was a difference in the past. In the past everyone though a game or 2 would be BETTER then EQ and at the time EQ was a rocking game. Now alot of people WANT to leave and are begging for something just descent to come along. I think its a matter of timing for WoW and the time is right. Besides, i dont think anyone wants a &quot; EQ killer&quot; we just want a good game. EQ aint it IMHO ATM.<br />
<br />
We will see i guess though :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Me personaly though, if its even close to a good game on its on respect, im so gone its not even funny. I would be gone right now if i wasnt strapped for cash ( buying a new truck and want to pay cash ). Which in a few weeks ill be back to having cash again so either way im 1 foot out the door heh.<br />
<br />
But any who, WoW defintly wont be for everyone no matter how good it is.<br />
<br />
Enjoy what you enjoy. Peace.</div></div><hr />

LoL Aruman! I agree that I want a challenge (this is an area where I think GoD shines). But there's a difference between torture and endless frustration, and a challenge. <br />
<br />
It sounds like you haven't been following the WoW forums. Note that there is no NDA in effect, the testers who are *playing* the game are all free to talk about their experiences and they are doing so quite actively. The result is the most exciting bunch of writeups I've heard in ages. I'm looking forward to this one with real interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like opening a can of beans with a paper clip as its much more challenge than a tin opener. <br />
I have high hopes for WoW, eq lost its appeal for me, WoW might be able to recapture that. And hopefully unlike other wanabee eqlike games it will provide a fun challenge to levelling up rather than just providing a levelling curve and hoping it hooks you.</div></div><hr />

When you make a mmorpg, you can't just cater to one type of player.  You need to cater to them all, the casual once a week sort of player, the hardcore 8-14 hours a day sort of player and all in between.  The main problem is, to give content to the high end player they need to have stuff to do for a extended period of time.  This in itself is difficult to pull off without putting in &quot;timesinks&quot; or &quot;boring repetitive exp&quot;.  SWG had characters that were too easy to max, and thus it wasn't considered a very good game.  (Note, i'm going off releases here.  I never played it beyond that).  Thus, the problem: What can do the do allow both casual and hardcore players to enjoy the game, and for an extended period of time?  Unfortauntly the cap in beta is only 30 at the moment so we do not know about the high end content.  Until i've really heard abou tall aspects of the game, I refuse to decide if it's going to be a eq killer or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's better business to cater toward the casual player who can only invest maybe 2-3 hours a day, tops (as the average age of gamers is rising, and they'll only be able to play for a few hours in a sitting before having to do other things, like work, family, school, etc) than the hardcore player who can invest a good 8-12 hours a day, easy.<br />
<br />
Why so? Simple really. If the player that can only put forth 2-3 hours a day, gets rewards worth the time invested, they are more willing to tell others about it and get groups together (see: word of mouth advertising, unbeatable), will stick around longer (because they will be more rewarded in the process, even if, as a whole, it takes longer, as such, more income), and lower the company's bottom line, because they don't have to force out expansions every 6 months because the 2-3 hour/day player doesn't burn through the content like it's going out of style.<br />
<br />
As such... is why EQ has to have an expansion every 6 months which is a load of junk, whereas WoW (if catered to the 2-3 hour/day player), can have an expansion once a year, that's of the highest quality possible.<br />
<br />
EQ is quantity &gt; quality. I'll take quality &gt; quantity, any day of the week. Add into the fact the EQ devs seem to need a whack upside the head by a clue-by-four, and... well... doesn't take a brain surgeon to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Do I have an MBA? No, maybe that's why I have some common sense. However, I am unemployed, so any company that wants some help in common sense... give me a call! *laughs*</div></div><hr />

I guess that depends on where you are at in the game. I am enjoying the higher end content in GoD.<br />
<br />
To me, EQ isn't about loot and rewards, it's about the challenges.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What challenges? It's the same old mindless dribble we've had for the last 5 years? The only &quot;challenge&quot; they introduce involves making it do more damage... whoopy. Real challenge there. Too bad in order to &quot;progress in challenges&quot;, you have to &quot;be bored stupid&quot; with the same &quot;old challenges&quot; over, and over, and over, and over, and over, until everybody slated for the &quot;new challenge&quot; can at least remotely handle it.<br />
<br />
All the devs do is feed on greed. You cannot do any &quot;challenging encounter&quot; with everybody naked, based on skill alone. Skill doesn't matter anywhere near as much as &quot;sitting around, doing nothing but item farming&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Interesting... From what I have heard in EQ, several more advanced guilds from EQ were given 30 reserved Beta slots each.<br />
<br />
Does that sound like Blizzard is more interested in the casual gamer market?</div></div><hr />

Depending on what happens between now and the end of Fan Faire (and the reports posted from it)... and depending on how clueless the devs still are... that seems to be more and more likely as the weekend closes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Challenge in eq where?!! Damn I must have missed that when playing. The real challenge if one must be found is that of the macro dynamics of a raid or the ability to deal with lagfest areas with a less than adequate graphics card. <br />
<br />
Hardcorism, theres an interesting subject. I was hardcore in eq for a while, only because you had to put so much time in to get anything. I don't know if it should be a required requisite for a game. I mean one benefit hardcores supply is more of a consistent online audience which the ability to get groups and the chances of interacting with others. Although thats not necessary. <br />
<br />
Thinking about I guess in a way, hardcorism is impossible to avoid in a typical mmorg formula, when sessions are so nonlinear and the difficulty of seperating the unlimited time period into recognizable chunks of time that can be meaningful and satisfying to play. So people try to use satisfaction as a measure, but when satisfaction is a measure time is no longer an issue.<br />
<br />
I think there could be tools to reduce hardcorism, for example there could be a high ease in making social arrangements online in a mmorpg, and the issue of someone having to log should be more of a nonissue than like eq. The ability to leave messages and engage in chat in the game without logging on I think would also be 2 useful features as well as an ease of making social arrangements with people of different time periods. With these measures, more meaningful time periods could be created.<br />
<br />
I think in a way eq has unwillingly nurtured the playing of a hardcore audience, and its almost seen as an expectation of future mmorpgs when it could be not the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess you didn't play EQ from Day 1, when you lost a bubble and a half of exp when you died, and there wasn't a cleric who had reached res level yet. Yes, levelling was a challenge.<br />
<br />
Now, dumb down the game where it is easier to level (WoW) and look at how the game will be later. You think it's easy to level in EQ now... wait until WoW reaches 5 years old (if it does).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I don't think any MMOG can cater to casual players and be successful.  Communities are built around people that play these games a TON.  Even in lower level guilds you typically have a few players that are always on.  If every time you logged on you met someone new and were not able to form friends, I don't think it would last long.  It is the community that is KEY to successful game.  And for that you really need the people that play a ton.  THough they don't necessarily have to be hardcore.<br />
<br />
As for WoW?  I don't know.  I have only been on the server that some WoW fanatics glued together to work with the beta client.  But the obvious effot and care put into the world is breathtaking.  <br />
<br />
A game with that much care and effort put into it, just cannot be bad.  I know that doesn't seem logical, but that is just the feeling you get.  The people that are making this game LOVE it.  It isn't just a job for them.  This game is truly a work of art.<br />
<br />
As for the longevity of the game?  I don't know.  I hope it will be able to keep me busy for a long time to come.  I believe that it will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A faster leveling game from the outgo isn't a bad thing really.  It IS a different style from eq, but is that so awful?<br />
I expect wow to be somewhere closer to blizzards own diablo games than everquest.  Does that mean people wont play the game for years? Probably not.  I do expect that people will play a lot of classes though.  And if there are substantial variations on the same class, people will probably play the same class several times.  Its not that one way is fun and the other isn't, one will just appeal more to given individual.<br />
I find the unending sameness of everquest a fairly big downside, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I find the unending sameness of everquest a fairly big downside, myself.<br />
<br />
In all fairness, though, 5 years is about 10 LIFETIMES for most computer games. Lets face it, there is sameness in EQ, but nothing like the repetitive nature of Diablo 2. I loved Diablo, don't get me wrong, but it got OLD very very fast. The pure vastness of EQ can keep it fresh for a lot of people. <br />
<br />
I am not putting too many high hopes into WoW. I will wait, play the game, and see. I agree with Giac somewhat that its kinda hard to say how good or bad the game is, its FAR FARtoo early to tell.</div></div><hr />

I disagree.  Ive hated many of blizzard games as i find them to be wholey uncreative and simply stamped out games similar to whats already been done, to me their almost as bad as micro$oft's gaming track record (lineage 2 = blah).  Ill wait till its out a while before i even consider wow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Heh... Obviously Kylt came into EQ later... <br />
<br />
Levelling in EQ was never &quot;challenging&quot;.  <br />
<br />
But why are you comparing WoW to how EQ was 5 years ago?  Blizzard doesn't have to compete against day 1 EQ, it has to compete against EQ *as it is now*.<br />
<br />
Is EQ challenging?  Sometimes.  Mostly because of messed up content and poorly finished design concepts, not because of well-designed challenging situations.  The primary challenge in EQ is to work around and push through bad design decisions and unfinished content.  Raid main assist anyone?  Uqua?<br />
<br />
As for levelling in WoW - no, it's not hard to level.  It requires time.  Levelling in most MMRPGs isn't a challenging affair - people naturally migrate to the easier content that will provide the best, quickest, most risk-free xp, while avoiding the challenging content until it's more trivial.<br />
<br />
In EQ, levelling is just a grinding process and it always has been.   Go kill these mobs from 1-5, these from 6-10, etc, etc.  In WoW you don't have to grind if you don't want to.  You can gain half a level doing available delivery quests.  You can get a quest that requires mobs drops from a certain part of the forest.  The &quot;grinding&quot; feeling, while not altogether gone sometimes, is alleviated by a variety of tasks and stories.  <br />
<br />
Some of the stories are quite involved.  For example one quest might start with a delivery to a guard in the city.  You're asked to carry a letter.  If you right click the letter, presto there's a 20 page &quot;report&quot; you can read which describes the situation of the zone that you've just started questing in.  The lore is easy to get to, you don't have to run around the new city hailing 200 mobs to figure out which ones will talk to you.<br />
<br />
It truly is a great deal of fun.  Remember &quot;fun&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>vuulk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">The quest/exp system (from what I read, no first hand experiance) seems to be far more interesting than anything EQ has delivered.  I have seen a lot of EQ, not all but many encounters turn into DPS vs Healing.  The annoying encounters seem to interest me the most.  The time sinks are the biggest turn off to me, mainly anything dealing with SoL.  Any body curious about WoW should take  a look at some of the quests, they seem very intresting, especially the elite (I think this is what they are called)  challenges, I read a couple that were very challenging but you didnt need 72 people for it.   Anyway, as mentioned many times in the past, Blizzard innovates through refinement and I for one can not wait for WoW.  I will definately will play unless the beta turns it into another EQ/DAOC/AO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Let me tell you all a little story about EQ's level of &quot;fun&quot;. About 8 months ago, I took a break from the game, and dusted off Diablo 2 to check out the new stuff they had added. During my time there, I met a married couple that hung around in the same chat channel I hung out in. This channel was usually filled with more mature adult type people, rather than the typical punk-snot nose &quot;l33t&quot; kids that tend to gravitate toward games like D2. We chatted quite a bit, I told them about EQ, they said they had heard of it, but never tried it. I recommended they give it a try, and even told them what server I played on and my characters names. <br />
<br />
Then we lost touch. I went back to EQ, and the times I stopped in to see them, they werent around. After asking the channel if anyone knew where they were, I was told they went to try EQ and no one saw them since. Since I didnt know their characters names I sorta hoped all was well.<br />
<br />
Then, one day, out of the blue, I am running through PoK, petitioning to buy a KEI, and I get a tell &quot;Do you remember Dan and Lilly from Diablo?&quot;. Of course I said yes, and we got together. After saying our hellos, I checked out their characters. Their gear was super sucky, I mean SERIOUSLY bad. But both were in their low 50s already, without being PLed, without getting any twink gear, without knowing anyone. They were TRUE noobies. <br />
<br />
And guess what. They couldnt stop thanking me for turning them on. They loved the game so much it was amazing. They told me about mobs they had killed, tradeskills they were working on. The husband was so proud of his research skill, and was asking me if I had any pages for his Necro spells. The guy was wearing an Advisor Robe at level 51. She was a Shaman, and didnt have any Tae Ew at 53. I mean, they had some REALLY bad stuff on, stuff you dont even loot when it drops. <br />
<br />
Well, I was dumbfounded, and it really showed me how strong a game EQ really is. True noobies, and they were absolutely hooked, totally. I had them run to the Bazaar, and emptied my mule for them. I logged in my twinks and gave them a few things. I got them some missing spells (note: neither had all their spells, not even all the purchased ones. They just couldnt buy them). I showed them a few places to farm easy plat, and showed them a few zones they could get loots for themselves. I had them e-mail me, and sent them all kinds of links. We still keep in touch, even though they are barely 60 and I am in an EP guild. I sometimes log in twinks to hang with them, etc. <br />
<br />
EQ is a totally amazing game people. Extremely immersive, incredibly huge, and as complicated or simple as you want to make it. Our problem is we have been playing too long, and as a result, our eyes are jaded with pessimism. We just dont see the forest anymore, cause all the damn trees are in the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I realize the WoW beta is only a level 1-30 game at the moment, but doesn anyone have an idea of what the high end content will be?  Lots of &quot;raid&quot; style zones, etc?<br />
<br />
The one concern I have is the staying power of WoW, most folks have given it great reviews, but many have ripped through the first 30 levels pretty quick it seems.  Also, the reports are that the same quests are used for any class of a given race, so replay is not quite as high (although class specific quests supposedly are going in).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Interesting... From what I have heard in EQ, several more advanced guilds from EQ were given 30 reserved Beta slots each.<br />
<br />
Does that sound like Blizzard is more interested in the casual gamer market?<br />
Yes, this has me worried also.  If they want to follow SOE's policy of throwing a major GFY to the casual player that can't or won't raid, I wish they'd just announce it now.  Self-absorbed, bombastic buffoons like Furor are not the sort I want influencing game design.  <br />
<br />
I think I read somewhere that raids would use instanced dungeons and weren't going to require 4+ hours and 70+ people to complete.  Wish I could find the link again.  Who knows, maybe even casuals can raid in WoW.<br />
<br />
As for those trying to convince one side or the other, who cares?  You like EQ? Fine, play EQ.  You sick to death of EQ?  Jump ship as soon as WoW launches.<br />
<br />
I'm interested in how Blizzard will handle their first post-launch class balance issue.  Will they &quot;monk&quot; a class a la SOE?  Will they &quot;shaman&quot; classes that were powerful initially?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Every single WoW beta report I've read have said how amazing the game is. However, they all have one common theme:<br />
<br />
They all focused on SOLOING.<br />
<br />
Yup. I went to this place then this place, then I killed this and this, collected this and completed a quest for item and exp! OMGZ GRAPHICS PWN.<br />
<br />
The ONE report that I've read that talked about grouping said that basically, they grouped up for 10 minutes, finished a quest, then left.<br />
<br />
This does not foster a community that has been built in EQ. In EQ, the game was challenging enough that I had to ask for help (or directions) or whatever when I was lvl 4, immediately building relationships. I got into my first group when I was lvl 7 in blackburrow. Friendships were built from these first days, and that's what made the game fun. That's what made EQ what it is today. It's the community that makes the game. Hell, if I was grouped with fun people, I could grind exp, endlessly pulling the same mobs and it'd be hella fun. I'd come back tomorrow and do the same thing for 8 hours if my group mates kept things fun. I'd probably play WoW for about 5 months...then leave (much like I did with D2) because there's no reason to come back.<br />
<br />
If WoW focuses solely on soloing, then it will fail.<br />
<br />
And yea, it's too easy to level in WoW, there were lvl 30 characters within 2 days of beta release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I dont think it's possible to really judge WoW at this point, not until the end game is reached anyway. If people really have been leveling up that quickly since the beta went live, I'd think that would a point of concern though. Every game has to have an ultimate goal that people strive for, whether it be reaching a high level, getting gear, beating an encounter, showing superior skill in PvP or whatever. If it is something anyone can do in 3 weeks, I doubt people will be playing any game for any length of time. In this genre of games a successfull business model has to have a hook to keep the paying customers coming back, or it is not going to be in business for long. Ultimately there are going to be time sinks in WoW, there has to be if it is going to be a success. I think it is too early to say what those might be, it sounds like they have this level 30 cap to stop you from seeing that part of the game. I would guess that the rapid level is in place to get people into the game, sort of an advertisment, and the real game will unfold beyond 30. But we don't know what form that might be yet. Given that it is a PvE game, I'd be very surprised if it isn't similar to EQ in general style though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">And what was the highest level Beserker after 2 days in EQ?<br />
How many flags did they have?<br />
<br />
I am thinking of jumping ship to WoW if it looks good. <br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Well, first grouping with a good group can be great, but how many people have had terrible groups, people that dont know their class, have absolutely no skill, go afk for long periods of time etc. I hate being FORCED to group, once upon a time I could solo if I wanted to, if I had no friends on I could could do something and get somewhere, now in EQ that is all gone.  Why has grouping been forced upon us in EQ, for one reason, to make the most of the limited available content, so that there can be less mobs, smaller zones and the largest number of players participating (I mean 6 frogs in Plane of Storms, what was Sony thinking? who XPs in the forests on the trees or bears?). When PoP first came out in the 1st zone sometimes you couldnt buy a mob to kill there where so many in the zones.<br />
<br />
Quests, quests in EQ are a joke, go talk to this guy, go kill 100+ mobs so that the 3 items you need drop or go buy them in the bazaar for some ridiculous price, then go back to guy and get reward. Then repeat, repeat, repeat. On a similar note GM events, those near mythical occurances, basically some bizarre NPC comes along slaughtering everyone and then some uber group shows up and slaughters it for the 1 piece of loot that drops and then event over. Reward to the 50 characters that helped, got killed, tried to talk to this thing, nada. Wow great.<br />
<br />
What am I looking for in WoW?<br />
<br />
The ability to do SOME things solo if I CHOOSE, if I want a group I group, if not I do something else I dont want to have to sit around for ages waiting for some class to log on so we can play.  &quot;Just looking for a tank, ask your guilds&quot; sound familar to anyone playing in LDON?<br />
<br />
Quests that have a real reward and progress the story line, not the mindless flag progression that EQ has in PoP. Go gather 70 strangers so we can get flagged for the next plane so we can get another 70 people to kill the next event to get access to the next zone. BAH I am in a small guild and PoP is pretty lame for us, praise to the few people running pickup raids on Prexus.  I wont mention GoD because I havent any of it at this stage. <br />
<br />
Appropriate areas for the level, Any low level players sick of the Anniversary skeletons owning you in the newbie zones? How much of the loot they drop is going to new players and how much to twinks?<br />
Oh yeah and that reminds me, a couple of years ago we got a Halloween event and what did we get ... skeletons (mostly as I remember). How about some originality, are skeletons the only model that doesnt stress the servers or something? Maybe for easter we have the skeleton bunny running around dropping eggs.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah and finally class and item balance. How much brains does it take to tune the fabled items BEFORE you put them in the game rather than after a bunch of people spent hours camping something that is now useless to their character for 20+ levels, as well as changing some of the effects too. I do not understand why the fabled items needed to be modified after they went live, who forgot to put the rec levels on them in the first place? And to go along with Item balance the massive difference in gear that low level alts have compared to new players. Kinda hard here as I twinked most of my low level alts, but still. In EQ I hate the fact that without class X available you are screwed, no XP for you. And if you get in a bad group basically you sucker someone else to join so you can escape, otherwise you feel guilty for spoiling 5 other peoples fun (assuming they are enjoying themselves).<br />
<br />
It doesnt have to be WoW, but I have centainly enjoyed blizzard games in the past. I still enjoy EQ but I think it be so much more than what it is today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly this kind of attitude annoys me. Yeah, lots of quests are kill and fetch affairs, but others are thought out, complicated events involving tradeskills, spawning and triggering, faction, etc etc. The big REASON that EQ Quests have become a joke is the internet itself. Want to do a quest? Head to EQ Spoiler Site of your choice and print out a full walk-through. No need to even read the text the NPCs give you anymore. I recently did an 8th shawl and I can honestly say I barely read ANY of the related text. Why? Because I had all the responses and items and turn-ins and combines listed RIGHT in front of me. Hell I didnnt even &quot;Hail&quot; half the NPCs, just walked up and said &quot;I will help you kill wolf_01&quot; or simply handed them the turn in without saying a word. Yeah, that quest was a joke, all right. <br />
<br />
EQ is as easy or as hard as you want to make it. In the beginning, there werent 1,000 sites dedicated to the game. You learned stuff by doing it. You learned quests by reading the story. I still know the story to the original Paladin Firey Avenger quest. Know why? Cause I did it when it WASN'T completely spoiled. I was one of the guys trying to figure it out. Came close too, got something like the 8th one in all of EQ. <br />
<br />
WoW will be great for a while, but the game will get spoilered out FAST. All Blizzard games do. The game will be as easy or hard as YOU wish to make it.</div></div><hr />

Well then I suggest that you stay far away from WoW as Tigole is one of the Blizzard guys now.<br />

You may agree or disagree with how people Like Furor see the game but at least they have a clue about it, Something that sadly can not be said about the current SoE dev team.</div></div><hr />

This gives the developers a chance to make it actually challenging.<br />
<br />
When Furor and Fires of Heaven discovered that some particular aspect of content's reward wasn't &quot;worth&quot; the effort it took to accomplish it, the word went out and people avoided &quot;wasting&quot; their time if it wasn't actually beneficial/required to achieving the next plateau. They were also the most vocal about things that WERE required to reach the next plateau but were insanely broken as far as risk/reward or time invested were concerned.<br />
<br />
Say what you will about Furor's personality...I don't know the guy personally. However, I do hold an amount of respect for him and his allies for their perspective on content. They really did understand what was broken or not. They were not just wanting everything handed to them on a silver platter.</div></div><hr />

Given enough time even a monkey could make it to 65 and 100s of AA. The &quot;difficult&quot; thing is having enough freetime.<br />

Furor hardly understands &quot;gaming overall&quot; the way I see it. Sure he knows a lot about Everquest. But his focus is on raid content because he likes to be the leader of the most successful guild. I suspect he wants things difficult to lessen the amount of competition for that #1 spot not because it makes for a fun game.<br />

Yes, some came from grinding, but far from all of them.<br />
<br />
I did not get those AA PL'd by a bard, I think maybe 10-20 are from some AE groups in one of the Luclin zones, but that's it.<br />
<br />
They came from working to gain them. Like killing 2-3 Guards in PoFire at the same time, instead of one at a time. You know, things that are a challenge, instead of a yawn. Instead of grinding, make it something to challenge/push your abilities.<br />
<br />
They also came from working on the LDoN Charm Stone, AA wasn't bad in there considering the difficulty, especially on high risk.<br />
<br />
Soloing in Barindu for quest items... tough mobs to solo. Challenging.<br />
<br />
Helping guildmates complete various quests in GoD, fun and challenging, it's all new content!<br />
<br />
I have no idea why people equate high AA to grinding AA, so come up with something better than that hehe.<br />
<br />
Current Challenge... Uqua... rough mobs, an AE that makes people ask for stat buffs again. Argh... Give us more gem slots SoE!<br />

It's all how you see the game I suppose, but to me, EQ is far from boring.</div></div><hr />

Do this quest, then move over here, say this this this for extra skill point, move there, do this quest...<br />
<br />
Same as in EQ. The epic quests were GREAT. It was great till I got stuck and succumbed to the spoiler sites...then it was just going through the motions.<br />
<br />
Yeah, WoW will be something new, but spoiler sites will pop up and things will go downhill.<br />
<br />
And on grouping...right now in WoW, THERE IS NO POINT TO GROUPING. You get exp slower, have to kill more stuff to finish quests...etc. You don't even chat with the people because you are in and out in 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
Guild bonding experience is when you spend hours and hours helping each other on emp keys and VT shards. Sure, people might call it a stupid timesink, but for many guilds, it fostered the cooperation, loyalty and dedication for moving through the planes. I personally believe it's this reason and not because of gear that guilds that progress through VT do better in the planes. This relates to WoW because if everything is easy, there'll be no community, everyone will be out for themselves because that's how it's most efficiently done. Guilds will fold at the first sight of tough times...because hell, I can solo everything anyways.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe they have a clue about EQ as it is played by the majority of its players.  They are to be associated with the Monty Haulism that split raiders from non-raiders which has effectively broken the game for the non-raider.<br />
<br />
So I think that anyone who thinks that Furor and his minions has worthwhile expertise to be consulted is simply revealing their own ignorance about the state of EQ.  You, and the other Furor fans, might try taking the blinkers off occasionally and looking around you.</div></div><hr />

I totally agree with you Kor. Look at their fiasco that was Diablows 2. I mean come on when you can go to a vendor and &quot;gamble&quot; on an item and get one of the top items in the game and the gold is pointless unless you need to repair items or buy potions. To me, That would be like telling someone &quot;Sorry, I don't want your 120kpp for my Fungi, I want an Orante Chain Tunic pattern&quot; That kind of system doesn't work cause people just get screwed in the end. Especially with the Stone of Jordan ring dupes and hacks that were going around for 2 years. Personally, I think Blizzard should keep their cartoony crap in RTS game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">In the beginning, there werent 1,000 sites dedicated to the game. <br />
<br />
<br />
there's still only a few quality sites.  most have been around longer than most current players and a number predate the launch of the game (from beta)<br />
<br />
of course there were always discussion groups.  I certainly remember message boards detailing paths through highpass etc in march/april 99.<br />
<br />
the game was harder but hardly more challenging.  it's chiefly a matter of MUDflation, dramatically lowered death penalty, experience modifiers.  it's not like any mmpog takes skill but certainly UO even DAOC are harder &quot;skillwise&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't think it's a question of how fast content gets &quot;spoiled.&quot;  there very few explorers out there, everyone is a follower.  I mean it takes 1 guy to figure the spear of fate but I'll be damned if every single guy who loots that tear and does the hand-in doesn't feel a sense of accomplishment.  in short what EQ/MMPOG is good at is making everyone feel like a hero in some way, regardless of skill, intelligence etc.<br />
<br />
btw Blizzard has stated publicly that WoW was in large measure &quot;ready&quot; for beta more than 2 years ago mechanically... and that the last 2 years has been about adding and tweaking a massive amount of content.  it's the one mmpog that actually has the resources of a large developer behind it to make sure it has enough game when it launched to compete with mature mmpog on the market</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Actually, for those of you who are talking about the super fast levelling etc, that was due to certain xp bonuses applied at the start to get people testing the higher (read, lvl 20-30) content.  They've now started toning down the rate of xp gain, and you should listen to the moaning from the MMOG virgins about how slow lvling is becoming. WoW (as it appears to be shaping up) isn't going to be a &quot;level up to 30+ in 1 day&quot; type game.  It's going to take a bit longer to level up than people were initially posting, but the difference is that even when killing mobs, you're generally doing it with a couple of quest goals in your journal.<br />
<br />
And personally, I like the idea of having a high end to aim for.  EQ would be a heck of a lot more boring if I didn't have that goal to strive for.  Some content is kinda excruciating (who enjoys doing Rathe raise your hand) but it's pretty hard to beat the feeling when your guild is working like a well-oiled machine with less-than-optimal numbers, and still pulls off a hard target. If people like Furor and Tigole etc can help to keep that feeling going, then I'm all for having them on the WoW team.</div></div><hr />

The problem is if they design the content in WoW to cater to one style of play, the fulltime &quot;EQ is my 2nd job&quot; raider, and force everyone into that playstyle if they want to advance past a certain point.  You'll know they've made the same mistake as EQ when they start releasing expansions aimed at the casual player or the raid player, but not both.  <br />
<br />
Furor and his ilk have only their own narrow interests at heart- they couldn't care less if the rest of the game falls to pieces around them as long as they have exclusive content for them (which they burn through at an insane pace and then complain for more) and they can keep themselves apart from the &quot;riffraff&quot; that makes up the vast majority of the paying playerbase.<br />

And previously and still on some mobs today, if you hand it in while not having the faction, items eaten and its another 100 mobs until you can try again. It just seems to me that a lot of quest items seem to be rare drops from rare mobs that require you to simply get extremely lucky or put hours and hours into doing the same thing over and over. Spell drops anyone? (while not being quests its the same kind of thing). Do I mind having to sit there and kill mobs for something, no, not at all. Do I mind sitting there for hours and hours killing place holders for the one mob that has a chance to drop what I am looking for, yes I find it frustrating. The quests that invlove travel, or uncommon drops are good, but some of the equip quest camps just seem crazy to me. Camping for hours killing green goblins underwater for the cleric epic was just boring.<br />
<br />
I am hoping that quests in WoW will be more tailored to allowing you to complete them as you level and while doing other things as well, instead of the EQ way which seems to involve sitting on your backside waiting for the rare drop to drop the piece that you need in an area  that doesnt provide anything else for the player to do. <br />
<br />
I dont want to just log on and get handed everything, but I dont want to sit there for 3 hours and end up with nothing to show for it, no XP, no items, no quest piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">There is a lot of moaning about how EQ is time sinks, raid content etc.  But what is it that makes most of us log in every day?  At least in my case, it's checking out what my guild is doing, or what friends are on.  So, if a game does not require long groups, or the formation of guilds to achieve progress, how do you get those friends? You might be playing with people you know in RL, but most ot the MMPORG community is formed &quot;in world&quot;.  <br />
A game that allows people to reach &quot;uber&quot; status strictly on a solo basis (aka Diablo II) will not achieve a vibrant community, simply because there is no need to waste time with socializing.  This in turn will require either a vast ammount of content to keep players interested, or it has to slow down the leveling process to an extend to equal a jboot camp to keep people playing via the &quot;I haven't beat it yet&quot; motivation.<br />
And all of us that are used to vast levels of content from 5 years in EQ will be disappointed fast with most new games that just can't match 150 zones of EQ.</div></div><hr />

Furor hardly understands &quot;gaming overall&quot; the way I see it. Sure he knows a lot about Everquest. But his focus is on raid content because he likes to be the leader of the most successful guild. I suspect he wants things difficult to lessen the amount of competition for that #1 spot not because it makes for a fun game.<br />
<br />
I suspect that your suspicion's are inaccruate. lol.<br />
<br />
Back in the day, when Luclin was considered high-end content, FoH was endlessly farming bane weapons and complaining quite vehemently that the time sink of this was insanely long. Such complaints are biased toward making something easier (in respect to reward) rather than more difficult. If Furor wanted it to be harder so that he and his crew would edge out the &quot;competition&quot;, he certainly took the wrong approach. <br />
<br />
As I said before, I don't know the guy personally. I do know that Fire of Heavens, the guild, interacted with the most prominent guild on my server, HELPING them with strategy and tactics or giving them tips and information. I am NOT a member of the guild that they helped. I just know some people in that guild. If Furor and FoH is the group of azzwipes people think them to be, why did they bother to share information with the rest of the EQ community? That seems counterproductive to keeping one's &quot;l33t&quot; status.<br />
<br />
Furor may have been sarcastic, assinine, whatever. I read their forum. I saw his language. However, I think I don't get offended that easily because I usually found myself chuckling at it. I managed to take his comments with a grain of salt. There was plenty of helpful info buried under the ego-inflating, self high-fiving gimmicky speech. It was kind of funny, actually.<br />
<br />
by CrustyOldShaman <br />
So I think that anyone who thinks that Furor and his minions has worthwhile expertise to be consulted is simply revealing their own ignorance about the state of EQ. You, and the other Furor fans, might try taking the blinkers off occasionally and looking around you.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call myself a fan, per se, but I did see what was worthwhile about their EQ experiences. So, sue me. I think anyone who can't appreciate FoH for their accomplishements is the one with blinders on. They did not break EQ. <br />
<br />
I am not ignorant about the state of EQ. EQ has had it's share of problems in design and the guilds that reached the &quot;end&quot; the fastest are the ones who discovered those issues. I can't blame them for noticing what was wrong. They were there before I was. Nothing has really changed! The current high end raiding shaman, even if they are not members of FoH, are on this forum telling you what is wrong in the &quot;end game&quot;. How would they know? They are THERE experiencing the issues first hand. Perhaps you would like to chastise them for noticing the &quot;state of EQ&quot; as you have FoH? <br />
<br />
Just because the current high end shaman might state their issues with more tact than Furor did, doesn't make them more right than Furor was. It's the same information. It's the packaging that Furor delivered it in that you didn't care for. I can't blame you for that. If he offended you, that's understandable. It doesn't mean he didn't know anything, though.<br />

The problem is if they design the content in WoW to cater to one style of play, the fulltime &quot;EQ is my 2nd job&quot; raider, and force everyone into that playstyle if they want to advance past a certain point. You'll know they've made the same mistake as EQ when they start releasing expansions aimed at the casual player or the raid player, but not both.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing...people who are casual gamers want the content to be suited to THEM...and the hardcore player be damned. Or well, at least &quot;consider&quot; the hardcore play, dear devs, but keep the focus on the fact that the &quot;majority&quot; of the playerbase is casual...<br />
<br />
The hardcore players get a negative reputation for wanting content that suits their playstyle, too, because it is supposed that they are in the minority. If they really are the minority, why would developers bother with them at all? Maybe the gaming community: Casual vs Hardcore is more equal than either side has realized. Or maybe it is actually filled with more hard core people than the casual folks realize.<br />
<br />
Content SHOULD fit the needs for both styles of play. I agree wholeheartedly with that. However, it is completely wrong to damn the hardcore players for their playstyle. If the hardcore folks &quot;need&quot; more content, in what way does that inhibit the casual gamer? I can't see that it should. That content is there for the casual folks when they casually reach that venue. So what if it's 1 or 2 years old by the time the casuals reach it? It shouldn't matter if they are truly casual gamers.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am not &quot;seeing&quot; this massive casual playerbase on my server. Maybe it's just my server. It could be because I haven't spent much time on any other servers than Innoruuk. <br />
<br />
If the casual playerbase IS the actual majority, then why aren't they in Kunark? Why is LoIO completely void of lower level players? Why is the Burning Woods giant fort not still perma camped? Why is Sebilis the home of level 65 twink gear solo farmers, where I might find only 3 players in zone at any given time? I haven't even stepped foot into Karnor's Castle. I don't know if people even still go into that zone at all.<br />
<br />
Move on from Kunark. Move to Velious. Why is it I can hear a pin drop in Dragon Necropolis? Why is Siren's Grotto void of a single soul? Why don't I hear mob spam in Kael Drakkal anymore? Why is Skyshrine empty? <br />
<br />
Move from Velious. Move to Luclin. Why are there ONLY Emp Key farmers in Ssra and nothing more? Why are all the Maiden's Eye mobs still standing? Why is Akheva void of activity? Why is Umbral Plains the AA exping, twink gear farm fest for a soloing necro friend of mine? Why is he the ONLY person in UP when he is there?<br />
<br />
Where oh where are ALL these casual gamers and why oh why are they not taking the opportunity to ENJOY the vast number of empty zones where they can get the armor drops, without contention mind you, that were coveted back in the day? Maybe the casual gamer isn't as casual as he thinks he is.</div></div><hr />

You know what is really funny is that one of the hardest events in Luclin continues to sit empty: Khati Sha the Twisted. He drops great loot and the last book for a great earring quest. I heard his difficulty is about equal to tier 2 gods in PoP. Yet I haven't seen a single write up on anyone ever beating him.

Egads, where to begin.  We really need a stickied thread to handle the casual vs. raider issue.  Casuals want the same opportunities that raiders have.  Note that I said opportunities and not results.  As for saying the &quot;hardcore player be damned&quot;, show me content denied the hardcore player.  I can show you dozens of zones and content, however, that are completely inaccessible to a casual player who paid the same for the expansion as well as the same monthly fee.<br />

<br />
Otoole, we've been wondering for years why SOE caters to the high end and pretty much ignores the casual player.  Only answer I can think of that makes sense is that there's no reasonable competition to EQ at this point.  It is most certainly NOT because fulltime raiders are the majority.  Search some and you can see the breakdown of ele+ guilds vs. the last known server numbers.  Best case raid people are ~15% of a server's population and even that is probably stretching it.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
No one, least of all me, is damning raid players (I prefer that term to hardcore- a hardcore casual will still not get to the point of a casual raider).  The problem is that casuals will not get to the content designed for raiders whether 1, 2 or 20 years pass.  Content is denied them essentially unless and until they join a raid guild and change their playstyle completely.  No content is denied the raider, however, even if it's content that's of no interest to them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I am not &quot;seeing&quot; this massive casual playerbase on my server. Maybe it's just my server.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you should leave the flagged zones you're in with your raid guild and go to where people actually exp, like tier 1, LDoN, PoV, BoT.  Paludal Caverns is packed 24/7 on my server.<br />
<br />

<br />
Just because we're casual players doesn't mean we're stupid.  What do all those zones have in common? Crap exp, crap loot.  For someone who's 65 and doesn't raid, you're basically consigned to tier 2/tier 3 and LDoNs- the rest of the world is one big wasteland, particularly when you have limited playtime.<br />
<br />
<br />

Because, like raiders, we like to actually kill mobs that drop gear we would wear.  Last I looked FoH wasn't farming Trakanon- why do you think that is?  Why oh why are they not taking the opportunity to ENJOY the vast number of empty zones where they can get the armor drops, without contention mind you, that were coveted back in the day?<br />
<br />
Or maybe casuals simply want to progress the same as raiders but w/o having to essentially work a second job.  Make sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Otoole, we've been wondering for years why SOE caters to the high end and pretty much ignores the casual player.  Only answer I can think of that makes sense is that there's no reasonable competition to EQ at this point.  <br />
<br />
The answer this is actually simple.<br />
Creating high end content means also creating content for the casual player base. Not direct but in a year they will be at that same content.<br />
So you have this carrot hanging in front of the raiders (the end zone of the expansion) while all the other zones will be open to everyone after a while (notice how normally only the end zone has a key/flag requirement)<br />
<br />
Take a look at the original idea behind PoP for example. The idea was that one could access tier 3 and below by doing quests or by doing a raid. Sure the path a casual player has to follow may seem harder or longer then the raid path but do not forget that the raid path does require the boring key camps, the unfinished content, the time sinks.<br />
<br />
Now if you ask me if SoE did a good job at balancing this whole idea that is a different matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I personally hope WoW is anti-raid guild designed.<br />
<br />
I think guilds in general ruin the new feeling of every new game to hit the market.<br />
<br />
A_guild_of_300asshats all move en masse onto X new game server, subsequently power up and devour all the content in the first 4 weeks, and basically make the game a living hell for anyone else who wanted to play and experience a new game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Best case raid people are ~15% of a server's population and even that is probably stretching it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think 15% is a stretch my any means, and although I abandoned that thread long ago, there were other factors I thought of later that never made it into our equation arguement. However, the point Otoole is trying to make is the OTHER thing that I said. That while Hardcore gamers are 15-20 of the actual paying population, they are probably 80-85% of the logged in players during any given moment, and they probably play 80-85% of the total hours the game has been played overall. Granted this doesnt mean that the Hardcore should be catered too and the Casual ignored, HOWEVER, it DOES mean that that Hardcore IS a force that needs attention. <br />
<br />
The casual gamer continues to bring up how much the gear from previous expansions sucks, etc etc etc, but you gotta remember something. <br />
<br />
I WORE THAT CRAPPY JUNK AT ONE TIME<br />
<br />
I went from garbage like a Mith BP and Ghoulbane (was a Pally til Kunark) to Kunark armor to Velious Arena garbage to NToV junk to pieces of crap out of ME and Umbral to my current level of mostly VT gear. I am sorry you missed the oppertunity to go through the various stages of equipping your character, it was actually FUN. <br />
<br />
Sheesh. New people log in now, and wanna go STRAIGHT to Time level gear. Everything else is crap. Even Ornate isnt good enough. LDoN takes too long. Blah Blah Blah, make 120 hp/mana stuff drop like rain off trash mobs please. Hey I know, how about a random item generator, and each mob has a chance to drop something called a &quot;rare&quot;, a &quot;unique&quot; and a &quot;magic&quot; item and . . . wait, that game BURNED OUT IN SIX MONTHS.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started again with this subject, seriously. I have a more concrete method to get a better grasp n the hardcore vs casual percentage, Iz, and I think you would be suprised at the results, seriously. In fact, use the play at home version of the game. Go to the web site of the Number 5 guild on your server. Find the roster. Figure out how many members that guild has. Multiply that number by the number of guilds that raid REGULARLY (Including those NOT in the EPs) and then use that as your base. Make sure you check and see if alt-accounts are listed or not, many guilds do not list alts on Guild Rosters. <br />
<br />
Is WoW the answer? Who knows. AO was the answer. DAoC was the answer. SWG was the answer. Yet here I sit, with EQ being the ONLY online game I pay for, for 5 consecutive years. Thats about $750 I have paid Verant/SOE (average 10 bucks a month, plus cost of expansions) and thats only 1 account. Not bad for a piece of shizz game like this, eh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo.  PoP is what screwed over non raiders.  It screwed them over by increasing the level cap to 65, rendering tons and tons of great zones useless for them, and replaced them with just a few crap zones that they are all herded into (valor, bot, etc).<br />
<br />
They tried to undo this reaming that they gave to the non-raiders by adding LDoN, but what a piece of crap that is.  Utterly boring, uninspired zone design, where they took a few passageways, randomly threw them together and called it an expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">And they feed off each other. The casuals want the good gear. And have dreams of reaching it. <br />
<br />
The ubers enjoy the challange but more importantly they enjoy the feeling of being there first or of being the best. Or the linking of something that makes everyone ooh and ahh. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem with EQ is there is an artificial seperation between the two. <br />
<br />
Number of warm bodies and more importantly number of clerics. <br />
<br />
The worst thing EQ has done was allow raids upwards of 72 man teams. And make content that requires that sort of force. That was mudflation at it's finest. When that happens probably 3/4ths of your force is at best a number. They may have an important role in the overall scheme of things but still being Shaman number 5 aint alot of fun day in and out. <br />
<br />
I look at a level 65 time geared player. Compared to me and you know what I see. Someone who is no longer playing Everquest. But instead someone who is playing Everraid. And it does make me a little sad when they are the ones that blazed up the path going to the best zones. And the mot amazingest loot and all. Cause they might have the best gear in the game but they probably don't have the depth of feeling for each peice of gear like I do. Or the bredth of memories from all the little things that me and my friends have attempted and failed and accomplished.<br />
<br />
I am not saying my experiance is better than thiers overall. But it is what I have chosen. And I enjoyed. But sadly now the game has the split and it is a gap that directly sets the two playstyles at each others necks. There is No way a casual guild can ever attempt something from Elementals and up. they do not have the force. Now they could get a coalition. Or maybe perhaps a pick up raid to attempt the flags. But again it comes down to the force required. It comes down to everraid. <br />
<br />
If they had LDON items that were as good as Time gear sure. There would be an outlet.  That would be fair. Because then casual guilds could have a path open to them. I am not saying make it easier for a casual to get the time related gear. But instead of there being no way to allow someone this take a long hard look at the rewards of Everraid and Balance them Vrs a casual playstyle. And base them both o they are equal in time. If it take a normal Everraid encounter 100 hours of playing to get x peice of gear. Then make sure that Everquesters can get the same peice of gear in 100 hours as well.<br />
<br />
I can hear the screaming of BUT THEN WHY RAID. <br />
<br />
All that I can reply is what.. dont you raid for the fun. The challange. The enjoyment of being first? Or is all that a load of crap?<br />
<br />
Six people doing 100 hours of LDON should net 6 items ov equal value as a 72 man raid getting 4.6 hours of raiding in and getting a net total of 6 items. But When raiding for 4.6 hours how many items does a raid  have drop. I would probably guess a hell of alot more. for 4 hours worth of play. So it is raiding that is too damn easy. Or should I say unbalanced. And yes I know Flagging, Key quests, Gearing up... All things the LDON person has to do as well.  If they dont have the gear to handle the smaller content they cant handle it. Just like the time guilds. <br />
<br />
If you look at the time invested. Vrs the gear. It is a huge huge break in the game. That is why it is so slanted towards everraid right now. And that is what is breaking the game. Because a raiding guild has all the options. They can raid when targets are available They can blow in and wipe the trivial mobs and gear up the twinks They can be more organised and block people from key mobs so they can continue to ahve access to all that the game has to offer. And yet on a day with no targets they can also work towards teh smaller guild targets as well. And with thier superior gear also dominate that selection of the game and increase thier feelings of power. <br />
<br />
Sadly SOE just doesnt care. They dont care about the good of the game. Or the enjoyment of the players. They care about first and foremost the bottem line. And people are continueing to play and pay. But sooner or later the game is going to have viable compition from someone that understands what fun and charecter and spirit are in a game and SOE is going to be slapped in the kisser with all the horrible descisions they have made over the years.<br />
<br />
But hey by then EQ 2 will be out and the cycle will continue. Oooh ahhh. and it will be crap that is pretty. and has the smell removed. <br />
<br />
If SOE was smart they would take a look at a roster of time guilds. Compare played to a roster of Smaller family guilds and compare the time involved. Then start making some real changes to the way they do buisness. <br />
<br />
My two cents. Like it or not it is how this one old bear thinks. <br />
<br />
Now Rytan stop screwing around with whatever you are doing and come here and talk to your users. Cause the worst thing a analyst can do is lose touch with thier base of users. We know that you are busy, but we are paying you. Not the other way around. So step up and make a damn differance.<br />

As for saying the &quot;hardcore player be damned&quot;, show me content denied the hardcore player.<br />
<br />
Iz, I wasn't discussing content that denied the hardcore player. I was discussing the attitude of the so-called casual gamer who doesn't care about the concerns of the hardcore player. If it's not a two way street, where both types of gamers can play, I don't see why one camps &quot;needs&quot; should outweigh the desires of the other. That's my point.<br />
<br />
I can show you dozens of zones and content, however, that are completely inaccessible to a casual player who paid the same for the expansion as well as the same monthly fee.<br />
<br />
Really? What do you define as &quot;completely inaccessible&quot;? Keep in mind, though, I do not care for keyed or flagged zones anymore than anyone else does. I paid for that content just like anyone else. I had to put in the &quot;time&quot; to get in, along with my American Dollars. It's apparent that 2 things are required to access some of the games content: Cold Hard Cash and Hours of Playtime. Does it suck for those who CANNOT put in the time? Damn straight it does. However, I couldn't gain access to that content anymore than you could even with my cash up front! The truth is, that content is JUST as accessible to the casual gamer as it is to the hardcore player. The only difference is &quot;when&quot; the casual gamer will gain entry in comparison to &quot;when&quot; the hardcore will gain entry. The casual gamer, casually plugging along, will most likely enter the &quot;end game&quot; of any given expansion 1 -2 expansion releases behind the hardcore player.<br />
<br />
The argument about locked content is as old as Antonica is. Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate, Plane of Air:  Level 46 requirement. The &quot;when&quot; of entry into such content was based on LEVEL and whatever amount of time it took for the casual gamer to achieve level 46 was what prohibited them from actual entry, not the &quot;content&quot; nor the hardcore player, per se. Those were raiding zones and the only people who went there were those who had the time to dedicate to said raids. If the casual gamer couldn't dedicate the time, why complain about those who could? <br />
<br />
Otoole, we've been wondering for years why SOE caters to the high end and pretty much ignores the casual player.<br />
<br />
LDoN was designed with the casual gamer in mind. How that can be considered &quot;pretty much ignoring&quot; the casual player is beyond me. LDoN instances mean no competition for said &quot;zone&quot;...a soluction to a common complaint of the casual gamer. LDoN instances can be done in less than 2 hours time...another solution to a common complaint of the casual gamer. The fact that it would take a great deal of &quot;time&quot; to rack up the points to purchase &quot;high end&quot; items with those adventure points doesn't seem out of line even for the casual gamer. The instanced zones themselves contained loot drops. There has been very decent items that come out of LDoN hards. It's not Plane of Time items, but it's not bad stuff at all for any TRULY casual gamer.<br />
<br />
Only answer I can think of that makes sense is that there's no reasonable competition to EQ at this point.<br />
<br />
Hmmm. For 5 years now, the next MMORPG to be released was going to be an EQ killer, or if not an EQ killer, the &quot;competition&quot; that was really needed to give EQ devs a kick in the nads. I've heard these kinds of statements when Neverwinter Nights, Horizons, AO, AC, DAoC, SWG, Diablo 2, and countless other gamesr were in development. All of these games ARE the competition, folks. EQ is still kicking...even with all of our complaining and whining and incessent bitching. Note that I say &quot;our&quot; so as to include myself in the mix of the periodically disgruntled who vocalizes it.  <br />
<br />
It is most certainly NOT because fulltime raiders are the majority. Search some and you can see the breakdown of ele+ guilds vs. the last known server numbers. Best case raid people are ~15% of a server's population and even that is probably stretching it.<br />
<br />
I didn't say they were the majority. I said it might be more EVEN than casual gamers imagine I would like to know how you come to that ~15% conclusion. Just do a tour of the zones that casual gamers should STILL be in and tell me why those zones are ghost towns. There are PLENTY of people who have never hit 65, my husband being one of them. I am fully convinced that he is, by far, the most casual of casual gamer there is in the game of EQ. He's a level 58 warrior as his main, playing since EQ went live, with RS2 as his only AA investment, thus far. The items he has, he either purchased in the bazaar with the pp I gave him, or friends he has made over the last 5 years have handed him things that he enjoys roleplaying with. Roleplaying--it's what my husband playes EQ for--he's an ogre and makes sure you know it, whatever zone he enters. He playes EQ for short bursts of time here and there, doesn't play for months, returns, plays for short bursts of time here and there, rinse, repeat. However, people ask me about him all the time because he's fun to be around. He's not uber, has no really good gear to speak of, except the PoP ornate gloves I saved for him. He used to be hardcore 2HS when dual wielding was the &quot;only&quot; thing to be as a warrior if you wanted to do any form of DPS. Once 2HS became a viable option for warriors when it was coded to be more balanced, THAT'S when he started working on his dual wield skill! He doesn't own a range weapon and I can't convince him for the life of him that he should have one. He doesn't know how to pull zones, because he doesn't know them like the back of his hand like a lot of people do. He's never joined a guild and continues to call them sororities (his way of shunning them) even though he gets invited to all sorts of guilds, repeatedly, every time people spend a small amount of time with him. HE'S CASUAL in the broadest concept of the term! Even still, he's a GOOD warrior and people seek him out. Go figure! :) There isn't one place he couldn't gain access to if he so desired. It might be tough for him, but he would get invited, I'm certain of it.<br />
<br />
Being a casual gamer does not exclude ANYONE from actual content. If my husband can gain access to it, anyone can. :p Even he wondered why, at level 56 (a few months back) he logged into Plane of Nightmare and couldn't get a group after LFG was set on and several of his charming /ooc advertisements. Then he did a /who and noticed only 6 people in PoN. He /ooc'd are you 6 all grouped together? Their answer...Yes. Thus, no group for him. They were full. That's it, Iz, 6 people in PoN! I can't understand why people are saying that the casual gamer is the MAJORITY of the server when PoN, PoV is right around where that big chunk of population should still be. PoV is even beginning to dwindle on Innoruuk. Many are in BoT. Tactics used to have good numbers in it. Now, a ghost town. HoH, soloers only. People are in Elementals, Time, or GoD. Everthing else is practically empty and it really has me scratching my head! How can this game be &quot;majorly&quot; casual but the majority of Innoruuk is crammed into 3 specific areas? I have even hopped from Wayfarer camp to Wayfarer camp, as has my husband and it's not flooded with people waiting to do LDoN's. LDoN's are still popular. I get invites all the time, still. But it's not like it WAS. All you have to do is make it a point to look around at where OTHERS are, not just where YOU are and it will become more clear.<br />
<br />
If Innoruuk is an unusual server, and this is not the case on all the other servers, then I really do apologize for my very short sighted commments. I am merely reporting what is really going on in the confines of Innoruuk. I do look around and wonder what happened to &quot;the old days&quot; and actually long for some of the things I used to enjoy...if for nothing more than to reminisce. I used to love to return to Everfrost as my power increased, just to &quot;show&quot; the mobs that used to torment me in my newbie days that I am stronger than they are. :p I still love smacking Mammoths when I'm at the Wayfarer camp, just because I owe them a lot of deaths. An eye for an eye...<br />
<br />
No one, least of all me, is damning raid players (I prefer that term to hardcore- a hardcore casual will still not get to the point of a casual raider). The problem is that casuals will not get to the content designed for raiders whether 1, 2 or 20 years pass. Content is denied them essentially unless and until they join a raid guild and change their playstyle completely. No content is denied the raider, however, even if it's content that's of no interest to them.<br />
<br />
Not true as illustrated by my husband's playstyle. He has raided with raiding guilds even though he will not join them and TELLS THEM SO. He doesn't pretend so that he can go along. They invite him anyway just because! Guilds invite him on raids frequently. Some he can attend because he's off. Others he can't because he works nights and the raid will run into the time when he must leave. It hasn't hindered him at all. Granted, he hasn't been in the Plane of Time. But I do not doubt that at SOME POINT (even if a year from now) he will be able to say he has been in Time.<br />
<br />
Or maybe you should leave the flagged zones you're in with your raid guild and go to where people actually exp, like tier 1, LDoN, PoV, BoT. Paludal Caverns is packed 24/7 on my server.<br />
<br />
PoN, PoI, PoJ, EMPTY! BoT, busy. PoV, was busy as little as 3 or 4 weeks ago but is emptying. Paludal Caverns is not packed 24/7 on Innoruuk, but I did get my bard twink the PC experience with some fun groups...however, I had to wait until the evening when more people would be on and in that zone. During the day it was difficult to get a group there. It could be done, but it wasn't easy because it was not &quot;packed&quot; 24/7 as yor server is.<br />
<br />
As for my &quot;raid guild&quot;...I was guesting with other guilds to get my flags into the E-planes. You see, I'm a gamer (casual or hardcore to be determined) who took well over a year off. When I first returned to the game there was this channel set up called &quot;Flagraiders&quot; and every single day there would be hoards of people on it wanting to get their flags done. I wasn't yet ready to do flag raids because I was still level 59 with no AA's. I didn't have an Emp Key, a VT key or a ST key. I didn't have a Vindi BP or a lot of my 60 - 65 spells in the bank. I also had practically 0 pp because I do tradeskills like a fool for fun, not for profit. lol. I have had to do it the way the so-called casual gamer does now. Make some friends and get some invitations for raids. It's that simple. The &quot;Flagraiders&quot; channel that was always full when I was 59 (not all that long ago) has no people on it now. That is no longer a viable means for attaining flags on Inny because so many people have what they need or have access to being raidflagged in.<br />
<br />
Just because we're casual players doesn't mean we're stupid. What do all those zones have in common? Crap exp, crap loot. For someone who's 65 and doesn't raid, you're basically consigned to tier 2/tier 3 and LDoNs- the rest of the world is one big wasteland, particularly when you have limited playtime.<br />
<br />
What is crap loot? LDoN's have decent loot for the casual gamer. Are you comparing that loot to Plane of Time loot? Then, yes, it &quot;crap&quot; but you aren't IN Plane of Time so you don't NEED Plane of Time gear! LDoN items will help you increase your power in LDoN's. Tier2/Tier3 loot will help increase your power in tier2/tier3 planes. It won't trivialize it for you, but it will be an aid. All I see is the non-raiding players being angry with the raiding players for having raiding loot. Well, raids CAN be fun and raids CAN be boring. It can go either way. I've personally experienced both.<br />
<br />
Because, like raiders, we like to actually kill mobs that drop gear we would wear. Last I looked FoH wasn't farming Trakanon- why do you think that is? Why oh why are they not taking the opportunity to ENJOY the vast number of empty zones where they can get the armor drops, without contention mind you, that were coveted back in the day?<br />
<br />
Or maybe casuals simply want to progress the same as raiders but w/o having to essentially work a second job. Make sense?<br />
<br />
No, it doesn't make sense at all. You want to get the SAME thing that the guy who put in 40 hours (made up figure) got for your 2 - 5 (another made up figure) hours worth of time? Trust me when I say that the guy who put in 40 hours wanted it in 2 - 5 like you do, too, but he didn't get it that way, so why should you? That's the point of trying to balance a game for both types of playstyles, Izmalis. You will both put in about 40 hours of time (in a utopian model) but your 40 hours might take months whereas the hardcore guy will have it in a week or 2. Either way, you both had to do the same thing to gain entry. It's the &quot;when&quot; you are complaining about.</div></div><hr />

 The casual gamer continues to bring up how much the gear from previous expansions sucks, etc etc etc, but you gotta remember something. <br />
<br />
I WORE THAT CRAPPY JUNK AT ONE TIME<br />
<br />
I went from garbage like a Mith BP and Ghoulbane (was a Pally til Kunark) to Kunark armor to Velious Arena garbage to NToV junk to pieces of crap out of ME and Umbral to my current level of mostly VT gear. I am sorry you missed the oppertunity to go through the various stages of equipping your character, it was actually FUN.<br />
<br />
AMEN! Thank you for understanding my point. When I came back into the game, a friend of mine who abandoned his shaman for a necro that he got to 65 with massive aa's in the time I was gone, /inspected me and said, &quot;Wow, 18 months - 2 years ago, your gear would have made me drool.&quot; Thus, revealing that my gear, while somewhat crappy now, was completely appropriate and even /drool worthy when I attained it with my then heavy raiding guild. Even without a Vindi BP! lol.<br />
<br />
The point is, that gear is not CRAP in the content where it was designed to shine. Velious gear is good stuff...IN VELIOUS. Luclin gear is good stuff IN LUCLIN. LDoN stuff is good stuff IN LDoN! Comparing apples to oranges will always leave you complaining that one is not as &quot;good&quot; as the other. I returned to the game with gear that could not support my occaisional soloing habits when I read where is &quot;the place&quot; to solo for exp on these forums. I had to suck it up because my HP buffed/unbuffed is a joke compared to what it &quot;should be&quot; and I didn't have the spells to do the damage I needed to do. I didn't have the 61 pet, I had 0 FT items, 0 PP to buy bazaar gear and 0 AA's. So, I grouped with other people, saved my pennies, looted the crap no one wanted, sold it for a little pp and nickel and dimed my way into being able to get some new items/spells. Even still, it's nothing uber but it gave me the opportunity to buy my spells so that I could, in turn, solo easier when I can't get a group that interests me and I can then get better AA's to improve my ability to group in places I want to be and solo in times when I want to be able to solo. I still am not getting loot drops in those flag raids because I haven't got membership privelages. So what? I am getting flagged! When I can waltz into those zones of my own accord, there ARE pick-up groups in the E-planes. I hear about them all the time from my friends who are IN those planes in groups getting AA exp.<br />
<br />
And yes, I may not be an &quot;end game&quot; shaman these days, but I have done GoD zones, instanced and non instanced. I do not have a great deal of experience with that content, but I do recognize what it's about. It didn't take a lot of time to get that figured out. Mobs hit furiously hard and furiously fast. They mitigate my slow and I can't heal to make up for it. My damage is unspeakable and my lack of AA's/focus items plays a part in it. I am not READY for GoD, just like many &quot;casuals&quot; are not ready for Plane of Time. However, I can do the looking into the future thing, talk to my shaman friends who DO have the aa's and gear to back up their statements, and I do know a thing or two about what I &quot;can be&quot; capable of given the right gear/aa's/focus items. It's not rocket science. It's simple familiarity with the class and EQ by design.<br />
<br />
Is WoW the answer? Who knows. AO was the answer. DAoC was the answer. SWG was the answer. Yet here I sit, with EQ being the ONLY online game I pay for, for 5 consecutive years. Thats about $750 I have paid Verant/SOE (average 10 bucks a month, plus cost of expansions) and thats only 1 account. Not bad for a piece of shizz game like this, eh.<br />
<br />
GOOD POINT! I hear ya and know what you mean. My twink bard was in Shadeweaver's Thicket chant kiting aliens when a broadcast went out about the 5th year anniversay, blah blah blah, and SOE was thanking us for making it and EQ such a success. No one said a word...well, there was only 4 - 5 newbs IN Shadeweavers, so that might also have something do with it. ;) However, I /ooc'd, &quot;For all the complaining we do about this game, we have to admit they must do something right because after 5 years, I'm still here.&quot; People answered that /ooc in the positive, admitting that it was true. We're still here 5 years of bitching later. All the EQ killers have come and gone and I'm STILL here. I left and came back. I'm STILL here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">Everquest has failed in one MAJOR category, and the irony is it's incorporated into the very name of the game:  QUESTS.<br />
<br />
How many people do quests today because of the &quot;fun&quot;?  How many people spend hours and hours of doing quests because it's &quot;necessary&quot;?  How many people spend those hours for little or NO EXP at all?<br />
<br />
Quests in Everquest have always been broken from a risk vs. reward vs. enjoyment vs. purpose.  How many quests are reportedly in the game and yet unsolved?  40%?  How many are in the game but broken?<br />
<br />
Out of the gate, WoW is trying to build an expressive, purposeful, rewarding questing environment.  Where a player receives a real benefit from running through storyline and is rewarded with at least a chunk of exp.  Add to this that they are gearing many quests to the soloist - you have a slam dunk for the casual gamer.<br />
<br />
To capture the high end gamer, they will have to have a progressive storyline that doesn't offer the same timesink-stupidity of EQ - as well as encounters that have originality and spice to them.  When a guild has nothing more to their strategy than &quot;zero delay 12 cleric rotation on MT, 4 druid rotation on the RT, max melee distance&quot; and it doesn't vary from encounter to encounter... where is the enjoyment in that?  I'll tell you where it is - the stupidity of the itemization - throwing another 25HP on an item so that a warrior can break 14K... or another focus effect so that a caster can get that extra tick on his dots...  There's no originality to any of the content... and the content is indubitably buggy and broken when released.<br />
<br />
Sony (and Verant before them) made a marketing strategy that pimped EQ to the players willing to spend the $13 every month... they were successful because no matter how bad EQ might be, nothing else is any better.<br />
<br />
The phenomenon that people see everytime a major new MMORPG is released is real simple - it's an expression of hope by the gamers today - hoping that this new game WILL be the new, better game to break the market from the filthy, stinking fingers of Sony... hoping that this new game will offer something more to those of us who call gaming our primary &quot;hobby&quot; yet know that we waste hours upon hours playing a piece of crap day in day out.  It's a cry to God that WoW (or ANY new game) will defeat the marketing bull **** of Sony and win the market with a fresh and GOOD product that will bring an enlivened interest and enjoyment into the gamers' experience again.</div></div><hr />

There is No way a casual guild can ever attempt something from Elementals and up. they do not have the force.<br />
<br />
The word EVER is what completely negates your argument. There is a way a casual guild of today can &quot;ever&quot; attempt something from Elementals and up. It's called another expansion beyond your reach. GoD AA's which come from EXP points, not actual GoD zones, have the potential to assist today's non Eplanes player enter Eplanes content...eventually. Whatever expansion would come after GoD, especially if it includes levels and spells that are not No Drop will only further aid today's non Eplanes guild to gain access to the Eplanes. The only thing that is true about today's non Eplanes guild is that they are not in the Eplanes TODAY. The statement that they will in no way EVER attempt something from the Eplanes is a fallacy and such fallacies have existed since the dawn of the EQ expansion (read: Kunark).<br />
<br />
I heard that same speech in the days of Velious about NToV and Sleepers Tomb. I've heard that same speech in Luclin about Emperor Ssraa, The Creator, and Vex Thal. The funny thing is, those people who made those comments back then are doing that content now. Granted, it's LATER than the guilds who did it when it was new, but it's being done by the very people who complained that they wouldn't be able to see that content due to not having a zerg force. They still don't have a zerg force. What they do have is level 65 and AA's that help them now that did not exist in the era of Luclin content. In turn, those levels/spells and their AA's haave given them the power they lacked back then to succeed in Vex Thal. In turn, their Vex Thal drops are helping them gain access to the E-planes as they are getting flags now. <br />
<br />
The topmost guilds on Innoruuk have rotting items when they do PoTime, their guild is pretty much full up. They have moved on to do GoD. PoTime is &quot;over&quot; for them in the grand scheme of things. The casual guy of PoP newness who couldn't do PoP &quot;end game&quot; content when it was shiny and new is just entering that content NOW or teetering very close to the edge of that content. All that the casual gamers who complain they will &quot;never&quot; see such content lack is patience. They WILL see it...just LATER than the hardcore player. That's it. Levels/spells/AA's enter the game that make the previous &quot;end game&quot; content doable and thus &quot;never&quot;, &quot;no way...ever&quot; are terms that are wholly inaccurate in regards to what content the casual gamer will or will not have access to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u70"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p70">The worst thing EQ has done was allow raids upwards of 72 man teams. And make content that requires that sort of force. That was mudflation at it's finest. When that happens probably 3/4ths of your force is at best a number. They may have an important role in the overall scheme of things but still being Shaman number 5 aint alot of fun day in and out. <br />
<br />
Absolutely.  There's a big difference between allowing a hardcore *player* to advance and requiring a player to become an active member of a large raiding *force*.<br />
<br />
Everquest went overboard when they started requiring 60+ people for a raid.  Ala Rathe.  Sure they've taken a step back in GoD, but that doesn't matter to people who have yet to reach Plane of Time and want to, no matter what GoD gear they're wearing.  The encounter is tuned to a large number of people.<br />
<br />
You will both put in about 40 hours of time (in a utopian model) but your 40 hours might take months whereas the hardcore guy will have it in a week or 2. Either way, you both had to do the same thing to gain entry. It's the &quot;when&quot; you are complaining about.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this isn't the case at all.  Success in Everquest is not simply a matter of time served.  It's also who you know, and how many people you can get online in one place at the same time.<br />
<br />
This isn't a bad concept overall, but as I said above, EQ took it to an extreme that put accessing the content out of reach of too many people.<br />
<br />
In the grand scheme of MMRPG raid design, in order for raids to be rewarding, fun, and challenging, they don't necessarily need &quot;high number of people&quot; in their design requirements.<br />
<br />
That said, expect WoW raid content to be tuned for a much smaller number of people.</div></div><hr />

Not good enough man. If there is top loot or zones in the game, I want them NOW!! I want the very best available loot to drop somewhere I can go. I want to be able to access every zone, and thats why I need that loot NOW, so I don't die. <br />

I am out of this, been through it once. I am not hardcore. I didnt see VT til well after PoP came out. I have no EP armor, even though I have been flaged a while.

We're still wearing gear that is lower than where we're fighting, at least for my friends and I.  Ornate and cultural armor barely takes the sting out of the beatdown I take in hard LDoNs while normal LDoNs are a snoozefest.  There is no progression for us unfortunately- normal --&gt; hard in LDoN is a quantum leap in difficulty.<br />

Sheesh. New people log in now, and wanna go STRAIGHT to Time level gear. Everything else is crap.<br />
I would kill for 2+ year old VT gear- my druid friend in VT gear now has more hps than my sk.<br />
<br />
Even Ornate isnt good enough. LDoN takes too long. Blah Blah Blah, make 120 hp/mana stuff drop like rain off trash mobs please. Hey I know, how about a random item generator, and each mob has a chance to drop something called a &quot;rare&quot;, a &quot;unique&quot; and a &quot;magic&quot; item and . . . wait, that game BURNED OUT IN SIX MONTHS.<br />

Blazz, be reasonable- at what point did I or anyone ask for stuff to drop like rain?  Well, other than getting to have ornate drop off trash mobs in Sol Ro like the raid crowd of course.<br />

<br />
Good for them. That &quot;real benefit from running through the storyline&quot; will last until the spoiler sites post the quests in full detail. At that point, it is entirely up to the player to choose to immerse themselves in the quests by storyline method or use the spoiler site method. If WoW is built around storyline immersion and it's entertainment value/advancement is dependent upon that, spoiler sites will break that game in a heartbeat. People will do all the quests speedily for all the leet lewtz and be gone in 6 months. Now, am I knocking WoW for having such content? No way. It takes a strong will to plunge through a frustrating quest without checking a spoiler site if you know one exists. :) God bless you for having the fortitude to not cheat. I check Allakhazam's for nearly every loot drop anymore. I sold too many things to vendors that players would have wanted for completions of their quests. Ignorance was not bliss on my part in that particular set of circumstances. :)<br />
<br />
Add to this that they are gearing many quests to the soloist - you have a slam dunk for the casual gamer.<br />
<br />
I disagree. The casual gamer is not necessarily a soloer. The interdependence in Everquest, while certainly having it's drawbacks, is what has kept this game alive for so long. Have you ever really noticed how many people admit that the reason they log in is because of the friendships they formed in this game? They whine and complain about the game itself, but still log in because of their FRIENDS. Soloing doesn't afford that kind of bonding and it gets lonely after awhile. I can play a non online game if I want to really be alone. I don't need to pay 12.95 a month to be alone. I can buy the game for a $30 - 50 one time fee, install it, patch it if need be and play to my hearts content...as casually or as hardcore as I desire. I am pretty convinced that an MMORPG's staying power is based on relationships that the players in the community form. Everquest is a fine example of that, if nothing more.<br />
<br />

<br />
I've heard that before, too, but so far no one has has said what that &quot;originality&quot; must entail. Other games offered a non time-sink means to levelling and acquiring loot. Within 3 - 4 months the people who left EQ to try out that game were back in EQ because that &quot;other&quot; game got boring after awhile. Personally, I though DAoC was fantastic!!!!...for about 2 months. Then I got bored. EQ looked good again. It had redeemed itself. I am still thankful for DAoC because some of the really GOOD features of that game prompted EQ to add them to their own. However, I still want to see flowing capes....;)<br />
<br />
When a guild has nothing more to their strategy than &quot;zero delay 12 cleric rotation on MT, 4 druid rotation on the RT, max melee distance&quot; and it doesn't vary from encounter to encounter... where is the enjoyment in that? <br />
<br />
Then don't do it that way. Try something else. I remember having a wonderful time in Siren's Grotto v2 (slightly fixed but still quite buggy) with my guild at the time. We employed non-standard tactics to try and reach the named mobs of that zone. We wanted to do it with as little time spent on the trash as possible. This brought with it some really funny trains, some seriously good time CR's and a lot of satisfaction when we owned the zone OUR way, rather than the &quot;normal&quot; way. Look, EQ has its faults. I openly admit that. However, no one holds a gun to our heads insisting that we do 0 delay 12 cleric rotations, etc. We have gotten complacent as well and pull out the old &quot;do what is known to work&quot; plan. Can wipeout after wipeout be frustrating? Yes, it can. However, it can be fun, too, with the alleged &quot;right mix&quot; of people. I also had some really fun times being naked at the WW/SG zoneline trying...and failing...to dodge Sontalek to get into ToV. It just depends on the night, the mood of the people, and the willingness of the group to keep cool even when things don't go as planned.<br />
<br />
I hung out with a guild that took 6 tries over 2 nights to take down RZTW. I was told that it is very, very hard to do it with less than 6 (I think?) enchanters. We did have a hard time doing it with less than whatever is the &quot;standard&quot;, if not 6 whatever the number was (perhaps 4). However, we eventually did it with less than that &quot;requirement&quot;. We felt every blow, every sting, every failure. The losses weren't rewarding, of course. Killing that badboy was, however, and it was probably more satisfying to kill him after 5 straight losses than it would have been to kill him on the first  or second try.<br />
<br />
If you're bored with the way encounters &quot;have to&quot; be done, start doing them in an unconventional manner. The challenge CAN BE up to you, as well. While I agree that the developers get paid to keep it interesting, we manage to dumb the game down on our own as well. We got used to have a raid force of 72 people, all clerics. lol. That's our fault. Try doing stuff without that fabled &quot;right mix&quot; and keep doing it til you beat the jerk. <br />
<br />
There's no originality to any of the content... and the content is indubitably buggy and broken when released.<br />
<br />
Agreed, however, so was AO, the alleged EQ killer of it's time. EQ is not the only game released with buggy material. It's not quite fair nor accurate to demonize SOE as the only buggy game creators.<br />
<br />
Sony (and Verant before them) made a marketing strategy that pimped EQ to the players willing to spend the $13 every month... they were successful because no matter how bad EQ might be, nothing else is any better.<br />
<br />
While accurate in it's assessment, this is a glass if half empty point of view. The alternate, positively stated counterpart with just as much accuracy as your statement would be: EQ has succeeded for as long as it has because no other product has competed with it's quality as of yet. When you're king of the dip****s (in a world of nothing but dip****s), you're still the top guy on the foodchain. :) It's really quite ludicrous on our part to expect Sony to provide a flawless game that will maintain our &quot;oh so high and lofty standards&quot; when NO OTHER GAME has managed to do it either.<br />
<br />
The phenomenon that people see everytime a major new MMORPG is released is real simple - it's an expression of hope by the gamers today - hoping that this new game WILL be the new, better game to break the market from the filthy, stinking fingers of Sony... hoping that this new game will offer something more to those of us who call gaming our primary &quot;hobby&quot; yet know that we waste hours upon hours playing a piece of crap day in day out.<br />
<br />
And it's a piece of crap in comparison to.....what, exactly? Since there has not YET been a game that is &quot;better&quot; than EQ, the quintessential EQ killer that is alleged to be looming out there in the future, what EXACTLY is your complaint, again? You pay money to play something you don't like and it's who's fault? The other guy? C'mon now. If you really, truly dislike EQ that much, stop playing. Seriously. You don't HAVE to play it. Look, I am pretty bummed about what my shaman has to look forward to. I have nurtured and cared for this damn 'toon for an insane amount of my free time. However, I have to admit that I do like EQ enough to have created some back up characters should Otoole become completely and utterly void of purpose. I like my bard, I like my necro. They are babies still, but I have them to look forward to. I still like EQ overall. I have to admit that much. It's the real reason I am here after 5 years. I am not REALLY here because there is &quot;nothing else&quot; to play. There are plenty of &quot;something elses&quot; to play. I don't like them near as much as I do EQ. That's the long and the short of it.<br />
<br />
 It's a cry to God that WoW (or ANY new game) will defeat the marketing bull **** of Sony and win the market with a fresh and GOOD product that will bring an enlivened interest and enjoyment into the gamers' experience again.<br />
<br />
I don't buy for one second that you are here because of marketing. Are you really that easily brainwashed? Or pehaps you think I'm that gullible? Pal, you are here because you want to be here. On some level, it's true. If you didn't want to be here, you would be gone. While I completely understand your frustration with this game, your passion about that frustration is because you actually give a damn about this game. What kills EQ for people is not their hatred of the game, it's when they become wholly indifferent to it that they truly walk away for good. There's a fine line between love and hate. Indifference is love's true opposite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Otoole, you type longer posts than me! :P<br />
<br />
I was discussing the attitude of the so-called casual gamer who doesn't care about the concerns of the hardcore player. If it's not a two way street, where both types of gamers can play, I don't see why one camps &quot;needs&quot; should outweigh the desires of the other.<br />
My objection isn't with raiding or raiders per se, but with raiding as the de facto requirement for access to content (flagged zones) and gear that is orders of magnitude better than non-raiders who put in identical amounts of time/effort.  Time/effort that is much more poorly rewarded unless they follow the raid path the game herds you into at the high end.<br />
<br />
<br />
What do you define as &quot;completely inaccessible&quot;?<br />
<br />
Flagged zones that require more than a group to gain access and have no alternate means of entry.  You either raid or you will not get in.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's apparent that 2 things are required to access some of the games content: Cold Hard Cash and Hours of Playtime.<br />
<br />
You're partially right- for Cold Hard Cash Yantis/IGE will be happy to provide you with one of the multitude of ele+ chars that have been ebayed in the last two months.  As for time, no amount of time will get you into elemental planes unless it's in the warm companionship of a bunch of raiders.<br />
<br />
The argument about locked content is as old as Antonica is. Plane of Fear, Plane of Hate, Plane of Air:  Level 46 requirement. The &quot;when&quot; of entry into such content was based on LEVEL and whatever amount of time it took for the casual gamer to achieve level 46 was what prohibited them from actual entry, not the &quot;content&quot;.<br />
<br />
See, I play at my own pace and do anything I want and I will eventually be 46.  I have one and only one playstyle (raiding) if I want to get into a flagged zone in PoP.  Surely you can see the difference.<br />
<br />
LDoN was designed with the casual gamer in mind. How that can be considered &quot;pretty much ignoring&quot; the casual player is beyond me. LDoN instances mean no competition for said &quot;zone&quot;...a soluction to a common complaint of the casual gamer. LDoN instances can be done in less than 2 hours time...another solution to a common complaint of the casual gamer. The fact that it would take a great deal of &quot;time&quot; to rack up the points to purchase &quot;high end&quot; items with those adventure points doesn't seem out of line even for the casual gamer. The instanced zones themselves contained loot drops. There has been very decent items that come out of LDoN hards. It's not Plane of Time items, but it's not bad stuff at all for any TRULY casual gamer.<br />
<br />
LDoN, though repetitive to the point of agony, has at least provided upgrades for the casual player.  It also provides an &quot;end game&quot; of sorts to progression for the casual- winning LDoN hards.  I like LDoN, but they really need to provide more foci (MP4, IH4, ID4) and more slot 7 augs among other nagging issues that aren't relevant to the discussion here.  The point here is- what in LDoN is inaccessible to the raid player? Nothing.  They even have LDoN raids for raiders, even though they don't sound like a lot more fun than adventures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmmm. For 5 years now, the next MMORPG to be released was going to be an EQ killer, or if not an EQ killer, the &quot;competition&quot; that was really needed to give EQ devs a kick in the nads. I've heard these kinds of statements when Neverwinter Nights, Horizons, AO, AC, DAoC, SWG, Diablo 2, and countless other gamesr were in development. All of these games ARE the competition, folks. EQ is still kicking...even with all of our complaining and whining and incessent bitching.<br />
I, at least, am not predicting the sky is falling for EQ when WoW launches, but then I won't know anyways as I will have abandoned EverRaid at that time w/ my crew already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Being a casual gamer does not exclude ANYONE from actual content.<br />
<br />
Unless that content is flagged and requires a raid guild to access.<br />
<br />
[My husband] has raided with raiding guilds even though he will not join them and TELLS THEM SO. He doesn't pretend so that he can go along. They invite him anyway just because! Guilds invite him on raids frequently.<br />
<br />
Then your server is filled with Candyland slides and gumdrop rainbows, because you'll get a big GFY from the raid guilds on A Ro if you want to leech PoP flags.  Anyone from A Ro in EW, SoT, IvM or RiP want to pipe up and prove me wrong?  Thought not.  It's a gentlemen's club where they will flag each other's apps, but no way they will invite non-raiders into their exclusive content.<br />
<br />
As for my &quot;raid guild&quot;...I was guesting with other guilds to get my flags into the E-planes.<br />
<br />
A Ro has an open raid system in place to get some flags, but the highest they've gotten is Sol Ro and the raids are at odd hours of the day or night, so it's exceedingly difficult to get far via this method, at least thus far.  But again, you're proving my point- you have to raid to gain access to content, whether it's with a guild of your peers or random people on the server.  Why must raiding be the One True Path?<br />
<br />
<br />
What is crap loot? LDoN's have decent loot for the casual gamer. Are you comparing that loot to Plane of Time loot? Then, yes, it &quot;crap&quot; but you aren't IN Plane of Time so you don't NEED Plane of Time gear! LDoN items will help you increase your power in LDoN's. Tier2/Tier3 loot will help increase your power in tier2/tier3 planes. It won't trivialize it for you, but it will be an aid. <br />
<br />
By that logic, PoTime people should lose their raid gear when I see them slumming in zones outside PoTime, Gates, etc... right?  Because they don't NEED that gear there, so they shouldn't have it?  <br />
<br />
Gear upgrades always help when you do challenging content.  I can tell you as a matter of fact that another 4k hps and another 800 AC added to my sk would make a world of difference right now doing LDoN hards<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it doesn't make sense at all. You want to get the SAME thing that the guy who put in 40 hours (made up figure) got for your 2 - 5 (another made up figure) hours worth of time?<br />
<br />
If I could get upgrades via LDoNs in 2-5 hours I would be ecstatic, but sadly each piece of 760 point armor is 15+ wins for me at roughly 1 hour/win (including setup time, zoning, buffing, etc...) and this is unaugmented, so it's barely better than cultural statwise.  Figure another 1500 pts (at least) for 2 good augments or 30 more hours and I will have a piece of gear that won't hold a candle to VT armor.  Yeah, we casuals are sure getting over on the raid crowd with LDoN gear!  Won't they be so jealous!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You will both put in about 40 hours of time (in a utopian model) but your 40 hours might take months whereas the hardcore guy will have it in a week or 2. Either way, you both had to do the same thing to gain entry. It's the &quot;when&quot; you are complaining about.<br />
No, it isn't the when, it's the &quot;if&quot;.  There's no way, even assuming WoW weren't on the horizon, that I could get into the elemental planes w/o joining a raid guild.  No amount of time played will get you into the elemental planes, at least not on my server.  Rewards in EQ are exponential if you raid, they're linear if you don't.<br />
<br />
See?  If all raiders did was work on LDoN adv points or AA's, your argument about time would make perfect sense.  We both could achieve the same level, but it would take the casual much longer in real time.  That isn't the case when it comes to raid gear- the casual will never, ever achieve the same level of gear or opportunites w/o raiding.  It's as simple as that and it's built right into the game design all the way down to hardcoding flags on the majority of PoP and continuing the &quot;fun&quot; in Gates.</div></div><hr />

Everquest went overboard when they started requiring 60+ people for a raid. Ala Rathe. Sure they've taken a step back in GoD, but that doesn't matter to people who have yet to reach Plane of Time and want to, no matter what GoD gear they're wearing. The encounter is tuned to a large number of people.<br />
<br />
You guys, really don't get it, do you?<br />
<br />
60+ people might be required for Rathe TODAY, but your casual gaming azzes shouldn't be doing the Rathe yet, should you? Not if you are an actual casual gamer. I am beginning to suspect that some of you alleged casuals are far more hardcore than you realize and are simply mislabelling yourselves. 1 or 2 more expansions from now and Rathe won't require 60+ people. At one time, Trakanon required 60+ people. Now, 5 expansions later, he is soloable. Aren't there single group teams tackling some of the bigger Velious dragons? I thought I read somewhere that a 6 person group took down a Luclin boss, too. I mean, it's POSSIBLE to do it with less than 60+ people later on. Granted the extreme examples I stated are uberest of uberly equipped people doing these previous end raid encounters with 6 or less people. However, it stands to reason that 30 or so less than uberly equipped people with post content levels/spells and decent but not amazing items could then tackle such content. I'm sorry but if 30 people is considered something beyond casual gamer capable, I'm stymied as to what you are expecting from this game. You don't like your 6 people group content and you are complaining that you can't gather 60 people. Have some patience and do what you CAN and enjoy yourselves where you are. I don't know why it can't be fun for you. It's been fun for me and I HAVE BEEN in a raid heavy guild before.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately this isn't the case at all. Success in Everquest is not simply a matter of time served. It's also who you know, and how many people you can get online in one place at the same time.<br />
<br />
Kylt, it's ALWAYS been like that for &quot;end game&quot; encounters in EQ. It's not new, and it's not something that came along because of Velious, Luclin, or PoP. May I remind you all that Plane of Fear required a raid force. Plane of Hate required a raid force. Plane of Air not only required a raid force of a specific number and TYPE (Necro, Wizard, Cleric), it often required dedicating yourself to camping out up there and staying several days in one spot. Lady Vox and Nagafen were not 6 man group encounters, either. I mean, c'mon now. Be at least a little realistic.<br />
<br />
There is no progression for us unfortunately- normal --&gt; hard in LDoN is a quantum leap in difficulty.<br />
<br />
Really? Why haven't I noticed this while wearing my Velious or Bazaar purchased armor? I have reconciled myself to doing ONLY hard LDoN's, should I get invited to do any at all. I have thoroughly enjoyed the challenge of them and I am not wearing one piece of ornate. NOT ONE. I agree that hard LDoN's have an element of difficulty in them, but I wouldn't claim that it is a quantum leap in difficulty. That's really stretching the truth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We used to do Vox with 20-30 people.  Plane of Fear with 20-30 people.  Plane of hate with... 20-30 people.<br />
<br />
And, for those encounters, they didn't even have to be the same people.  You could do casual raids to the planes.  You could do an open raid on Vox.  <br />
<br />
The encounters were a) not dependent on huge numbers, and b) were not dependent on the equipment of the people participating.  A shaman in full totemic armor could participate in a plane of hate raid (and often did) as easily as someone a little better geared.<br />
<br />
In Velious (my favorite expansion btw) - the number requirement went up.  However, and this is *key* (pun!) they didn't add pre-requisites to accessing the upper-end content.  The casual gamer could still participate fully.  There wasn't a requirement of having first done flags AA through ZZ, or of having camped 11 parts of a key in various zones (one of which is really 5 parts), etc etc.  Even in upper-end Velious you could hold open invite ToV raids.  The less-geared player would take more ae Damage (oh no) but could still participate.<br />
<br />
So no, it hasn't always been like that.</div></div><hr />

You really think that the difference between a normal LDoN where healing is an option, not a necessity, and LDoN hards is small?  Ever try main healing in an LDoN hard as a shaman?  Mobs go from hitting in the low 300's (if that) to doubling for 990ish and mitigating slow- all of them. Nevertheless, they still die in a very short time, so you can't slow well, you can't heal well and you don't do solid dps in short fights- oh wait, that's a whole different thread. :P<br />
<br />
It is a massive step up in difficulty, but I'm not complaining (other than making my shaman obsolete)- it's the single group, challenging content we can do around our schedules that we love. It's a great feeling equipping those warlord gauntlets that you earned yourself, as opposed to buying 99% of the rest of your gear in the bazaar via E*verTrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u80"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p80">The problem Otoole is you assume that EQ will<br />

1. Last forever. <br />
<br />
2. Not be populated by the farming lewt hungry munchkins that due to thier raiding lifestyle Have the gear to solo Trakanon. And 6 bo The Avatar of war and such.<br />
<br />
When it becomes trival enough for the casuals to do something with 12 - 18 people there is almost always a Raider/ ubermunchkin already pharming. With his 3 box macroquested combo o doom. And for a casual who does not have an army of rangertwinks or Packet sniffing blankwads checking when things are up It can actually be a challange fighting down to mobs that are not even up... then guess what. Casuals are by nature casual. so they dont spend the next 30 minutes looking for another target for thier 2 hours of play. They settle down to xp for a bit. Or log or go do an LDON causeing a random 4-6 people to get disapointed cause yet AGAIN thier playstyle is not rewarded no matter how much of thier limited free time they are willing to sacrafice to the gods of EQ Spawns.<br />
<br />
And yes maybe in 2059 I will be level 250 with 1697 AA and I will finally through sheer force of will have acumilated enough complete heal potions to Damage sheild my way past the RZTW script and step foot into Elementals.. I mean it is possible. Someday. But the liklyhood o that happening is about the same as you determining that maybe just maybe people might play an enjoy different things than you. <br />
<br />
If you love to raid then go ahead. Raid your ass off. But to deny people the ability to experiance and enjoy content by the limitation of how many goosestepping lackys you can muster is just poor design. <br />
<br />
A long time ago I was told by the fledgling uberguilds In The dawn of Velious. You should not be in Dragon Necropolis. It is too hard here. And we did fine. I was ran overtop of in the begennings of Kunark when camping the Howling stones keys by more jerks. Then when I was in howling stones and learned Every nook and cranny of the place I was informed that people were coming past and Killing everything in the wing I had my group in.. because they had more people and were deemed more important by of course themselves.<br />
<br />
At the time that was uber content. And while I was certainly not uber and could not kill the bosses of said zone. I could find a nice or challenge certain things when I chose with my group of friends. Now that is not possible without Many many many more people and that frustrates me. <br />
<br />
In planes of power. I got spectrals out of Plane of justice. I had my guild flagged for storms and Valor, I flagged my guild almost single handedly for Tactics through the quest in storms. (Before The ones were opened to the so called unwashed masses) But sol Ro and beyond is denyed to me without a very large force. Could I handle sol Ro. Yes. Me and my friends could. We could also in time handle Elementals. But without the right mix and number of people there is no chance. No matter how hard we try with indaviduals. You have to raid. And in large numbers. If RZTW ever becomes 12 man doable by the casual gamers without a exploit or the encounter being completly changed I will eat my words gladly.  But we both know that days happening is so slim that it is 2 dimensional. <br />
<br />
Anyways. Continue with everraid. But in time if you keep playing the raiders will have no more gods to crush. And no more &quot;pharms&quot; an when your cleric rotatiosn become shoddy and tired after 6 billion macro cycles and the only person left playing is the Superuberduper raider from hell Maybe you will see what I am trying to say. <br />
<br />
The gap is too great. My time invested is not worth as much as a raiders. and that is unfair. Because my money is.<br />

/disagree <br />
<br />
I have watched flagged people waltz solo into an elemental plane. They click on the little portal thingie and POOF they are into the zone. That's elemental entry WITHOUT a raid. However, you are correct that it took a raid to get the ability to waltz on in. As it stands right now, it requires far more people to take down the PoP bosses you need to get elemental flagged than it will 1 - 3 expansions from now. Mark my words. &quot;Time&quot; really IS the thing that gets you into that content if you are a true casual gamer. I'm not talking about merely the 40+ hours you put in actually raiding, although that IS a big, big part of it. Time, as in:  patience, your time will come grasshoppah, will also get you into that content. There are plenty of &quot;family&quot; or &quot;casual&quot; guilds on Innoruuk that formed alliances with one another to combine their meager forces to take on things bigger than their ranks could handle. The people in this thread complaining about it being &quot;who you know&quot; that helps you gain access to content have apparently been playing another game than I have been playing on and off for 5 years. This game has always, always, always been designed around interedependence on some level. So much so, that effecient soloers were the reason people began their complaints about class balancing in the first place! Nerf Necros, nerf Druid, Nerf Shaman, cried the masses. We can't play without them, don't allow them to play without us! Be careful what you wish for...you just might get it. :p<br />

Oh, Mr. level 46 casual gamer, what did you plan on doing once you entered that plane now that you have access? Were you going to just get a pickup group? Sorry, no dice. PoF, PoH, PoA were RAIDING zones always. Your casual gaming behind still wasn't going to &quot;do&quot; anything in PoF, PoH, or PoA without knowing more than 6 other people in the game. Iz, nothings really changed.<br />
<br />
LDoN, though repetitive to the point of agony, has at least provided upgrades for the casual player. It also provides an &quot;end game&quot; of sorts to progression for the casual- winning LDoN hards.

The point here is- what in LDoN is inaccessible to the raid player? Nothing. They even have LDoN raids for raiders, even though they don't sound like a lot more fun than adventures.<br />
<br />
And I'm still banging my head against this wall trying to explain to you that NOTHING is inaccessible to you IF you have the patience to deal with the fact that you, in your current state, are not yet &quot;equipped&quot; to deal with it (because you intend to take less than 60 of your closest friends). However, at a later state, you WILL be equipped to deal with it because you intend to take less than 60 of your closest friends. You are no less restricted now than you were at levels 1-45 where the Antonica Planes are concerned, back in the day. You were not &quot;equipped&quot; to enter the Antonica Planes prior to level 46 and even then, when you had reached level 46 you would be foolish to go in there with LESS THAN a raid force. However, once Kunark came out....things changed a little. You COULD have entered PoH, PoF, or PoA with less than maximum people and possibly accomplished sections, if not all, of it's content. This kind of game design has ALWAYS been a part of EQ since the beginning. I'm sorry that it's a disappointment to you. However, it's not a recent development.<br />
<br />
Unless that content is flagged and requires a raid guild to access.<br />
<br />
You mean, like PoH, PoF, or PoA were? They were, in essence, &quot;flagged&quot; to only allow level 46 people to enter, much like HoH and BoT require you to be level 62 (?) to enter, since they changed it's implementation. Or, if that doesn't strike your fancy, consider Sebillis or Howling Stones. They were &quot;keyed&quot; and you had to collect some stuff that was insanely annoying to have to collect and turn it in to some annoyingly placed quest guys if you wanted access to those zones. Couple that with the faction hits that the evil races would take in those zones and it hindered peoples willingness to enter those zone in the first place, initially. It wasn't all that easy for an evil to buy/sell if they didn't have access to the Overthere as they were KOS to the only other merchant area for the entire expansion. There were no PoK stones to whisk you away to a non aggro center of commerce. Trust me, there have been PLENTY of annoying hindrances in zone entry and play since day one of EQ. There has ALWAYS been some content designed around a raid force and not all the casual gamers got to go on those raids. C'est la vie.<br />
<br />
Then your server is filled with Candyland slides and gumdrop rainbows, because you'll get a big GFY from the raid guilds on A Ro if you want to leech PoP flags. Anyone from A Ro in EW, SoT, IvM or RiP want to pipe up and prove me wrong? Thought not. It's a gentlemen's club where they will flag each other's apps, but no way they will invite non-raiders into their exclusive content.<br />
<br />
LOL. Mmmmm, gumdrops. :) Seriously, that's not a EQ developer issue then. It's a server issue. It's not like my huband's character will get daily invites to all flag raids in all places of his choosing. But he WILL get them just as I have gotten them. I was not guilded to achieve the flags I have. I asked if I could tag along. I was told I could. I did. Grats me. No big deal. If that's gumdrops and rainbows to you, I highly recommend that you /movelog to a less angst filled server. :) It might be the most meaningful $75 you ever spent on EQ.<br />
<br />
A Ro has an open raid system in place to get some flags, but the highest they've gotten is Sol Ro and the raids are at odd hours of the day or night, so it's exceedingly difficult to get far via this method, at least thus far. But again, you're proving my point- you have to raid to gain access to content, whether it's with a guild of your peers or random people on the server. Why must raiding be the One True Path?<br />
<br />
Sol Ro's not good enough for you right now? Sheesh! You're not looking so casual anymore... ;)<br />
<br />
You have only further proven my point as well, dear Izmalis. You needed a raid to access PoF, PoH, PoA at EQ's inception. You needed a raid to kill Nagafen or Vox if it was your hearts desire. The loots off of them were not being sold in the Bazaar as they were considered &quot;leet&quot; at the time and people who had them, kept them.<br />
<br />
By that logic, PoTime people should lose their raid gear when I see them slumming in zones outside PoTime, Gates, etc... right? Because they don't NEED that gear there, so they shouldn't have it? <br />
<br />
Well, if you are going to reverse engineer my statement, yes that is how it will look. However, consider this: if LDoN's really fit your actual playstyle at the moment and they are already painfully boring with your current substandard (by your estimation) gear, do you think that having Time lewtz is going to spice up your LDoN encounters? I dare say it will make what you already claim as boring even more borings. Sorry. Sad but true.<br />
<br />
I can tell you as a matter of fact that another 4k hps and another 800 AC added to my sk would make a world of difference right now doing LDoN hards<br />
<br />
Of course it would. It would relegate them into essentially LDoN normals with slightly different layouts.<br />
<br />
If I could get upgrades via LDoNs in 2-5 hours I would be ecstatic, but sadly each piece of 760 point armor is 15+ wins for me at roughly 1 hour/win (including setup time, zoning, buffing, etc...) and this is unaugmented, so it's barely better than cultural statwise. Figure another 1500 pts (at least) for 2 good augments or 30 more hours and I will have a piece of gear that won't hold a candle to VT armor. Yeah, we casuals are sure getting over on the raid crowd with LDoN gear! Won't they be so jealous!<br />
<br />
Oh, is that it? You want the raid folks /drooling over your gear? I see the green monster poking out from behind your facade, Iz. Do you want the upgrades to make &quot;a world of difference&quot; doing hard LDoN's or do you want to be /inspected and told you are so &quot;l33t&quot;? Having been told by peeps in the past that I was &quot;uber&quot; because I had my epic or some Velious armor was only marginally fun for a short while. It's not that big a deal and it doesn't get you laid in real life. LOL. PoTime/GoD gear is no different. It's marginally fun to be the best dressed on your server, but it won't get you a raise in pay at work.<br />
<br />
No, it isn't the when, it's the &quot;if&quot;. There's no way, even assuming WoW weren't on the horizon, that I could get into the elemental planes w/o joining a raid guild. No amount of time played will get you into the elemental planes, at least not on my server. Rewards in EQ are exponential if you raid, they're linear if you don't.<br />
<br />
Patience would have as I have been illustrating all thoughout the theme of my responses on this subject. 6 months from now, you WOULD be in the Eplanes with less than 60+ people in order to accomplish that goal. The trouble is you want those FUTURE types of rewards TODAY. Yes, if you want in the Eplanes right now, you best join a raid guild. If you don't want to join a raid guild, stop whining about the Eplanes. In case you haven't heard...they're not the &quot;leetest&quot; place to be anymore. Time and GoD are definately for the uber set. You would still be a peg or two behind the cool kids at the cool table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">by Kylt<br />
We used to do Vox with 20-30 people. Plane of Fear with 20-30 people. Plane of hate with... 20-30 people.<br />
<br />
Grats to you. Really. Do you remember how many people were on each server back then? They used to tell us those numbers at the time. Do you remember how many of those people on the server were level appropriate? I really think that the ratios of players/level had a good deal to do with it in Antonica. Server populations increased though beyond that time and content/player ratios most likely contributed to the &quot;predetermined&quot; raid force size of &quot;current end game&quot; content. You didn't do Trakanon with 20 - 30 people when Kunark was fresh. Lo and behold, raid forces sizes grew only ONE expansion after the original EQ. /gasp<br />
<br />
Oh and for the person who commented about boring strategies with no thought in varying design...you didn't do Venril Sathir with a 0 delay 12 cleric rotation melee heavy yadda yadda. Wizards were a REQUIREMENT to get him dead. I remember there being complaints about that....damn wizard with their cocky &quot;I'm a required class&quot; attitude. lol. It's always something.<br />
<br />
And, for those encounters, they didn't even have to be the same people. You could do casual raids to the planes. You could do an open raid on Vox.<br />
<br />
LOL...not on the rainbow and gumdrop server known as Innoruuk! We had to schedule plane raids according to a community calendar because they were hotly contested. Naggy and Vox couldn't be &quot;scheduled&quot; so they were the race to mob of the higher end guilds until they farmed them clean. Only THEN did Naggy/Vox open up to be casual raid available. That was well, well, well in to Kunark or later maybe. The PoH/PoF/PoA scheduling on Innoruuk continued into the days of Velious. There were many, many, many rants on Innoruuk forums about the European/Asian guilds swiping the planes while we slept. There were many rants about guilds that stepped out of line of the &quot;summit agreement&quot;! LOL. Casual raids for PoH, PoF, PoA...my butt!<br />
<br />
The encounters were a) not dependent on huge numbers, and b) were not dependent on the equipment of the people participating. A shaman in full totemic armor could participate in a plane of hate raid (and often did) as easily as someone a little better geared.<br />
<br />
The encounters WERE dependent on huge numbers. &quot;Huge&quot; at that time was 30 people. C'mon. It's completely relative and wholly relevant to this discussion to keep in mind what that content was like when there wasn't an expansion after it. <br />
<br />
As far as being &quot;permitted&quot; into a Hard LDoN or even a flag raid, NO ONE...and I mean NO ONE makes me list my gear and I do not get /inspected before I get an invite. I recall it being a bit of an issue for Kunark dragons because RESIST gear was pretty important. These were facts learned in the days of failed Vox/Naggy raids due to poor resists. By the time farming Velious Dragon began, resist gear was a MUST. So sorry, that argument also does not hold up as being a &quot;newer&quot; issue based on PoP &quot;breaking&quot; EQ. <br />
<br />
Equipment has always played a role in a players performance, but the only way to get better gear was to keep trying to do harder mobs in weaker gear. Nothing's changed. If you aren't getting group/raid invites because your gear sucks...and that is the line you are being handed, I'd look again in the mirror and see if it's really the gear you wear, or is it perhaps your attitude/ineptitude in the game. I don't know how you play, Kylt, so I am not trying to belittle you. I'm just hard pressed to believe that people look at you and say, &quot;No, you can't do a hard LDoN with my group because you are not wearing PoTime gear, kthx.&quot; If, in fact, they are, I recommend you do a /movelog and go play with less jerks. $75 would be a good investment if it would enhance your enjoyment of the game.<br />
<br />
In Velious (my favorite expansion btw) - the number requirement went up. However, and this is *key* (pun!) they didn't add pre-requisites to accessing the upper-end content. The casual gamer could still participate fully. There wasn't a requirement of having first done flags AA through ZZ, or of having camped 11 parts of a key in various zones (one of which is really 5 parts), etc etc. Even in upper-end Velious you could hold open invite ToV raids. The less-geared player would take more ae Damage (oh no) but could still participate.<br />
<br />
Have you been smoking crack? KEYS were implemented in Kunark and continued from there. VP, Seb, HS...KEYED and considered &quot;upper end&quot; content, pre-Velious! /gasp No zone for joo if you don't have your key! No Trak, no whatshername Sathir, no Kunark end-end game without VP key.<br />
<br />
Velious, while easing up on the key phenomenon was not void of sever annoyances and yes, even keys. That tower in Iceclad made you get multiple keys. The only reason nobody really complained about that is because it wasn't for the highest level characters of the game. By the way, I like that tower. :) What about your Skyshrine key so that you could even get to the other half of Velious? You weren't getting through to Cobalt Scar without that key or a druid...and a TOOTH. C'mon! So we didn't have to get &quot;keys&quot; we had to get &quot;teeth&quot;. Gimme a break. It's NOT NEW. Say it with me: IT'S NOT NEW. :D<br />
<br />
That ToV raid of yours with the open invite...how many loot drops did you get without your many required crazy collection of gems? Grats no key and you can enter (as long as you had a tooth to get you to that half of Velious), but phaction pharming for doing the quests to GET the actual loot for your time investment = PITA. How many dorf heads, giant heads do these jerks really need to LIKE me?<br />
<br />
Again, I may sound like I'm complaining about game design. I'm actually not. I'm reiterating how much we had to do in EACH and every expansion that annoyed each and every one of us. As time passes, we tend to forget that the pain of reaching where are now was ACTUALLY GRUELING at the time. Velious, arguable a very good expansion had it share of annoyances. I repeat this concept until you all understand:<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT NEW TO EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">There is a big difference between having to complete a quest for a tooth to be able to port to Cobalt Scar - *note* a one-groupable affair - and the post-Velious requirements to access end-game raid content.<br />
<br />
Every requirement you listed, save the trak tooth for VP key, is either soloable or required a minimalist group at best.  Faction farming in Velious - soloable.<br />
<br />
It may take a casual gamer a week as opposed to a day to get max ally dragon faction, but it's still doable the same as it would be for someone playing hardcore every day.<br />
<br />
Anything soloable, or doable with a very small group, is accessable to the casual gamer.  Forcing players to join a guild system in order to successfully access content isn't.<br />
<br />
The encounters WERE dependent on huge numbers. &quot;Huge&quot; at that time was 30 people. C'mon. It's completely relative and wholly relevant to this discussion to keep in mind what that content was like when there wasn't an expansion after it. <br />
<br />
You're right.  The point is that SOE should never have gone down the road where more people is better.  If you want to implement timesinks, ok I can somewhat see the logic.  But make the timesinks doable by everyone, so that given enough time (read: I don't mean given enough expansions) they can be done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u84"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p84">by Izmalis<br />
You really think that the difference between a normal LDoN where healing is an option, not a necessity, and LDoN hards is small? Ever try main healing in an LDoN hard as a shaman? Mobs go from hitting in the low 300's (if that) to doubling for 990ish and mitigating slow- all of them. Nevertheless, they still die in a very short time, so you can't slow well, you can't heal well and you don't do solid dps in short fights- oh wait, that's a whole different thread. :P<br />
<br />
Yes, as a matter of fact it IS a different thread. You are NOW comparing shaman specific issues to EQ design issues a whole. Yes, I did try to heal in a hard LDoN. According to what the people with amazing gear on this forum say, even WELL EQUIPPED shaman have issues being healer in an LDoN high risk. That's not the issue we are discussing here, in actuality. Your gear wishes will not aid YOU, the shaman, but they might aid your SK. See what I mean? Shaman specific issue. My point of contention in this threasd is: EQ DESIGN as whole.<br />
<br />
It is a massive step up in difficulty, but I'm not complaining (other than making my shaman obsolete)- it's the single group, challenging content we can do around our schedules that we love. It's a great feeling equipping those warlord gauntlets that you earned yourself, as opposed to buying 99% of the rest of your gear in the bazaar via E*verTrade.<br />
<br />
Now if the @#$!! login server would just work occasionally...<br />
<br />
Which was my initial point. Casual gamers have NOT be &quot;ignored&quot; by EQ devs. LDoN = challenging single group content that you can ACTUALLY access at your convience, as opposed to fighting against some other KSing lootwhores. lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">by SnowwSilverhammer<br />
The problem Otoole is you assume that EQ will<br />
<br />
1. Last forever. <br />
<br />
Conversely, you assume EQ will end tomorrow, thus you must have access PoTime TODAY.<br />
<br />
2. Not be populated by the farming lewt hungry munchkins that due to thier raiding lifestyle Have the gear to solo Trakanon. And 6 bo The Avatar of war and such.<br />
<br />
Grats me. The rainbow and gumdrop server of Innoruuk doesn't face these daily issues. That's a server issue, not a game developer one.<br />
<br />
When it becomes trival enough for the casuals to do something with 12 - 18 people there is almost always a Raider/ ubermunchkin already pharming. With his 3 box macroquested combo o doom.<br />
<br />
Again, SERVER ISSUE, not game designer issue.<br />
<br />
And for a casual who does not have an army of rangertwinks or Packet sniffing blankwads checking when things are up It can actually be a challange fighting down to mobs that are not even up... then guess what. Casuals are by nature casual. so they dont spend the next 30 minutes looking for another target for thier 2 hours of play. They settle down to xp for a bit. Or log or go do an LDON causeing a random 4-6 people to get disapointed cause yet AGAIN thier playstyle is not rewarded no matter how much of thier limited free time they are willing to sacrafice to the gods of EQ Spawns.<br />
<br />
Hm. I have only encountered 1, perhaps 2 LDoN's where named were not up. Grats me and my luck with the RNG. Often there have been 2 named per instanced dungeon. Double grats to me that we were able to do both of them most times. Suxors to be me that on one occasion I won the random on a NO DROP mask upgrade but the zone instance ended just as I was about to loot and we were all booted out. No mask, lots of tears as I wept. :)<br />
<br />
And yes maybe in 2059 I will be level 250 with 1697 AA and I will finally through sheer force of will have acumilated enough complete heal potions to Damage sheild my way past the RZTW script and step foot into Elementals.. I mean it is possible. Someday. But the liklyhood o that happening is about the same as you determining that maybe just maybe people might play an enjoy different things than you. <br />
<br />
Apparently they DON'T, Snoww. You see, I hear people whining and moaning about NOT doing something different than I'm doing. I hear them whining and complaining because I am &quot;permitted&quot; to do what I'm doing and they want to do the same thing without the same annoying committment I had to put in. Hey, RZTW took 6 tries over 2 evenings for me. That was WAY MORE than 2 hours of my free time. In fact, the guild I was guesting with was gonna do a 4th try on the first night but I thanked them for having me along, but I had to get to bed due to work in the morning. They ragged me just a little...saying, &quot;You'll be sorry if we get him this time and you miiiiiiissed it.&quot; I knew it was true because I suffered the same 3 losses they did, but that's the breaks sometimes. Luckily for me, they didn't do him and win that night. They opted to wait until the next night and they allowed me to go back in with them. I suffered 2 losses AGAIN that following night and when we beat him, it was a sweet victory. My butt, back, and even my head hurt from sitting in my chair that long not one, but two nights back to back.<br />
<br />
I don't wish everyone as difficult an encounter as mine was RZTW. In fact, I hope you all smack him down on the first try. Really, I do. However, I don't think you should get to do him tonight with 6 - 12 people just because your casual and, allegedly, I'm hardcore. Funny thing is, I'm not hardcore from what I can tell. I just happen to be able to sit at my computer longer than 2 hours at a time....OCCASIONALLY. Not often, but sometimes. Other nights I log in and maybe after 20 - 30 minutes I think of a better way to spend my free time and log off. Even knowing that guilds are doing flags and I could get them done, doesn't prompt me to stay on. I play when I want and don't when I don't.<br />
<br />
If you love to raid then go ahead. Raid your ass off. But to deny people the ability to experiance and enjoy content by the limitation of how many goosestepping lackys you can muster is just poor design. <br />
<br />
Here's what I want to know...just what do you think is in that content you are chomping at the bit to enjoy? I was in Plane of Earth last night. You know what's there? YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE, you just don't know it yet. Click the links and prepare to be amazed! It's *mostly* models you're already familiar with: <br />

<br />
A long time ago I was told by the fledgling uberguilds In The dawn of Velious. You should not be in Dragon Necropolis. It is too hard here. And we did fine. I was ran overtop of in the begennings of Kunark when camping the Howling stones keys by more jerks. Then when I was in howling stones and learned Every nook and cranny of the place I was informed that people were coming past and Killing everything in the wing I had my group in.. because they had more people and were deemed more important by of course themselves.<br />
<br />
Ok, then why are you whining about needing a raid force to get into the Eplanes? Clearly you and your amazingly skilled casual friends should find this content completely challenging to you, but doable like all other expansions. I was told the same things about DN...and even better that Sirens Grotto v2 was still too buggy even after the &quot;fix&quot; and unplayable as a result. The &quot;uberguilds&quot; of Velious on my sever wouldn't touch that zone with a ten foot pole. My guild of idiots thought it more to be a challenge that must be overcome. Hard? Ha! We went in anyway. We did it because nobody actually TRIED to do Sirens Grotto with any kind of tactic. It WAS a PITA zone to try to kill trash to get to the named mobs. Respawn rate made it very, very difficult. There weren't a whole lot of &quot;pull&quot; spots at the time and it wasn't easily navigated. We decided that it was time to forget the trash and just gun for the named and keep trying until we discovered a tactic that reduced the amount of trash to kill before the real mob we were after. After MANY attempts, we figured it out and we farmed and we farmed and we farmed. The &quot;uber&quot; guild of the time would send in &quot;spies&quot; to see what we were up to. We sent &quot;spies&quot; to watch them try to do it our way and fail....and we laughed and we laughed. Then, we just told them how we did it, then they did it too. One thing we learned in all our attempts at whipping that silly zone even before it was dumbed down...GEMS LIVED IN SG. We had stacks and stacks and stacks of gems that we would need once we were farming ToV. Even though the loot tables weren't great in SG, we had the knowledge that WE did it when it was still hard to do. We had one thing to show for it, too. People from other guilds on other servers were logging in level one invented characters just to ask us about a piece of loot we posted on Alla's with our guild tag on it. It was a monks dream belt at that time until other pieces outshined it later on in the game overall. We got credit for finding stuff, not because we thought ourselves to be amazing, nor did we pat ourselves on the back everyday. The merry band of idiots I was with weren't jerks. We just enjoyed the game and the more challenging and exciting the better. Spending as much time in SG as we did was proof enough. The loot in there wasn't great. We spent a lot of time in there anyway farming gems for later.<br />
<br />
At the time that was uber content. And while I was certainly not uber and could not kill the bosses of said zone. I could find a nice or challenge certain things when I chose with my group of friends. Now that is not possible without Many many many more people and that frustrates me. <br />
<br />
Not true. You CAN be challenged and do certain things with your friends, you just can't do the Eplanes until you make a few more friends and do what has to be done. Sounds like it's time to broaden your horizons, make an alliance of some sort with some other people and just do it.<br />
<br />
In planes of power. I got spectrals out of Plane of justice. I had my guild flagged for storms and Valor, I flagged my guild almost single handedly for Tactics through the quest in storms. (Before The ones were opened to the so called unwashed masses) But sol Ro and beyond is denyed to me without a very large force. Could I handle sol Ro. Yes. Me and my friends could. We could also in time handle Elementals. But without the right mix and number of people there is no chance. No matter how hard we try with indaviduals. You have to raid. And in large numbers. If RZTW ever becomes 12 man doable by the casual gamers without a exploit or the encounter being completly changed I will eat my words gladly. But we both know that days happening is so slim that it is 2 dimensional.<br />
<br />
First of all, I didn't say RZTW would be 12 man doable any time soon, but don't say never. You will most likely end up eating your words. Who knew EQ would last 5 years? I sure didn't. I can't rightly say that EQ will be no more in 1 or another 5 years. I can't predict it. <br />
<br />
Anyways. Continue with everraid. But in time if you keep playing the raiders will have no more gods to crush. And no more &quot;pharms&quot; an when your cleric rotatiosn become shoddy and tired after 6 billion macro cycles and the only person left playing is the Superuberduper raider from hell Maybe you will see what I am trying to say. <br />
<br />
The gap is too great. My time invested is not worth as much as a raiders. and that is unfair. Because my money is.<br />
<br />
Snoww, Innoruuk was a lot more like that BEFORE than it is now. Maybe the majority of the jerks from Inny /movelogged to your server. ;) It's not THAT bad these days. People appear to be a lot more willing to help others out. I remember the days of massive guild wars as they all raced to each named mob when the servers came up. There's still a bit of that taking place, but by no means is it the same hectic brawl that it was in the days of Velious and Luclin. Either people mellowed a bit as the server &quot;grew up&quot; or the jerks already tired of Innoruuk and went to torment some newer meat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't forced to join a guild system in order to successfully access content. I'm not even forced to play EQ. Go figure. ;)<br />
<br />
While it's definately beneficial to join a guild, it is NOT a requirement. This is a player issue, not a development one. People can raid together and not be guilded together. There is no law, no rule, no command issued forth that one must be guilded to do a plane raid. Pick up raids are just as viable today for gaining flags as they have been alleged to be concerning Naggy and Vox and the Antonica planes. If your server doesn't engage in this kind of behavior, it sucks. Truly it does. However, you cannot blame the game developers because you are in a lousy community. While it certainly make me feel compassion for your plight, it doesn't make me want to rip out a developers still beating heart so that I can cram it down his throat. I suggest you try making a few more friends and create a coalition with flagging as the reason for the union. If you want in that badly, do what it takes. I paid the same $12.95 you did. I whined and bitched and moaned about how stupid I think flags are...and then, I went and did them anyway. Case closed.<br />

Faction farming in Velious - soloable.<br />
<br />
Tell that to the warriors. We know how good they are at soloing. Faction farming cost money to buy the heads or time to kill them yourself. That's really what we're discussing here...REQUIREMENTS for content. I know plenty of people who didn't have a Cobalt Scar tooth for a looooooooong time because they couldn't solo the drake for the key and they couldn't round up a capable group at a convenient time. I dare say they were just as annoyed at not being able to get beyond Skyshrine as you are about not being able to get beyond tier 2/3. Back then, to them, it was the straw that broke the camel's proverbial back. Today, flags are your straw. It's all relative to the timeframe and the disgruntlement of the player in question.<br />
<br />
You're right. The point is that SOE should never have gone down the road where more people is better. If you want to implement timesinks, ok I can somewhat see the logic. But make the timesinks doable by everyone, so that given enough time (read: I don't mean given enough expansions) they can be done.<br />
<br />
Kylt, what part aren't you understanding? They ARE being done...just not by YOU. You will need to make several more friends in order to do what you want to do. Are friends bad?</div></div><hr />

Um.  Until I joined WoW Alpha in Oct/November I was the raid leader for a 4-year old PoTime/Uqua level guild.  This is not a whine.  I have done everything that has been done in Everquest.<br />
<br />
And you're still comparing requirements that required one OK OMG TWO people to complete to full-blown time and GoD flag raids?  How can you possibly compare something that requires two people with something that requires over 50?  You're comparing a single-mob kill in Skyshrine with a complex raid that requires CC'ing 11 mobs?<br />
<br />
You really think that both are equally accessible to a casual gamer?<br />

No, not quite. I took your nostalgic &quot;Velious was my favorite expansion&quot; comment and reminded you that there were REQUIREMENTS (the point of the entire argument) to gain entry to Velious content. I've been making comments that REQUIREMENTS to gain entry to Everquest content is not new by design. Nor is having to gather a more than 6 man party to do so NEW. That requires looking at each &quot;level&quot; of EQ and each expansion on it's own and recognizing that this whinefest about access to content, while packaged with a new scent each expansion is the same whinefest it has ALWAYS been. VP access = whinefest. ST access = whinefest. VT access = whinefest. Now, Eplanes/PoTime access = whinefest of such magnitude I have to wonder what was placed in peoples rectums. Is it because it's more than ONE ZONE that they were are blocked from? I think so. However, as I clearly recall...one of the OTHER sources of a whinefest was because high end content was &quot;too limited&quot; and all the &quot;top&quot; guilds were crammed into one zone after they took out all the nameds that popped. Kylt, was your guild one of the guilds whining about needing more than one zone to play in so that yours wouldn't be hindered by having to play with other slightly less uber guilds? I hope not. If so, you got what you asked for and now arguing against the very thing you wanted.<br />
<br />
You really think that both are equally accessible to a casual gamer?<br />
<br />
Are you casual? Then how in the hell did you do &quot;everthing that has been done in Everquest&quot;? And if you are casual, why aren't you telling the casual &quot;I don't have access to content&quot; folk to take a look at you? Why aren't you a gleaming example of what they CAN do if they stop bitching about it and just deal?<br />
<br />
Sorry, who the **** are you again?<br />
<br />
I'm Otoole Frostypants, damnit! :p {Female, by the way}<br />
<br />
I'm not uber. I'm not end game, but I manage to do what EQ has to offer. I am here to tell the people who insist it can't be done that it CAN if they stop setting the limits of how many friends they are willing to make, or to just be patient until their limited number of friends CAN do it without the extra help they are complaining about requiring. Those are the options available to the casual gamer. Make more friends or wait until later. It's a pity that you can't understand that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">Are you casual?<br />
<br />
No, I'm not a casual gamer at all.  But that doesn't invalidate the argument that casual gamers should have access to more game content.  I see their point and concede it.  My original argument (i think?) was that past requirements were minimal, and those that did exist were doable by casual gamers.  They didn't require membership in a 100+ member guild.  They were timesinks, yes, but timesinks that could be completed within a reasonable timeframe, not a timeframe measured by how many expansions it would take to accumulate enough gear to be able to complete the content with less numbers.  And don't even get me started on how SoE managed to create an impediment to the constant replenishment of numbers in order to just *maintain* a viable raid force via the implementation of the very flags that are supposedly simply required to progress in the first place.<br />

Did you pay more for the extra content you've gotten because of the extra time you can afford to put into the game?<br />
<br />
I would like to get the same enjoyment out of the game and same chance at what i paied for without having to have my character played 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, run off leaving people in a jam at the drop of a hat because I have to be at a spot at the ordered time.<br />
<br />
I dont want to grind for 4-6 hours for AA experience, I dont want to mindlessly kill the same mobs over and over and over in BoT. Can i get into higher planes without doing it? No cant get there without putting in the Time, Time, Time, its shouldn't be based on the amount of Time you put into the game, last i seen quest was part of the name of the game, why isn't there some more quests you can do that dont require 4+ groups to do that give real exp. <br />
<br />
Would be nice if you got something for tradeskills, you are learning and experiencing something. Just a token for accomplishments, rather than yeah your a master tailor now you can sell stuff. Why not get a AA point for ever 250 skill you get in a trade. <br />
<br />
How about some real quests that give real experience as the reward and not just as a entry to a zone or a piece of equipment. Remember back when orc belts would actually get you real experience? Why is it that nothing of that nature was implemented on any level past newby level? Sure would be nicer if we had some other method of acquiring some experience without having to kill en mass to get somewhere.<br />
<br />
Heck how about finishing the apprentice amulet quests? Hell thats something we should have been fighting for since kunark was released imho. No sorry to say the faster and higher we got they gave us exactly what the elite of us asked for, more content for the elite, more items for the elite. Well sorry i think we may have been elited right out of a job. <br />
Im not to the point of being completely useless yet, not like the folks who are up to doing GoD content and find themselves lacking, who by the way will probably either re-roll, or quit, or oh gee be back in the old zones, till we start tripping over ourselves. No but i look ahead and am starting to ask, why go on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u91"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p91">Just one quick last note before I go to bed :x<br />
<br />
No interest in playing WoW at the moment personally.<br />
Just from reading all about it on The Crucible and various other forums im wondering if too much is expected of it.<br />
Hope for a lot of peoples sake it turns out to be as good as they hoped.<br />
Remember the pre DAoC etc and how that was going to be the answer to peoples problems with EQ.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's entire approach to the WoW project has been baffling.  It is quite simply put an approach that we, as EQ players, are not used to.<br />
<br />
Allow me to explain.  If you go to www.gamespot.com, and do a search for world of warcraft, you can find the first preview they did of the game:<br />
<br />
http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/worldofwarcraft/preview_2809173.html <br />
<br />
This preview was dated September 9th, 2001.  We're coming up onto over 3 *years* ago since the first preview was written.<br />
<br />
http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2001/pc/rpg/w0w/wow_screen002.jpg <br />
<br />
This picture was taken in a zone called Westfall, just west of Stormwind (human main city).  My paladin is actually camped there at the moment, very close to where this screenshot was taken.  WoW has just made it to beta.  The zone that this picture was taken of has existed for over 3 years.<br />
<br />
Alpha, and now Beta, consisted of a series of pushes.  Certain content was locked while other content was made available for testing.  You hear alot about the &quot;Undead push&quot; in Alpha.  That was a time when, for about a month, everyone had to play undead characters from level one.  In otherwords, the Undead areas were fully and completely tested from the ground up.  The biggest bug I reported in the Undead push was a hole I managed to fall into and couldn't climb back out of, a landscaping flaw.  I'll check tomorrow but I'm willing to bet that the hole isn't there anymore.<br />
<br />
The Horde push tested the Horde areas fully.  And a new class, the shaman.<br />
<br />
The level cap was raised very slowly.  In 4 months the cap has been raised from level 25 to level 30.  That's 4 months of testing *just* lower level content.  Now there are rumors (probably true) that the cap will be raised to level 35 in the next push, and at the same time druids will be made available as a play class.  If, on average, the push lasts a month, then you now have 1,000 players testing content from level 30-35.<br />
<br />
The point is, the amount of care that is being put into making WoW *the* game at release is staggering.  No detail is too small.  Tunes are made.  <br />
<br />
And also, thank god, Blizzard isn't afraid to completely overhaul existing systems that were already in place.  At the moment weapon damage is being completely redone becuase it was discovered, in Alpha, that fast weapons were consistently outdamaging big damage, long speed weapons and as a result warriors were all running around with daggers as primary weapons.  The entire talent system is apparently being redone.  The list goes on.<br />
<br />
Raid content?  Who knows.  I've heard rumors of hires made by Blizzard in this department though and some people that posted on this thread might be eating shoe down the line...  Raid content is months away from testing, 30-35 still hasn't been done.  Speculation puts the required raid force in WoW at a much lower number than is required in EQ.  Number requirement does not equal skill requirement or challenge and thank god Blizzard has been paying attention.<br />
<br />
Misnomers on this thread - soloing is not the most efficient way to level.  For you powergamers out there, duoing &quot;elite&quot; mobs in an instance dungeon of your own creation is by far the best way to go if xp gain is all you're after.  But with so much actual *content* in the game, I'll be quite surprised if the majority of players simply powerlevel themselves to 60.  I'd kind of feel sorry for them for missing so much :P<br />
<br />
WoW in its current form is definately a casual friendly game.  There's a couple of unfinalized factors that will influence this however.  #1) xp rate gained in WoW at the moment might not be the release rate, and #2) on the boards themselves there is talk about an xp bonus/penalization system to help alleviate the burden of some xp from casual gamers.  Think bell curving xp gain across the population.<br />
<br />
For me, personally, the choice to play WoW came down to a couple factors.  Primarily was the opportunity to test the game out.  But just comparing the games themselves?  I could log onto EQ, and spend 6 hours of preparation/downtime and an actual hour of killing boss mobs in plane of time.  Or I could log onto WoW, and do whatever I felt like.  No stress.  No feeling of &quot;I've done this 1,000 times before&quot;.<br />
<br />
Will WoW be a letdown?  I'll be frank.  WoW is going to blow EQ out of the water.  I've played every single MMRPG released since Everquest.  None of them had the polish, content and fun-factor of World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
The hype is justified.  And hopefully godwilling the game will be released without another 3 yrs going by :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">The current high end raiding shaman, even if they are not members of FoH, are on this forum telling you what is wrong in the &quot;end game&quot;. How would they know? They are THERE experiencing the issues first hand. Perhaps you would like to chastise them for noticing the &quot;state of EQ&quot; as you have FoH? <br />
<br />
Simply put no they are not.  The biggest issue in EQ is that its designed for a small minority of players - raiders.  Non-raiders are simply pp farmers who buy their gear from the bazaar (off raiders for whom its substandard) or else bore themselves to death doing LDoN over and over to get gear that is poor compared to raid gear from an expansion 2+ years old.  Where will I find Furor demanding a fair deal for non-raiders?<br />
<br />
And when you point this out they give you crap about how casual players can now go do Kunark content, lol.  I mean: just how good is 'top end' loot like jaundiced plate these days.  I must apologise: asking you to take your blinkers off was demanding too much from you.<br />
<br />
[Edit: just to add:]<br />
<br />
The mess EQ is in right now is a direct consequence of SoE designing for raiders to the exclusion of non-raiders.  So please stay with EQ, and leave WoW unpolluted by the wants of raiders so the majority of gamers can enjoy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">I can see 2 months after WoW release.<br />
<br />
You can probably close your eyes and level up to lvl 40 in a couple hours.<br />
<br />
Pretty funny comment. Nevermind that there are numerous reviews, made by players and also by reviewers from different gaming sites and magazines, telling how they in few hours of FUN questing and adventuring had reached level 5 or 6. That's at newbie levels. Doesn't exactly sound to me as if someone can get to level 40 in 2 hours. I can level newbie char in EQ up to level 10 within short time, and even that is not an achievement, as some will do more in same time. Not to mention it's dead boring.<br />
<br />
Quests in EQ are most not worth even bothering for. Someone mentioned scripted events and such - do they even realize how darn long it actually took to get first such quest into the game? And how many there actually are, when compared to all the quests in the game? Very few, not to mention most of them also suck.<br />
<br />
EQ is the first, and so far also only online game, where a person matters nothing. All what matters in the whole game is how many people band together under one banner, the more the better. Or, should I say, if you have more people under one banner, then you actually stand a chance to get something. Not to mention that EQ has half the content, which is made for those people, who have no life and can spend like 8 hours DAILY to play the game. Rest are just the suckers who pay the same fee every month, but are not eligible to the content simply because the Devs are idiots. Nothing should be given out on a silver platter within 5 minutes, but NOTHING should take more then 2-4 hours to &quot;finish&quot; or aquire either. Not to mention that while a group or two should not be able to take on everything there is, NOTHING should require to have 70+ people on at the same damn time just to get one thing done. That is not a challenge, that's idiocy.<br />
<br />
The person who wrote, how Diablo people came to try out EQ and are so &quot;happy&quot; for starters - sure, when the thing is NEW, it's always cool. However, let them level some more. Let them try to reach any content, or gear, without belonging to some &quot;uber&quot; guild on their local server. Let them try to get their high 50's and 60+ spells on their own. Let them try to get their epics etc. You know, in a short while, realization will hit them like a brick on the head and they'll be thinking &quot;*** are we doing here anyway, this all sucks..&quot;. For me, personally, ONLY reason why I still am in EQ are the people I met and became friends with. I only log on to the game during the days, when we have a guild raid, because then I am doing something with these people. It's FUN to be with these people, not the game itself. I don't log on at other days at all, because the game itself sucks. And once WoW is out, we'll move over and EQ will be just another fading memory a la &quot;ah yes, was one game what we played, was 'fun' when we didn't know it, but once we learnt it, we realized how much it sucks&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">Otoole, it's clear to me that you're the reincarnation of a VAK (Verant Ass Kisser) and that no amount of discussion will change your outlook that the separation of the playerbase is no big deal and that casuals will get there if they &quot;just put the time in&quot;.  Kylt, Snoww and others have said it more succinctly than me, so I'll leave it at that.  I do, however, have one last bone to pick:<br />
<br />
 <br />
Seriously, that's not a EQ developer issue then. It's a server issue. <br />
It is most definitely a developer issue, NOT a server issue, unless on your server the raiders are allowed to incorporate their own coding changes into the build.  Last I checked, developers put the idiotic flagging system in place, not raiders- it's to them I assign blame and look for a solution, not to the charity of some raid guild who will let me tag along and leech flags.<br />
<br />
I also want to reiterate what Crusty said- if you think EQ is so swell as a casual player, by all means stay here until the end of time and stay far away from WoW.  Then we both win, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">The biggest issue in EQ is that its designed for a small minority of players - raiders.<br />
<br />
<br />
The point has already been made that we do not KNOW the percentages of raiders to non-raiders. Further, I believe both of these categories of players needs to be broken down further, into hardcaore raiders and semi-casual raiders (of which I am one), and we can further breakdown the casual player group into hardcore casuals (lots and lots of playtime, refuse/dont wish to raid) and true casual gamers. So stop saying things like &quot;A Small Minority&quot; becasue I believe that the TRUE number of &quot;People Who Raid&quot; is WAY WAY closer to HALF of all EQ accounts than you want to believe. <br />
<br />
Now on to these other points about content. First off, both Otoole and Iz and Kylt are right, and you are all also wrong. EP content WILL be accessible to the average EQ player soon enough. In fact, I would not be a BIT suprised to see them open up Tactics and Sol Ro this summer and the EPs this Fall. I do not think they will ever open up Time. Never. ST still isnt open. Neither is VP. Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Here is what pisses me off the most about you people arguing this crap though. You act like its OUR FAULT (people who raid) that YOU cant get into these zones. Stay with me here, WE DID NOT DESIGN THIS GAME! We are simply willing and able to do what it takes to play at that level. For myself, here is what I would RATHER see:<br />
<br />
All EP God encounters in their own, instanced zone. Another instanced zone for all EP Mold dropping encounters. Open the EPs in general up to the populus and keep the Mini-Minis there. Make EP raid zones similar to Ssra. No one goes to Ssra for XP. No one goes there for 1-group loot drops. People go there for one reason, RAIDS. God and Mold droppers are raid level mobs. You MUST admit that Raiding people need content too. <br />
<br />
Make the EP XP zones keyed, but have them be one-group completable similar to OS, Tactics back-door, etc etc. Make them difficult and time consuming, but keep them ONE GROUPABLE. Keep some loot in there for the general folks. Lots of the one-group drops in the EPs are VERY nice, my club, FT3 belt in Fire, Class Pet-Proccing weapons, etc etc. <br />
<br />
But remember, I didnt make it the way it is. I didnt design the flag system. I didnt create keys. SO STOP BLAMING ME.<br />
<br />
Otoole, I love you man, and I readily agree with TONS of what you are saying. But these guys DO have a valid point. The flag system is stupid. But it has to be there as long as there is end-game raid content in those zones along with general mobs. As it has been proven, events in general zones blow. RZtW gets messed up by joker-punk-snot noses who get off screwing with people. Aggnar can get so laggy that even GOOD guilds lose to him due to warping and bad lag. <br />
<br />
Iz, Kylt, Snow, Crusty, and whoever else cares, remember this. 6 months ago, no one would EVER have thought it possible for a pick-up raid to take down mobs like Bert, MM, and RZ. Now its being done regularly. As time goes on, and more people get better gear (VIA LDoN or whatever), and more AA, you will see more and more pick-ups doing these mobs. Eventually, I think Pick-ups will be doing MOST of the flag mobs in the game, period. It happend with Naggy and Vox. It happened to an extent to Kunark dragons. I see pick-ups doing Bosses in Luclin now. If you are a &quot;hardcore casual&quot;, in efect you play a TON but just dont wish to join a high end guild or raid, this is going to be your only path for a while. Sorry. One more time, with feeling.<br />

Blazz, I sincerely hope you were typing this post and didn't see my post DIRECTLY above yours before you made that statement.  I have nothing against raiders- the game designers were, are and always will be the doorstep at which all blame must ultimately rest.  The only time casuals quibble is when raiders tell them to &quot;leave your friends and join a raid guild if you want access to the content you paid for&quot;- that's not constructive and essentially tries to treat the symptom, not the cause of casual irritation.</div></div><hr />

Did you pay more for the extra content you've gotten because of the extra time you can afford to put into the game?<br />
<br />
What extra time is that? You see, it's an ASSUMPTION on the part of people who oppose what I have been saying that I somehow play EQ for 12 - 18 hours per day. Sorry. No go. I'm an adult. I have a job. I have to go to that job if I desire to get paid. I have bills. I own a house. I have a mortgage. I can't take that lightly. I am not the kind of player you imagine. I'm probably more like you (the casual gamer) than you understand. I STILL GO ON FLAG RAIDS.<br />
<br />
I would like to get the same enjoyment out of the game and same chance at what i paied for without having to have my character played 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, run off leaving people in a jam at the drop of a hat because I have to be at a spot at the ordered time.<br />
<br />
I don't play that way and those of you who insist that this is the ONLY way to reach the Elemental Planes are out of your minds. I have not been guilded to get the flags I have. I do not play 12 hours a day, 7 days a week and I don't run off leaving people in a jam at the drop of a hat. Without all of that nonsense, I still have managed to do flag raids. <br />
<br />
The extremes that people will go to in order to state that it is the ONLY WAY flags can be accomplished are the ones who are dead wrong. I am walking evidence that flags can be done WITHOUT membership in a guild and WITHOUT playing for 12 hours at a stretch. The 2 nights back to back of RZTW were definately more than 2 hours but not anywhere near close to 12. Keep in mind, the folks I was with tried to take him down 3 times EACH night and I had the free time to keep trying. If I hadn't, I wouldn't have stayed. It's that simple. I would have had to try some other time with some other group of people. So what?<br />
<br />
Even attempting RZTW 3 times per night didn't equate to 12 hours of time invested per session. Nowhere is it stated that he has to be attempted at minimum 3 times in one session. Therefore, if YOU want to give him a go, you can do so once win or lose and leave other attempts for another session. If you opt to give him another shot before logging off...THAT'S YOUR CHOICE. <br />
<br />
You people exaggerate WAAAAAAAAAAY too much. It's not the content that precludes you. It's your assumptions about that content that precludes you.<br />
<br />
I dont want to grind for 4-6 hours for AA experience,<br />
<br />
How do you plan on getting AA experience? You want to do a quest for it? Ok, guess what...flag quests give you an AA exp point as one of it's rewards. :D You know what else? Raids give experience, now. It's not like the old days when the KS group gained exp while everyone else got nothing. So, even while raiding you will receive experience. Granted, it's not the BEST exp in game, but it doesn't leave you gaining nothing at all for the time online. I have managed to ding AA's while on raids.<br />
<br />
I dont want to mindlessly kill the same mobs over and over and over in BoT. Can i get into higher planes without doing it?<br />
<br />
Tell me again what game you have been playing? Clearly, it's not Everquest. You see, in order to LEVEL your character past level 1 you had to either mindlessly turn in muffins, bonechips, shark meat or other such items to hear that little ding for as long as it was viable. The other alternative was to mindlessly kill rats, snakes, bats, kobald runts, spiderlings or other such mobs over and over and over until you heard that little ding. So, that argument also doesn't hold up. If you had to perform such rituals to get from levels 1 - 2, why were you expecting it to be different now?<br />
<br />
Also, last time I checked the flag progression, it was only required to kill a mob such as RZTW one time to get that portion done. I've done the Carprin kill more than once and when I hailed him the second time I did it, I was told I already had that flag. Amazingly I didn't HAVE to kill him over and over and over to get the flag. I only had to kill him ONE TIME. The fact that I have done it more than once for the sake of OTHER people receiving a flag isn't a big problem to me. As others have done for me, I opt to give in return to others in need. So what? It was fun killing Carprin once. It was fun killing him a second time. Sure, the 50th time might be boring, but I haven't killed him 50 times. I really don't understand your argument. It's been a part of EQ's design since day one. If it took you this long to comprehend it and hate it....leave. Play something else. EQ's not for you.<br />
<br />
No cant get there without putting in the Time, Time, Time, its shouldn't be based on the amount of Time you put into the game, last i seen quest was part of the name of the game, why isn't there some more quests you can do that dont require 4+ groups to do that give real exp.<br />
<br />
Funny, quests also take-------time. I play it to fill some of my free TIME. I have done it because I have enjoyed it. On days when I have not, I logged off. Not all days are filled with glee and fun. Some days I have logged on and it just didn't do it for me. However, if it was like that for me every single day I logged in, I would have hung this game up years ago. I tried DAoC. It was fun for 2 months because it was &quot;new&quot;. Then, when day after day that I logged in revealed my repetitive boredom, I ceased playing. It wasn't fun. It didn't satisfy what I was searching for to fill my free TIME. No big deal. I didn't spend weeks, months, or years complaining on their forums telling their developers to get their heads out of their azzes. I simply stopped playing, cancelled my account and found something else to do. Granted, I never actually got &quot;hooked&quot; enough into DAoC to give a damn. I wasn't attached to my character. I hadn't invested that much TIME into it. Still, even if the shaman class in EQ never gets looked into and improved, I will STILL play EQ. I will just be another character...like a bard or a necro or a cleric or a wizzie or a mage...etc. Why? Because after all is said and done, I enjoy playing EQ and I enjoy having a good time with the people I meet on my server. That's essentially why I play and I have gotten what I paid for.<br />
<br />
They days that the login server were down really sucked. I would have rather been playing. I was annoyed that I couldn't access the content I paid for. You see, that's what REAL denial of access to content is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">CrustyOldShaman<br />
Simply put no they are not. The biggest issue in EQ is that its designed for a small minority of players - raiders. <br />
<br />
First off, if the SMALL MINORITY of players are raiders, where the hell are all these so called casual gamers? I have covered this territory already, C-O-S. PoI has, at this moment in time 12 people in it. 2 full groups of people in their 50's. I know this only because my husband is playing his casual gamer Ogre warrior right now. I'm not kidding when I say that 12 people in PoI at the moment is a BIG number compared to other days that I have been in there soloing to gather tinkering drops. Usually I'm there alone or with 3 other people--tops. PoN, empty. PoJ, empty. PoV, numbers definately dwindling since I levelled there. Much harder to get a group than before. PoTactics, 12 people at most any time I'm in there. HoH 3 - 5 people SOLOING. BoT still has a fair share of the population. Even those people take off at various points to go do a flag.<br />
<br />
Non-raiders are simply pp farmers who buy their gear from the bazaar (off raiders for whom its substandard) or else bore themselves to death doing LDoN over and over to get gear that is poor compared to raid gear from an expansion 2+ years old. Where will I find Furor demanding a fair deal for non-raiders?<br />
<br />
Define that fair deal! For the life of me I can't comprehend why LDoN is so &quot;awful&quot;. It's EXACTLY the kind of content that the so called casual gamers asked for. They wanted zones that they didn't have to &quot;compete&quot; for in order to do anything. They wanted to &quot;accomplish&quot; something in under 2 hours of playtime. Hello?! LDoN is the answer to that cry. Yes, an expansion came out after LDoN and it wasn't ALL for the casual gamer. It was for the raider...again. Who's to say that the next expansion won't increase the risk/reward of LDoN type zones or offer MORE of them and focus mainly on the casual gamer again? <br />
<br />
And when you point this out they give you crap about how casual players can now go do Kunark content, lol. I mean: just how good is 'top end' loot like jaundiced plate these days. I must apologise: asking you to take your blinkers off was demanding too much from you.<br />
<br />
If you honestly believe that &quot;Kunark&quot; is what today's casual gamer should be relegated to, I do pity you. 5 expansions to wait WOULD be something to be upset about. However, it's more appropriate to look around and take note that most &quot;casuals&quot; who said they would not &quot;ever&quot; have an opportunity to get into Vex Thall are NOW doing Vex Thall. That's quite a big leap up from Kunark. Those same Vex Thall entering people are doing High Risk LDoN. That content isn't THAT old. It's certainly not 5 expansions old.<br />
<br />
Again, exaggerating is really not a good way to make a case.<br />
<br />
[Edit: just to add:]<br />
<br />
The mess EQ is in right now is a direct consequence of SoE designing for raiders to the exclusion of non-raiders. So please stay with EQ, and leave WoW unpolluted by the wants of raiders so the majority of gamers can enjoy it.<br />
<br />
And again, you are EXAGGERATING just like a lot of people are when it comes to this topic. Non-raiders have not been EXCLUDED and it is absolutely ludicrous to claim that they have. LDoN is the most prominent item to point at and remind you that something was introduced into EQ that did not previously exist...with the casual gamer in mind---uncontested instanced zones that are capable of spawning named mobs. I dare say that augments are ALSO a decent item introduced into EQ that had not existed before. It allowed &quot;casual gamers&quot; to take their current gear and upgrade an aspect of it without the need of a raid force. It also offered the opportunity to recieve decent upgrades to armor via two methods: Adventure point collection system and mob drops in the instanced zones. High Risk LDoN drops are not awful. They may not be amazing GoD drops of today but there is no expansion released with new item drops that doesn't make the previous expansions items pale by comparison. However, even Vex Thal &quot;crap&quot;, if it's better than you currently possess, isn't crap in reality. If it's an upgrade to YOU, then it should still be viewed as &quot;good&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Otoole, it's clear to me that you're the reincarnation of a VAK (Verant Ass Kisser) and that no amount of discussion will change your outlook that the separation of the playerbase is no big deal and that casuals will get there if they &quot;just put the time in&quot;. <br />
<br />
Hahahahahahahahaha! That's really funny. As if I believe my alleged ass kissing would somehow net me something! Please. That's simply laughable. I'm merely a pragmatic individual who bothers to take a step back from time to time to analyze what's around me. There are moments when I get so &quot;wrapped up&quot; in myself and my wants and my desires for my shaman that I neglect to realize why I'm here. That's when I take a step back and try to view the situation without any &quot;emotion&quot; attached. Sure, Otoole isn't quite as powerful as she once was. It's frustrating. It's even a little depressing. However, those are EMOTIONAL reactions because I have invested and insane number of days played on her and I can feel the slip in power. However, I made a bard and I can do things with that bard that I couldn't do with Otoole. Otoole NEVER in her entire career gathered the entirety of the yard trash and a few house escapees in Unrest and kited them ALL dead at level 14. Otoole couldn't have handled a crowd that big. The baby bard could. That was FUN. I got killed a couple of times learning how to do it, but when I saw all those, &quot;You have gained experience!&quot; messages one after another after another as each mob dropped making a massive pile at my feet...I was re-energized because I found something FUN to do in EQ. Only one other person was in Unrest at the time (a level 14 Beastlord) and he watched my bard run in silly stupid circles with a massive train on her heels and he watched me kill them ALL. He thought that looked like a buttload of fun and decided that minute to create a bard for him to play. That was ALSO fun to have someone see something really fun take place and decide to join in the FUN.<br />
<br />
Otoole, while still my favorite character at the moment, will be shelved if she really becomes useless. hundreds of days played later, I will just level up my low level necro or bard or make another character that I would have a good time with. No matter what you guys insist, I still find EQ to be FUN. You won't be able to tell me that I'm not allowed to find fun where I desire. Trust me, I think flags are annoying. But, I realized from a PRAGMATIC point of view, if I wanted to get into the elementals, then I would HAVE to suck it up and do them. So, I have. If you opt NOT to suck it up and do them, that's your choice. Asskissing SOE isn't going to net anyone any flags. LOL. Neither is belittling them day and night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">by Blazz<br />
Otoole, I love you man, and I readily agree with TONS of what you are saying. But these guys DO have a valid point. The flag system is stupid. But it has to be there as long as there is end-game raid content in those zones along with general mobs. As it has been proven, events in general zones blow. RZtW gets messed up by joker-punk-snot noses who get off screwing with people. Aggnar can get so laggy that even GOOD guilds lose to him due to warping and bad lag. <br />
<br />
I don't disagree that the flag system is stupid. I haven't ever said that I thought flags were great nor that they were awesome and a really wonderful thing to be implemented. My point has been and continues to be...FLAGS exist and it isn't JUST PoP that has involved such &quot;restrictions&quot;. I honestly think that this is the first time that it was more than ONE ZONE in an expansion and that upset a lot of people. However, having been in the lagfest that was ToV because every raiding guild was in there farming dragons, I have to say that having more than one place that the high end raiders would have to enjoy so that they would thin out and reduce lag was a good idea. I know, I know, ToV wasn't flagged. Never mind that. People who entered ST had their own share of woes. It was still a battle for competing uberguilds to get to the &quot;content&quot; first since there was only really one place for them that hadn't been done to death for them.<br />
<br />
Even still, as I have been pointing out time and time again...ALL content IS accessible. You just have to do what must be done to access it. There were people complaining in EACH and EVERY expansion that they would &quot;never&quot; get into: VP, ST, VT...and yet those same people HAVE entered those zones. They just did it &quot;later&quot; than Uberguild_01 did. <br />
<br />
Here's some &quot;content&quot; I never had access to: Kerafym. He was one time deal PER SERVER. I paid the same $ as uberguild_01 did. Yet I will not likely see Kerafym (I hope I have the right name, my mind--it's got gaps!) ever. Kerafym would have to be reintroduced into the game by specific intent on SOE's part and I dare say that the guilds who had that feather in their cap would scream bloody murder if they lost that notch in their buckle. Sheesh. It doesn't really matter! It's a game. If it's fun for the uberest of the raiders to be able to say they unleashed Kerafym, by all means, let them have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">My argument is a simple one. <br />
<br />
Without raiding I can not in a reasonable amount of time begin to approach the Raiders ability to get Gear, superior hunting areas, and Zone access.<br />
<br />
The raiders, due to SOE' singleminded approach to Risk Vrs reward can only greatly reward people with 72 man teams. Large targets are the loot dropping cash cows. And a non raider cannot in a reasonable time frame attempt to approach something that has a multatude of raid only encounters blocking the way. <br />
<br />
There is no other avenue of access to elemental planes than Large scale raiding. And since GoD is primarily designed for Elemental planes + charecters there is basicly an expansion that I have purchased and was advertised as 55+ expansion. <br />
<br />
Raiders can access the content for Casual players. but the converse is not true without a huge amount of delay while waiting for item creep and AA creep to catch up (Or the casual becomeing a raider)<br />
<br />
Or how much fun would it have been for SOE to have limited anyone Elemental plains flagged only able to access a new level of LDON missions. Called uber missions. But at the same time cutting them completly out of Normal and hard missions.  Would that be fair? I mean Normal missions are beneath all the ubers right?<br />
<br />

They wanted to &quot;accomplish&quot; something in under 2 hours of playtime. Hello?! LDoN is the answer to that cry.<br />
<br />
Could the reason that you can't comprehend it be simply that you have no imagination?<br />
<br />
Lets try spelling it out to you:<br />
<br />
1.  Non-raiders in the gimp gear have nothing like the dps that raiders have.  So the 90minutes timer is a real threat to failure.  Every LDoN adventure is the same dps-race againt time.  Night after night after night.  It gets to be a pain after a week, let alone six months.  And how many successful adventures does it take to get one slot of SUBSTANDARD gear?  Remember if you are a PoTime player you just need only one augmentation per slot.  If you are a non-raider to get a slot to the minimum level of gimpage you need to get points to buy a very expensive piece of armour and then no less than three augmentations.  The system as it stands is bizarre.<br />
<br />
2.  Non-raiders in their gimp gear need to get a full group to maximise their chances of success.  I was in an established group of adult players so we'd try and wait till all of us were logged on before we started an adventure.  There's no mechanism by which you can add players after you've started, and with the crapomatic 90 minutes timer you couldn't afford to risk a no show even if you could.  It was usually a hour or so before we would start recruiting fill ins for the remaining group places, and often one of us - delayed by RL problems in an adult world - would log in to find we'd started without him.<br />
<br />
3.  Non-raiders, without the safety blanket of a guild, have to rely on filling up empty slots with strangers.  Very often these people turn out to be raiders playing alts who simply go LD when raid is called, or the guild village idiot who nobody from that guild wants to group with. Remember how many times have you read on this forum guild players saying they'd never do a LDoN with a pickup group?  Well unless you are an amnesiac many times - yet now you cant remember that?<br />
<br />
Yes we wanted instanced dungeons.  What we didn't want was the utterly rubbishy adventure system that SoE tacked on top of it.  We wanted instanced versions of dungeons like LGuk, Sebilis.  With proper bsp tree based subzoning this would have been perfectly feasible.  But SoE's Devteam - uber raid orientated as they are - wanted something else.  Hence the leaderboard , and the 'exciting' race against time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Sigh, I just don't know how to say this any other way. LDoN gear is ONLY substandard if you are looking at a Time equiped player man. <br />
<br />
I will agree that the casual player should have access to certain zones through smaller quests. I will agree that the loot tree COULD be a little closer together. But I will never ever agree that people should get raid level loot WITHOUT RAIDING. I am also a full supporter of NO-DROP, which I think was a big mistake with early Dragon gear (making it tradable).<br />
<br />
You cannot sit there and bitch and moan about the plight of the casual player and tell me that the Raider should NOT have SOMETHING unique to style of play as a reward. Sorry, not buying that one single bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL NOTE: SOE has put something newish in for the more casual players. Fabled mobs. Their drops are quite excellent. They do not require 60+ man teams, I know of smaller 60-65 level guilds taht can do some with 3 groups or less. There IS some progress being made in this direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">Without raiding I can not in a reasonable amount of time begin to approach the Raiders ability to get Gear, superior hunting areas, and Zone access.<br />

<br />
Define reasonable Snoww? You mean &quot;now&quot;? Because in all likelyhood, the EP zones WILL be opened up for everyone in some fashion. Its just not going to happen &quot;now&quot;. <br />
<br />
As for gear, you want EP Raid level loot obtainable without having to Raid? This is completely unreasonable. There has to be SOME reward for the people who CHOOSE to raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't see VT or Ssra til well after PoP came out. I couldnt. There was no way. The biggest baddest guilds had that content locked down. So I waited until they moved on. I didnt join a &quot;big bad&quot; guild, I joined a smaller guild considerably behind on the food chain. We have no raiding requirements. We are on a DKP system, you are rewarded for attendance. Want loot? Raid. Don't mind what your wearing? Don't raid. My choice.<br />
<br />
Granted the casual players loot path is more difficult. Personally, I do not know how to solve it without approaching Diablo 2 style droppings. But you can still get LDoN gear, mixed with the PoP gear available to you (please note on my magelo that I wear a Bloodmetal Earring, player made POP item), check out the lower areas of Gates for better augs, stick em in, etc etc etc. Yeah, its gonna take time. Sorry that you dont have time to play, NOT my fault. <br />
<br />
I really do not know what else to add. I agree that the flag system blows. I agree that there should be SOME better loot available to casual players, or that the Uber loot shouldnt be SO froaking good. But I dont have a good solution. Instanced loot zones like Guk and OS available LDoN style? Come on man, there would be 800 instances of each up per server with people in there farming their faces off. Even then, all I would see is casual players whining its all SUBSTANDARD anyway. <br />
<br />
Tired of this debate. The game has a format. Find your level and float at it, or do what it takes to get the next level. Or dont play. Those are the current options. In 6 months, come back here and whine if at LEAST Sol Ro and Tactics arent open for the general population, lvl 65 required. Then I will be on your bandwagon BIGTIME. Until then, sorry, look through the candystore window, like I do (I am not in Time, and have no EP armor at all), and try to be happy with what you have rather than pissed about what you cant get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">I don't begrudge the raider something unique. But when every single slot has 2-3 times the effectiveness of something I am able to get. And tehy can get it faster than I will ever be able to attempt it.. Well something is out of whack.<br />
<br />
In Velious Raiders had the better gear. But it wasnt so bad. <br />
<br />
The problem is one of scale. Once a raider gets established, the gravy train of pharming leads them to rewards that are so far above what a non raider can expect that it is a different game. <br />
<br />
Why is it the raider can expect a reward for thier style of play but Non raiders cannot? There should be rewards for both systems that are close in nature but when in one path the other becomes closed. If you are Bob the raider who when walking forward gods quake at your mighty armies. Then you get the Axe of doom once you have lain low the Lord of battles himself. The other lesser peons of Bob's mighty war machine, also get the spoils of the war. Several drops along the way to shore up thier meager existances! (Taking say 72 men 1 hour for the encounter. So 72 man hours) (Total drops 10-20 on a scale+ the Axe of doom)<br />
<br />
But the non raider should be able to find out who had made the Lord of battles axe and by fighting to the mountain Forge of Skippy the silver armed forge dude and bringing him some matierals that you and your group of 6 buddies could collect in nice 1 hour chunks a few days a week (Total for all encounters 72 man hours) Total drops 6-12 + the newly forged Axe of doom.<br />
<br />
But the drops should be the same along the way. Then you have real choice. RAid and take out the big targets. Or do not raid and enjoy the smaller targets.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">There is a saying in product research man. The 2nd one of any product only costs the material required to make it. The FIRST one costs 10,000 times that. <br />
<br />
What about ALL the flag time invested by the Raider to get all 72 of his people there? What about the time they all invested to get their AAs and gear to a level where that content wouldnt just blow them away? Where does that factor into your equation. You want to charge Fennin Ro in Orante Legs and come away with EP ones? Something doesnt seem right here.<br />
<br />
There is a HELLUVA lot more that goes into getting that &quot;First Big Kill&quot; than you could possibly know. My guild was the 6th on my server to kill RZtW, thus entering the Elemental Planes. It took us 5 failures, and that was a GOOD ratio. Many guilds take more. Thats 5 3+ hour raid nights to kill that guy, who dropped exactly 2 pieces of loot, with no gravy in between start and finish. Took 4 attempts to kill Xegoney. First one we knew we were outclassed, so we spent UNTOLD HOURS farming EP molds and gear so that there were 100 or so people geared up enough to have 72 on sometime to take anotehr shot at her (yes, takes 100 active raiders to achieve a consistant raid force in the 60+ range nightly. Especially with my guild, which has NO minimum raid requirements). <br />

Its worse than VT loot - an expansion 2+ years old<br />
<br />
But I will never ever agree that people should get raid level loot WITHOUT RAIDING.<br />
<br />
Why?  Raiding and grouping are just different playstyles.  If you enjoy raiding then raid, if you enjoy grouping then group.  Theres no greater skill required in raiding than in grouping - at best its a slightly different skill set - at worst you have fewer roles to play in a raid than you do if in a group and unless you are raid leader, most decisions are made for you.<br />
<br />
It certainly isn't about risk versus reward: as you must be aware raiding carries negligible risk - you have battery of clicky ressers and a choice of people to summon corpses if CR is a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot sit there and bitch and moan about the plight of the casual player and tell me that the Raider should NOT have SOMETHING unique to style of play as a reward. Sorry, not buying that one single bit.<br />
<br />
The reward is they get to enjoy their particular playing style' against mobs (even whole zones nowadays) designed for them.  What you are saying is that you demand that non-raiders must be excluded from the phatest lewts ... would that really ruin your enjoyment of the game?  Is that honestly the only motivation for you to raid?  Well I can't think of any reason that does you credit: please explain.<br />
<br />
But most bizarre of all: I will accept all of what you say - FOR EQ - I have left EQ knowing that it will continue to pander to raiders like you, I don't care if you want to continue dumping on the non-raiders in it.  But follow the thread through from the start and you will see that what the non-raiders are saying is please leave WoW alone.  EQ is broken for the non-raider: why must you insist on WoW being broken in the same way?  Thats why we don't want Furor influencing WoW's devel;opment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">First off Crusty, look at my gear. Please. My most recent aquisition was my BP, the PRIDE AND JOY of my entire character. Its from VT. Its 2 year old content. Most of my gear is. Look at it, and tell me what sort of UBER raider you think I am.<br />
<br />
I have readily admitted that there is too large a disperity between what casuals can get and what high end raiders can get, but you are not looking at my point. Raiding is fun only to a certain degree, but a lot of it isnt fun. We do it because we WANT the reward for it. We WANT the extra juice that it nets us. If everyone could get raid level loot without raiding, no one would raid, and the raid-level loot zones would be OVERRUN with people man. <br />
<br />
As it is, there are not enough molds to go around in the EPs, with all the servers at or over 10 guilds flagged (by the way, thats probalby 2000 players per server EP flagged, somehow I doubt this is &quot;15%&quot; of the server total population, closer to 30-40 if you ask me). Granted, this is an artificial shortage created by SOE. They could add more mold droppers. They could make them easily accessible by all players. But they don't, because DIABLO STYLE GAMING BURNS OUT.<br />
<br />
Very little risk in raiding? Gee, I remember one particular week we were trying to kill RZ. Every night we went there. 3 or more hours. Guess what I came away with that week. About a full yellow less XP than I started with, thats what. <br />
<br />
Read my other posts man. I DO agree with some things you say. But others, I am just /boggle, honestly.<br />
<br />
But follow the thread through from the start and you will see that what the non-raiders are saying is please leave WoW alone.  EQ is broken for the non-raider: why must you insist on WoW being broken in the same way?  Thats why we don't want Furor influencing WoW's development.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Adding a comment on this. You must be out of your mind if you think that Blizzard isnt going to have content for the hardcore players. In fact, you must be completely bonkers. SOE knows that the hardcore player is a pretty hefty chunk of their subscribers, why else would they continue to put out content? If hardcore was only 15% as some claim, why put so much into keeping that portion happy? <br />
<br />
Because its MORE than that, probalby more than EITHER of us actually knows. Blizzard knows that. They are a BUSINESS and want as many customers as possbile, hardcore, semihardcore, casual hardcore, and true casual alike. To try and exclude any of these people in a game of this kind is like cutting off a few limbs and still trying to play ball.</div></div><hr />

AS it is there is only one option. Raid. That is the problem. It is not a choice when there is only one option. (Or okay there is a choice Raid, or stagnate) Or can you tell me where there is loot and encounters that are custom made for only non raiders to enjoy that we have not already done? (I am flagged up through tactics, and have the keys for Howling stones, Seblis, VP) And have dropped Servitor of luclin a few times and done the radiir stuff and all the other stuff in UP while luclin was still active. We have been after some of the other smaller level boses and sadly they are almost never up. Raiders keep killing them with alot less people due to thier superior gear and playtimes and usage of superior tactics like Ranger camping and more than likely 3rd party programs for some of them.<br />
<br />
Please remember I am talking about the 72 man montrosities here. There is not a problem with a couple small guilds grouping up to form a force to kill some things. But when the greatest challange to an encounter is comunication and ligistics well you are not longer playing a game but instead Evermanager. The Massivly Multiplayer Online Hand holding game.<br />
<br />
While I am playing Everquest. I want to be entertained and I want to enjoy the fact that the carrot in front of me looks juicy and delicious. But there is a problem for the non raider the carrot is gone. Or at best give the smaller half rotten carrots. <br />
<br />
Is this fair Blazz? And Otoole? Can you honestly say that because you raid you are to be afforded more fun than the next person? If so then thanks for your time, and leave me be.<br />

<br />
The implication of what you are saying is that not-raiding is more enjoyable that raiding: even for those people who raid.  As written the conclusion is that raiding should not be present in any game (remember games are for people's enjoyment) or at least merely a non-essential sideshow to add something different that people could do for variety now and then.  Put the raid-level loot in properly instanced dungeons without the LDoN adventure nonsense and crowding wouldn't be a problem.<br />
<br />
Very little risk in raiding? Gee, I remember one particular week we were trying to kill RZ. Every night we went there. 3 or more hours. Guess what I came away with that week. About a full yellow less XP than I started with, thats what.<br />
<br />
It sounds like you get what you deserved.  A group of non-raiders going deep into a dungeon (quite possibly with no resses available at all) could get far worse in a single night, with nightmare CRs to boot.  Yet they would expect negligible rewards in EQ as it stands.  At least you had the motivation to keep trying because there was the chance of some good loot if you succeeded.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">SOE knows that the hardcore player is a pretty hefty chunk of their subscribers, why else would they continue to put out content? If hardcore was only 15% as some claim, why put so much into keeping that portion happy?<br />
<br />
Wrong, they do it because a Devteam without any creativity finds it easy to pump out new content with different graphics, upped damage on mobs, and upped stats on loots.  But when WoW comes out non-raiders will be leaving EQ in droves so then the hardcore raider in EQ will become a 'hefty chunk' of the playerbase - quite possibly the majority - and the preference given to raiders will at last become justifiable.<br />
<br />
Because its MORE than that, probalby more than EITHER of us actually knows. Blizzard knows that. They are a BUSINESS and want as many customers as possbile, hardcore, semihardcore, casual hardcore, and true casual alike. To try and exclude any of these people in a game of this kind is like cutting off a few limbs and still trying to play ball.<br />
<br />
Put in all the content you want for raiders: just don't give non-raiders who push themselves to the same extent as raiders inferior rewards.  Those raiders who have tantrums if raiding isn't the one true way, who get upset if players with other styles of play aren't gimped by comparison, should be ignored or preferably recommended for treatment to psychiatrists.</div></div><hr />

Because on my server the raid guilds are willing to carry my worthless ass through flagging events, it must be that way on all servers! Stop whining and ask your friendly local uberguild to let you along to leech flags, I'm sure they won't mind at all.

Not sure about A Ro but on Bertox we have an active pick-up raid channel that will attempt just about anything that is up and they can gather the raid force to attempt. Many &quot;uber&quot; guilds have actually actively helped this movement since it frees them up from backflagging. It's also a general policy for the upper tier guilds to not allow people along on flagging raids unless the person's guild has already killed that mob.<br />

So do we, but not if we're forced into one single playstyle in a *cough* roleplaying game. Yeah, yeah, it's essentially a hack and slash Doom clone now, I realize that.<br />
<br />
DIABLO STYLE GAMING BURNS OUT.<br />
Tell me, how well did Diablo and Diablo 2 do financially? I think they may have sold a few copies.  My friends and I played D1 for close to 2 years w/o burning out, that remains the most fun game we ever played- single group content we can do ourselves.  And as for burning out, taken a look at the number of ele+ people ebaying lately?  Burnout is at an alltime high and is not restricted to the problems plaguing shaman.<br />

Yeah, and how long does it take you to make that back in Sol Ro or PoFire?  A lot less than the amount I lose in a single LDoN hard where I get my clock cleaned repeatedly.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Adding a comment on this. You must be out of your mind if you think that Blizzard isnt going to have content for the hardcore players.<br />
There is a world of difference between &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;raider&quot;. If rewards are linear for time spent in game (e.g. AA's, LDoN adv points), the hardcore player will far surpass a casual in how rapidly they build their character, but at the end of the day the casual will eventually get there.  EQ, however, provides exponential rewards- one playstyle is rewarded massively versus all others and the time spent is irrelevant.  Raid gear is not slightly better, it is orders of magnitude better.<br />
<br />
My only concern with WoW is if they go the &quot;raid or don't bother&quot; route that EQ has.  But, if they do, my friends and I won't hang around 3 years hoping things improve.  Eventually someone will get it right- my guess is that it will be Blizzard as they have yet to let us down, but we shall see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is so much bull ****.  Raid gear is not 'orders of magnitude better'.  It isn't even an order of magnitude better.  We are talking percents here.  A top of the line monk will do about 50% more damage than a top of the line casual monk.  However, that casual monk will take within 10% of the damage when tanking compared to the raiding monk (AC is severely capped on most classes in this game after a certain point.).  We are talking 50% MAX with the casual monk at 100atk and the raiding monk at 250 atk and the weapons being 17/20 and 23/20 respectively.<br />
<br />
ON a caster it is LESS obvious.  They pretty much all have the same spells.  The focus effects are within 10% EFFECTIVE of each other.  Mana regen is the same except for right click effects.  And even those will be well under 10% total mana regen.<br />
<br />
If you really think raid gear is 'orders of magnitude better' you know jack and **** about the mechanics of this game.  Which is pretty common, so I am just taking this time to enlighten you a bit.<br />
<br />
The most common copout is lack of gear when someone fails something.  I see it all the time.  Do some hard content and many of hte lesser equipped in the group will start saying they need better gear and will often leave the group.  Then we will replace them with someone with worse gear and then clean up the area.<br />
<br />
There is no order of magnitude of difference between casually equipped and raid equipped.  However, the well equipped person has no reason to fail other than lack of skill and NOONE is willing to say they don't have the skill to do something.  The poorly equipped will blame their gear and quit.  THAT is the largest difference.</div></div><hr />

If you were only comparing 1 stat and 1 piece of armor at a time, you'd have a point, but you're not.  You get to wear all your armor at once and benefit from them en toto.  The difference between a raid player and a casual player is massive- 4k+ more hps on my sk means that I can survive being one rounded by some of the more difficult mobs.  That isn't slightly better- that is make or break the game better.<br />

If they can get them- just how common is IH4 and MP4 again for the non-raider?<br />
<br />
Mana regen is the same except for right click effects.  And even those will be well under 10% total mana regen.<br />
<br />
Assuming max FT, which most casuals will not have w/o seriously lacking in other stats.  Do your FT items have only 20hp/mana? Wait, they have more stats + resists + foci?  No way!  &quot;Slightly&quot; better?<br />
<br />

Or maybe you've 100% lost touch w/ the game outside the exclusive raid world you play in.  I'd love to see you do what you do now in bazaar gear w/ FT5 or less and most foci gone and lacking another 4k in hps.<br />
<br />
There is no order of magnitude of difference between casually equipped and raid equipped.<br />
Heya, can you show me where I can buy a Time's Antithesis in the bazaar? Because, seriously, there really isn't much of a difference between a mana-free, instant-refresh slow that casts the same as the spell and that frees up a gem slot is there?  That is only a minor difference, I can't see why I thought raid gear was so much better.  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>Saramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Define that fair deal! For the life of me I can't comprehend why LDoN is so &quot;awful&quot;. It's EXACTLY the kind of content that the so called casual gamers asked for. They wanted zones that they didn't have to &quot;compete&quot; for in order to do anything. They wanted to &quot;accomplish&quot; something in under 2 hours of playtime. Hello?! LDoN is the answer to that cry. Yes, an expansion came out after LDoN and it wasn't ALL for the casual gamer. It was for the raider...again. Who's to say that the next expansion won't increase the risk/reward of LDoN type zones or offer MORE of them and focus mainly on the casual gamer again? <br />
<br />
<br />
Yes LDoN was for the casual gamer BUT its also somewhere where raiders can go. How many casual gamers can go to the majority of PoP and GoD ?.<br />
In GoD SOE threw the casual gamer a bone with a couple of zone but denied a big part of the expansion to them.<br />
In LDoN SOE threw the raider a bone in the way of LDoN raids but did not deny them access to any part of the expansion.<br />
Before raiders scoff and say &quot;well why would we want to do normal LDoNs etc&quot; just look at the leaderboard most of the top 20 belong to raiding guilds and has been stated on here many times people would rather complete 3 normal LDoNs in the time it takes to do 1 Hard because of the points difference.<br />

While I agree with you, I'll point out there's really no point feeding the troll.  In every expansion I saw a huge jump in my own capabilities due to the gear improvements I got. And the gear improvements for me, a non-raider, were smaller than any raider would see.  <br />
<br />
So if Brodda isn't capable of noticing how much gear affects even his own play he's hardly worth replying to.  Personally I can't help as classify his post as another of those 'look at me I'm leet' posts: its too ridiculous to be anything else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play golf. When I play golf, I like to stand with my back to the hole and swing a croquet mallet at the ball, which is between my legs. Now, I am still hitting it in the general direction, but that is how I like to play. Obviously, I dont get very good scores, but I dont understand why. I practice a lot. I play as much as most other people, but I still seem to suck. <br />
<br />
EQ is a game. Games have methods for &quot;winning&quot; and &quot;not winning&quot;. In Diablo 2, did you attack Diablo with your maxxed out Cold Resist Aura on your Paladin? Of course not. You did what the GAME required you to do to achieve that goal. Granted, there are various paths to the goal. One path is to wait until your character is so high level that Diablo can barely hurt you. <br />
<br />
You say there is only one path into the &quot;High End&quot;. I say that you are correct, FOR THE MOMENT (and not even, actually, on many servers. Many servers have pick-up groups flagging people for EPs without joining an &quot;uber&quot; build). But I also say that eventually, YOU will be able to enter the EPs with a single group quest. I say that soon there will be a way for 1 group people to gain access to Sol Ro Tower. As I said before, you will probably never see Time unless you join a big guild. Oh well. <br />
<br />
There is going to be a difference between raid level loot and non-raid level loot. I cannot understand why you cannot just accept that. Granted the disparity is HUGE right now, but sheesh, after 5 years, if one guy walks and another guy runs full speed, he probably SHOULD be pretty darn far ahead. <br />
<br />
One other point you should be considering. Why did Diablo 2 burn out? Yeah, Diablo 1 was a fantastic game, I played it a long time too, mainly because there was nothing else even remotely like it. But even that example can be applied. Why arent you still playing Diablo 2? EQ came out before D2, yet you came back. Why? I will tell you why, its because you ACHIEVED your goals in D2 because its SIMPLE to do so. To make raid level loot drop in instanced LDoN style zones would shorten the lifespan of EQ by LIGHT YEARS. SOE wants the timesinks, so you pay longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think that if you're dissatisfied with EQ you should move on to something else so you don't have to whine about it.  Those of us still having fun will not be convinced to go elsewhere due to your whining.</div></div><hr />

That isn't slightly better- that is make or break the game better.<br />
Yes, on tanks I admit that it makes a much larger difference.  However, 4k is pretty rediculous.  I would say 2000-2500 hp difference.  There are extremes I guess.  My brother started raiding with his SK with my guild not too long ago.  He is within 2k of our other SKs and tanks very good.  He has gotten two raid drops so far.  I have to wonder what is make or break though.  Your casual player doesnt raid does he?  So other than Kodtaz named I don't think it is make or break for any other part of the game they would do.  Certainly not hard LDoN or Vxed/tipt.  (My brother was tank for vxed/tipt before he joined my guild.)<br />
<br />
Except Ancients, GoD spells and L65 PoP spells unless they have a dumptruck full of plat- pretty big assumption.Almost all ancients are outdated.  GoD spells are easily one groupable at any level, lvl 65 PoP spells are all under 20k for shaman spells on my server, except Q.<br />
<br />
If they can get them- just how common is IH4 and MP4 again for the non-raider?<br />
You can get spell haste and healing at tribute masters.  And tribute is quite easy to come by if you investigate the matter a bit.  I must admit MP4 has been really hard to come by for my shaman.  I spent all of 30min killing frogs in PoWater and didn't get frog oil.  =(<br />
<br />
Assuming max FT, which most casuals will not have w/o seriously lacking in other stats. Do your FT items have only 20hp/mana? Wait, they have more stats + resists + foci? No way! &quot;Slightly&quot; better?<br />
Again, check tribute masters.  Also there are some nice one groupable items with FT out of GoD.  Not to mention LDoN augs.<br />

Or maybe you've 100% lost touch w/ the game outside the exclusive raid world you play in. I'd love to see you do what you do now in bazaar gear w/ FT5 or less and most foci gone and lacking another 4k in hps.<br />
Well, I two box my shaman alot.  Who was my main before kunark.  He is not well geared at all, has no access to elementals.  Yet, he has far more than FT5 with no ornate.  (Check tribute masters.)  I have played a friends time geared shaman, and the differences aren't that remarkable.  I can and have substituted my shaman for a time shaman in Vxed.  He did great.<br />
<br />
I also do a lot of parsing and I did slowly take off gear while tanking an unslowed valorian guard.  I never had problem keeping him up all the way from 1900ac to 1100 ac over the period of 5 hours.  In fact, there was a less than 3% difference in damage taken from 1350ac to 1900ac.<br />
<br />
Heya, can you show me where I can buy a Time's Antithesis in the bazaar? Because, seriously, there really isn't much of a difference between a mana-free, instant-refresh slow that casts the same as the spell and that frees up a gem slot is there? That is only a minor difference, I can't see why I thought raid gear was so much better.  <br />
<br />
Well, there are the rare clickies.  However, it is mostly a convenience.  One of our shaman didn't get his antithesis while we were doing time and I can't see any difference between him and the other shaman when grouped.  If you are going to be the only healer it helps, but it doesn't make or break any thing.<br />
<br />
If the difference between raid gear and bazaar gear isn't orders of magnitude difference, why do you raid? And why are people so up in arms about casuals getting gear of near the same quality?<br />
<br />
Competition.  That is why I raid.  I want to beat something before anyone else does.  Challenge.  I want to work with many different people to complete goals.<br />
<br />
As for the rest?  It is because the casual gameplay is not hard.  It is not challenging.  One group encounters are TRIVIAL.  There is nothign dynamic about them.  You can't possibly design challenging one group encounters and keep them challenging for all the different make ups.  It is a design and QA nightmare.  I yawn doing Kodtaz single group trials.  I NEVER yawn when doing Uqua.  <br />
<br />
And really the items are there.  MOst casuals just won't get into GoD.  There are some really nice items to be had there, but they don't like dieing, they don't like CRing, they don't like TRYING.  They want it right now.  <br />
<br />
Right now Doze and all of HoH are up on my server.  An easy one group encounter with fabulous items.  They will probably stay up another two days before someone hits him up for twinks.  <br />
<br />
Let me give some hints.<br />
<br />
Use tribute.  <br />
Easy item to use are Tae Ew Chain Pants.  Easy as hell to make.  Tae Ew Blood is not rare and these legs are worth 10k tribute.<br />
<br />
Easy money.<br />
Velium pieces.  Take a chisel and farm Sky shrine.  You will be able to use the chisel to break up bricks and blocks into small pieces of velium which stack.  They sell very fast int he bazaar at 75pp.  Or use them to get smithing up very cheaply to 222 skill.  At which point you can make your own tae ew chain.  You actually don't fail the 295 trivial chain much at 222skill with a 5% mod.<br />
<br />
Easy items.<br />
Get an enchanter and druid/cleric (either or) head to barindu and do Vexd.  You will need at least a 7khp buffed tank and one melee with riposte.  Follow the right wall till you get to a dead end area witha  bunch of mountain pookas.  Camp outside and charm a pooka.  Just keep killing here.  A trickter will spawn. Break charm and retash/malo.  Charm again.  and HASTE.  (snare helps.)  have the melee with riposte pull and use riposte disc.  By the time the riposte disc wears off the named will be at 30% because of hasted pooka.  Fast heals to tank till dead.  You can do this all over in vexd though the roaming named lizard will probably kill you outright when it spawns.  Just regroup and try again.<br />
<br />
You can use the above method to get kodtaz flagged easily.  Where you can get 145hp + mask and ranged off of trash.<br />
<br />
Also there are a lot of 100+hp items that drop off of trash in GoD.  Or I should probably say there are a lot of varied 100+hp items that drop as they are somewhat rare.<br />
<br />
It is so easy to fall into the 'we aren't well enough equipped' set of mind when trying new things.  I know from experience when our guild came back from DAoC after a year and at the start of PoP we were wipign to Vindi and by GoD we had been in time for 7 months?  something insane.  I remember doing LMM and people kept saying that we just didn't have the equipment.  Within a week he and bert were dead.  <br />
<br />
I remember duoing Efreeti in solb with a shaman when I was 56 before velious.  I tried 5 different shaman.  Every one of them said we didn't have the gear/lvls to do it after wiping before getting past the lava.  Except one.  After 7 wipes where we got farther each time, we were able to camp it with ease.<br />
<br />
The items are out there.  Especially with GoD.  I recommend trying.<br />
<br />
What i think most casuals see is the progression that raiders enjoy.  We raid elementals where we get gear then move onto time where we can get gear where we can go to GoD and get gear.  I think that is what casuals lack.  There really isn't any progression for them except at he start of each expansion.  And I don't think there would be enough casuals to make use of a similar progression like raiders have, since casuals typically make very poor use of their time.  There are very few casuals which would make use of such a system.  Casuals aren't usually very goal oriented.  If they were they would be raiding.  My guild raids nomore than 20 hours a week. Very few people play the hours that are being quoted for raiders on this board.  At any other time besides raiding we have less than 10 people on typically.<br />
<br />
Try GoD though.  It is what casuals have been wanting.  It is by far the best expansion for casuals to get item drops since Kunark.</div></div><hr />

Yes LDoN was for the casual gamer BUT its also somewhere where raiders can go. How many casual gamers can go to the majority of PoP and GoD ?.<br />
<br />
All of them can go there. Every single one. They just choose not to and claim that their playstyle prohibits it. Baloney. I was in a PICK UP RAID tonight to do AD. It didn't even take two hours of my time. This was a pick up raid, people! Those things are notorious for taking forever to &quot;organize&quot;. I arrived at the door to AD in PoV, noticed that it was 10:10ish pm. I was concerned about starting a raid this late in the evening...just how long would I be &quot;stuck&quot; trying to kill this dragon? The dragon was dead, Planar Projection hailed, and loot drops awarded all under 2 hours time. The casual player who doesn't spend 8 - 18 hours playing per day COULD have done this flag. Does every raid go off this easily? Of course not. However to state that it CANNOT be done, that it is IMPOSSIBLE unless with a massive guild, is absolute horse manure. It CAN be done. It WAS done. I witnessed it. I had my doubts while I waited for the raid to form. I was pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
In GoD SOE threw the casual gamer a bone with a couple of zone but denied a big part of the expansion to them.<br />
In LDoN SOE threw the raider a bone in the way of LDoN raids but did not deny them access to any part of the expansion.<br />
<br />
No one, I repeat, NO ONE has been denied access to any part of this game. The only thing holding anyone back is their own stubbornness. If the casual gamer attempted to do flags and only did one &quot;event&quot; (read: boss) per evening, it would take some TIME to complete all of the flags. Failures included, there is no question it would be lengthy. However, it's the SAME thing everyone else went through to get the flags. It is just extended over many days for the casual gamer whereas it the hardcore raider most likely attempted more than one flag per session. So what? It's still not been DENIED the smaller guilds nor the unguilded. You just have to suck it up and do it if you want access. It's not denied to you BY SOE. It's denied to you by your unwillingness to do what it takes to enter.</div></div><hr />

There's been a huge number of threads over the years on equipment and its importance.  Explain to me Brodda how it is all these top rank shaman have been advising the shaman community and have been so very wrong.  Are they liars or merely morons?<br />

Here I think we have the crux of the matter.  I think raiding and non-raiding are equally valid styles of play, you imply that raiding is somehow superior and therefore the top rewards should be reserved for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u131"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p131">GoD was close. I never thought 70 people was a valid playsstyle to prove who was better. Far too many poor, lazy players hide behind all thier guildmates. Many afk the entire run until the last mob where they wake up and either auto assist or jump into a CH chain, or basically do whatever they are told, no initiative, skill or thought. Blasphemy I know, but I do think rewards should be worthwhile to a 6 man group doing hard content. There is no room for lazy bots, cronic afk'ers and generally crappy players. GoD came close, but that little game was designed only for certain classes, the rest just boot lickers who should feel lucky to bask in the light of warriors and clerics.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand why people say its hard to design content for 6 man groups and be challenging. Its much harder to design content for a 40-80 person zerg, all it end up being is designed around something simple like how many healers they can field to either heal, cure or remove curse.<br />
<br />
Anyways, its time to break away from the huge guild crap. Reserve a few end game encounters for the sheep. Let the rest be conquered by the skilled, not the numbers. We don't need to feed to ego's of the huge guild's leaders anymore, and thats what EQ has became.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
The most moronic individual can prosper in PoP.  He can get his gear by standing behind 50 or so of his guild mates.  He can grind out those aa's in Dreadlands style zones where the only challenge is staying awake.  Entry into PoTime is determined by guild affiliation, not by skill.<br />
<br />
Perhaps thats what the raiders really object to: imagine if they had to get the top gear by taking on mobs at the cutting edge in a six man group where EVERY member of the group has to pull his weight and play a wide range of roles well.  <br />
<br />
Lol, perhaps then the people wearing the best gear might have the minimal degree of intellect needed to notice its value to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here is where you seem to blame ME for your plight. I DIDNT DESIGN THIS GAME.<br />
<br />
I do not think one or the other is superior or inferior. In fact, I enjoy both styles of play. But the bottom line remains, that in this game, to get the very best loot, you must kill the very biggest mobs, and that takes RAIDS. That is how the game is designed. <br />
<br />
Personally, I happen to agree that this SHOULD be the case. I also agree the gap should be smaller, and that the non-raiding player SHOULD have access to better items, but currently that isnt how the game works. <br />
<br />
There is a post above about the areas where some REALLY nice items are available in Gates without needing to be EP Gears to camp them. Not all of Gates is horrid you know. Lots of the expansion is doable with 1 solid group of bazaar level guys. You do the stuf you can, improve the gear you can, and move up as you can. It called PROGRESSION. One big problem with the game now is that a person can get PLed to 55, buy a full set of Ornate and be &quot;as good as it gets withtout raiding&quot; instantly. <br />
<br />
Crusty and Iz, as I have repeated before, you both have very valid points. However, given the current situation of this game (and indeed, every game like it) I cannot see a viable solution. Verant has had the top items in the game on Raid mobs since day 1 (Naggy and Vox). It used to require a Raid to kill Sir Lucan for Soulfire. Fear and Hate were certainly never 1 group zones until the recent changes in Hate. Thats the game. I am sorry it doesnt suit you. But thats the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you do this, yet keep the hardcore from just dominating these encounters and farming the crap out of them? Wait, I know, you put inferior loot on them. That what you want?<br />
<br />
I disagree that EQ just feeds huge guild leaders egos, also. Look at your server. How many guilds are EP flagged? Are they ALL some kind of ego-maniacally led group of hardcore &quot;got a bucket so I dont have to get up&quot; type of players? I hardly think so. They took longer because they are less hardcore, yet they achieved something anyway. <br />
<br />
My guild killed the Emp in Ssra for the first time well over 8 months after PoP came out. Took us a long time to get keyed up for Emp and VT, because our membership just isnt packed with 10-hour a day people. Eventually, even the more &quot;casual&quot; members of my guild got their keys though, and managed to grab a couple VT items before we moved on to the EPs full time (yes, we farmed VT right through being flagged up for the EPs).<br />
<br />
Everquest has raid encounters. Period. Always has. Right out of the box. Yet a lot of you &quot;casual&quot; people have STILL played it longer than any other game in the history of your PC. Why is that?</div></div><hr />

First off, I didnt complain or make that decision, secondly, I do not believe it to be completely true. Where did you get this information? Please show me where and when it was EP level gear, and the PLAYERS got it changed. I would be interested to see. Getting a little tired of people coming her and spewing misinformation as &quot;fact&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Yes, on tanks I admit that it makes a much larger difference.  However, 4k is pretty rediculous.  I would say 2000-2500 hp difference.<br />
Brodda, you're out of touch methinks.  Take a look at my sk's magelo- for a bazaar player he has very good gear.  When she dings ND3 she will break 7k hps.  My friends in Time+ guilds are over 11k already.  11 - 7 = 4, no?  And the AC difference for your shaman may not matter, but Steel Warriors have done extensive parsing and show AC to matter all the way up into the low 2000's (at least)- another 500 AC would make a massive difference to my mitigation.  Don't be obtuse and downplay this- the margin of error w/ a tank w/ 11k hps and 2k+ AC is way, way higher than it is for someone like me that raid buffs to 6.8k and just shy of 1600 AC.  I'm lucky to last 10 secs in a hard LDoN w/o a heal, so yes, it affects me even where I am now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Competition.  That is why I raid.  I want to beat something before anyone else does.  Challenge.  I want to work with many different people to complete goals.<br />
<br />
We're not out for competition (we couldn't care less how we stack up as long as everyone is on an even playing field for opportunties) and we LOVE challenges.  Taking out stuff w/ one group is awesome for us- no matter what drops, one of us is getting an upgrade (NBG &gt; all for friends).<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the rest?  It is because the casual gameplay is not hard.  It is not challenging.  One group encounters are TRIVIAL.<br />
<br />
In your gear perhaps, but not for us.  We're getting creamed in LDoN hards and on named in Tactics- we have lots of upgrades to get through repetitive LDoNs and E*vertrade before we'll succeed consistently on these encounters.  We have our own modest goals and our own progression to achieve before WoW is released and we move on.  There really isn't that much more for us to do of interest other than:<br />
- win LDoN hards reliably and get all the drops we need off named<br />
- beat Tactics named<br />
- BoT wing bosses<br />
- BoT tower bosses (highly unlikely w/ 1 group w/o serious charming)<br />
<br />
Fortunately we'll prolly get most of these right before WoW is released.<br />
<br />
<br />
Try GoD though.  It is what casuals have been wanting.  It is by far the best expansion for casuals to get item drops since Kunark.<br />
I appreciate your trying to point us to GoD, but I def. do not feel it is a casual friendly expansion.  4 hour trials are not fun.  Mobs that hit for 1200+ are not fun if you're struggling on 990 hitters in LDoN hards.  Meaningless AA's that cost a ton and spells that are not noticeably better than existing spell lines. Zone layouts worse than LoY are not fun.  No graveyards is horrible for us- when we wipe late at night we just log, ez pz.<br />
<br />
And also about GoD, PoP left such a bad taste in our mouths vis a vis flagged content we pretty much vowed to never buy another EQ expansion, especially not one w/ MORE flagged content.  Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me.</div></div><hr />

Misinformation may have been a poor choice of words, but you are spewing. You are making HUGELY controversial statements without backing them up with facts. Sorry. I dont buy it. I do not think the PLAYERS changed the level of gear available from LDoN. In fact, I do not think the level of the gear changed at all since it went live, so you must be talking about Beta modifications. Only thing I remember changing was the way augs worked. <br />
<br />
Statement like &quot;It was EP level but UBERS got it changed&quot; are so inflammatory that you NEED to back them up. Otherwise, it sounds like your making this stuff up to justify your own anger and fustration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You say this on the one hand, but on the other hand, it sounds like POP added some things to YOUR style of play that GREATLY increased your enjoyment. <br />
<br />
Or perhaps you forgot what the game was like before insta-travel and graveyards. Maybe you don't like the 5 extra levels, or cool AA and spells that PoP brought. Perhaps the whole concept of &quot;Ornate, make your OWN class armor&quot; doesn't appeal to you.<br />
<br />
Honestly Iz, you are starting to sound like an impatient child. You do not seem to wish to take the time to increase the power of your character to be more efective in more advanced zones. A couple months of upgrading using LDoN and the other suggested methods to improve are going to kill you? You want to be effective in Gates THIS INSTANT and damn the LONG path that the people who ARE effective there took.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope you are still around when they create a 1-group quest for Sol Ro access. I hope you are still playing when they open the EPs to the general population. But of course, when those things happen, I am sure you will have some other issue that you want instant gratificaion on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What don't you believe? That SoE wouldn't change it?  Or that raiders would demand it to be changed?  We know that SoE does change things when Furor says so (the monks will tell you that), and we know that raiders insist that non-raiders shouldn't get raid-level loot: lets just do a quick look down this thread:<br />
<br />
As for gear, you want EP Raid level loot obtainable without having to Raid? This is completely unreasonable<br />

<br />
And I am telling you the &quot;EP Quality&quot; it used to have was the extra +40 hp aug you could stick in, which actually brought it NOT close to EP quality in ANYTHING except +hps. Not close in resists, Ac, +mana, and no focus. THATS what I remember. THATS the &quot;nerf&quot;.<br />
<br />
Spin it any way you want man.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">Yeah there was a big houha at the time when it was discovered that an extra 40 hp aug could be put on which could have been possibly perceived as demeaning the point of raiding. However, I think it was an error on SoE's behalf and I don't really think it was intended 2 40 hp augs being put on one slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">Well, I know of one monk that has a 170hp monk BP out of LDoN which is very nice.  I believe at one time you could get 210hp out of LDoN.  Which does seem fairly insane.  Thus they put slot type 7s in all old armor and left a slot type 1 on the ldon armor.  Then they changed the 40hp slot type 1 augs to slot type 7.<br />
<br />
The problem with making progressve one group content is that players tend to gravitate to the most efficient form.  You would end up with your super group then everyone else.  There are just too many classes to make that desirable.  <br />
<br />
I have heard of people wanting for these trials to be tailored to your group make up.  This is a development and QA nightmare.  I have worked as both and would not want to touch a system like that with how EQs system is now.  <br />
<br />
The nice thing about raids is that you can expect a certain make up, since there are so many people.  You can say this encounter will need 3 enchanters and it is ok to expect that in a raid of 40+ people.  Can you design one group encounter with having a CC class in mind?  What about a tank?  Or a cleric?  DO we need to assume there is a slowing class?  Or assume there isn't?  <br />
<br />
And Iz, I gave an example of my brothers sk who is casually geared.  I just talked to a monk who has no elemental gear at all and is over 8k buffed.  Also, from reading your post it seems you assume I have a well equipped shaman, when I made it absolutely clear that my shaman isn't well equipped and my monk is now my main.  So I have to assume you never read the post at all.</div></div><hr />

I've been doing this for over a year already.  We're taking a break from LDoN while we PL a more useful class than my poor shaman (cleric of course), but honestly everyone wanted a break from LDoN.  There's only so many you can do before you start asking uncomfortable questions like &quot;what's the point of all this boredom again?&quot;.<br />

Sadly, I doubt that I will live forever because that is the only way this will happen.  How many times has SOE revisited an older expansion to improve the content?  If it's not never, it's close to it, unless the players benefited somehow unfairly.  As soon as expansion_0x is released, the devs pretty much just fix glaring bugs then ignore it while they work on expansion_0x+1.  That's why there is not and never will be a Tactics style 1-group test for the rest of the PoP content we paid for but will never get to see w/o raiding.</div></div><hr />

This isn't what's happening in Gates w/ the return of the Unholy Trinity? This isn't what happens w/ raid guilds?  Tell me, how many monks, shamans and sk's are your guild recruiting?  How about the rest of the guilds on your server?  If it's like mine, the sum total = none.<br />
<br />
<br />
And Iz, I gave an example of my brothers sk who is casually geared.  I just talked to a monk who has no elemental gear at all and is over 8k buffed.<br />
Please link a magelo as I have to back up these statements.  That player either has VT gear (which smokes LDoN gear) or has every single 1492 piece of armor w/ every single possible 1000+ augment in each slot.  Monks in my guild have around 1k less hp than does my sk.  Monks don't get PE/PD aa's FYI, that's quite a few hp right there.  An 8k monk is not casual in the least.  Again, show me the magelo.<br />
<br />
For me to go from 7k -&gt; 8k would require adding 50 hps PER SLOT (20 slots as I do not use shield).  You're honestly going to tell me that's possible w/o raiding?  Brodda, I respect your courtesy in replying to my posts but you're either extremely out of touch or disingenous to the point of dishonesty.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Sadly, I doubt that I will live forever because that is the only way this will happen.  How many times has SOE revisited an older expansion to improve the content?  If it's not never, it's close to it, unless the players benefited somehow unfairly.  As soon as expansion_0x is released, the devs pretty much just fix glaring bugs then ignore it while they work on expansion_0x+1.  That's why there is not and never will be a Tactics style 1-group test for the rest of the PoP content we paid for but will never get to see w/o raiding.<br />
<br />
Um, Fabled mobs arent re-visiting old content? The upgrades to Cazic Thule, then Droga and Nurga wasnt upgrading old content? The addition of Veskar, Sol C, and Chardok B wasnt upgrading old content? <br />
<br />
I also will COMPLETELY disagree that they will never open up Sol Ro and eventually the EPs themselves with tactics-like quests. I bet they do Sol Ro before August, and the EPs before the 1st of 2005. The reason I think they will do these things is that DESPITE what YOU think, I think SOE DOES care about the casual gamer. Sol C certainly wasnt put in for the Ubers. Nor was Chardok B. There are small guild encounters in Char B. There is reasonably acceptable loot in Veskar, Sol C and Char B (oh wait, its not the VERY best so it &quot;sucks&quot;, my bad). PoV, PoS, HoH and BoT werent opened up because of the &quot;Highest end players&quot; man, they were opened for YOU. <br />
<br />
I understand where you are coming from Iz, I really do. But you need to remember that EQ has been a LOT like this from day 1. I think there should be a HELLUVA lot more zones like HoH, where the loot and minis are in one area, and the God Boss is in the &quot;B&quot; portion of the zone. Agnarr should be a &quot;B&quot;. So should RZ, and Fennin and Corinev and Xegoney. But thats not the deal right now. Eventually, I think you will gain access to these zones. You disagree. I guess we will just wait and see.</div></div><hr />

I didn't bother w/ Fabled after hearing the angst in guildchat from all my guildies getting trained by raid guilds gearing up their twinks du jour.  I'll take your word on that though I haven't seen/heard much else about them.  The rest of the zones you mention do not offer significant (if any) gear upgrades for where we're at (L2 LDoN/PoP ornate).  We may go back to cd-b to farm those FT2 necks, but the stats on them are so atrocious it's really not worth it, esp. w/ the RvR for cd-b when you need serious CoTH just to get to the zone to summon/rez.  I did like cd-b though when we went there before they changed the rare spawn rate to ~0, I'm still wearing the bracer I got there on my sk.<br />

You, however, are the only one saying this is going to happen- need I point you to the &quot;Should the elemental planes be opened to the masses&quot; thread a few months back?

As for gear, you want EP Raid level loot obtainable without having to Raid? This is completely unreasonable. There has to be SOME reward for the people who CHOOSE to raid. <br />

<br />
On my server, the ep's are opening up alot now. I got flagged for PoE, PoA and PoW, back in December. I havent been raiding much lately because i have been working on my berserker. I know several of the guilds that just finished up VT are either joining these raids or just getting pissed and crying about pickup raids taking all the flags fromt he first 3 tiers except for RZTW and Sol Ro. Granted pickup raids do the minis every chance we get. Also I know on E'ci their pickup raid channel is Time Flagged. The point is most of the events in the first 3 tiers are under 2 hours with the exception of Saryrn who takes forever just cause of the script. There is no reason a casual gamer can't join these raids and at least get to the ep's. I had some pretty crap gear til I hit Sol Ro tower. Now it isnt a problem cause of all the ornate and mini drops.<br />
<br />
Another thing I noticed is that casuals don't like Hard LDON's hate to say it but there is a ton of great gear off named only in Hard. any group with decent dps, an 8.5k tank and a good cleric can do it.</div></div><hr />

Sigh, Iz, seriously, long heavy SIGH.<br />

You refuse to go to small-raid content, content YOU ASKED FOR, because of what? Come on man. Give me a break. You are just finding more and more excuses to blame your situation on the &quot;Raiders&quot;, aren't you.<br />
<br />
As for gear, Veskar's Soulscream Belt isnt good? The items you mentioned in Char B aren't good? Sol C's itemization may have been slacking a bit, but there is some other solid gear in Veskar and Char B man. And of course, there is LDoN-Hard's named, which drop 90 hp boots that are Shaman usable, as one example. Thats near VT quality by itself. <br />
<br />

<br />
This doesnt count Sarania. These people think EVERY zone and EVERY piece of gear they PAID for should be accessible to them by WHATEVER style of play they choose. Heck, I saw some guy post he wanted XP and gear for doing TRADESKILL COMBINES! Yeah there we go, lets all go to the Gem store in POK, but 100 bars of gold and 100 saphires, and hit that Combine Button til we get a Pepperoni Bracer of Uberness and 2 AA!! Gimee a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">The problem was Pop was majority raid infrastructure, and Ldon is very much papercut out dungeons. I think thats the general complaint of people now. I have no idea what GoD is like as I quit just before it came out. <br />
<br />
The underlying complaint is not that there is all these locked up zones, its because it was such a majority. In terms of actual novel content for the nonraider(I prefer to use nonraider term not casual/hardcore) it was somewhat limited. But it just has to be accepted, this is how EQ has evolved, and I think it has become majorly raid focused. Anyway, this argument is getting old.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Brodda Thep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Please link a magelo as I have to back up these statements. That player either has VT gear (which smokes LDoN gear) or has every single 1492 piece of armor w/ every single possible 1000+ augment in each slot. Monks in my guild have around 1k less hp than does my sk. Monks don't get PE/PD aa's FYI, that's quite a few hp right there. An 8k monk is not casual in the least. Again, show me the magelo.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=124663<br />
<br />
I couldn't find the one of the monk I was talking about.  I was talking to swifter last night on Lanys and he told me he had 5500hp without any elemental raid drops.  He is elemental flagged so can do some tradeskilling, though his guild doesn't raid elementals as far as I know.<br />
<br />
However, that monk above does have some upgrades available to him.  There are a number of GoD items that would be better.  And with a group of similarly geared people, he could EASILY get kod flagged.  Once in Kod there are at least 5 100+hp items you can get.  Two of which come off of trash.  And you can also immediately zone into Yxtta and get another two 145+hp items off of trash.  Then going back to Kod you can do two events with three groups with some creative CC for a bunch more items that are 175+hp, one of which is a triggered event.  Once you do that and get some of the nice atk/regen/ft/hp augs out of kod you can even do kod trials.  Or at least be able to get glyphed prayer rings for everyone and anyone that wants.<br />
<br />
Of course this doesn't even mention some very very nice items out of Vxed and tipt and ferubi and qinimi, and barindu, and riwwi.  All of which can be one grouped.<br />
<br />
Not Like SoE would ever design a single group event around 1 or 2 classes, no Sir.<br />
And if they would create such an event by mistake they would never make it part of a required progression, no Sir.<br />
Well the ikkinz trials would be what a hard one group encounter would be.  Coudl you imagine all the people left out?  It is bad enough for people in hard core guilds, which will go back 20+ times to make sure everyone is flagged.  Wouldn't happen for casuals.  So many classes would be left out to dry.  With raids you can assume a shaman has malos.  YOu can assume someone has GRC, you can assume someone has DI, you can assume someone has tash, you can assume there is a bard, you can assume that every unique ability for each class is present and design your encounters around all of those.<br />
<br />
Lets also remember that while it may take me 50 hours of raiding to get a 200hp item it actually took me 50 hours to get a 30hp upgrade.  How many hours would it take you to get a 30hp upgrade?  Of course 50 hours is sort of slow atm.  When we did time it was closer to 15 hours.  But we only raided 6 hours each week for six months.<br />

<br />
I'm wearing the soulscream belt, I don't need two.  Ditto on most of the good gear out of cd-b.  Not to mention w/ our limited playtimes it's been quicker in some cases to play &quot;E*verTrade: the MMORPG&quot; in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
And of course, there is LDoN-Hard's named, which drop 90 hp boots that are Shaman usable, as one example. Thats near VT quality by itself. <br />
<br />
No argument there, LDoN hards are the #1 reason my shaman is now a buffbot and we're PLing a cleric.   I love doing LDoN hards, despite the fact that we usually lose.  90 hp is nice, but it's still a far cry from an average piece of VT gear which is more well rounded in terms of stats, resists, foci, FT, etc.  But for us it's better than any of the other zones you listed at least.<br />
<br />
<br />
These people think EVERY zone and EVERY piece of gear they PAID for should be accessible to them by WHATEVER style of play they choose. <br />
I never said that, but I do think that whatever gap there is should be far smaller.  My highest piece of hp gear (100 hp) on my sk is a Stonewood bow I just dropped 80k for.  I don't even have the opportunity to fight the mobs that drop the parts to even make it.  So if I want the best (and I believe for an sk it is the best droppable range item), I get to play E*verTrade or EverRaid, but not EverQuest.  At no point do I get to earn it myself w/ my friends.<br />
<br />
Very lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Xarrais is hardly an example of a typical casual player- the time he's put into his char could just as easily have been spent raiding w/ that kind of time on his hands.  I've read his posts over on monkly business for years.  He has every single AA in game and (last I looked) 550ish LDoN wins.  Yes, 550.  At 1 hour/win, oh, a casual could get that many points in a mere 23 days /played.  W/ a 2 hour playing time per night w/ no nights off, no fails, no LFG, nothing interfering w/ your playing time (login server, patches, etc...) you could do that in 275 straight days of LDoN.  And boy would you ever have a blast doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets also remember that while it may take me 50 hours of raiding to get a 200hp item it actually took me 50 hours to get a 30hp upgrade.  How many hours would it take you to get a 30hp upgrade? <br />
<br />
Not much less, maybe even a bit more because I'd have to get at least L2 LDoN armor (760 points) which may or may not be better than what I'm wearing now, then get +hp augs (1k+) points.  That right there is 34 hours at 1 hour/win for 51 pts.  If you go to the 1492 L1 armor it's 48 hours/upgrade.  And the difference is, even after it's fully aug'd it will not be as good as VT gear from 2 years ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
When we did time it was closer to 15 hours.  But we only raided 6 hours each week for six months.<br />
<br />
If guilds like this existed on A Ro we'd all be raiders, but they don't.  We have ele+ (or otm elementals) and family guilds w/ pretty much nothing in between.  Someone from A Ro is welcome to enlighten me.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Iz.  MY MAIN IS A MONK.  WE DO GET PE.  BUT THANKS FOR THE FYI.<br />
My main used to be a monk also.  I'm referring to the Physical Enhancement AA that adds 2% to CS/CA/ND aa's- I can't find anywhere that lists monks as getting this, including monkly business.  I could be wrong, I haven't played my monk since the nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Honestly, I don't think it matters at this point. You only need to look at the difference between LDoN Normal and Hard to see how big the gap has gotten between the raiders and the rest of the crowd. I know a PoTime enchanter that has as many hitpoints (7700 buffed) as the tank I normally group with. Now we're at a point where SOE has to design different single group content for the normal 65s and the raiders. <br />
<br />
... and SOEs anwer to that is to spend a few hundred hours in LDoN normals to upgrade your gear so you can move on to GoD. Assuming you'll be willing and able to play 4 to 6 hours at a stretch to do anything with GoD. PoP broke EQ when it comes to the balance between the casuals and the raiders and GoD made it worse. Opening up Sol Ro or even EP isn't gonna change that. They split the player base too much and now it's too late to fix it.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I am referring to that same AA and monks do get it.<br />
<br />
As for Xarrais, yes he is a casual player who plays a ton.  Most of the casual palyers I know have 75 days played in the past three years.  Some have FAR more.  I also said that the monk I talked to on lanys was better equipped without anything from elemental raids and beyond.<br />
<br />
And you don't just have to do LDoN to get your upgrades.  You could go fight named in Vxed for upgrades.  Or kill Dozekar when he is up.  Or fight in barindu and get a nice item from random drops.  <br />
<br />
Alot of people think hardcore is the opposite of casual.  Ithink powergamer is the opposite of casual.  I also think you will find more powergamers in high end guilds than anywhere else.  Powergamers are very focused on getting stuff done fast.  The destination is what is important to them, not the journey.  So given equal amount of time /played a powergamer will be far better equipped than a casual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u160"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p160">Yes, on tanks I admit that it makes a much larger difference.  However, 4k is pretty rediculous.  I would say 2000-2500 hp difference.  There are extremes I guess.  My brother started raiding with his SK with my guild not too long ago.  He is within 2k of our other SKs and tanks very good.  He has gotten two raid drops so far.  I have to wonder what is make or break though.  Your casual player doesnt raid does he?  So other than Kodtaz named I don't think it is make or break for any other part of the game they would do.  Certainly not hard LDoN or Vxed/tipt.  (My brother was tank for vxed/tipt before he joined my guild.)<br />
<br />
Almost all ancients are outdated.  GoD spells are easily one groupable at any level, lvl 65 PoP spells are all under 20k for shaman spells on my server, except Q.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can get spell haste and healing at tribute masters.  And tribute is quite easy to come by if you investigate the matter a bit.  I must admit MP4 has been really hard to come by for my shaman.  I spent all of 30min killing frogs in PoWater and didn't get frog oil.  =(<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, check tribute masters.  Also there are some nice one groupable items with FT out of GoD.  Not to mention LDoN augs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I two box my shaman alot.  Who was my main before kunark.  He is not well geared at all, has no access to elementals.  Yet, he has far more than FT5 with no ornate.  (Check tribute masters.)  I have played a friends time geared shaman, and the differences aren't that remarkable.  I can and have substituted my shaman for a time shaman in Vxed.  He did great.<br />
<br />
I also do a lot of parsing and I did slowly take off gear while tanking an unslowed valorian guard.  I never had problem keeping him up all the way from 1900ac to 1100 ac over the period of 5 hours.  In fact, there was a less than 3% difference in damage taken from 1350ac to 1900ac.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there are the rare clickies.  However, it is mostly a convenience.  One of our shaman didn't get his antithesis while we were doing time and I can't see any difference between him and the other shaman when grouped.  If you are going to be the only healer it helps, but it doesn't make or break any thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
Competition.  That is why I raid.  I want to beat something before anyone else does.  Challenge.  I want to work with many different people to complete goals.<br />
<br />
As for the rest?  It is because the casual gameplay is not hard.  It is not challenging.  One group encounters are TRIVIAL.  There is nothign dynamic about them.  You can't possibly design challenging one group encounters and keep them challenging for all the different make ups.  It is a design and QA nightmare.  I yawn doing Kodtaz single group trials.  I NEVER yawn when doing Uqua.  <br />
<br />
And really the items are there.  MOst casuals just won't get into GoD.  There are some really nice items to be had there, but they don't like dieing, they don't like CRing, they don't like TRYING.  They want it right now.  <br />
<br />
Right now Doze and all of HoH are up on my server.  An easy one group encounter with fabulous items.  They will probably stay up another two days before someone hits him up for twinks.  <br />
<br />
Let me give some hints.<br />
<br />
Use tribute.  <br />
Easy item to use are Tae Ew Chain Pants.  Easy as hell to make.  Tae Ew Blood is not rare and these legs are worth 10k tribute.<br />
<br />
Easy money.<br />
Velium pieces.  Take a chisel and farm Sky shrine.  You will be able to use the chisel to break up bricks and blocks into small pieces of velium which stack.  They sell very fast int he bazaar at 75pp.  Or use them to get smithing up very cheaply to 222 skill.  At which point you can make your own tae ew chain.  You actually don't fail the 295 trivial chain much at 222skill with a 5% mod.<br />
<br />
Easy items.<br />
Get an enchanter and druid/cleric (either or) head to barindu and do Vexd.  You will need at least a 7khp buffed tank and one melee with riposte.  Follow the right wall till you get to a dead end area witha  bunch of mountain pookas.  Camp outside and charm a pooka.  Just keep killing here.  A trickter will spawn. Break charm and retash/malo.  Charm again.  and HASTE.  (snare helps.)  have the melee with riposte pull and use riposte disc.  By the time the riposte disc wears off the named will be at 30% because of hasted pooka.  Fast heals to tank till dead.  You can do this all over in vexd though the roaming named lizard will probably kill you outright when it spawns.  Just regroup and try again.<br />
<br />
You can use the above method to get kodtaz flagged easily.  Where you can get 145hp + mask and ranged off of trash.<br />
<br />
Also there are a lot of 100+hp items that drop off of trash in GoD.  Or I should probably say there are a lot of varied 100+hp items that drop as they are somewhat rare.<br />
<br />
It is so easy to fall into the 'we aren't well enough equipped' set of mind when trying new things.  I know from experience when our guild came back from DAoC after a year and at the start of PoP we were wipign to Vindi and by GoD we had been in time for 7 months?  something insane.  I remember doing LMM and people kept saying that we just didn't have the equipment.  Within a week he and bert were dead.  <br />
<br />
I remember duoing Efreeti in solb with a shaman when I was 56 before velious.  I tried 5 different shaman.  Every one of them said we didn't have the gear/lvls to do it after wiping before getting past the lava.  Except one.  After 7 wipes where we got farther each time, we were able to camp it with ease.<br />
<br />
The items are out there.  Especially with GoD.  I recommend trying.<br />
<br />
What i think most casuals see is the progression that raiders enjoy.  We raid elementals where we get gear then move onto time where we can get gear where we can go to GoD and get gear.  I think that is what casuals lack.  There really isn't any progression for them except at he start of each expansion.  And I don't think there would be enough casuals to make use of a similar progression like raiders have, since casuals typically make very poor use of their time.  There are very few casuals which would make use of such a system.  Casuals aren't usually very goal oriented.  If they were they would be raiding.  My guild raids nomore than 20 hours a week. Very few people play the hours that are being quoted for raiders on this board.  At any other time besides raiding we have less than 10 people on typically.<br />
<br />
Try GoD though.  It is what casuals have been wanting.  It is by far the best expansion for casuals to get item drops since Kunark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ill tell you what us casuals lack. As a person who can be hardcore at times and others extremely casual. The endless amount of time hardcore gamers have to play. Thats it, not will not drive not ambition. Sure we can be lazy in the game. Maybe its cause were so damn busy in our real lives.<br />
<br />

<br />
Before Kunark shipped, I had 4 Dragon items on my Paladin, and  Firey Avenger. 95% of the rest of the server had none.<br />
<br />
The game has been split since Day 1. Look at Luclin. VT didnt split the population? Come on. PoP just made it glaring because it became TRIVIAL to LEVEL. Before, the casual player was a couple levels behind. Now, anyone can hit 65 in no time at all. <br />
<br />
I will use my &quot;2 guys running&quot; analogy again. After 1 year, the faster guy is a little ahead, but after 5 years, how far SHOULD the hardcore player be ahead? I mean, think about it. You want to be able to score 100+ hp/man gear OUT OF THE BOX, that is the attitude I see, and thats what pisses me off. No one wants to work for anything. Iz wont go to Veskar, too far to run.

<br />
Sick of this arguement. Just because a piece of gear or a zone exists doesnt automatically give everyone that buys it the RIGHT to it. Do the work. Earn your way. Like the rest of us. Stop asking for handouts. How much easier do you REALLY want it to be?</div></div><hr />

How about you enjoy what EQ offers you.<br />
<br />
So shut the hell up, go back to Time. And God. Be worthless except as another faceless number. <br />
<br />
You have won at EQ and possibly at life.. Good for you.<br />
<br />
Next time you are kicking dirt in the little guys faces, I certainly hope you take a moment to reflect back tot he time when you were just starting the game and the world held that first glimps of so damn much fun ahead. <br />
<br />
The casuals just want to have that fun. Not the endless raids and the herding of cats to the end game. <br />
<br />
In a game of exploration. Of adventure, the worst thing you can do is crush that sense of adventure and EQ does that so amny ways now. And the most vexing is the requrement of raids to even enter the end game. <br />
<br />
The loot. yeah it would be nice. Having the extra hit points and such would increase my suvivorabilty tremendously when I get that wild hair and pull 4 in Tactics pit. <br />
<br />
But you know what. It certainly seems the margin of error for the end game is just not geared towards my playstyle. They have ramped it to the thinnest of margins to the place when only the Min Maxer survives.<br />
<br />
And I do not play that game. <br />
<br />
The one thing raiders don't seem to realise is there game is much more sustainable with cheap increases in DPS requirements and rediculous ramps up of power and thinning of margins of error. Where the game that I have tried to describe should be built around both playstyles. If the raids are what you shine at then wonderful. Go for it. But give the smaller folks and time impared players something to log in for as well. And LDON with the cookie cutter layouts and mentality and the step right up and win a prize little girl hawking is admitadly rather lame.<br />
<br />
The whole damn point is rather silly anyways because Shaman are so damn archaic now in the world of DPS and ANTI DPS that everquest has become that it just makes me feel sad.<br />
<br />
We are the swiss army knife that your grandfather has. But the Screwdriver has been filed away and the scissors have had little child protection things put on them so the little darlings won't mutilate themselves with em. <br />
<br />
So all we have left is a old tool with little utility and lots ofsentiment attached. And I am tired of it.<br />
<br />
Have fun with the uber game. Maybe Ill watch as you pass me in another game and remember our little conversations with amusment.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u163"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p163">Before Kunark shipped, I had 4 Dragon items on my Paladin, and  Firey Avenger. 95% of the rest of the server had none.<br />
<br />
The game has been split since Day 1. Look at Luclin. VT didnt split the population? <br />
<br />
Ooooh, dragon loot pre Kunark? I'll just go ahead and bow to your uberness so we can get that out of the way. <br />
<br />
... but to answer your question, nope, not even VT split the population to any large extent. It might have made the rest of EQ too easy for the VT crowd, I can't judge that, but it certainly wasn't the case that you needed VT level gear for anything a single group was likely to do. About the hardest camp I can think of in Luclin was com2 in ssra with those unslowable elites and you certainly didn't need raid gear to handle it. Although you might have needed a few extra people if your gear was bad. <br />
<br />
 I will use my &quot;2 guys running&quot; analogy again. After 1 year, the faster guy is a little ahead, but after 5 years, how far SHOULD the hardcore player be ahead? <br />
<br />
Anyone with the right class and lvl can join a raid guild and be in PoTime in 3 months, what's your point? How much we all suffered 5 years ago when rubicite was uber is irrelevant. <br />
<br />
 I mean, think about it. You want to be able to score 100+ hp/man gear OUT OF THE BOX, that is the attitude I see, and thats what pisses me off. <br />
<br />
If I got as worked up about gear as you obviously do, I'd either be raiding or I would've quit EQ by now. <br />
<br />
 <br />
Sick of this arguement. Just because a piece of gear or a zone exists doesnt automatically give everyone that buys it the RIGHT to it. Do the work. Earn your way. Like the rest of us. Stop asking for handouts. How much easier do you REALLY want it to be?<br />
<br />
My point is that I think the current situation is bad for EQ. You screw up too many things when you make the gap  too big because of gear. It wastes SOE's resources because they have to design content for too wide of a range of lvl 65 players. It screws up raid guilds because they either have to carry new recruits on the high level raids or they have to do lesser content just to gear them up enough to be useful in a place like Time. It screws up the casual 65s because they hit a brick wall in terms of gear when they get burned out on LDoN. It screws up friendships because there aren't any meaningful places for raiders and non-raiders to group any more. <br />
<br />
We obviously disagree over whether that's a good or a bad thing but since the developers are on your side in this, my opinion really doesn't matter. You'll see in a year or so who was right, I won't be around that long to see how it turns out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly right.  <br />
<br />
Blazz, you are wrapping yourself in sanctimony to the exclusion of viewing the wider picture.  <br />
<br />
The disparity in EQ is out of control, and its harmed the game significantly.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u165"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p165">I don't know whether it would be right to say but before pop, more people grouped together there was less barriers it didn't really matter if you raided or not. Now I believe there is a massive division.<br />
<br />
However, this maybe due to the size of guilds and therefore most groups are guild only. Or its part of the raiding-nonraiding difference. I was part of a time guild and do remember there was a fair few groups where the choice of the person depended on how good their gear was. It would be convenient and niave to isolate this fact as a seperate incident as I believe it most likely goes on on all servers.<br />
<br />
I am inclined to say pop was the cause, however, its not just the reason of the gap between the raiders and the nonraiders. There are more subtle less obvious reasons too. For example, the amount of time raiding as opposed to grinding. The amount of upgrades now compared to what there once was, the frequency of upgrades are much higher. These factors contribute more in the difference between a nonraider and a raider. Then the other aggravations to the nonraider, is the bias the game has taken towards raiding. This isn't a bad thing necessarily but it is alienating. I think pop was just the most apparent form of this alienation. <br />
<br />
Another problem is the nature of the items in game. All the items are homogenous. Tradeskill items are really no different than any other item in the game, so the incentive if you are a raider to do tradeskills isn't really that high. And I would argue most people that do raid and do tradeskills do so for the purpose of using time, and to sell. Charms is an exception to this generalization though, however, I think they could have been better integrated for an alternative purpose. <br />
<br />
If the variety of items that are available ingame were more diverse, I think there could be less of a gap. Imagine a few slots only upgradable by certain quests, or tradeskills, or the content of group content rather than raid content.<br />
<br />
The monopoly of getting only the best items in game by raiding although seems logical is one of the alienating factors of the game today in my opinion.<br />
Or if the values most prioritised for raiding differed than the standard set of values which everyone has access to, this would also make it more of a nonissue. Resistance gear used to be a lot more important than say hp I think and to an extent it was more of a either/or decision. Now the items are more likely to raise both values of hp and sv resists.<br />
<br />
Dunno if any of that makes sense, but arguments can frequently miss out certain elements.</div></div><hr />

Gear sucks in those new &quot;casual optimized&quot; zones like Sol C, Veskar, and Char B, I USED TO WEAR FULL BRONZE!!<br />
<br />
Do you even bother to read my posts? I don't go to Veksar because there's no gear there I want.  Same reason I'm guessing your guild doesn't farm Kael arena for thurg armor, eh?  Oh wait, are you saying we should go to &quot;casual&quot; zones  (as if these zones only allow casuals in) for lower exp and loot we won't wear?  That makes a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
How does the fact that you used to wear bronze many years ago negate the fact that the disparity between raid gear and casual gear is at an all-time ridiculous high?  And that flagged content has artificially divided the paying playerbase?  You're losing me w/ your reasoning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u167"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p167">Look, I am not uber, I am not in an uber guild, hell I dont even have any EP loot except a weapon off a 1-groupable guy. My WHOLE point is that the game has had this seperation SINCE THE BEGINNING. You weren't getting any Dragon items until pick-up raids started doing them. You werent getting Class specific Kunark BPs and Legs because they only dropped off Raid level mobs at the time. Velious had their armor quests, which, DURING Velious, were not easily accessible to the casual gamer. Luclin brought us Ssra and VT, 2 zones that are basically ONLY for Raiders. And then POP brought us raid zones. <br />
<br />
To say &quot;Its too late to open up Sol Ro and the EPs&quot; is absurd. The gear available to single groups in those zones is VERY good, some of it better than the very best you can get in LDoN (the FT3 belt in Fire comes to mind). I really really do NOT understand what you people want. <br />
<br />
For the last time, I am NOT HARDCORE. I am a casual Raider. I think that is about 2 categorys below Hardcore Raider, and about 2 classes above True Casual. I am not Time flagged. I have 1 Gates trial flag, ONE. <br />
<br />
What pisses me off so much is the TOTAL instant-gratification Diablo 2 attitude I see posted by a large majority of the so-called &quot;casual&quot; players. <br />
<br />
How does the fact that you used to wear bronze many years ago negate the fact that the disparity between raid gear and casual gear is at an all-time ridiculous high?  And that flagged content has artificially divided the paying playerbase?  You're losing me w/ your reasoning.<br />
<br />
My point here is that, at the time, I wore the BEST available to me. And I wore it for a LONG time. The biggest problem I see now is that there is no natural progression of gear. There is no Class Quest stuff (like the Totemic my shaman wore in Kunark til I gradually replaced it) ---&gt; Medium Level stuff for the 50s ---&gt; 60+ stuff. Now its &quot;level really fast cause its trivial, buy the best the bazaar has to offer because making pp is trivial, and burn out your options in 6 months playtime&quot;. Sound familiar? Yeah, Diablo 2. Any further diluting of this would be even worse for SOE overall, because more players would &quot;max out&quot; faster and stop playing (and paying). <br />
<br />
I agree the gap is too big.<br />
I agree that the EPs should be opened up with 1-group Tactics like quests. <br />
I agree that there is a large portion of content that some people will just NEVER see. <br />
<br />
But the game is 5 years old, and the ONLY thing that has really changed is the size of the gap. Pre-Kunark there was a gap (that is why I related my gear at that time, to demonstrate that). In Kunark there was a gap. Velious had HUGE gaps (HoT, NToV, even the Arena). Luclin completely divided &quot;raiding&quot; and &quot;non-raiding&quot;, and PoP further widened this gap. <br />
<br />
But look at the history of the game. Before the end of Kunark pick-ups totally dominated the Antonica dragons. I see small guilds doing NToV and HoT all the time now, heck HoT is trivial with 65s and current bazaar level gear. Pick-ups are doing POP Flag mobs DAILY on my server. <br />
<br />
I don't understand what you want, and I don't understand your total impatience to get &quot;it&quot;. Sorry you chose the style of play you did. Try raiding for 6 months if you want better gear, cause THAT how the game works, currently. Right or wrong, thats the deal. There is post on this thread demonstrating there IS good quality loot available in Gates without &quot;uber&quot; gear. But its out there a ways, not close to the POP stones, with no graveyards, and the content is HARD. <br />
<br />

I'm glad your uber at EQ, that you gave up so much of your family and social and professional life for a game, where at the end of your 3-4-5 years you have absolutely nothing to show for it. NOTHING.<br />

I hope WoW changes this as AC2 has<br />

I myself stopped playing EQ and moved AC2 a game that doesn't require the time investment and allows people to solo, quest and a variety of different combat styles.<br />
<br />
When I stun a mob, it's combat animation actually slows down! It is so cool, everyone gets sow (in the form of a mount you can craft at lvl 12)<br />
Everyone can port. You can change your class at lvl 50 if your not happy with it. And although it had a crappy launch, like AO it has improved significantly since release.<br />
<br />
It isn't EQ... and nothing will ever erase the memory of my first run across a zone or first boatride.<br />

<br />
First off, I stopped being even REMOTELY uber shortly after Kunark came out. My guild is not that hardcore. We have no raid atendance rules. It wasnt hard to camp Emp and VT keys, and MOST PoP encounters arent more than a couple hours. There is no need to be &quot;Uber&quot; to get decent gear and flagged for the EPs, thats half my POINT. And take your little jibes about my time spent playing and stick em where the sun doesnt shine. You know nothing about me, or my lifestyle, or my family. <br />
<br />

<br />
So, your telling me that the guy who invests a TON more time than you wont have MUCH better gear? Gimmee a break ok? There is no need to invest HUGE amounts of time in EQ if you don't wish too. Lots and lots of people are having a blast however they choose to play. <br />
<br />
EQ accomodates a ton of playstyles. There are quests (don't blame me if there are walkthroughs of all the quests available at the click of a button, you are more than welcome to ACTUALLY DO THE QUEST), there are merchanting type people who buy, sell and trade all day, there are tradeskillers who enjoy that kind of stuff, there is a LOT of &quot;playstyles&quot; of both raiders and non-raiders. And the game has re-playability. Want something semi-fresh? Start a new character and go places that you havent been with him. Everyone gets so stuck on this &quot;Gotta have the BEST XP zones, gotta have the BEST loots, not wasting my time for less&quot; blah blah blah. Its all crap.</div></div><hr />

As for my thoughts on EQ being a &quot;TIME&quot; sink I stand by them. I'll use getting your VT shards as one example of them.<br />
<br />
I'll use certain guild requirements for membership as well, where you are told that in order to be in a guild you have to be somewhere at a specific time 3-4-5 times a week, it no longer is a game, it's a job.<br />

<br />
I couldnt agree more with most of this, but I will make one comment on the VT key thing. Most of the shards are soloable by a 65 shaman in average gear. Most are duo-able for any tank class. There are only a couple that actually require more than 3 people, and of those, I think ONLY the Ssra shard itself is a problem. The others are doable, and you can camp them on your own schedule. No &quot;raidtimes&quot; to meet, etc etc. The hardest part of the VT key is the Rift off the Emp, the rest is fairly trivial, and just requires time and effort, like any decent, worthwhile goal. <br />
<br />
I dont blame you for being upset about &quot;requirements&quot; in guilds. I do not agree with them one bit, that is why I am not in one of those guilds. I found a guild that fit my playstyle. For me it wasnt that difficult, because I have been on my server a long long time and know tons of people. But I am sure there are guilds on every server that are creeping along, a few flag mobs here, a few Luclin bosses there, etc. Lots of Luclin bosses are fairly simple, now that 65 is the max level and there are so many good spells and AA available. Even &quot;family&quot; guilds can take them.<br />
<br />
I have been playing for 5 years. I was in the &quot;top&quot; guild before Kunark, and I left because of the entire &quot;attitude&quot;. Hell I was a FOUNDING MEMBER of that guild. I guess maybe the reason I have the convictions that I do is that my characters progressed along the path of each expansion, but WELL behind the &quot;cutting edge&quot; of levels and gear. /shrug, to each his own, but I hate the current &quot;level to 65, make 100K, buy the best you can, then burn out cause you dont &quot;want&quot; to do more&quot;. The game has been dumbed down to the point that anyone can get max level and good gear with very little effort at all. Graveyards, insta-travel, heck when you die before level 10 you spawn WITH your gear now. Sheesh. Yeah, there is a BIG gap between the hardcore and the casual, but its always been there. It just wasnt as noticable because the GAME itself was more of a challange, not the gear or the zones you could or couldnt enter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u173"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p173">On the Vex Thal thing, its was probally designed with dual intentions in mind. The ubers would wine about the boring greenie camps, but be challenged by the emperor and such and of course do it first, info would trickle out. The &quot;casuals&quot;, back then that meant those likely not even 60, could pick up many of the peices while still getting xps, I know I have many toons who with a little forethought, picked their xp grinds with a goal in mind, sometimes that goal was acrylia or other stuff for plat, other times it was for shards. It made leveling more fun, and when the time came, I mostly had fun xp camps left for VT progression. Of course those camps are going to suck for the new level 65's who didn't get the shards when it was xps, instead doing PoJ, PoI, PoN, etc until they were max'd in level. That key quest was designed for a totally different game, PoP changed everything.</div></div><hr />

The problem is not the gap; there should be a gap.  The problem is the design and extent of a gap.  As I have said, too much of a good thing is not a good thing.  <br />

You way overstate the gap in the pre-Kunark period.  <br />

But don't get me wrong, I agree with you that this is what is occurring.  But it's not a grand social statement of people's failings; it's just bad design. <br />
<br />
The game design now hurtles people to the end of their progression path (and folks will generally select the easiest option, because that's a normal and acceptable impulse).  Once there, folks don't have a reasonable sense of progression, unless they raid.  They get frustrated, express that frustration, you say you agree, and yet you still argue about on a bulletin board trying to morph it into a statement that if they bitch about EQ, they have a poor work ethic and no sense of initiative.  <br />
<br />
I think that's silly.  It's just bad design; a fine and valid idea has become distorted and harms the quality of the game, imho.</div></div><hr />

I dont think so. How many dragon items and Fear or Hate armor pieces did you have when Kunark shipped? Zones like Lower Guk and Sol B were perma-camped and had a lot of good loot flowing out of them, but there was definitely &quot;another level&quot;. The difference between an RBB or CoF and an FBSS was staggering in those days. On my server, there were MAYBE 2 other guilds even capable of killing Naggy or Vox. And back then, &quot;guild&quot; didnt mean big massive blob of zerg people, it meant 40-50 solid players. <br />

I agree its bad design, got a solution? Personally, I think there should be a MAJOR overhaul of the gear system, and make everything have a level limit to be usable. Then we might actually see people use some form of progression, rather than the current &quot;straight to the top, and head-on into the wall&quot; mentality we see. But that would piss people off too. The game is 5 years old man, there just ISN'T a real good solution to a LOT of these issues.</div></div><hr />

Well they could use the sullotion used by the old MUD's.<br />
Have a remort button and let people restart as a slighty better class at level 1 again.<br />
Fairly easy to balance those classes and the loot for them as you can start from 0.<br />
One can even make it so that the next expansion is for those classes only (and when you only take make classes like healer, tank, nuker etc and let people decide by a skill tree what abilities they want I am sure you have solved a lot of the issues we cuurently see)</div></div><hr />

Odd that Diablo 2 sold over 4+ million copies then, eh?  Who knows why people shelled out $50 for a game w/o raids and unattainable gear and locked content.  After all, EQ is doing so much better, no one burns out on EQ right?<br />
<br />
The game has been dumbed down to the point that anyone can get max level and good gear with very little effort at all. Graveyards, insta-travel, heck when you die before level 10 you spawn WITH your gear now. Sheesh. Yeah, there is a BIG gap between the hardcore and the casual, but its always been there. It just wasnt as noticable because the GAME itself was more of a challange, not the gear or the zones you could or couldnt enter.<br />
What do you care about this?  How does the fact that other people can use a GY to retrieve their corpse affect you personally?  If you don't like GYs, stay out of PoP and spend time in those outstanding RvR zones like Veksar, Cd-B, Sol-C, DN, SG, etc... you know, the ones that are packed 24/7 (not).<br />
<br />
And the gap between raider and casual was always there, correct, it just wasn't to the point it is now.  There was never a time to my knowledge that raid wizards had more hps than casual warriors of the same level, but that is where the game is at now.  There is little more humiliating than when your friend, a PoTime raiding wizard, tells you his hps and it's more than your sk has.  He still refuses to take over tanking, though, the punk. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u182"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p182">The game is 5 years old man, there just ISN'T a real good solution to a LOT of these issues.<br />
No flagged content, none whatsoever.  Do not ever artificially divide the playerbase.  Use instancing to handle zone loads and raid events so that people exping in a zone do not interfere w/ raiders and vice versa.  Gear obtainable from raiding is 10-20% (just throw out a number) better than 1 groupable gear, tops.  NO DROP is a thing of the past- get rid of it entirely other than epics (a la FV server).<br />
<br />
Note that w/ a (at most) 10-20% difference in gear, you could design content so that casuals/raiders could use the same content, cutting down on design/development costs.  That makes no sense, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
There, how's that for solutions that took me all of 30 secs to type up.  Hopefully Blizzard has more intelligent designers than the clueless wonders at SOE- the same brainchildren who think shamans are a great class because 4 years ago someone solo'd a dragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u183"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p183">heh nice to see Blazz holding town the thread like a cowboy with a barstool in a barfight<br />
<br />
there's always been a disparity between ubers and non-ubers in EQ since the days when noobs would ooh and ah over the dark elf ranger with twin yaks and cof killing guards outside of grobb.  the point is, in the past, before flags and crazy EXP mudflation to 65 there were 2 sort of ladders to the EQ power curve.  certainly one was gear... after all that's what EQ is about.  but the second was also individual player ability.  if you remember there was a time when some people NEVER hit 60... ever.  the hell levels mid 50s and the high death penalty in exp and hassle guaranteed that no matter how much a crappy player might play a night, the majority of the players quit before hitting 60.  even as recently as mid velious being 60 meant that you were at least competent as a player and motivated.  some classes such as sks and bards could count on one hand the number of maxed char per server on any given night.<br />
<br />
there were certainly items you had to raid for... like your epics... but the idea of the playerbase being segregated say by a player with thurg armor versus SS armor wasn't even a remote thought.  or the idea of a sk with his epic being worthless to a group versus one with a prismatic one...<br />
<br />
back in the day, you could spend 20 hours camping a fungi or epic piece, working on tradeskill to make an item and think of it as investment longterm in your toon.  raiding of course yielded the best gear fastest but factioning or camping keys was something you did on your own.  a player pretty much dialed up or down the level of play he wanted.<br />
<br />
more than anytime in the past, what you have now due to the lack of any other ideas at soe is a sort of jet-stream MUDflation in eq.  the result is that the playerbase is segregated but even for the most involved die-hard raiders it's not a good situation.  anything you have on your toon is good for a couple months max.  you have to keep on the raiding treadmill nonstop or be left in the situation of being hardpressed to be able to raid.  I'm sure ever server has the powerguild who fell to pieces because a portion of the guild decided that sitting on their ass on raids 5 hours a night wasn't really turning out to be so fun.  <br />
<br />
the more I play this game the more I realize that &quot;hard-core&quot; versus casual player isn't a codified player type.  it's situational.  Ive seen many many noob, casual players get serious and join a powerguild and just as often hardcore players and even guilds downshift due to real-life or just getting a clue about spending 8 hours a day raiding.  really, as a player it's in your best interest that the game NOT segregate your ass needlessly<br />
<br />
but it's going the other direction in EQ<br />
<br />
in truth.  the disparity between the haves and have nots post PoP versus before isn't the same thing at all.  unless SoE intends to rotate expansions for the raider versus non-raider (LDON, GoD, LDON, GoD) it's an untenable situation for sony and not good for either type of player.</div></div><hr />

My post basically says competition makes a game good.  If their is no competition and evidence of victory in said competition, Wow, and any other game will loose a signifigant portion of their playerbase fairly fast if they do not do this, and any game designer worth the price of their shoes already knows this.

I would gently suggest that currently EQ caters towards the Ubers and allows the have-nots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u187"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p187">Hmm a solution. A revamp of the stat system possibly, with certain raid attributes. AA 10 level extension on the next expansion but with grinding possibly slower than 60-65. (This to provide a possibly divide in people, so not everyone is the same level.) Having the majority of the expansion, group content. Plus a host of new different spells, which work interdepently with all the classes;- Ie the addition of a 2nd trick to say shamans other than slow.<br />
<br />
In criticism, the solution is probably overly idealistic- a majority group based content would be met with contemption from the raid crowd to the extent of alienating them and losing them from the game and I think they are valued customers- Raiding is an integral part of the game now, and the problem is its too big, that the amount of content needed for the raider has to be an increasing part of every new expansion to keep that part of the audience interested.<br />
<br />
Secondly, a slowdown in grinding would only serve the older players. The new players would and could be alienated by the amount of possible aa to get as well as levels. One of the ideas I heard before GoD release was a combination thing, which instead of gaining training points as you level you could gain 5 aa per level for level 65-75.<br />
<br />
Thirdly, when a new level cap is integrated, lots of zones are obsoleted. So, everyone and everything would be based in the new expansion. Which as presently, at least, there are sizable populations raiding for example old expansions.<br />
<br />
There is also the idea of revamping old content, but old content doesn't sell. And, people like new things. So revamping old zones would be like just like buying a &quot;new&quot; item from a charity shop.<br />
<br />
The solution is probably unviable now at this stage of the game now though, plus there seems to be a  prefererence to work on graphics upgrades and not these &quot;small&quot; things.<br />
<br />
Don't know if my post makes sense, (I'm no good at grammar or arranging arguments) -just my ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love how it's implied that alienating and losing casual players (the majority) is okay and that they're not valued customers a la raiders (as if raiders pay more).  I don't know if that was your intent, just seemed worded oddly.<br />
<br />
Raiding is an integral part of the game now, and the problem is its too big, that the amount of content needed for the raider has to be an increasing part of every new expansion to keep that part of the audience interested.<br />
<br />
Correct- the funny thing is that the SOE designers (well, marketing is probably more fair since they run the show) think their plan of a mudflated, &quot;raiders only&quot; expansion every six months, finished or not, mostly bug free or not, is a ticket to longterm success.  The rate at which raiders devour content is far greater than SOE's ability to churn them out, broken and unfinished or not.  I will cheerfully wait a year between expansions in WoW if they're actually finished on release and not plagued w/ unfinished, broken content.  Content that can't be fixed because the devs now have to work on the next expansion, not the one they just released two weeks ago.</div></div><hr />

Iz, I know that you know that I am sorta on your side, and that you and I have these debates regularly, even though we are closer together in ideals than either of us wants to admit. <br />
<br />
One point I want to make on the quoted portion of your post though. You have been playing EQ for what, 4+ years? EQ has NEVER had any of the things you mentioned. In fact, nothing even close, with the exception of some instancing, which is relatively new. Why have you kept playing this long? Did you play Diablo 2, the game you &quot;compare&quot; EQ too even 1/5th as long as EQ? Do you really think that D2 was more susseccful commercially than EQ?<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the answer isnt less non NO-DROP gear, I think its MORE no drop gear. If the Soulscream Belt was no drop, you would have to go there to upgrade your character, along with all your other slots. This would create a situation where the casual player would have to spend his time gearing, rather than this blitz to 65, camp 50K and hit the Bazaar. I think the Bazaar has ruined EQ more than anything. One thing I distinctly remember doing constantly when the game was &quot;more fun&quot; is finding out where better gear was, and going to get it. Even when I wanted to twink, I would use my main to go camp his gear, and having goals like that made the game a TON more fun, at least for me. <br />
<br />
I guess the bigest problem is that they have eliminated the goals for the casual player. Grinding XP and camping pp to buy some ornate isnt a &quot;goal&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
Note that w/ a (at most) 10-20% difference in gear, you could design content so that casuals/raiders could use the same content, cutting down on design/development costs. That makes no sense, doesn't it?<br />
<br />
It used to be about that. As the game got older, the gap grew. It got REALLY at the end of Velious and Luclin, where ST, NToV, and VT really pumped out the &quot;high end&quot; gear in big chunks, and made Thurg and SS armor look like Bronze. <br />
<br />
I fully support opening Sol Ro and the EPs eventually. I would like to see the more casual one-group style players have a shot at the one-groupable stuff in these zones, and the smaller raid mobs that exist there. But I want there to be a decent sized line between the raiders and the non-raiders. Its a completely different game. Just because a +240 hp, +25 to all, +41% haste, +100 attack BP exists, that doesnt mean EVERYONE should be able to get one. Period. You do what the game dicates you do to get that level of loot. How did you score loot in Diablo 2? You certainly didnt kill Andarial over and over for her drops. You did Mephisto or Baal. Why? Because thats where the good stuff was. The fact that you could do it alone, and so easily, is what burned out the game, and others like it. There SHOULD be some hard effort in getting the very best. And basically, to get the 210 hp BP, you better have one with 150 on it already, and know 60 other people with 150 on theirs as well. Thats the deal.<br />

<br />
1. Hardcore superraiders (5+ hours a day, always in the top end guilds)<br />
2. Semi-hardcore raiders (3 or more hours a day average, but lots of days they dont even log in)<br />
3. Casual raiders ( 3 or more hours a day, but only a couple days a week, tops) = This is me<br />
4. Hardcore (more than 2 hours a day) non-raiders = Iz and a couple other<br />
5. Semi casual non-raiders (about 2 hours a day average)<br />
6. True casual players (less than 2 hours a day)<br />

I guess we will just have to agree to disagree here. I think you want it to be TOO easy. I will agree that you should have a road to a 170 hp BP if the best in the game is 250, but thats about it. Oh wait, you do have that road, its called LDoN. <br />
<br />
I will also agree that LDoN is too cookie-cutter, but honestly, it has the potential for becomeing truly excellent. Yeah, its pretty vanilla right now. It was cool on its release though, it just got too solved too fast. I highly doubt we will see much expanding of it either, since I think all type of effort is going into EQ2. Without EQ2 on the horizon, I think that LDoN would be made into EXACTLY the type of playstyle option the casual player wants (except the ones who want 150 hp BPs off yard trash in level 50 zones, and the ones who want to get XP from tradeskilling, etc etc. These jokers can just go find another game)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u194"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p194">The buggest problem that I see is that events in GoD now REQUIRE you to have the best gear, without it you are just going to fail and die. As there is only one way to get this gear, raiding, this means that for the majority of us in small/non-raiding guilds even if we wanted to do something in GoD is just isnt possible. This is my biggest complaint, I cannot group with friends in uber guilds because they dont want to do the things I want to do, and I cant go to the areas that they go to becuase of flags or gear. <br />
<br />
I do not see how GoD can be an expansion of the game if the majority of players are not going to see more than 3 zones. I feel that this will alienate the player base, and increase the level of players leaving.<br />
<br />
Who wants to go to zone to watch an 8k tank get one rounded by a mob knowing that you just bounced slow of it and its coming for you next. :)  I dont unless I know that I have some chance of surviving there. My personal experience with GoD has been limited. I have done one group in Ferubi where we killed a centaur looking thing, other than that GoD provided my with the alchemy reciepes I needed to max to alchemy :)<br />
<br />
Having said that I was scared spitless the whole time i was in GoD, thinking if I get agro from this mob, then I am dead and possibly the entire group, every add had me freaking out. <br />
<br />
Most of my gear was Kunark, with some LDoN pieces and one luclin piece, I really felt out of place. <br />
<br />
Now back to my original point. Sony has not scaled the mobs in GoD to be tailored for the individuals in the group, the expectation is that you will have the best available and therefore the mobs are pitched at that level, if your gear isnt of that level, then you simply will not survive. <br />
<br />
The problem with gear and scalability is that with most of the high end armor you are simply replacing one no drop piece with another, this means that there is very limited trickle down of the armor. I might be able to buy a 30ac bp in the bazaar, but to get the 50ac one I need to get a raid and hit HoT, to get a 60ac one its LDoN or Planes for ornate, for higher its Elementals or GoD or VT, but unless I am Planes/VT/Elementally geared I am not going to survive in GoD to get anything. <br />
<br />
I dont believe that people are interested in HoT for Velious armor because there is better in the game and people dont seem to want to camp there anymore, better to go to BoT and pray that your group can hold the named spawn from the marauding camp stealers and train pullers long enough for that elusive ornate pattern to drop to fund the next piece of armor or equipment.<br />
<br />
Blazz you say you have 1 flag for GoD, have you looked for more? The general feeling from the board seems to be that shaman can forget about GoD flagging until people can do it with 5 people and the shaman can just tag along, we dont bring enough to the group for people to choose us over a DPS, real healing class or a mezz class (enc, bard).<br />
<br />
Well thats my rant for today. For my own plans I am attending pick up raids on Prexus trying to get flagged for Sol Ro and I have a plan to ugrade stuff to LDoN gear as I can, my guild is a small one and generally we do events on teir one. When WoW comes out I am certainly going to look at it and if it seems good, then I will make the switch and jump games.<br />

<br />
I only have one Gates flag because I barely play anymore, and just happened to get asked (by non-guildies) one day if I wanted to tag along.<br />
<br />
Also, do not make the mistake of lumping the entire Gates expansion into some &quot;You MUST have the very best&quot; category. There is a post on this very thread that outline some area that more &quot;average equiped&quot; players can go to and try for upgrades. Just because you cannot do the upper end Trials without EP/Time gear doesnt mean they are all that hard. I can probably do 3/4 of the trials easily with my VT level gear. Bazaar equiped can do half, and upgrade AS THEY GO. The one trial I did could be done by NAKED lvl 65s, I swear. Non EP SK for a tank, me as secondary healer and slower, Chanter who didnt bother to charm cause we didnt need to bother, ranger, wizzie and rogue for DPS (and me, I bounced one add and Baned it twice every wave, told the group what I was going to do so we saved him for last, when we got there, it was 1/2 dead already).<br />
<br />
But when these options are offered, I see responses like &quot;Too Far to run&quot; or &quot;No graveyard&quot; or &quot;The mobs are too hard, we can kill them, but its hard&quot;, I will get quotes if you want them. This is an indication to me that the Bazaar geared people want . . . just that. A Bazaar to BUY Time level gear in, I guess. <br />
<br />
The bitching and moaning about the current state of the shaman class really doesnt apply THAT MUCH to people who are not in the final set of Gates trials. SHaman are still a very solid class. Yeah, our power is diminishing due to the adjustments in the game, but we arent completely worthless, and has been pointed out, we are the masters of trivial content. Some Gates trials are as easy as LDoN normal, if not easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u196"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p196">Sorry, good gear doesn't help much in GoD - I haven't been one and two rounded as much as I'm in GoD since walking out on the mesa in Everfrost at level 3.<br />
And LDoN pretty much eliminated the big &quot;raider - casual&quot; gap.  The top level LDoN gear with full augments puts you at elemental level without ever doing a single raid.  Yes, it will probably take you some 25,000 points to get there, what, at 50 points an hour is 500 hours played.  But compared to what it takes to equip a full guild to that level you're probably faster as a non-raider.  I know for sure that I spend more then that time raiding since LDoN came out, and I still have slots with Velios, Luclin and ornate armor.<br />
Regarding WoW, I won't touch it until it's clear that Blizzard did a better job securing its systems against hacker then they did on battlenet.<br />
PS: Opening SolRo and EP wouldn't help at all for the casual players - the elemental level pieces still don't drop from one group mobs.  If you have a &quot;casual&quot; association that can effectively farm EP armor - they can defeat the progression.</div></div><hr />

You'd think that, but then in subsequent posts you label all casuals as &quot;whiners&quot; because they &quot;want it easy&quot;.  I don't paint all raiders w/ a negative brush nor do I hold them responsible for the state of the game.<br />

<br />
Started in early velious.  Short answer: we're still having fun and haven't quite reached our casual goals yet and WoW hasn't been released.  It's only recently after 3 years that we've hit the wall in terms of our advancement as casual players and that our gear is finally holding us back for the content we want to do.<br />
<br />
Do you really think that D2 was more susseccful commercially than EQ?<br />
<br />
Not apples to apples since one is a single player game and one is a MMORPG w/ a recurring subscription.  I wonder if EQ has sold 4 million copies though over 5 years.  Is this data available somewhere?  WoW ought to be a good benchmark, though.<br />
<br />

This would create a situation where the casual player would have to spend his time gearing, rather than this blitz to 65, camp 50K and hit the Bazaar. <br />
This would single out the casual player and simply punish them further.  Then they wouldn't even be able to get to a certain point in their gear progression w/o spending hours camping gear that's not even close to raid gear.  If everything was ND, we'd have quit long ago, egads.  I still wish I had known about FV when I started.  If I'm not allowed to earn my gear via combat, at least let me play E*verTrade and earn it through my investment skills.<br />

Actually we have lots of goals, and how we define our goals is none of your business (though I've posted ours recently).  Why do you keep trying to force one playstyle (raiding) down our throats?<br />
<br />
I fully support opening Sol Ro and the EPs eventually. I would like to see the more casual one-group style players have a shot at the one-groupable stuff in these zones, and the smaller raid mobs that exist there.<br />
This is the extent of our agreement I think, because:<br />
<br />
<br />
 But I want there to be a decent sized line between the raiders and the non-raiders. Its a completely different game. Just because a +240 hp, +25 to all, +41% haste, +100 attack BP exists, that doesnt mean EVERYONE should be able to get one. Period.<br />
<br />
Actually, unless they use server unique items a la Diablo, it's perfectly possible for everyone on the server to get that bp if they're willing to join a raid guild and spend the hours necessary.  I fail to see the reasoning why time spent raiding &gt; time spent on single group content.  Time is time, I guess we disagree on why one person's time is more important if they raid than another person's who doesn't raid.<br />
<br />
Also, your breakdown of people into various categories is irrelelvant other than raider vs. non-raider.  Time spent is meaningless in terms of progression once you achieve a certain point- at that point it's raid or quit.</div></div><hr />

Not post-nerf we don't, unless you were one of the lucky few who managed to score 2 40 hp augs and the L1 breastplate in the first week of LDoN's release.  I believe a 140hp bp is now the highest u can get from LDoN post-nerf.  Someone correct me if I'm wrong and post the augs you'd use to improve on this from LDoN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I was thinking, WHY is it important that you can only get a Time level gear only come from Time? I mean you still got your gear, is it some how less because someone else got it a different way? Now to some extent I can understand this, and this is kinda of my point. if I can link a BP with stats even CLOSE to what is in Time, I think anyone in time would be pretty pissed. Because really, what do you have besides the stats.  We both have chain BP, and I can dye them the same color as you. Now back in vellious, thrug/dragon/giant/tov all had different textures. Now, lets say you could get a BP close to tov, but it looked like bronze.<br />
<br />
I think this was a big loss when they moved to the new engine in SOL. Before, I would be WOW that guy is in full NTOV gear, or what ever. Now that newbie, in FS with some dye looks mighty close to that person in full time gear. There is no other value besides the stats, so I think i understand why they want to &quot;protect&quot; them.<br />
<br />
This is the direction WoW is going to take, you will be able to get similar gear in stats as a non-raider. But all the raider's gear will look better. So you get this good sword, but it looks like a rusty sword a newb got off a skelly in EC. Where as the the raiders is a bastard sword w/ a fire effect on it.<br />
<br />
In everyday use, there close, with in say 10%, but there is more value to the weapon then the stats. They can both &quot;do&quot; the job, one just looks a lot better doing it. :D<br />
<br />
I think EQ might be to far along for this the gap to big.  And the fact that the engine can't do this atm. But then I am on the casual side of the fence, so I understand my views could be all wrong. But I do believe that when the devalued armor for the way it looked, it changed the game so only stats mattered.<br />

<br />
Yes. And those who become a part of that game all-but-invariably develop the same attitude. It's an unfortunate but hardly surprising phenomenon considering that everyone who plays EQ is a human. There have always been two different games being played, but the fence between them is higher than ever. Of course, it's also easier than ever to dig under the fence, but you get dirtier than ever in the process.<br />
<br />
As for LDoN versus raiding, seriously, give me a break. Doing LDoNs as often and for as long as it would take to deck a character out in the best, fully-auged merchant gear would burn out even a hardcore raider. This is clearly not a good solution for people who don't raid all the time because, in most cases, they find it tiresome (replacing one set of boring, tiresome content with another isn't the answer). Being a numbered cog in a guild that raids constantly will get you better gear faster and more easily, even if all you do is farm elemental planes - even moreso if your upgrades are the stuff no one else wants anymore.<br />
<br />
On the subject of open raids, flag raids, alliances, etc., these things certainly exist and are certainly an option for people who don't want to raid constantly. I am one of these people, and I have attended many such events, but I have relatively few PoP flags. Why you ask? Simple: I don't enjoy most of the PoP content, especially the god encounters. They're not too hard. They're not inaccessable. They're boring. I have always enjoyed playing a shaman because of the difference I can make. When my contribution is lost in a sea of zerglings, my buzz is killed - and no amount of success or loot can replace it.<br />
<br />
I'm just not interested in the content that leads to progression in PoP's &quot;storyline&quot;. Combine that with my complete lack of interest in said storyline or having the best gear in the game and it's clear why I don't chase the PoP carrot. About the only reason to suffer through it would be to play with friends. Of course, with friends who will drop you like a rock for easy uber loot, who needs enemies?<br />
<br />
Progression is fun when what you're progressing through is fun. Otherwise it's merely toil that some people think isn't terribly good design for a game. I don't see why raiders should be catered to exclusively any more than non-raiders should. There needs to be a middle ground. Gates is much more of a middle ground than PoP, but it has its own unique balance issues.<br />

I wonder if EQ has sold 4 million copies though over 5 years. Is this data available somewhere? WoW ought to be a good benchmark, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
not even close.  diablo series, warcraft series, myst series, unreal series, half-life any of these games kick the crap out of EQ in units sold to a point where it's not even relevant to compare EQ<br />
<br />
I believe that EQ has moved somewhere north of 600k units.  that's nothing in the large scheme of top PC titles... let's not even mention console game sales<br />
<br />
even as the number 2 MMPOG, EQ is on the fringe of video gaming.  as recently as SoL times I had friends in Korea who'd never even heard of Everquest.  what makes EQ an enormous cash cow is 1) the constant revenue stream of you monthly fee for basically nothing from the company but bandwith 2) the POTENTIAL for growth since MMPOGs are so small<br />
<br />
with all this in mind blizzard has squarely marketed WoW for a more mass appeal.  in fact if you look at the beta boards there's back and forth daily between old MMPOGers (mainly DAOCers and EQers) and RTS/FPS/RPG gamers about how easy the game should be and what constitutes an unacceptable timesink.<br />
<br />
personally I think focusing on retaining hardcore players isn't a bad one.  it's unlikey that one size fits all in MMPOG or that one game can be everything to everyone, especially when you have to re-up subscribers every month.  hardcore gamers such as sony has with EQ are an invaluable resource versus casual gamers.  there's a principle in marketing: cost per aquisition of customers.  with eq you have a captive customer base who not only pays up every month, but in MANY cases has multiple accounts, and in MOST cases also buys every expansion 2 or 3 times a year and in MOST cases through his playing career signs up multiple other customers.  one loyal customer can easily provide a $200+ revenue stream a year... and up to $600 or $1000 for the most involved.  all this at zero cost in advertising or aquisition for the company.  this kind of thing is unheard of in business let alone in software where a small developer might see $10 net ONE TIME for a shipped game after paying off publisher, advertising, packaging etc etc<br />
<br />
what's really sad is that EQ HAS the golden goose.  all they have to do is quit pissing people off and making them quit.  when a new movie comes out or a new game comes out, the studio or publisher has to MOTIVATE you to get up off your seat and go check out the new product.  basically the null state with EQ is to keep playing... they gotta MOTIVATE YOU to quit.  they gotta screw up or piss on you to make you take the step of going to the options screen and hit &quot;cancel.&quot;  I dont know if any other game will EVER again have that sort of unassailable position with its consumers... I doubt any game will so effectively kill the golden goose with so many customers in that case than sony has</div></div><hr />

Pretty clearly shows that EP is superior to LDoN in every way. Always has been. The ONLY thing that ever got close was HPS before the 2 +40 hp aug nerf. Period. <br />
<br />
Mu mispoke Crusty. LDoN is close to VT, better than Ornate, and well below EP level gear. With or without the &quot;nerf&quot;. <br />
<br />
You'd think that, but then in subsequent posts you label all casuals as &quot;whiners&quot; because they &quot;want it easy&quot;.  I don't paint all raiders w/ a negative brush nor do I hold them responsible for the state of the game.<br />
<br />
I dont mean to imply that all casual players are whiners, but lets face it, you cannot even seem to fixate on an upgrade plan. You say you want 100 hp items available to you, someone posts where they are available, and you say &quot;Too far, no graveyard, no insta-travel, so we dont go there&quot;. Fabled mobs get mentioned as upgrade solutions for smaller guilds and even 1 groupers, and your response is &quot;They are always camped by Ubers who train people blah blah blah so we dont go&quot;.<br />
Thats crap bro, it REALLY is. <br />
<br />
This would single out the casual player and simply punish them further.  Then they wouldn't even be able to get to a certain point in their gear progression w/o spending hours camping gear that's not even close to raid gear.<br />
<br />
Actually, part of my plan would be to up the drop rates, since it cant really be &quot;farmed&quot; anymore. I also want firm level limits on ALL gear, so you cant drag lvl 10 twinks in to loot this stuff. This would give the casual players a DEFINITE route to their game. Progress in levels, and upgrade your gear as you go. Make the gear significantly better than it is now. One problem I think that SOE has is that they HAVE to keep upping the ante on the Hardcore Raid level gear, or those players will bail out, yet they do not wish to completely obsolete every single piece of gear available to the casual player every exapansion. If you could suddenly get a 150 hp BP very easily, then all that work and time you invested farming pp for your Ornate or doing runs in LDoN would be totally wasted.<br />
<br />
Actually we have lots of goals, and how we define our goals is none of your business (though I've posted ours recently).  Why do you keep trying to force one playstyle (raiding) down our throats?<br />
<br />
None of MY BUSINESS ?!?!?!?! Do I not play this game, same as you? Because I choose to raid occasionally, what YOU do with YOUR time is none of MY business?? Got a clue for ya here Iz, I am NOT some hardcore 5 hour a day guy!! How many times do I have to explain my playstyle to you?<br />

Your in la-la land sometimes Iz. Cripes. Typical &quot;hung with a new rope&quot; attitude. Gates HAS upgrades for 1 group folks with bazaar level gear! Fabled mobs drop DAMN GOOD LOOT! GO F#%$%ING GET IT! See, you want to be able to pop into a PoK stone, kill a couple Fire Beetles, and loot a 150 hp BP with FT5 on it, and one for all your friends, and log. Thats your &quot;hour&quot; playtime for the night. You wanna do that 20 times, and then . . . BE MAXXED OUT IN A MONTH AND QUIT!!<br />
<br />
Also, your breakdown of people into various categories is irrelelvant other than raider vs. non-raider.  Time spent is meaningless in terms of progression once you achieve a certain point- at that point it's raid or quit.<br />
<br />
Or WAIT til the game changes and this stuff becomes available!!<br />
<br />
This game has paths defined in it. I didnt make them. Would it KILL you to raid every now and then, even if you HATE it? Guess what, I HATE farming trivial raid mobs. But I do it, you know why? Because I got mine, so I help my mates get theirs. Sheesh, I have been to 5 raids in the past 30 days. Last night I got EP arms. First new item I have gotten in 4 months. WEEEEE. Why havent I gotten full EP armor? BECAUSE I CHOOSE NOT TO RAID. Its not as fun for me, so I settle for what I have, grunt out a few LDoNs a week to try and add some upgrades, and thats THAT. <br />

I like this post, and popped you a reputation point for it, but I do disagree with a few things you said. <br />
<br />
Its sad if all the guilds on your server got snooty the minute they hit the EPs. I really do not think this is the case on mine. I have twinks in an old, much much lower end guild than my main is in, and the EP guilds hardly act like Gods. Some of the HIGHEST advanced people are like that, to be sure, but for the most part, even the &quot;Top 3&quot; guilds have a lot of very nice people in them. Your server may be different. Cant say. <br />
<br />
As for your LDoN statements, of course its boring. How much fun do you think killing Reparm or Hydro or Avatar of Mist is the 20th time? People are always doing some calculation for gear vs time in the EPs too. 1 piece every couple weeks? Yeah, ok, sure. But lets start factoring in flag mobs, and back flag mobs, and back-back flag mobs, and fails, and the 2 months some of us miss because we ARENT &quot;uber&quot; style players, etc etc etc. Most of this time isnt &quot;fun&quot;. Heck, LDoN can be more fun than MOST raids, especially the 10th+ kill on any mob. <br />
<br />
I really dont even know what to say about this anymore. Go ahead and beat me up. All I can say is &quot;Sorry you only got 3+ years of enjoyment out of this game, that truly sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />

I ran the numbers out of curiosity.  Some assumptions:<br />
- average of 400k players throughout EQ's history (probably less than this)<br />
- all players pay for EQ monthly (for maximum revenue)<br />
- each EQ expansion averages $30 as they keep releasing bundled packs which lower the aggregate cost for new players<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard:<br />
Diablo 2: 4 million X $50 ea. = $200,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 expansion: 2.5 million X $30 = $75,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 revenue: $275M<br />
<br />
SOE/Verant:<br />
Monthly subscription revenue<br />
400k subscribers X $13 X 60 months = $312,000,000<br />
<br />
Expansions revenue<br />
400k subscribers X 8 expansions X $30 = $96,000,000<br />
EQ revenue: $408M<br />
<br />
Clearly SOE/Verant have destroyed Blizzard in sales and revenue, despite the fact that Blizzard holds back to back to back sales records on the launches of their titles.<br />
<br />
But then again, perhaps you've heard of the Warcraft/Starcraft series? I think they may have moved a few units as well...<br />

Sounds like you're onto something.  We define our goals, you don't define them for us, get it?  If playing E*verTrade to earn ornate you'll get no other way in a reasonable timeframe isn't a goal to you, that's fine- each person has their own goals defined by themselves.  I make no judgments on each player's chosen goals, when did you get anointed such that you and you alone defines what is a reasonable goal in EQ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Gates HAS upgrades for 1 group folks with bazaar level gear!<br />
<br />
If said group can survive the beating in their bazaar gear, fine.  We still refuse to reward bad design by shelling out more $$$ so raiders get more content aimed squarely at them.  If you reward bad design you will only get more of it.  Not to mention by the time we get my cleric PL'd up and re-equipped, we should have met most of our goals and WoW should be out soon, so throwing more money at EQ is not the wisest decision.<br />

See, you want to be able to pop into a PoK stone, kill a couple Fire Beetles, and loot a 150 hp BP with FT5 on it, and one for all your friends, and log. Thats your &quot;hour&quot; playtime for the night. You wanna do that 20 times, and then . . . BE MAXXED OUT IN A MONTH AND QUIT!!<br />
<br />
I quote you all the time so that you know what I'm responding to and so that I don't put words in your mouth.  If you'd kindly quote me where I've said this, I'd love to read it.  Wanting to earn my own ornate in Sol Ro Tower instead of the bazaar is hardly the same as killing fire beetles.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or WAIT til the game changes and this stuff becomes available!!<br />
<br />
Never happen.  They're working on the post-Gates expansion now as is, you think they'll fix the rest of the existing broken content?  WoW is the only hope to fix this, not EQ.  I find the debate over this interesting and stimulating, but I'm not naive enough for one second to think the designers will ever change the EverRaid game to accommodate the casual playstyle on anything resembling an even footing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This game has paths defined in it. I didnt make them. Would it KILL you to raid every now and then, even if you HATE it?<br />
<br />
Kill me, no.  Send my $$$ (the only language SOE speaks) to another game developer who doesn't force players down one path? Yes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its sad if all the guilds on your server got snooty the minute they hit the EPs.<br />
Guilds, yes, individuals, no.  Plenty of friends in the high end guilds, I don't have a problem with raiders- just the designers who forced this on everyone as the only path for progression.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for your LDoN statements, of course its boring. Heck, LDoN can be more fun than MOST raids, especially the 10th+ kill on any mob.<br />
<br />
I like LDoN despite some glaring flaws, it's just 2 years late and the gear is still woefully behind.  The inability to get basic augments like ID4, MP4 and IH4 is just ridiculous considering these are staples (with higher foci percentages) on raid gear.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I really dont even know what to say about this anymore. Go ahead and beat me up.<br />
<br />
This isn't personal, just a discussion over a meaningless game that is one of the ways I choose to spend a portion of what little free time I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
 All I can say is &quot;Sorry you only got 3+ years of enjoyment out of this game, that truly sucks&quot;<br />
Despite all its many flaws, I still feel like I'm getting $26/month of fun from EQ.  Once that changes, the rest of my friends leave or WoW is released, we will be gone forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u214"><b>perceus_eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p214">Raiding for the best gear/ability to handle the hardest content isn't a &quot;design flaw&quot; its part of the game.  If you can't handle that, this is not the game for you.  <br />
<br />
If *YOU* hate raiding, then don't raid.  Don't act like you're part of some vast majority that should be catered to, shut up and play the game the way you want to, with the merits and flaws that go along with that play style.  <br />
<br />
I did a quick survey (based on their posted rosters) of guilds on e'ci that range from occasional raiders to uqua level guilds, and everything in between and there are over 2500 characters that are members of these guilds or involved in public raids (only included characters that have raided at least once in the past month for public raids, since there are 1500 registered raiders and i know for a fact not all of them are still involved).  This did not include the two major asian raid forces on the server, one guild and one public group.  <br />
<br />
I have doubts that ALL of the people interested in raiding were counted in this basic a survey, but 2500 seems to be a decent chunk of the active level 65 population on the server.  Just DROP it, atm you're just crying because your playstyle doesn't work but you don't want to quit.  Go play lineage 2, that's what games designed for nonraiders are like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u215"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p215">Sorry Iz, your such a hypocrite, man. Lets get into some details of that, and I won't even have to go to past posts.<br />
<br />
Our upgrade plan remains LDoN, Tactics, BoT and that's pretty much it.<br />
<br />
Wrong, Gates has upgrades. Fabled mobs drop upgrades. You just refulse to acknowledge them, and the reason is . . .?<br />
<br />
We refuse to reward SOE for exacerbating the problems caused by flagging in PoP by subsidizing more flagged raid content that we will never see in Gates, particularly content that has forced many shaman (myself included) into retirement.<br />
<br />
I see. Yet you played Luclin, yes? Ssra and VT are pure raid zones. You play in POP, correct? An entire expansion designed around raiding. <br />
<br />
How much Gates have you seen Iz? A BIG problem with this expansion is the word of mouth people are hearing, which they apply universially across the entire expansion. Saying that Gates is ONLY for EP+ level characters is absurd. There is plenty of content, and available gear, for the non-EP 1 group level 65 players. However, you keep reading how its all SO HARD, and how Shaman are SO WORTHLESS that you buy into it and don't even bother going to see for yourself. The hard stuff, and the places where Shaman arent as useful are MUCH deeper in. Granted its not as deep as, say, NToV or HoT was to Velious, or SSra and VT were to Luclin, but there is a TON of content, trials, AND GEAR in front of the REALLY hard stuff. But, based on the posts you see here, 90%of which were written by EP+ shaman, you have decided to, and I quote &quot;. . . refuse to reward SOE for exacerbating the problems caused by flagging in PoP by subsidizing more flagged raid content that we will never see in Gates, particularly content that has forced many shaman (myself included) into retirement.&quot; <br />
<br />
Big Golf Clap for you Iz. Hey, I know, you should probably consider cutting off your nose, to spite you face, next. <br />
<br />
Yeah, your going to have a harder time in Gates than the EP people who are going to breeze through the first half of the trials with druid-shaman combos EASILY healing them. Oh well, thought you wanted SOME challange to get your stuff. OK the Fire Beetle thing was a bit lowball, but I guess you want your UBER gear to drop off . . .Giants in BoT? Come on. <br />
<br />
Next quote.<br />
<br />
Raiders get gear upgrades every expansion, why should non-raiders have it any different?  That's one of the reasons I hate NO DROP so much, all that wasted time.<br />
<br />
Think we established that there are upgrades for the casual players in Gates. Oh yeah, forgot, your nose lying on the floor in front of you again, boy, I bet your face is super pissed it doesnt have a nose anymore. And of course, the Fabled mobs. Friend of mine in a completely non-raiding guild, lvl 64 in fact, just got himself a Fabled Mith BP. Thing is awesome. He and his guild did it with 2 groups, 1 outside friend EP level helping. The rest were geared WORSE THAN YOU, IZ! But of course, all those mobs are dominated by high level raiders ganking them all the time, so they don't count as &quot;upgrades&quot; either. Where do you want your upgrades again? Remember, wherever they are, thats where the people will go. ALL the people man, raiders,  casuals, and all sorts in between. Heck, if they are easy enough and good enough, I will PERSONALLY twink my characters with it. Oh and please make the best stuff non-tradeable, so I can truly dominate the spawns and then sell it for a HUGE fortune in the pathetic excuse for an economy known as &quot;The Bazaar&quot;. Don't worry Iz, I give you good deal, you just keep farming that pp in some trivial worthless zone, no one goes to, k?<br />
<br />
Wait, I know, instanced zones, right? Hey yeah, lets make another exploitable system in the game where all you need is a 65 druid and you can walk out in half a day LOADED. <br />
<br />
Of the available choices, Iz, the only decent one I see is Instanced zones containing NO-DROP upgraded gear for the casual players. And even then, if the stuff was too good, it would completely topple the current mudflation problem we have now, not to mention the constant &quot;Make an instance, zone in, track for nameds, zone out, repeat&quot; situation. We see that now in Gates for spells. The stupid rarity of them is FORCING people to do this to get their spells. What a crock of ****, and I will be behind you 100% in busting SOEs balls for this crap. <br />
<br />
If said group can survive the beating in their bazaar gear, fine.  We still refuse to reward bad design by shelling out more $$$ so raiders get more content aimed squarely at them.  If you reward bad design you will only get more of it.  Not to mention by the time we get my cleric PL'd up and re-equipped, we should have met most of our goals and WoW should be out soon, so throwing more money at EQ is not the wisest decision.<br />
<br />
<br />
I quote you all the time so that you know what I'm responding to and so that I don't put words in your mouth.  If you'd kindly quote me where I've said this, I'd love to read it.  Wanting to earn my own ornate in Sol Ro Tower instead of the bazaar is hardly the same as killing fire beetles.<br />
<br />
Sigh, again, where would you have us put your upgrades? Not in the newest expansion? Wait, up top didnt you say that &quot;. . Raiders get gear upgrades every expansion, why should non-raiders have it any different?  That's one of the reasons I hate NO DROP so much, all that wasted time.&quot; <br />
<br />
AH HA! I get it! You WANT it tradeable and buyable and in places you don't (or can't, or won't, or refuse to) go, so YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE WORK! You can sit back, farm pp, and buy your next big upgrade! Hey I am catching on Iz. Still think your face looks kinda funny without a nose, but hey, I bet its mad you cut that nose off man! Good Move!<br />
<br />
Never happen.  They're working on the post-Gates expansion now as is, you think they'll fix the rest of the existing broken content?  WoW is the only hope to fix this, not EQ.

<br />
Gonna wrap this up, Iz. Again, we will agree to disagree on the opening of Sol Ro and the EPs eventually to everyone v.i.a. some tactics-esque back-door quest. I think it will happen. Heck, I bet over 3/4 of my servers current active playing population is already EP flagged, so why the hell not? But then, &quot;Raiders are only 15% of the population of the game&quot; /snicker. <br />
<br />
I will agree with the aug thing, except that I think SOE addressed this. In the form of Tribute. Wait, is that something you not doing in protest? Please let me know, cause it seems like a good idea to me. Seems like a way the casual players can get focus effectsthey are missing for the times they need it most (like, say, and incursion into GATES!! or an LDoN Hard!!). Oh and for the record, these focus you mention are not exactly spilling over the top of the pot in EP gear either, man. But then again, since you can get the on Ornate or Player Made items, I guess it can't be THAT big a problem. Oh no, your not using those Player Made items cause they are created from items you cannot get too, right? The nose thing again?<br />
<br />
As for the last line, Iz, all I have to say is this. Isnt that what its all about? There is no rule here &quot;Whoever cancels his account with the most Cyber-Toys wins&quot; bro. Cripes, I honestly think you get more enjoyment out of this game than 90% of the Hardcore Raiders you so vehemently oppose, because for them EQ has become WORK. Man, stop letting gear, and greener grass, affect you. Make the seperation in your own mind. Raider. Non Raider. Here is my &quot;play pool&quot;, I dont care about theirs. You admit that you are having fun in your own niche in the game bro. Can you not see this is a HUGE thing? Look at the Uber people leaving. Gates sucks for them, know why? ITS FROAKIN HARD! They want it all to be gravy too. Half of em wanna ride along eating popcorn watching Baywatch, then hail the pp and say &quot;Cool, flagged for Fire now&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yeah, the game had flaws. Many of them glaring. But you read that last line of your post over and over, Iz. THATS what its all about, period.</div></div><hr />

Using your numbers:<br />
48 servers * 2500 raiders = 120K raiders in EQ.<br />
Last known count of accounts: 400K<br />
120/400 = raiders are 30% of the total paying accounts.<br />
<br />
So either raiders are a distinct minority, or the number of accounts in EQ has shrunk significantly to where 120K accounts makes up the majority of the accounts.  Again, this is using your own anecdotal numbers.<br />
<br />
You make this too easy.<br />
<br />
Edit: Switched to 48 servers from 32 and redid the math to be consistent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u217"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p217">Wrong, Gates has upgrades. Fabled mobs drop upgrades. You just refulse to acknowledge them, and the reason is . . .?<br />
<br />
Did I not just post that I will not reward poor design by throwing good money after bad to buy Gates?  <br />
<br />
Easy test to see if we buy any more EQ expansions (write this down):<br />
Does the expansion rely on flagged content to separate the playerbase?<br />
If the answer to that is yes, we will not buy the expansion.  And yes, this means we most likely won't be buying any more expansions.  This isn't spite, it's simply making an informed choice as a consumer how to spend disposable income.<br />
<br />
And of course, the Fabled mobs. Friend of mine in a completely non-raiding guild, lvl 64 in fact, just got himself a Fabled Mith BP. Thing is awesome.<br />
Note the LDoN bp in my magelo on my sk.  I would not consider that an upgrade.  I did a quick search on fabled stuff and the ratios on some of the weapons are very nice, but they're not well-rounded in other categories like AC, hps, mana, stats, resists.  I could see getting one for the 4 times a year where I am not the tank for my crew.<br />
<br />
Don't worry Iz, I give you good deal, you just keep farming that pp in some trivial worthless zone, no one goes to, k?<br />
<br />
Quote me and don't put words in my mouth.  You have a bad habit of doing this.  We earn our plat via E*verTrade as well as selling drops we can't use out of PoP and hard LDoNs.  Farming plat is boring and unproductive, hence we don't spend any time doing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Of the available choices, Iz, the only decent one I see is Instanced zones containing NO-DROP upgraded gear for the casual players.<br />
<br />
That would be the LDoN hards.  I honestly don't know what reasoning they used to make some of the named drops NO DROP and some not, very inconsistent either way.  As for tracking nameds, that doesn't exactly help us a ton because we still have to clear to the nameds which is not a given for us at all.<br />
<br />
AH HA! I get it! You WANT it tradeable and buyable and in places you don't (or can't, or won't, or refuse to) go, so YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THE WORK! You can sit back, farm pp, and buy your next big upgrade!<br />
<br />
No, the only reason I want to see an end to NO DROP as it then allows for raid gear to trickle down to non-raiders when they're through w/ it.  I'd prefer to kill for my gear, but w/o serious raiding your options are limited and you will never approach VT gear, much less anything better. And again, I don't farm pp.  Work smarter, not harder, as they say.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heck, I bet over 3/4 of my servers current active playing population is already EP flagged, so why the hell not? But then, &quot;Raiders are only 15% of the population of the game&quot; /snicker. <br />
<br />
You are seriously telling me that 75% of your server is EP flagged? I suspect you'd have a hard time backing this claim up even anecdotally.  If I zone into PoK on your server I'd better see 3/4 of the players L65 and sporting elemental gear.<br />
<br />
I concede the point that I'm in the minority as a casual who posts here.  I also readily admit that the developers are of the same mindset as you and that no change to benefit casuals is likely.  Nevertheless, I enjoy discussing the issue despite a known outcome (no change).<br />
<br />
Oh and for the record, these focus you mention are not exactly spilling over the top of the pot in EP gear either, man. But then again, since you can get the on Ornate or Player Made items, I guess it can't be THAT big a problem. Oh no, your not using those Player Made items cause they are created from items you cannot get too, right? <br />
The stats on the casual-attainable gear that have these foci are awful, player made or not.  Ornate is better but still subpar.  Look at the Gleamscale cape (Imp Healing 4) out of CD-B if you want an example.<br />
<br />
Make the seperation in your own mind. Raider. Non Raider. Here is my &quot;play pool&quot;, I dont care about theirs.<br />
That would be entirely possible if they didn't inhabit the same world as the casual player.  When our limited playing time in Tactics is interrupted for yet another RZTW farming, it does affect us unfortunately.<br />

Sigh, but you ASKED for upgrades, and you WANT them in the curent expansion, the one with upgrades for Raiders.<br />
<br />
Most of the &quot;flagging content&quot; in Gates is 1 groupable man. And seriously, once you gear up on the lower trials, I am pretty sure you would have a shot at the higher ones with the right group mix. Granted, this whole &quot;Holy Trinity&quot; thing is bad for the game, but you are basically dismissing an entire expansion, one that COULD improve your characters, both in spells, gear, and abilities, because you disagre with the companys game design? I guess I just can't follow that reasoning.</div></div><hr />

I recall reading elsewhere in this forum that the high end guilds were all recruiting despite lower numbers needed for GoD content.  The poster attributed this to severe attrition.  I won't dispute that more people are starting to move towards raid philosophies, it's part of the game design, but I doubt the numbers you posted are accurate, maybe they are on your server /shrug.<br />

I don't know why people are getting hostile here.  One guy says he prefers to give his money to SoE, the other guy doesn't.  It's just a game.

Active player base, almost man, seriously. We are up to 12 guilds EP flagged, and a bunch more on the verge. I think there are 14 guilds Sol Ro flagged at least. Do the math. Lets say they have 50 on any given moment, times 14 is 700, out of what, 1200 players total? Ok, 60%, my bad. That's average. Evenings, during prime time, I am thinking there are 12 guilds with 70+ on easily, and thats mostly EP flagged, you start factoring in the guilds that raid and arent flagged, you got a LOT of raiders Iz, a LOT.</div></div><hr />

Last I checked, your account was billed whether you logged on nightly or not.  It is 100% irrelevant if at any given time there are more raiders (who by definition play far more frequently than an equal number of casuals) on than casuals.  The only relevant figure is the number of paying accounts, not accounts online.  Online time isn't a valid measuring stick of the raider percentage of the overall population because SOE doesn't charge by the hour- it's a flat monthly fee per account.  We all pay the same amount, regardless of playstyle.<br />
<br />
Or are you saying there's only 1200 paying accounts left on your server and that of those, 700 are raiders?<br />
<br />
Or let's use your numbers vice the numbers posted by another raider a few posts up:<br />
48 servers * 700 raiders = 33.6K raiders in EQ.<br />
Last known count of accounts: 400K<br />
33.6/400 = raiders are 8.4% of the total paying accounts.  A bit of a difference from 60%, eh?<br />
<br />
Of course I don't think it's anywhere neark 400K anymore, so that assumption is false.  But it would have to be 67.2K or less total accounts across all of EQ for your assumption to be even at 51%, much less 60%.<br />
<br />
Math is fun.<br />
<br />
Edit: Switched 32 servers to 48 servers and redid math.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Um, no, I am saying that the server probably averages about 1200 logged in at any given moment, more during peak hours, less early in the day. <br />
<br />
Can't really argue with you anymore Iz. You say one thing, yet you actually act in a completely comtrary manner. Thats called being a hypocrite bud. EQ will never model itself to YOUR specific playstyle, nor should it. Your upgrades are out there, right where you wanted em, on 1 groupable mobs in the next expansion. I don't wanna hear any more protest, cause everything after &quot;I didnt buy Gates . . .&quot; is totally irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

First few zones are full of this kind of stuff. Most of the drops are between LDoN Norm and LDON Hard in stats, AND have a focus (sure, maybe its small, FT1, Veng 1, etc, but its there). As you go up in zone difficulty, you get better loot. Stuff is harder. Its farther to run. There are no Graveyards. <br />
<br />
Here is a link to a loot page that has a ton of info on Gates zone drops. Note: the zones are in order, so the first 3 or 4 are the ones Casuals can hit, and the later ones are for the more advance-geared people. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u229"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p229">You say one thing, yet you actually act in a completely comtrary manner. Thats called being a hypocrite bud.<br />
My iniquities are legion, but hypocrisy isn't one of them.  Kindly quote me where I said one thing, but did the opposite (i.e. hypocrisy).  I said I would not be purchasing any more expansions with flagged content and that's what I'm doing.  I would be a total hypocrite if I said that, then went out and bought Gates for some loot upgrades potentially available in the 8 non-flagged zones out of the 16 listed.<br />
<br />
I'm perfectly willing to agree to disagree on this.  SOE patently feels as you do- there will be no non-flagged expansions ever again.  Upcoming games look to be the same.  Vanguard if anything will be even more retro EQ with brutal CR's, timesinks and other pain for the casual player.  WoW looked good until they made the mistake of hiring Furor.  Based on that decision alone, I'd say WoW will not be casual friendly at all.  Hopefully I'm proven wrong on this, but my enthusiasm for WoW is gone.  I'll quit EQ when we &quot;win&quot; (meet our goals), then just wait until people get into the high end game of WoW to see if it's a &quot;raid or quit&quot; mentality by the designers.<br />
<br />
All one can hope is that someday a future game would like my cash and the millions like me in the mass market.  None soon, however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u230"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p230">Raiding for the best gear/ability to handle the hardest content isn't a &quot;design flaw&quot; its part of the game.  If you can't handle that, this is not the game for you.<br />
<br />
Such statements speak for themselves, though I would point out that EQ used to be &quot;the game&quot; for a lot more than just your type of player. Unfortunately your intolerant solipsistic attitude is typical.<br />
<br />
If *YOU* hate raiding, then don't raid.  Don't act like you're part of some vast majority that should be catered to, shut up and play the game the way you want to, with the merits and flaws that go along with that play style....<br />
<br />
You make a common mistake here. Raiding in EQ is not monolithic. Raiding does, however, by its nature encourage full-time raiders to be monolithic. I think that's the cause of confusion. Anyway, with 5 years of content currently live, EQ has a wide variety of activities which collectively fall under the somewhat loose term &quot;raids&quot;. Similarly, EQ has a wide variety of players. Your survey, like most, is colored by your prejudices. Is someone who has raided once in the past month (in a public raid no less) a &quot;raider&quot;? Ask any self-proclaimed raider and, after he stops laughing, he'll say &quot;um, no dude&quot; - as well he should.<br />
<br />
Some people pursue the current, linear (read: flag-based) raid content so they can continue playing with friends. Some do so just to keep up in general. Some do because they want to see new things. Some do it for the loot. Some because they're bored. Some because EQ is their only social outlet and they don't want to lose it. The list goes on. You say to not &quot;act like you're part of some vast majority that should be catered to&quot;. Fine; you do the same.<br />
<br />
Here's a thought experiment for those who can manage it: Imagine that all the loot (meaning instantly-usable items, not quest/tradeskill/lore items) from every raid encounter stopped dropping tomorrow. How many people would still raid as, shall we say, vigorously as do now? Let's go further. Suppose that loot was still available, but now it was on raid encounters in the form of quest/tradeskill items that are collected and turned in for said loot. How many would raid then? One more supposition. Let's say that the raid encounters drop no loot, but the loot is still available via quests/tradeskills that are not in any way restricted by raiding (i.e. no drops or forages from zones flagged by a raid encounter). How many then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u231"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p231">I ran the numbers out of curiosity.  Some assumptions:<br />
- average of 400k players throughout EQ's history (probably less than this)<br />
- all players pay for EQ monthly (for maximum revenue)<br />
- each EQ expansion averages $30 as they keep releasing bundled packs which lower the aggregate cost for new players<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard:<br />
Diablo 2: 4 million X $50 ea. = $200,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 expansion: 2.5 million X $30 = $75,000,000<br />
Diablo 2 revenue: $275M<br />
<br />
SOE/Verant:<br />
Monthly subscription revenue<br />
400k subscribers X $13 X 60 months = $312,000,000<br />
<br />
Expansions revenue<br />
400k subscribers X 8 expansions X $30 = $96,000,000<br />
EQ revenue: $408M<br />
<br />
Clearly SOE/Verant have destroyed Blizzard in sales and revenue, despite the fact that Blizzard holds back to back to back sales records on the launches of their titles.<br />
<br />
But then again, perhaps you've heard of the Warcraft/Starcraft series? I think they may have moved a few units as well...<br />
<br />
Bottom line: SOE has nothing to worry about from such an inexperienced game developer.<br />
<br />
Well, Yeah, Other Than Diablo 1 and 2 plus their expansions, Starcraft plus its expansion, Warcraft 1, 2 and 3 plus their expansions all and each one of them have been getting excellent reviews from everyone, and breaking records in sales, Blizzard is an inexperienced game developer.<br />
(I can compare their games to SoE's game because you were comparing their revenue. If we can compare sales, that means that we can compare products)<br />
<br />
You compared the whole history of EQ to 1 blizzard title and EQ came on top, is that a surprise? is that even relevant? Diablo is not an MMORPG and yet I would bet money on it, that the diablo line combined and alone has grossed more than EQ in its entirety in the first year of the release of each title of the series. Even if that is not true add the rest of their products and it is not a competition, it is a slaughter.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is: Your bottom line is unfounded and simplistic</div></div><hr />

Circuits, sorry if my sarcasm didn't come through.  I agree with you 100%, that was the point of the comparison.  Blizzard was and is a force to be reckoned with in the gaming community and SOE ignores their upcoming competition at their peril.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u233"><b>circuits</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p233">Jeez I can't do anything right today can I?<br />
<br />
I am the one that needs to apologize. I try to read posts prior and following a message before I comment on it, however on a thread this big it is hard to keep track sometimes.<br />
<br />
Sarcasm is not lost on me, I appreciatte a good sarcasm even at my expence :D<br />
<br />
I guess I took your post out of context, but on the other hand disagreement is what fuels conversation, and that is why this post is ultimately boring, we agree, and that is that.... :D</div></div><hr />

These numbers can't be used to compare inexperience or experience.  I don't even know why Iz was saying what he did.<br />
<br />
These numbers originally came up to compare how successful games are that cater to single player styles.  However, the true draw of a pay to play game is that this goes directly to the company.  You don't have publishers (well you migth depending on contracts) and vendors taking a cut.  Most game developers get very little of that 50 dollar price tag at the stores.  Blizzard gets a good deal more than most other companies but their games often cost more too.<br />
<br />
Of course operating a 24/7 game with customer support and servers is quite an undertaking for any company to undertake.  Still the money to be had is phenomenal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing your forgetting here is that people do things every day in this game that are NOT that fun. Is the 50th LDoN mission in Takish really that fun? Is farming those Velium Houndfurs so you can try your 7th shawl combine for the 3rd time fun? Its a balance. I am QUITE sure that people would still kill the Gods once or twice, just for the sake of saying &quot;We did it&quot;, even if there was no reward (loot, flag, whatever). But we can take your &quot;experiment&quot; one step further. Would people still do LDoN runs if they dindt get points and loot didnt drop in there? Would people continuosly make those Unsealed Poison Vials if they didnt get Pottery skillups? <br />
<br />
People invest their time in this game for numerous reasons, but one big reason, and quite probably the most common reason, is to &quot;get stuff&quot;. Therfore, whatever the game dictates we need to do to aquire such stuff, we will probably do it. If you told me I had to hail every NPC in every city to get an Uber Bracer of Pepperoni, I would be on my way to Freeport right now. 'Cause once I put on that bracer, the rest kinda just disintigrates in my mind. Let me try to explain it using my own gear as an example.<br />
<br />
I have an 8th Shawl. I decided it was a cool thing to go for. Once I got it, the hours and hours of tradeskilling, farming, etc etc seemed meaningless. I had the shawl. I could point to it and say &quot;I did that&quot;. <br />
<br />
I have a BP off Aten. I worked hard. I keyed up. I helped my mates key up. I raided to earn points. And when I had enough, and one dropped, I bid. Now I have it, and I am SO glad I put the time into it. Never mind the 20+ hours it took me to get my ME shard. Means nothing now. I have the BP.<br />
<br />
I have LDoN legs. I decided that my chances to get EP legs really werent that good, since I dont raid on some &quot;4 hours a day, 365 days a year&quot; schedule, and I never got any legs out of VT (only 1 or 2 decent ones there for shaman anyway, and tanks love them too). So I decided to get LDoN legs. I also decided that I probably wouldnt be able to buy the TOP ones, and still buy good augs etc, so I went for the 760 ones. Also have a Bracer from LDoN. Have earned a few augs to stick in them. Am slowly gaining points to buy more augs.<br />
<br />
The point I am trying to make is that all these things were MY decisions. I decided to quest. I decided to raid. I decided to do LDoN. I decided to farm Nadox for a week solid to earn enough to buy Quies. I decided to to join a mid-level guild, instead of a &quot;hardcore cutting edge&quot; one. Was all this &quot;fun&quot;? DAMN TOOTING it was. The hours camping, the hours farming, the hours raiding, the hours walking through LDoN tunnels casting Tears, VP and Quies over and over, the hours clicking the &quot;combine&quot; button, all that is part of the package. <br />
<br />
But in the end, my goals were achieved. I had the items I wanted. That makes it all worthwhile to me.</div></div><hr />

I know you're being facetious - but duuhh.<br />

It's like when they asked the Newton guy why he robbed banks, he said:<br />
<br />
&quot;Because that's where the money is.&quot;</div></div><hr />
