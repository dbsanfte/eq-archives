none, I mean flat out none of them can match the XP potential you make in SOL B. when you reach 40, yes I highly recomend you go to these other places people recomend, BUT when you have fought there for a few blue bubs, and see how it goes, then move to SOLB, pre 45 do the window/pool room and however much more you can, then after move in to bats and bugs. The XP flies, and I would say that unless you get an unlucky pull it is very safe, and even if you get an unlucky pull (if you have enough HP to take the beating while you run) you are going to be close to a zone line.<br />
<br />
this is the jewel of EQ folks, if you want to get up quickly, go here.<br />
<br />
bring a friend to make it go even quicker.</div></div><hr />

I want to add that this zone is 5 years old ... so its very boring.  If your a mindless lvl'er and dont care much for content Sol B is the place for ya!<br />
<br />
There are a few casters and most stuff runs (lava beetles are dumb) but its a very soft zone and the 25% &lt;I have heard&gt; mod is very nice.<br />
<br />
Anyway get out of my zone until I am done with it!</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the info...I have been playing in Echo for a couple of nights, and the exp is pretty good...always nice to have more than one spot to lvl up, regardless of how boring it is  :cool: <br />
<br />
More importantly, if there is a better chance of getting some decent camps without waiting, I am there. I will try to get there tonight and give y'all a report.</div></div><hr />
