<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wampaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild has recently changed ToV faction and I was wondering the best way to raise giant faction to do armor quest. I got mostly ss armor but i still have to do legs. Ive been hunting in SS which is pretty easy and kind of fun. I spent like 4 hours in there and giants still scowl. Is there a better zone or mob to kill? I was thinking about killing dwarves, but didnt want to ruin thurg faction unless necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It'll go slowly.  That's expected.  The higher level mobs you can kill the better.  Dwarves in Icewell Keep are ideal.  Especially the royals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">ww dragons, WTOV trash, SS hunting, kill tons and tons of greenie coldain for heads in Great Divide, kill the few dark blue (at 60 at least) dwarves in the mines in Great Divide. Those guys are great exp. Kill royals in icewell keep, tag along for yelinak/dain kills. Took me about a month to get non kos with Tmax, riff/zek only takes about 1 1/2 weeks to get to ally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go to GD, bring your chanter and wizzie friends and AOE the wolves and wolfmasters until you get to dubious - then just buy/farm heads....<br />
<br />
i got from max scowling to dubious in maybe 3 hours of AOE...then i turned in maybe 40 heads for ally...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Killing dragons in WW will get you non-KOS with zek giants pretty quickly.  From there, I would go to the dorf camp farthest south in EW and repeatedly flatten that camp.  If you are not yet 61, you can prolly make some decent exp out of it and get a ton of heads + riff faction.  You can even get the books off of the missionaries for some decent quest rewards if you stay there long enough.<br />
<br />
Killing Royals and Dain in Icewell is by far the fastest way to faction max and riff and very worth it timewise if you can get a decent group together.</div></div><hr />
