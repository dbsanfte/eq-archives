<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ZzeldaAkuti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.. well its been awhile since i last posted about this well i think 2weeks lol :P but was curious anyone have any suggestions to plvl at? i usually keep em ungrouped and i ch with my druid and ds/regen my ranger.. i've been at neriak killing guards but now exp is horrible there at 53 and its perma camped now by this monk and a warrior/cleric so i cant go there..<br />
<br />
I tried the grey pulling golems and snakes for an hour but the life of them doesnt really match the exp they give.. I'm fresh out of ideas heh.. hole is horrible.. kc/velks is horrible cause of crowds and jaggedpine is horrible cause theres 10druids/20rangers killing everythin in the zone at a time lol.. thanks for your help.. also the druid always has c3 since on my ranger account i have a 60ench to feed it to the druid.. thanks all for your help plz give input :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crimsonsun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">could always do HHK nobles. I can solo them harmony pulling (as long as i have c3) its not pretty and i have to burn about 40% mana healing myself, but its about 1 - 1 1/2 normal exp at my level. With a heal, you'd be all set :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like i'm in the same situation, except i'm using a lvl59 shamen.  I tried the Grey also and the xp was poor.  Velks is always overcrowded and I have yet to try KC.  One thing I've heard is try Fungus Grove.  A lvl 60 should be able to do single pulls there (at least I've been told).<br />
<br />
What is the XP (% wise) on the HHK nobles?</div></div><hr />
