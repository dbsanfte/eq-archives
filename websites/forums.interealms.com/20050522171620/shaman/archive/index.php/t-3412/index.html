<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am the proud owner of a Rubicite Breastplate.<br />
<br />
It cost me my iksar ceremonial chestplate, clay guardian shield, crystal covered shroud and 1kpp, and it was worth every penny :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a gentleman on Luclin server selling a FULL set of visible Rubicite.  Kinda funny seeing all the new players asking about it...basically their comments were:<br />
<br />
What's rubicite aura?  Those stats SUCK!  Why would anyone buy this?<br />
<br />
He was asking 20k for all of it.  I think its a hell of a deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep, I know what you mean.<br />
<br />
The guy selling it was &quot;taking best offers&quot;. I offered everything i had lying around in my bank, thinking he would want more. A lot of the replys in the auction channel were rubi suck etc as well.<br />
<br />
The BP is the same stats as the iksar regen tunic (maybe one less hp/tick), but it is RUBICITE :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My friend just paid 18k for the BP.  Ridiculous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've seen alot of &quot;ubers&quot; on Rodcet Nife auctioning to buy this, figured maybe they have new focus 3 effects on test or something.</div></div><hr />

Gah!  It's RUBICITE.  It looks red.  'nuff said.<br />
<br />
Oh, by the way. *DING*.  Post number 500!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It has a pretty unique, reddish look to it.. it stopped dropping a long time ago, except for a short period - a week or so - (I forget what it was for), when it was dropping in Najena.  People want it for the looks though.. the stats suck :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's &quot;just&quot; the 3hp per tick. But back in the day, it was the only hp regeneration item. It was the dogs nadgers! Bright red plate (so everyone knows you've got one! Nothing else looked like it). The stats were pretty good then too. Uber j00 noo8! ;p<br />
<br />
Then it stopped dropping, it acquires a nostalga value, especially to those who've been playing the longest (i.e. the ones with the most money).<br />
<br />
Never owned one, so some of that's just hearsay, but there you go.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The people who want it = Old, Old players who remember when it was the shiznat.<br />
Those people are usually the ones with *tons* of plat laying around since they have been playing for years.<br />
<br />
nostalgia + lots of plat &gt; cruddy stats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Respectable, thanks for the info. <br />

*definitely wants to romp around in red plate metal*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Basically Rubicite was around before class quest armor.  If you wanted to upgrade from bronze rubicite was one of your options.  <br />
<br />
I have turned down many insane offers for my BP.  But in my old school opinion you just don't trade a rubicite bp.  It's more than rare, it doesn't drop anymore.  I'm lucky to have a cloak, helm, pauldron and two bracers as well.  <br />

<br />
Worse, it was THE option. Remember, it was the time when banded was hot ****... Before smithed armor, before planar, before even totemic and the rest of the crafted bunch. There was SOME random pieces of visible armor here and there (barbed sleeves and leggings, brigandine, skull shaped barbute and the likes), but the only things that were even remotly like a full suits of armor were just rubicite, blackened iron and maybe mithril.<br />
<br />
None of which you would even throw to a twink nowaday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Khall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rubi Bp is double your base regen, If i recall right.<br />
<br />
Which means, if you're base is 2hp per tick sitting you'll get 4.<br />
<br />
At higher levels tho, the value of the bp becomes apparent.<br />
<br />
If you regen 8 or 9 per tick sitting, you'll get around 16-18 per tick etc.<br />
<br />
That's why the rubi sells for a lot. It's basically a fungi at higher levels that looks good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Rubi is 3 hp/tic as already stated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">New Rubi drops in Cazic Thule and it looks pretty damned hot on an Iksar shaman. I'm working on getting myself a full visible set of this (helm, bracer, arms, chest, legs, boots). I've seen the arms dropped (passed on roll), the legs drop (passed on roll four times), the helm drop (won second roll), the bracer drop (won second roll).... <br />
<br />
Anybody know what drops the new Rubi bits? <br />
<br />
Tae Ew Hunter (maze) - Legs<br />
Quivering or Gyrating mass (slime tunnel) - Bracer<br />
Something (maze) - Arms<br />
Quivering or Gyrating Mass (slime tunnel) - Coif<br />
<br />
BP? Is there a chain rubi bp that drops in CT now? I've seen a jungle spider carapace drop in the maze... and it really looks like part of the set, but it lacks the magic work &quot;rubicite&quot; in the name.<br />
<br />
Boots? Are there rubicite boots?<br />
<br />
Oh and these are some SWEET shoulders: http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=11432</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The rubicite breastplate that i am talking about does not drop anymore, and hasn't for about 2 years or so, ever since they took rubi out of CT because of all the camping, ksing.<br />
<br />
It is a chain BP with a red plate graphic, and there are also rubi bits for every visible slot. The stats are marginally better than banded, with the BP having 3hp/tick regen.<br />
<br />
Considering that i traded a tunic with equiv stats and 1k for the BP, i think i did well on the deal. I wouldn't sell mine now, even if you offered me a fungi for it :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Aye old, rare, items are good.  People like me that remember em want em for just that, if I saw a rubi bp for 20k or so, I'd grab it...my plats just rotting in my bank, nothing for me to do with it hehe.  A few weeks ago I got my monk a Runed Fighters Staff, sure it may not be the best staff in the game anymore with the high dly dmg bonuses and stuff, but in its day it rocked!  Plus, if all my sources are correct, its one of only 3 left on server.</div></div><hr />
