Besides the quick regen to heal from melee at lower levels, the fungi will help regen mana super fast at 24 when you get cannibalize.<br />
<br />
... You will level faster doing this than buying anything else . . . unless you're constantly being PL'd even then it's still a good choice. I wore my fungi until I got 60 and just recently replaced it with a vindicator BP ;D (thanks guild!)</div></div><hr />
