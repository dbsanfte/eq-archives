<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Went there tonight for a little xp/loot.  Maybe I never noticed before, but the casters are a little more varied in their spells now.  Worst was the bone ritualist.  They try to fear quite a bit, so load up MR when you go down.  A LOT more of their spells were landing than I remember, and I have been going down here quite a bit again in the last couple weeks.  Bone Depradators tried to fear, too.<br />
<br />
Just a warning.  They seemed a little tougher tonight.  Earth Seers used to just malo you and then use the poison rain spell.  They were trying Pox and Bane of Nife, as well.  I remember them casting Pox, but BoN seems new.<br />
<br />
Also, a &quot;Carved Wooden Mask&quot; dropped quite a bit.  Maybe it's for the Tasks?  I don't remember this before.  Drop rates on salts and skins seemed higher, too.  Got one cave lord sash (makes 2, now).  Stupid slaves reset a couple months ago, so I believe I have enough in the guild to free them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I haven't been back to Droga in about a month.  It was at that time when I noticed a slight, unannounced change to Droga.  Fewer mobs were dropping the 15-20pp and I was only getting 2%-ish AA for killing mobs at the Ice Master Cialin camp versus 3-4% I had been getting.  The fights seemed a bit tougher as well.  It has been easier to root-rot golems in PoV for 5% and I haven't needed the loot really, so I gave up on Droga.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I remember getting BoN'd down there (whoo that sounds bad!) half a year or so ago, but it was down in the jailer area.  They might have changed caster AI a couple times since then, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Droga is definitely a zone heavily involved with the tasks that come from Overthere.<br />
<br />
I didn't find it to be overly difficult, and the aggro radius on the mobs is absolutely miniscule.  Buff up some resists and go to town I say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did a task last night ( it was not worth it in my opinion; could have spent my time xp'ing :( ), and I too noticed that the spells were landing a lot more.  The wizards were nuking me for 1/2 damage a lot.  Prior to patch I would xp with my Rogue in Droga, and I never had the mobs successfully cast on me like they did last night.<br />
<br />
I got a few masks, and yes, it seems that the salt dropped a lot.  I ended up getting 5 of them to drop when I was working on the task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The reason they are actually casting good spells is because yesterday they added NPC Usefullness categories to spells.<br />
<br />
This allows their AI to pick which spells are the most useful to casts.<br />
<br />
You can see the changes on Lucy if you want to see them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That explains it.  Anyway, for those that haven't been there lately, load up the resists, because these guys are a tad nastier (casters) than before.  My SK runs about 8k with self and shaman buffs, and he was about 20% after a fight with the necro gobbie.  The sucker landed about 4 spells at once on him.</div></div><hr />

Yeah wanted to finish an aug for my pally and ranger so was doing a few LDON's and chanter mob was casting ALOT Of the trepidation spell and the sk's/nec were fearing. Chanter mob were casting alot more charms and the gates mez spell. Noticed the same stuff in drogna as was already mentioned doing my one task. <br />
<br />
Only spell i wish the chanter mobs would stop casting is the damn recant magic or whichever is their higher nullify magic spell. Anoying losing that many buffs at once if i dont catch it with my pallies stun lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have spent a lot if time in Droga. Had nto been there in about 2 months though. After reading this post I thought that i would go check it out &amp; do a little farming. I did my usual camp rotation. King, Flame Master, Ice, savage Spider. I definately noticed that it was a little tougher. The PH for the Flame Master seemed a bit tougher &amp; The PH&amp; Ice were both tougher...dispelled a ton of my buffs. Still very trivial self buffed but the dificulty was much harder.<br />
<br />
thanks for the info about pet pulling. I was able to do different camps. Pet pulling rocks...it is much easier to do the Flamemaster camp &amp; the other Named (forget his name) jsut off the Dinning room with a pet...extra dps &amp; you can do both with the same pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gotta love how mobs have access to spells lots of players of the level don't have access to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Droga still seemed rather easy last time I checked it out. For a shaman the easiest mobs to kill are rogue and warrior mobs. Caster mobs I tend to avoid as they like to dispell buffs..</div></div><hr />
