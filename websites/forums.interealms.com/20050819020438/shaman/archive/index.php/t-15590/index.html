<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever since I found out about Rabid bear I had thought &quot;wow thats an awesome idea, a wussy caster temporarily becoming a badass melee that does huge damage.&quot; Just like the Hulk! I wanted to be in an exp group and get hit by a brann militis and say &quot;you wont like me when I'm angry!&quot; and then just hit that button and floor all the rogues, wizards, and rangers in the room with my damage!<br />

Shaman everywhere mock the AA ability... Sony themselves mock the ability, and your AA points are better spent in alchemy mastery or innate charisma.<br />
<br />
I realise this would never happen, because Sony would rather eat one of their own limbs than make a progressive change in everquest without putting a &quot;Forbidden Dungeons of Sushi&quot; label and a $50 charge on it. But I'm here to propose my ideal changes to Rabid Bear. In essence...<br />
<br />
RABID BEAR 2.0!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Rabid Bear<br />
<br />
Description:<br />
<br />
Reuse time: 8:00:00<br />
<br />
Requirements: level 59. Must spend 12 ability points in the Archtype Abilities. This ability turns you into a Rabid Bear, boosting all of your offensive capabilities. Lasts 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
Statistics:<br />
<br />
AA cost 3/6/9<br />
<br />
level 1: 20% haste above haste cap, +150 atk<br />
level 2: 30% haste above haste cap, +250 atk and double-attack.<br />
level 3: 45% haste above haste cap, +400 atk, double-attack, and weapon damage bonus equivalent to that of equal level warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Notes:<br />
This makes it so, at the expense of 18 aa points a shaman can essentially put out the DPS of a rogue without backstab for 5 minutes every 8 hours.<br />
<br />
Hastened Rabidity would be removed. For the sake of DPS melee classes who might feel threatened by Rabid Bear *cough*rangers*cough*, this ability would have a very long reuse time (the aformentioned 8 hours) and thus would be usable at most 3 times every real life day, typically no more than once in a raid. Instead it is replaced with this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral Rabidity<br />
<br />
Description<br />
<br />
This is a passive ability; it does not need to be activated.<br />
<br />
Requirements: Rabid Bear at level 3. This further improves your offensive capabilities when using Rabid Bear.<br />
<br />
Statistics<br />
<br />
AA cost: 3/6/9<br />
<br />
level 1: Adds a chance to score crippling blows while in Rabid Bear form.<br />
level 2: Adds a proc, 'maul' to all attacks while in Rabid Bear form. Proc information: 200 dd, magic based reistance check at -500 (lure).<br />
level 3: Increases chance to proc maul substantially, and gives a small chance to score a critical proc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well that's what I would like to see for Rabid bear. I think it would be awesome to, for 5 minutes, become a very very powerful meleer... a force to be reckoned with. And for 36 AA points and to be able to only use it every 8 hours I really see no imbalance with these changes. But like I said, there is no way in hell that Sony will ever do this. *shrug* I had my fun in writing this thread just imagining heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">it would still be useless with a 8 hour recast<br />
<br />
rabid bear as it is is really not that bad but the recast is too long for how long it lasts, cut the recast down to 30 minutes or less and it'd be nice</div></div><hr />

I'd prefer for Rabid Bear to be removed and replaced by unresistable DoT that does 500, 1000 , 2000 damage per tic depending on the level of AA for 4 tics every 72 minutes. The cost would be 3/6/9 AAs to buy the ability and allow us to do our Shamanistic duties during the fights.</div></div><hr />

doesnt that seem a little umm extreme?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Rabid bear with a 12 min reuse would be OK.  But still just a toy with weapon skill cap at 200 no amount of attack is going to make us damage kings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Idealistic! And certainly better ideas than what SoE has so far done to rabid bear. Please...change this joke aa!. Make hasted rapidity DESIRABLE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Change rapid bear's reuse time to 30 minutes, and then it would be more interesting to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i think they should have gave us a skill of max duel weild + double atk that would hav e made our dps output alot greater then using a single weapon   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would be happy if they changed the reuse time on rabid bear to 30 minutes.  It would still be just a toy, but it might be a toy I would want to play with.  As it is now, it's something that I'll spend points on shortly after my lobotomy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For what it's worth Penny, I'd buy your Rabid bear. Course, this is coming from someone who's closing in on 100aa's and still hasn't bought MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still think the final revamp idea I came up with was pretty solid all round (If you think of it as having the same duration/reuse time as the mage elemental forms, IE you can keep it up full time as long as you don't get dispelled too much).  Its fairly heftily buffed over regular rabid bear, but it also has a number of limitations to counteract this.<br />

One thing I was thinking about though.  In many raid settings shaman pets are simply not viable, so how about enhancing rabid bear but making it simply not work when you have a pet up?  This gives us a little more variety in how we can do damage, plus it adds to its usefulness as a 'when the chips are down ability' without making it overpowering.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This is an interesting idea, as was the ideas that Sebazy came up with.<br />
<br />
The important point to realize is that rabid bear is useless as it stands, and an overwhelming majority of shamans think so: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=15165&amp;highlight=Rabid+Bear<br />
<br />
When LoY came out, shamans boycotted it until our spells were fixed.  Given that other classes have had their AA's fixed, I think that it is not unreasonable to ask for an adjustment to RB.  I say boycott LDoN until rabid bear is fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For what it's worth, I grouped in droga last night, and a rogue had a realtime dps parser.  When I was playing around with rabid bear, I was achieving maybe 30-50 dps (really streaky though) with a 33/30.  A 65 SK with a 1hs 28/25 was achieving 75 dps roughly.  A 55ish rogue was achieving 70 dps.  A 55ish ranger was achieving 55 dps.<br />
<br />
Not that great, but it was ok.. and fun nonetheless-- expect to be a lot less inefficient and less effective when you use it, unless you're an uber with Staff of Eternal Flames or something.<br />
<br />
If you want real dps, Blood of Saryrn already gives you 47-48 dps by itself, but you'll get agro.  Tears of Saryrn will give you anywhere between zero to 289 dps-- note that if you even just hit something twice with Tears of Saryrn, you're already beating the Blood of Saryrn dps and getting less agro.<br />
<br />
But since it's hard to Tears a mob while engaging in melee (it's possible-- target a friend on the other side near to the mob and rain him), you can Blood of Saryrn then rabid bear, achieving maybe 77-98 dps while getting beaten up.<br />
<br />
My suggestion for defensive Rabid Bear is maybe give us 75 parry 75 riposte 75 block and make that rabid bear proc into a lifetap dot (so that our dps isn't that great, but we become more defensive in the case of an emergency).  Instead of 50 CR maybe have 25 resists across the board.<br />
<br />
Or maybe an offensive Rabid Bear-- increase our 1hb, 2hb, piercing, and hand to hand to 225.  Also 150 dual wield if you're wielding nothing in both hands.  Maybe make it really strong meleewise, but it will double your mana costs (or lengthen spellcasting time) whenever you cast stuff.  Then make refresh time a lot smaller.  Or maybe increase our offense somehow and lower our defense (like D&amp;D berserker rage)-- put us under the effects of torpor for 30 seconds after rabid bear is gone.<br />
<br />
------<br />
<br />
Calculations<br />
<br />
Blood of Saryrn<br />
casting time 5.7 seconds<br />
duration 42-48 seconds<br />
damage 2240-2560<br />
Including casting time it's 47-48 dps<br />
<br />
Tears of Saryrns<br />
casting time 6 seconds<br />
recast time 12 seconds<br />
damage 0, 650, 1300, 1950, 2600, 3250, 3900, 4550, 5200 (depending on resists and crits and number of targets)<br />
Including casting time and recast time it's 0, 36, 72, 108, 144, 180, 217, 253, 289 dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh yea-- get rid of the weapon delay after casting a spell, so that while you're in rabid bear form, you'll be acting like a hybrid rather than a caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The fact that we have a thread like this on our boards every week and SOE hasnt done crap about it is just proof that SOE and devs never come to this board they dont play shm hate us and love to nerf us cause we too &quot;uber&quot; and overpowered</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Right, they hate shamans because shamans abused them as children.  Err, wait.  They MADE the shaman class, there's no &quot;hate,&quot; that's just silly.<br />
<br />
So it's a useless ability.  I'll spend my points on something else until/unless it's replaced.  Maybe I'll /feedback a better idea if I get one.  I'll spend the rest of the time I save making little tinfoil hats for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">No you're wrong SOE didn't make the shm class verant did SOE just bought it <br />
