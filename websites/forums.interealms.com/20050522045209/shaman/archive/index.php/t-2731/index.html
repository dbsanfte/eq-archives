<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I admit it, I am an HoS addict.  I like running around with a 159 of 190 weight allowance.  <br />
<br />
I also admit I thought the original Rage line was far superior to the gimped version they &quot;redesigned&quot; when they broke the original spell.  Now that they have made Rage NOT stack with HoS,  I think they should give us the original line back.  <br />
<br />
Sure the AC of the new line is welcome, but boy there was nothing like the feeling of getting into a no win situation, and casting one of the Rage spells.  <br />
<br />
Granted the first line wasn't perfect, and it was extremely situational.<br />
<br />
The new rage line is just a pain in the arse.  That forever long recast, and then they put in that silly 20 second recover time.  There is NO reason for there to be a recover time on that spell.  It aint that good.  Then they make it last like 15 minutes.  It is annoying, and nothing more.<br />
<br />
It is strange, I am a huge fan of Verant.  I am a huge fan of &quot;The Vision&quot;.  I am a software developer, I have a tremendous amount of respect for everything EQ.  This one spell change is really about the only place I diverge from this feeling.  They made some new spells that drained a casters mana, and wrote code that indicated caused the spell to end when mana dropped to zero.  This BROKE the rage line.  Then instead of fixing the new spells, they declared that Rage wasn't implemented correctly.  This even though the guy who originally designed the Rage line of spells, all spells for that matter, said it was working absolutely correctly.  They made all kinds of statements like &quot;well if the spell has no mana to consume, it has to end&quot;...Well I guess they didn't feel the consumption of all regened mana was enough to feed the spell.  IMO they clearly decided to scrap a spell line that was working as originally designed, because it was easier than correcting a bug introduced by a new spell line.<br />
<br />
The net result is I now have an annoying spell I hate and never cast, in return for a spell that while it was only occasionally useful, was SO much fun to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gimme back my melee buffs and regen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The rage change went hand in hand with the Torpor change.<br />
<br />
I'll take that trade any day of the week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I like VoB, but the only time I ever cast it is right before I run through SG (I hate those see invis sea horses and want every buff before going through).<br />
<br />
Short duration, 30 second no cast time, not worth it for me in typical exp camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">vob stacks with focus, so the problem isn't the spell line, it's the fact that VI never bothered to fix rage the same way they fixed vob to stack.  Someday they may notice it, same as the effect on the 8th cudgel not stacking with ANYTHING.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Havanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I was just wondering, what was the Torpor change? Just curious, I'm new to the class.</div></div><hr />
