<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Everyone always gets a little wound up before the launch of a new expansion, but it's getting a little out of hand around here.<br />
<br />
Don't tell people to commit suicide, don't call them idiots for having a difference of opinion, don't abuse the profanity rules.  We have a good community, a lot of knowledge is shared here, a lot of friendships have been made here - help keep it a place that people want to visit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Agreed.  I don't want to see this place turn into the SK forums.<br />
<br />
Love and peace, everyone!  It's just a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got a couple PMs today about people who others thought should be suspended.  I just wanted to let you all know I stepped down as moderator last week, so send your messages to Gloriana or Tulkor or Sunmoon.  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I understand your reasons Henora.  Extreamly proud of you.  I wrote a very nasty letter to sunmoon myself, yet never pressed the send key.  In the end I just realized that some things are inevitable.  No matter what what online game we play they will always have people selling items and characters.  If they want to pay for our bandwidth then fine.  I looked at every other EQ fan site and only found two without these despicable Ads.  Those being Eqatlas and Allakhazams.  Sadly Sony will never take action against such piece of **** companies since it keeps people playing thier game.  I cant speak for every one here, but we'd love to have you back as a moderator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">well thanks Ceno.  <br />
<br />
I hope people can keep in mind that the people (like Gloriana) who do the day to day work to keep the crucible going don't get paid for it.  They don't get anything besides grief, too much moderation or not enough... you can't please everyone, no matter how hard you try!  It's a truely thankless job.<br />
<br />
That being said, I still appreciate being given the opportunity to help manage our class site.  I feel like I did my best and made this a better place when I could.   If anyone wants to discuss anything regarding my former moderator stuff, feel free to PM me.  I have no ill will towards anyone about the decisions made and no desire to discuss it further publically.  :)<br />

PS - Ceno, you're still a bastard!  ;)  /tease</div></div><hr />

on another note, good point glori</div></div><hr />

Awww... that's too bad, you were always a pretty good mod I thought.  Are they looking to add anyone new (not that I'm volunteering), but with all the pre-GoD hubbub, things look like they could use some more assistance.</div></div><hr />

Careful now, that would be the druid forum ;)</div></div><hr />
