<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks :) We try to help in ways we can.  I wish it could be more sometimes.  We also will be doing the AIDS walk as well.  Another very serious issue.  A heated topic since I was very angry at GW Bush for cutting funding to overseas AIDS research.  Can't remember what city in Africa but British doctors doing AIDS research had found 14 or 16 prostitutes who are immune to HIV and the city they work and live in is the most infected city in the country for HIV.  It was also hereditary as 4 of the women have daughters who work as prostitutes who are immune as well.  Funny how none of this ever was reported in US news.  I saw it on a BBC news report that was part of a program on Discovery last year.  Any British or UK people in the guild who could dig up or find a link for me to that news ?  I wanted to show my friend Dean the report.  I believe if the U.S. was helping in the research it may well be the first cure or close to a cure for HIV for the world.  Since HIV is a worldwide disease.</div></div><hr />
