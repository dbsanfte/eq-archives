register and away you go, its not to hard to figure out, if I figured it anyone can</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my case, you click my name in red, to see what my HP's and equip, etc are.  If you want one of yourself, go to Magelo.com and register, creating a profile of your own.  You then enter all your skills, atributes and equip.<br />
<br />
BTW, here's the code that allows you to click through my name to show my profile, as always the []'s have been replaced with ?? so you can see what the code is.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>nygaard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks for the quick reply<br />
<br />
I can not see his page at all. The only thing I see is a lot of different code signs or else it tries to download a file so I think it is my browser that is f**ked :(<br />
<br />
regards</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When you can't see his page, it's because of your firewall. Try turning that off and try again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are using Internet Explorer try this:<br />
<br />
Click the &quot;Tools&quot; menu item, select &quot;Internet Options&quot;; Click on &quot;Advanced&quot; tab; scroll down to &quot;HTTP 1.1 Settings&quot;; make sure both &quot;Use HTTP 1.1&quot; and &quot;Use HTTP 1.1 through proxy connections&quot; are checked.<br />
<br />
Don't remember if you need to restart IE (close and open it again).  This should fix the problem you described...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The other interesting site is http://www.eqrankings.com, which sorts magelo profiles by various stats and lets you take a look at what some other people are wearing.  You can either look at the high-levels at the top of the list and dream, or find people your level and compare gear.  Nice job on that site.</div></div><hr />
