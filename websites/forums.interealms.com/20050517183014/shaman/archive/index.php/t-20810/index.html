<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What does the famous 5% slow difference between Shamans and chanters really mean.<br />
<br />
I would like to give this piece of fine work from Gardeltron a special place into the spotlight  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The general equation for damage is:<br />
<br />
X = t1*DPS + slow proportion * DPS * (T - t1)<br />
<br />
where t1 is casting delay and T is fight duration.<br />
<br />
For shamans: t = 5 sec (Malos) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 8<br />
For enchanters: t1 = 1 sec (Tash) + 6 sec (Forlorn) = 7<br />
For beastlords: t1 = 3.5 sec (Sha's Revenge)<br />
<br />
Xs: total damage for shaman<br />
Xe: total damage for enchanter<br />
Xb: total damage for beastlord<br />
<br />
Relative efficiencies are:<br />
<br />
Xe/Xs for enchanter vs shaman<br />
Xb/Xs for beastlord vs shaman<br />
<br />
When relative efficiencies are equal to 1, the two classes are equivalent. If less than one, the class being compared is better than the shaman, when it's greater than 1 the shaman is better.<br />
<br />
DPS factors out of the relative efficiency, but it changes with duration of the fight. Resists are not factored in here.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is this:<br />
<br />
Enchanter slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 22 seconds.<br />
Beastlord slow is better than shaman slow if fights last less than 37 seconds!!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I will adjust a few things.<br />
For starters I will leave the Beastlord out of this as that class is missing a MR debuff.<br />
<br />
Now we will look at 3 scenario’s<br />
<br />
1)	Both have no spellhaste and no clickies.<br />
2)	Both have no spellhaste but have clickies<br />
3)	Both have maximum spellhaste and have clickies (a situation I think would look the most natural)<br />
<br />
So lets take a look at situation 1:<br />
For shamans: t1 = 5 sec (Malos) + 2,5 sec (refresh time on spellgem) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 10.5<br />
For enchanters: t1 = 1 sec (Tash) + 2,5 sec (refresh time on spellgem) + 6 sec (Forlorn) = 9.5<br />
<br />
The battle has to last 25 seconds or longer for the shaman to be the better slower<br />
<br />
So on to situation 2<br />
<br />
For shamans: t1 = 5 sec (Malos) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 8<br />
For enchanters: t1 = 1 sec (Tash) + 3 sec (Forlorn) = 4<br />
<br />
The battle has to last 65 seconds or longer for the shaman to be the better slower<br />
<br />
Ok that is a scary number but not something one can even consider normal so we look at situation 3<br />
<br />
For shamans: t1 = 3.335 sec (Malos) + 3 sec (Turgur's) = 6.335<br />
For enchanters: t1 = 1 sec (Tash) + 3 sec (Forlorn) = 4<br />
<br />
The battle has to last 40 seconds or longer for the shaman to be the better slower<br />
<br />
As far as I understand it mitigation does not influence this at all <br />
<br />
I really hope someone with a better understanding of the math behind this is going to react and tell me where i went wrong (I did create a simple spreadsheet and did some manual calculations that gave the same times)<br />
<br />
If this really is the case than we can just stop now with this whole discussion as it is clear that the chanter is the better slower in GoD.<br />
<br />
Welcome to redundancy<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I understand it mitigation does not influence this at all  <br />
<br />
That sounds right. Mitigation should affect how much more (or less) effective one slower is versus another, but the breakeven point should be the same with or without mitigation.<br />
<br />
I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You are also using a &quot;perfect world&quot; scenario for t1.<br />
<br />
Yes, you have the cast times correct, but there is actually a bit of a delay in between each spell as you wait to be able to cast the next spell.  It's probably less than 1.5 seconds, but still, when mobs are doing 1k DPS, that can be a significant difference.<br />
<br />
I realize that you used the same thing for both Enchanter and Shaman, but that little difference would mean that the fights must last a little bit longer still for Shaman to come out on top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One can only imagine what would happen if Shamans were better healers than Clerics and Druids for the first 40ish seconds of a fight...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Blasphemy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Forgot to account for the recast delay for spellgems.   I think it is about 2.5 seconds, so that would shift the initial caluclation of shaman = enchie at 22 seconds to shaman = enchie at 24.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
  SO all of these times should be SLIGHTLY longer fights in order to have us break even with the enchies.   Of course, that just makes it worse for us ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Anjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nope.  Spell refresh time has been included above, I believe.  There is no refresh timer when you're using an item to slow the mob.  You cast Malos and can instantly slow afterwards with Turgurs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Greetings,<br />
<br />
My god, I suppose it's sad that I just realized, for the first time, that enchanter's slow stick casts in HALF the time of their spell, making it equal to our slow casting time.<br />
<br />
*** is with that?  Grrrr...I guess it's my own fault for not researching it...but...for the love of pete.<br />
<br />
If they get to cut their spell casting time in half...give us a TA that casts in 1.5 seconds.  Or better yet, leave the TA alone, and give us an item that casts malos in 2.5 seconds.  Tell me you wouldn't love that as a shaman.<br />
<br />
*sigh*<br />
<br />
Thanks for the post.  Looks like pretty good information, formally laid out.  Yes, it's under &quot;perfect&quot; conditions...but it's a controlled environment test...that's how these things work.  Just goes to show that &quot;king of slows&quot; isn't exactly applicable.<br />
<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">According to Alla's there is no item which casts Malos . . . or are you talking about the ONE item that casts Turgur's?<br />
<br />
*&amp;#$, that's a pretty huge freakin stretch to assume that EVERY Shaman has managed to get the ONE item that casts Turgur's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I realize that.  I was just stating that, since the enchanter's clicky slow stick casts their slow in half the time that their normal spell does (3 seconds versus 6, according to the information above), that it doesn't seem quite fair to me that the TA casts our slow in exactly the same time as turgur's.  So, either make the TA cast in 1.5 seconds, or better yet, introduce an item with clicky malos that casts in 2.5 seconds.  I think most shaman would be happy to de-mem malos, and have it land twice as fast.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm talking about the Time's Antithesis, the one item that casts turgur's.<br />
<br />
I'm not using this as an argument to say that a faster casting TA or a time dropped fast cast malos item would balance our class.  I didn't mean for it to sound like that.<br />
<br />
I was pulling this one tiny piece of data out of Styg's post, the fact that I JUST NOW realized that the enchie item allows them to cast their slow twice as fast, and stating that I thought it was unfair.<br />
<br />
I very definitely believe many classes, including us, need balancing, and certainly still would after a tiny item change.<br />
<br />
I don't have a TA, I never will, I wasn't suggesting to balance our class with modifications to it.  Just a speculation about itemization being a little out of whack here.<br />
<br />
I guess it just irks me to see their slow, which is already extremely close to ours, get the casting time cut in half on their item, making it that much closer to ours overall.<br />
<br />
I would love to be the king of slows/buffs/debuffs, like they keep trying to say we are.  Now, all we need is a better slow, serious buffs, some meaningful debuffs (other than malos) and for mobs to not be immune to or mitigate slow more than 50%.  I'll see you in never-never land, waiting for that to happen.<br />
<br />
Sorry to derail the thread a little Stygianna, I liked your post, this just got under my skin and I was already responding before thinking about post continuity. :-/<br />

If you don't have it (I don't...) then the 1st scenario applies to you.  If you do, then the 2nd or 3rd do.  Doesn't seem to be assuming anything.  Just read the appropriate one, and ignore the others if you like.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What I am obviously not communicating very well is that by trying to cover every single possibility we are clouding the message.<br />
<br />
Yes, it's possible that someone has an item that will cast one of the two spells for them.  It is however unlikely and frankly unimportant to the arguement.<br />
<br />
If we wish to get some action we need to be clear and concise.  Sure, there will be things that a concise synopsis doesn't cover.  The point is to get someone looking at it first, THEN get the nitty gritty details.<br />
<br />
If you don't make your point quickly you are unlikely to make it at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">As far as I understand it mitigation does not influence this at all <br />
<br />
This is correct.  I did the algebra and slow mitigation drops out.  I modeled slow mitigation as:<br />
<br />
slow proportion = 1 - slow mitigation * slow reduction<br />
<br />
If this really is the case than we can just stop now with this whole discussion as it is clear that the chanter is the better slower in GoD.<br />
<br />
It is interesting to compare scenario 1 when a shaman is using Balance of the Nihil (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4900&amp;source=Live).<br />
<br />
If Malos is cast first, the battle only needs to last 12.5 seconds before the enchanter slow prevents more damage.  On the other hand, if Malos does not need to be cast, Balance will be better than the enchanter slow unless the fight lasts longer than 58 seconds.<br />
<br />
So the bottom line is, if mobs can't be slowed alone by Balance, then you're much better off having an enchanter doing the slowing.<br />
<br />
Balance is better than Malos+Turgurs for fights lasting less than 60 seconds, even with resists (Balance has a 6 sec recast time).<br />
<br />
If the enchanter has a clicky, then Tash plus clicky slow beats Balance for fights lasting longer than 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
If you have TA, then Malos+TA slow will be better than Balance if fights last longer than 17 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bottom line 2 is, Balance is useless if either the enchanter or shaman has a Plane of Time item with slow on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Many of you know that 5% difference was discussed during the fanfaire. This 5% explanation was not ment to bring the shaman communitee into and uproar about how much this difference effects DPS.  Perhaps that answer should have been followed by the below explanation as well.<br />
<br />
From current point of view:<br />
&quot;Balance of the Nihil&quot; resolves the casting time concerns between a shaman and enchanter.<br />
<br />
As discussed above.  With a single incoming mob.<br />
An enchanter in a group will be using traditionally &quot;Tash&quot; and &quot;Forlorn Deeds.&quot;<br />
<br />
A shaman will just need &quot;Balance of the Nihil&quot; and then may cast Malos as he or she sees fit.<br />
<br />
Therefore, making the shaman and optimal choice for slow.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, 5% difference in slow, tends to make a difference in longer fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On a side note, 5% difference in slow, tends to make a difference in longer fights.<br />
<br />
There, he said it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">From current point of view:<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe it does but it comes at a high price, we lost 15% slowability to it and when claims are made that 5% is such a large amount I do not consider it an upgrade at all.<br />
<br />
A second issue is that they must have known that GoD was designed for the time+ community. So that should tell you that the average Ikkinz shaman/chanter would run around with a slow stick.<br />
<br />
However knowing how this expansion was tested I think the whole GoD fiasco shows clearly that using a beta test as a marketing tool has failed here. And we all get to pay for this by running around crippled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">It is not as simple as plugging numbers into an equation. On a pull you would normally be casting before the mob arrived in camp, and the agro associated with the debuff becomes very important. On a long pull an enchanter could slow before it arrived in camp, but so could a shaman with similar gear, and they would generate considerably less agro doing so. In that situation t1*dps = 0.<br />
<br />
In closed scenarios where it is only possible to start casting when the mob is either very close to or in camp, an enchanter might have a timing advantage but would likely get mushed if they tashed right away, whereas a shaman wouldnt because of the low agro associated with our debuff. <br />
<br />
In any case in real non-trivial situations what you would primarily be concerned with as far as slowing is concerned is the possibility of the tank being taken out before heals land. Under those conditions, speed of slowing and the magnitude of the slow are the real critical parameters, not the mana efficiency. When i'm tanking I dont give a rats behind if the casters are saving a few mana, but I do care if I die since that obviously slows the group down.<br />
<br />
Chanters are taken into groups mainly to charm or CC. If they are doing either of these things, they are not going to be giving full attention to slowing, and that will impact on their performance. Personally I like to have redundancy of functions in my groups when doing challenging content, and the two clasess complement each other well IMO.<br />
<br />
On the comparison to Nihil, Tash is -40MR, same as the modifier on Nihil. Malos on the other hand is -55MR. In conjuction with Nihil, that jumps to -95MR. Looking at realistic situations this is like everything else, when dealing with trivial fights there isn't much to choose from and you can get by with many classes, but when things go wrong, or a target presents a serious challenge, you want the specialist class that has the flexible options, and that clearly is shaman in this respect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">On the comparison to Nihil, Tash is -40MR, same as the modifier on Nihil.<br />
<br />
Howl of Tashan is -50.<br />
<br />
There are specific focus effects in game to lower tash aggro in regards to any aggro issues. Not to forget the fast casting Boggle that reduces their hate by 500 per cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ah, hadn't noticed that spell refresh was accounted for in the first of the 3 scenarios, just saw that it was missed in the original posting, and missed any mention of it being with TA for that calculation.   Anyhow, just makes me wish I had the Nihil that much more I s'pose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Tugela, your posts are always helpful because they point out the errors in thinking that are apparently shared by SoE developers in balancing GoD content.  Let's look at specifics:<br />
<br />
On a pull you would normally be casting before the mob arrived in camp, and the agro associated with the debuff becomes very important. On a long pull an enchanter could slow before it arrived in camp, but so could a shaman with similar gear, and they would generate considerably less agro doing so. In that situation t1*dps = 0.<br />
<br />
Malos can generate aggro too.  The diiference between Malos+Turgur's and Tash+Forlorn is one poison counter.  Enchanters have a half second cast time spell that reduces hate by 500.  Slow aggro is not a problem for a competent enchanter.<br />
<br />
In closed scenarios where it is only possible to start casting when the mob is either very close to or in camp, an enchanter might have a timing advantage but would likely get mushed if they tashed right away, whereas a shaman wouldnt because of the low agro associated with our debuff. <br />
<br />
Wrong again, for the same reason as the previous statement.  Malos will not pull a mob off a competent tank, but Turgur's can.  In most situtations, once the mob is being aggro'd by a tank, the aggro of shaman and enchanter debuffs is nearly equivalent, and any problems in aggro control can be handled much better by an enchanter.<br />
<br />
In any case in real non-trivial situations what you would primarily be concerned with as far as slowing is concerned is the possibility of the tank being taken out before heals land. Under those conditions, speed of slowing and the magnitude of the slow are the real critical parameters, not the mana efficiency. When i'm tanking I dont give a rats behind if the casters are saving a few mana, but I do care if I die since that obviously slows the group down.<br />
<br />
Mana efficiency is irrelevant to this discussion.  An quite frankly, magnitude of the slow is less relevant for fast, intense fights than speed.  Enchanters are clearly better slowers in such a situation.<br />
<br />
Chanters are taken into groups mainly to charm or CC. If they are doing either of these things, they are not going to be giving full attention to slowing, and that will impact on their performance. Personally I like to have redundancy of functions in my groups when doing challenging content, and the two clasess complement each other well IMO.<br />
<br />
Any competent enchanter can do CC, charm, and slow without a great deal of effort.  Even with blown pulls, an enchanter will be able to lock down 4-5 adds, and slow when convenient at a later time.  Redundancy is bad when DPS is what is needed.  An enchanter brings much more DPS potential than a shaman, period.<br />
<br />
On the comparison to Nihil, Tash is -40MR, same as the modifier on Nihil. Malos on the other hand is -55MR. In conjuction with Nihil, that jumps to -95MR. Looking at realistic situations this is like everything else, when dealing with trivial fights there isn't much to choose from and you can get by with many classes, but when things go wrong, or a target presents a serious challenge, you want the specialist class that has the flexible options, and that clearly is shaman in this respect.<br />
<br />
Giac has already pointed your error with Tash.  Balance comes with a whopping 24 disease counters.  I'm not sure we know the relationship between disease counters and aggro, but my guess is Balance has more aggro potential than Tash+Forlorn.<br />
<br />
Also, if you had read my post above, you would have learned that casting Malos+Balance negates any advantage it has over other slowing combinations, primarily because it has such a low slow percentage (60%).  If an enchanter is equipped with a Plane of Time slow item, they will slow much better than Balance can.<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil does little to solve the debuff problems of a shaman because of its very low slow percentage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Gardeltron <br />
A. Plain and simple your flaming Tugela.  <br />
<br />
Half your statements like &quot;Wrong&quot; and &quot;This is an example&quot; and etc...  are not necessary for a discussion.<br />
<br />
B. <br />
1.  An enchanters still deals with Aggro management problems.  (Enchanters can handle aggro management for others well but the best that handles aggro management for themselves is wizards.)<br />
2.  There are still tash deaths to deal with. (no, the velious days are not completely over.)<br />
3.  Casters are on a different damage mitigation table than priests.  AKA: Enchanters have the potential without Rune on to take a good amount of damage.<br />
4.  CC, charming, hasting, tashing, slowing, re-Rune-ing, and stunning believe it or not, can be trying on an enchanter to do all at once.<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil does little to solve the debuff problems of a shaman because of its very low slow percentage.<br />
<br />
1. A fast slow is very ideal in what can be, on average a 37 second fight.<br />
<br />
2. The debuff component to Balance is a very nice combination.  <br />
<br />
3.  If we are mentioning fully equiped enchanters in the high end game, it is silly to disclose that we can not discuss a shaman that is fully equiped with the spell 'Balance of the Nihil'<br />
<br />
Lastly, Gaic doesn't always look at the whole picture.  He can be morbid at times.<br />
<br />
Case in point:  <br />
We were discussing the speed of Tash+Forlorn.<br />
Now we are possibly discussing the speed of Tash+clickie aggro control+Forlorn.<br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil's casting speed and debuff component is ideal for reducing Damage taken by the tank as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
Waiting for Tash+clickie aggro debuff+Forlorn Deeds is a process in itself.  Not to mention other aspects and enchanter is responsible for in a group discussed above.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">While I do wish we had faster malos, our malos+turgur combo is superior to tash+deeds(er whatever the chanter slow is), because you need to look at the big picture:<br />
<br />
1) It improves group member dps for magicians, wizards, druids, necros, shamans in terms of resists.  Howl of Tash is -50MR.  Malos is -55 MR, CR, FR, PR.  If you wanted to, you could upgrade to Malosinia which is -70's (or you could just cast malosinia, which is resistable, but still it can be helpful and is faster-- magicians land this spell all the time).<br />
2) The delay you have with malos is probably needed anyway or you'll get agro.  In LDoNs you want to work fast so you tend to turgur without malos anyway; likewise an enchanter is busy with mezzing and probably doesn't want to tash/deeds or he'll have to recast his rune all the time.  On resist you can heal yourself, virulent paralysis, etc.  If you have agro you can malos a mob and not generate more agro.  An enchanter tashing and reslowing an agro mob is gonna be in pain for a little bit-- all this time you can be healing/assisting the chanter while he's struggling with CC.<br />
3) There is a big difference in agro between tash and malos.  If you malos, someone can simply attack the mob and get agro from you.  Tash is a poison counter issue and is high agro.<br />
4) You are a chain class priest that focuses on hp and avoidance.  You can heal yourself/Quiescence yourself on incoming if it's particularly dangerous, and you can heal/Quiescence your main tank while you're working on slowing the incoming mob.<br />
<br />
If you want speed, the best combo is probably to have the chanter tash and you can cast turgur.<br />
<br />
We also have the best flexibility.  Malicious Decay/Cloud of Grummus is extremely nice-- on raids that's what I usually start out with if there are multiple shamans.<br />
<br />
Tigir's.. well, tigir's really stinks.</div></div><hr />

So many points in this very last post of yours show very little understanding of the game once again, yet I am the one that doesn't always look at the whole picture.<br />
I am tired of replying to clueless people so please do me a favor and don't lure me into flaming you(this isn't just directed at Gagner, though).<br />
<br />
Just to clarify I am going to quote my last post and you are welcome to tell me what part of the &quot;whole picture&quot; I left out for correcting Tugela's misinformation.<br />

Howl of Tashan is -50.<br />
<br />
There are specific focus effects in game to lower tash aggro in regards to any aggro issues. Not to forget the fast casting Boggle that reduces their hate by 500 per cast.</div></div><hr />

A. Plain and simple your flaming Tugela. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure what you consider a flame, but to me a flame is a personal attack on the poster.  Tugela's opinions are well written and thoughtful.  I just happen to disagree with much of what he said in the post I referred to. <br />
<br />
Half your statements like &quot;Wrong&quot; and &quot;This is an example&quot; and etc...  are not necessary for a discussion. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry if the word &quot;wrong&quot; seems a bit harsh.  I admit that I am sometimes outspoken, but if I think a statement is wrong, I feel obligated to state so.<br />
<br />
I'm still looking for the phrase &quot;This is an example&quot; in my post.  Perhaps you are referring to something someone else said.<br />
<br />
B. <br />
1.  An enchanters still deals with Aggro management problems.  (Enchanters can handle aggro management for others well but the best that handles aggro management for themselves is wizards.)<br />
2.  There are still tash deaths to deal with. (no, the velious days are not completely over.)<br />
3.  Casters are on a different damage mitigation table than priests.  AKA: Enchanters have the potential without Rune on to take a good amount of damage.<br />
4.  CC, charming, hasting, tashing, slowing, re-Rune-ing, and stunning believe it or not, can be trying on an enchanter to do all at once. <br />
<br />
I'm not quite certain I understand the relevance of these points to the discussion.  Yes, Tash generates aggro, but so do most of the detrirmental spells a shaman casts.  I will admit my ignorance of the finer details of playing an enchanter, but those skillful enchanters I have observed do a tremendous amount for their groups when things go bad.<br />
<br />
1. A fast slow is very ideal in what can be, on average a 37 second fight.<br />
<br />
2. The debuff component to Balance is a very nice combination.  <br />
<br />
In situations where balance can be cast and will slow a mob without any other debuffs, it will do better unless the the fight lasts more than a minute.  If it lasts too much more than a minute, then Balance will have to be recast.<br />
<br />
3.  If we are mentioning fully equiped enchanters in the high end game, it is silly to disclose that we can not discuss a shaman that is fully equiped with the spell 'Balance of the Nihil'.<br />
<br />
Had you read the previous posts carefully you would have discovered that this comparison was indeed made in several posts.  A shaman that has Time's Antithesis will have little need for Balance.<br />
<br />
Balance of Nihil's casting speed and debuff component is ideal for reducing Damage taken by the tank as fast as possible.<br />
<br />
I would aggree if the slow percentage was 70%, or even 65%.  The low slow percentage severely reduces the usefulness of the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">From what I can take of Gagner67's post is that well<br />
<br />
A shaman is<br />
<br />
A very dependable and trustworthy slow bot who needs do nothing else what so ever.<br />
<br />
We do nothing besides slow, and not only that we can slow on incoming with no difficulties, we are perfect and flawless.<br />
<br />
We are an element of the group which by just haveing us in the group all damage is reduced by 75%, the main tank is the only person who ever gets agro.  And all pulls are singles.<br />
<br />
He makes me love the shaman class, doesn't he make you feel the same?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'm not a number cruncher at all in EQ... I have never bothered... I like the game for the fun.<br />
<br />
However, over the past few weeks I have gotten the urge to take a look at the comparison of a BL, Shaman, and Enchanter in terms of slowing effectiveness.<br />
<br />
Granted, what I am looking at is under perfect conditions:<br />
<br />
1. Doesn't take into account worry over aggro (slow immediately)<br />
2. Assumes that casting of debuff and slow is completed without fizzle/interrupt, and slow is successful on first cast.<br />
<br />
Some of the stuff I am looking at mathematically right now has opened my eyes up a bit, and to be honest... angers me. Maybe I shouldn't have bothered, but it's too late now.<br />
<br />
I'm going to look into this some more. I need to get some hard numbers on how much damage particular xp mobs do unslowed etc, but from what I am seeing now... Shaman are indeed less desirable in groups where the most effective efficiency occurs in the use of a Slow spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">well to be fair either one casting debuff+slow on a mob thats still inc is going to get a spanking, chanters even more so. <br />
I have both a shaman and a Chanter, my chanter has a 40% tash agro reduction and I STILL have to wait before I can tash. if I tash on pull I either die or the healer starts pouring mana into keeping my weak ass alive. granted he doesnt have scs but niether does my shaman. if I malos+slow as fast as possible on my shaman I might take a few whacks but I am much more able to take the beating.<br />
<br />
the numbers still make you cringe when you see them posted like that, add in snare/root from a party member and the chanter is a massive upgrade to the shaman in any group. <br />
chanter haste is a bigger dps increase than anything the shaman can bring to the group.<br />
chanter slow is going to be as good or better in a lot of situations.<br />
mana regen nothing else needs to be said.<br />
charm...same as above.<br />
<br />
its pretty ****ing sad that shaman take nerf after nerf (in the form of not getting better spells) over slow because we are the &quot;best&quot; at it, when it turns out we arent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">How much of an extra beating the debuffer takes depends on the tanks you are using. If you have a knight and they are reasonably competent, I would guess that either debuffing class would do. If you are using a warrior they will probably be dropping incite on the mob on inc. Then, depending on whether taunt works or not, their ability to pull agro off the debuffer depends on when and how much damage they are putting out. As a general rule of the thumb, if the debuffer pulls agro on inc from debuffing/slowing, a chanter could expect to take about 1 round of combat more than a shaman if taunt fails.<br />
<br />
I seldom have problems with either class though. Shaman malos is low agro and by the time they slow I usually have enough hate built up with incite/damage to keep agro. Chanters usually hold off a bit, so they seldom get agro either. In my experience the biggest problems are with BLs slowing, since their slows bounce more and are fast casting, which results in them building up huge agro if they have to cast multiple times. They are also much more agressive in casting than shaman or chanters. Of course they are also more capable of taking the hits. But they tend to stand back when doing it, rather than next to me, resulting in me chasing mobs all over camp.<br />
<br />
Personally, given the choice, I would rather have a shaman slowing most of the time. Whether you use them or another class all depends on what you are doing and what sort of functions you need. I know chanters can perform the function as well as shaman, but if you are doing challenging content you take enchanter primarily to CC, and when the **** hits the fan you don't want your primary CC performing other high risk tasks. Chanters and shaman are actually very complementary in groups. Having a group that rips through content the fastest isnt much good if it folds when things go wrong and you have to spend half an hour doing CR. You need to balance efficiency against safety, and safety is achieved by having redundancy of function. In extreme encounters you might need very specific class makeups, but those sort of encounters are not the norm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I aggree with you that in many situations, it probably doesn't matter which class slows.  Even for much of the early level 65 content this is true.  But high level encounters are not that rare these days: hard LDoN, elemental PoP, and Gates all have a lot of content that ultimately most players at level 65 will have to deal with in one form or another.  If you want redundancy in slow, enchater and beastlord is the way to go.  Shamans bring nothing to these types of encounters that either of these classes don't bring, other than very weak healing.  If you want back up healing for your cleric, then druids and paladins are more effective than a shaman and bring huge DPS increases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks, Junior Mod, if I need your assistance I'll ask for it.<br />
<br />
Considering a lot of the posts lately, Gardeltron and Tugela are having a fairly civilized discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">The funny thing is the Sony ain't fixin' SH!T.  As an SK, I have pretty much become a novelty act.  Warriors get spells (skills) and have mana (endurance), plus a 5% mitigation bonus.. and all I got was this crummy T-shirt.  <br />
<br />
Why?  Because most people are essentially labotomized.  Most people could care less if shamen have a niche, and SKs have a niche, and paladins have a niche, and necros have a niche, and druids have a niche.  Honestly, if Sony announced that strating tomorrow the only classes in EQ will be WAR CLE ENC, maybe 5% of the people would even care.  The rest would /shrug, transform into the closest class, and go on paying their $13 monthly fee.  Maybe the rest of us care too much about keeping the game interesting and seeing a variety of races and classes.<br />
<br />
Think about it, you know it's true.  The rest of the classes are basically just playthings.  A few have some useful roles to play, but at the end of the day Sony is still far too stupid to be able to comprehend true class balance.  To Sony, class balance only applies to those three.  Only if they have completely overpowered one of the three, to the point that people have been complaining for months, then maybe they'll toss the others a small bone to shut them up.  Let's face it, they are lazy as all he11 and truly balancing the classes would take way too much thinking and effort.</div></div><hr />
