In all seriousness, how about no canni spell or aa - instead, ditch that idiotic Hastened Rabidity, and give us a Hastened Cannibalization.  3 levels, for a max total of 20-30% reduction in the reuse timer, or something like that.</div></div><hr />

If you look at all of our canni ratios they are all about 11/20. A 1/3 ratio would be a HUGE step down.  Was your post supposed to be funny ?</div></div><hr />

I don't think so. The upgrade in volume would actually make it a more useful spell honestly. With Q you can easily heal the dmg from cann you just can't eat it up fast enough. Lets say you've got the 999 and 333 mana returned. In 2 casts you've got ~2k dmg and 666 mana. Perfect to q and heal up. Net gain ~500 mana in less than 18 seconds assuming same cast time on the cann. Sure you could turn that ~2k hps into ~1100 mana with cann 4 but it would take  about a minute and a half to do it. In that same time you could do 2 cycles with the &quot;big cann&quot; and q and net about the same amount of mana but only spend ~36 seconds of that time casting leaving you with more time to cast other spells. Bigger volume means less active and more effect even if it is less efficient. Personally 36 seconds and 4 casts of cann spells and 2 torpors/q's sounds alot better than 14 casts of cann and 1 topor.<br />
<br />
Really since torpor lost it's mana drain efficiency hasn't been as important as volume. This is even more true with Q and extended duration aa's and focuses. I can heal myself effectively enough I just can't eat the hps up fast enough. I'd definitely be willing to give up some in efficiency to gain a large amount in volume.</div></div><hr />

<br />
C'mon. We are talking lvl 65 here. Since then shaman should have learned hp and mana management and the joys of low health aggro  :D . Even the most non-uber shaman with all wis-gear should be able to handle a 1K canni.<br />
<br />
Israi, agree to a point. Would like larger amounts of regained mana per cast as well, something between Canni IV and V. Alternative to costs you could also balance it with recast times to prevent higher hp/mana ratio over time (and we all know, Norrath would come to an end, if shaman would get even the slightest increase in power /sarcasm).<br />
<br />
Hehe, at least 1 in 7 people understood your point. Maybe you should have elaborated a bit more /shrug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, a very true statement.<br />
<br />
But then the moment you stop chain pressing your Can IV button to actually do something with the mana this is no longer true.<br />
And get me started how we pay for this with extra mana cost on each spell we have.<br />
<br />
Edit: Now that I think about it a bit:<br />
A necro like Can that runs for 4 ticks and does 600 damage a tick and gives 200 mana would be nice to have, even when the ratio is crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Unfortuneately, a MoT (mana over time) for health on a fixed duration (ie: like the 4 ticks stygiana suggested) might constitute origional thinking and SoE cannot seem to grasp the concept.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I'd LOVE to see some sort of MoT that couteracts the effects of Q (say 300 health a tick, 4 ticks, for 150 mana a tick).  While the ratio wouldn't have to be as good as say Can4, at least you could do something else while you were getting mana back.  Would be even better if it was influenced by SCRM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think about it ratios on cannibalize mean nothing to us, since we all use Q/torpor to get the health back, and we're all going to drop that 200 mana for the spell after cannibalizing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do NOT think that it is out of line to ask for something along the lines of what the original post in this thread asks for.  Give me a 500 to 1000hp range for the hp to mana conversion...  hell give it a slightly longer refresh ...  BUT STOP REQUIRING ME MASH MY CANNI4 hotkey ad infinitum if my Canni AA isn't up and I need mana conversion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I want in the form of canni upgrade is a hastened canni5 aa. Drop it to 2 minutes, or one minute. Hell drop it to 42 seconds...</div></div><hr />

What would you do with all the wonderful mana, if our regeneration rate doubled?  <br />
<br />
From a raid point-of-view:<br />
<br />
On normal raids after debuffing I usually chain rain and for the most part and I end up with 40m when the target is dead.  No matter how hard I cast or want to cast, I can't get rid of my mana.  Even if I spot heal group members or cast cures, I almost never go oom.  On new targets I might run oom, and so does everyone else, that's part of learning the encounter.  It's not like a shaman casting Tears of Saryrn or Tnarg's Mending is going to save a raid if we had extra mana.<br />
<br />
From an ldon/xp group point-of-view:<br />
<br />
Not an issue even.  If you're in an ldon or xp group and you're constantly losing mana, then either your gear needs upgrading, you need to get SCM or you're simply wasting mana.  I seldom go under 75-80m for very long while in ldon or xp groups.<br />
<br />
From a solo point-of-view:<br />
<br />
The time between soloing doomfire soldiers would go down, but I've given up soloing for xp for the most part, because it's boring and I can get points for augments and xp at the same time in ldon.  I only solo when there's nothing else to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing that disappoints me the most about shaman abilities is our inability to use DoTs on raids.  I'm talking about stacking 6-7 DoTs, not casting BoU and BoS and that's it.  I want to cast Bane, Pox, Anathema, BoS, BoU, Odium.  Wizards can sustain 200-250dps and not die even when Concussion doesn't work.  They have a combination of big nukes, lures and draughts they can use to avoid getting aggro too quickly.  We could easily sustain 200-250dps on raid targets, but we die because of poison aggro and the DoT damage calculation flaw (i.e. most recent damage done gets an aggro &quot;bonus&quot;).  <br />
<br />
Even if they gave us a half-assed solution like a DoT that reduced aggro or made the mob &quot;forget&quot; (e.g. an amnesia DoT) some of the damage you just did to him, I would accept it.  I don't see that coming any time soon though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If you think about it ratios on cannibalize mean nothing to us, since we all use Q/torpor to get the health back, and we're all going to drop that 200 mana for the spell after cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Stygiana meant that it would give us 200 mana/tick over 4 ticks. You would have a net gain of 600 mana (not counting MP/specialization reducing the mana cost of Q) in the end. Best of all, you get to hold off carpal tunnel syndrome for a couple more years. Cann4 just isn't adequate given the current size of mana pools and the pacing of today's content.<br />
<br />
Canni-over-time would provide some balance to our mana regen. It would require a buff slot for the recourse, which is a downside. However, if they prevented the recourse from stacking with Cann4, that would allay many of the balance concerns regarding having shaman chain both Cann4 and our theorectical Cann6 &quot;upgrade&quot;. I don't know that we need to drop the efficiency down to 3 hp/1 mana, but I'm sure some happy medium could be found.<br />
<br />
This is a really interesting idea, which pretty much rules out any chance of SOE implementing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I want canniescence where I press my aa button and enter into a lich type form. Passive cannibalization offset by automatic quiescence. Of course to keep things balanced it should also provide the group with a damage shield. The damage shield would strip hitpoints from the mobs and place them into a mana pool. Every time the mana pool hits 1200 it would spread the mana across the group. <br />
<br />
Clearly more thought is needed though, perhaps the melee could get endurance instead of mana.</div></div><hr />

I'd only support this if it could be cast on others.  Die chanter!</div></div><hr />

I don't go OOM, but increasing my mana regen means I can do more of the vodoo I do so well.  I can add an extra DoT on a rooted add, I can chain nuke the MA's mob, I can root more, I can chain AE nuke to kill mobs faster.  Right now I do tons as I'm often the main healer, slower, buffer and I do CC and add a bit of DPS on the side.  Sometimes, especially if a group member dies and I have to rebuff them, it totally throws out my mana regen patterns and I struggle a little more to get to the point where I was freely tossing out damage, heals and controlling the flow of the fight.  If you are not pressing your mana regen, what are you doing with your mana?  For me I am always casting.  Long cast times and hotkeys are usually all that allows me to communicate with my party.  My gear is OK, I have SCRM and I am always canning, sometimes, out of sheer habbit, I cann when FoM.<br />
<br />
Getting a self only mana regen that works similar to Torpor/Q would be a HUGE bonus as not only could I regen mana, I have more time to cast even more often.  I'd settle for a 4 tick Cann4 happily (every tick gives a cann4 effect, freeing up my time).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">As a player who already IS suffering from carpal tunnel syndrome, I want a form of canni that doesn't involve me having to mash a key every few seconds to maintain my mana regen rate.  Make it a passive ability,  make it a much bigger block of health to mana at the same ratio with a longer recast time, or just make canni 5 reusable more often.  I could care which, but for gods sake already, make it so that I don't have to aggravate my Carpal Tunnel just to keep my mana up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The big issue that needs attention is not mana regen at this point.  It is our lack of ability to do any damage.  Tears is highly resisted, Velium Strike is slow and inefficient, and dots are too much aggro to be realistic.<br />
<br />
Like a guy a few posts up said -- why the hell do you want more mana?  Are you running out of mana malxing and slowing?  Or spot healing?  I guess in the &quot;odd&quot; group where you're main healer or there's two shaman, and you're chain casting saryrn resists-be-damned, maybe you would be out of mana.  But even without KEI, 9, or any other mana regen buffs (and only FT5), I still hover around 75-90mana on hard LDONs (and my gear is far from uber).  <br />
<br />
I like that our collective voice is congealing into a couple main points -- mana regen and damage, but what's the point of more mana regen if you're not using your mana on anything (i.e. damage).<br />
<br />
Give us a neg aggro modifier on all dots level 56+ (Bane of Nife and above), and give us a serious nuke solution that isn't AE.  If you don't understand why I ask for this, ask Grizlor about melees proccing debuffs and dots.  On raids where many melees have weapons proccing and taking up debuff slots, even if we WANTED to start stacking dots... we can't. <br />
<br />
Give us an upgrade Spear of Torment to 1100 damage for 325 mana with a 3 second recast at level 64.  Put it on shammy merchants or LDON merchants, doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
The point is, give us something to do besides cast 31 flavors of slow or constantly mashing the canni4 button.</div></div><hr />
