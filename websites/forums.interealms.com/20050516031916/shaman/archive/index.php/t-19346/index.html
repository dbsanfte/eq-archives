<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hehe, Its always been my goal to max all skill/trades but this begging has not gone past 192. It suposed to be a max of 200. All been on my pet. Just curious if anyone practices this and got 200</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yep my skill is 200 and I also have a skill of 200 on my 52 ranger and my 43 Beastie has a 180ish....and just like you I get squat for it :D<br />
Think that my best &quot;beg&quot; was from the Ancient Cyclops when he gave me a silver to leave him alone, shortly before he fell over dead :p</div></div><hr />

All I can think of when I read that is my troll sitting on his but in PoT, hungry saying &quot;Awww come on dogdog, give mes a bite of da hobbit bone.&quot;  And dogdog, of course, replys &quot;grrrr.../bite!&quot; Rinse and repeat when button refreshes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heard a rumor you can no longer gain begging skill from pets. Not positive tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Heard a rumor you can no longer gain begging skill from pets. Not positive tho<br />
As of today it does, I was tooling around on my necro today and got a skill up from my pet; remember operative word: rumor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Do you have to train a point first?<br />
Cause Im still at zero</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Seichan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No you don't have to train the first point.. but if you don't the first skillup will take half of forever.  So far on my quest to max Begging, I've recieved a whole whopping 4cp.. but that's not the point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aekhold</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I'm stuck at 144... but I always train it on my pet. I'll try on mobs, melee time is back :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">There used to be a rumor that beg was a ghetto taunt.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure that it was de bunked though.</div></div><hr />
