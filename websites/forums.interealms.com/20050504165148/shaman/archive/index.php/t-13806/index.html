<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
<br />
I only need yaeth's 108 for the last part for an attempt at malo.  It went up for sale about a week ago for 10k.  It still hasn't sold.  I have enough, but it would break me,  do you think it's worth the risk?  A failed attempt would be pretty horrible.  I raid a couple times a week, and malo would help me out alot.  Thanks in advance.<br />

<br />
I was hunting the shik'nars in FG that drop the Vex Thal shard... you know, the Royals and Warriors.  We saw TWO Yaeth's 108s drop in less than 3 hours.<br />
<br />
Might be random, but I would try hunting there a bit before I shelled out 10kpp.<br />
<br />
Good Luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Look at the price for Malo on your server.  If Yaeth's 108 is more than 25% of that it's over priced.  Words of Retention are also rare and will be expensive.  The rest of the parts are pretty common.  If you get Malo on your first try for half the normal cost you are ahead of the game.  If it takes two tries your broke even.  If it takes more you are having very bad luck.<br />
<br />
Make sure you have them combined by a caster with maxxed research and a geerlok but that goes without saying.<br />
<br />
On the Nameless Malo goes for as much as 65kpp so 10kpp would be a good price.  I have only seen one other Yaeth 108 for sale there at 12kpp.  I put the one I have up for 10kpp since I'm only 51 and need some armor upgrades badly.  My ikky is starting to show it's age.  Otherwise I would hang on to it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have yet to see a Yaeth 108 on Karana (note I have malo, so I don't look), but the Yaeth 107 for Torpor has been seen once in the last month for only 1 million pp. I've given up on being able to buy those research components due to the ignorance of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got Yaeth 108 to drop from the Shiknar warriors in Fungus Grove.  I would seriously try bringing a group down there to hunt for a little while before paying 10k for the page.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So far i have seen at least 3 yaeth's 108 drop.  One dropped during a 10th ring war, one dropped in ssra temple and the other one during an arena clearing before we pulled the AoW.<br />
<br />
I ended up buying my page for 25 plat in the bazaar.  Maybe its plain luck but i dont see yaeth's 108 as that rare.  As for words of retention i have yet to see it, as well as agony, or any of the topor research drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was given two copies of Yaeth's 108 from a friend who was camping Vex Thal Shards from Fungus Grove. She was only there for an hour. Words of Retention dropped for my Paladin back when my old guild was killing the Rhags in Ssrae off of some MoB on the way there. I hadn't thought enough to ask for it, though. I believe it was sold in bazaar.<br />
<br />
Grab some friends and head over to Fungus Grove, rather than spending 10k.</div></div><hr />
