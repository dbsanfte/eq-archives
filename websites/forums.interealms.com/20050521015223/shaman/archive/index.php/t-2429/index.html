<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have some questions about focus items, maybe someone can clear up for me:<br />
<br />
1. Does improved healing affect heals over time like torpor or just instant cast heals?<br />
<br />
2. Does extended enhancement affect heals over time like torpor or is there a min duration for buff spells?<br />
<br />
3. Can more than one focus item be activated at a time? Eg: can mana preservation combine with improved healing?<br />
<br />
On AA and focus:<br />
<br />
4. Do Spell Casting Reinforcement and SCRMastery affect heals over time like torpor.<br />
<br />
5. Do SCR and SCRM stack with Extended Enhancement focus items.<br />
<br />
6. Does Quick Buff reduce the casting time of heals over time like torpor.<br />
<br />
Thanks if you can answer any of these questions. No guesses or best friend's dog's cousin told me...replies, please.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'll try to answer you questions.<br />
<br />
The ones I am sure of:<br />
<br />
2. Does extended enhancement affect heals over time like torpor or is there a min duration for buff spells? <br />
<br />
Extended enchancement DOES NOT affect torpor but does affect other buff spells.  <br />
<br />
3. Can more than one focus item be activated at a time? Eg: can mana preservation combine with improved healing? <br />
<br />
Yes.  Different focus effects will stack but same focus effects won't.  For example, mana preservation will combine with quick cast.  But mana preservation 3 on one item will not combine afflication efficiency 3 on another item.<br />
<br />
4. Do Spell Casting Reinforcement and SCRMastery affect heals over time like torpor. <br />
<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement DOES affect torpor, but there is some argument as too how much skill you need to see a difference in amount of torpor ticks.  I for one saw an extra tick with Spell Cast Reinforcement 1.<br />
<br />
5. Do SCR and SCRM stack with Extended Enhancement focus items. <br />
<br />
Yes it does.  But since extended enchancement does not work for torpor, it does not help amount of torpor time<br />
<br />
6. Does Quick Buff reduce the casting time of heals over time like torpor. <br />
<br />
Yes it does.  If you get Quick Buff 3, torpor will be 3 second cast and other &quot;normal&quot; buffs will be half time.<br />
<br />
As for question 1:<br />
<br />
1. Does improved healing affect heals over time like torpor or just instant cast heals?<br />
<br />
I am not sure on this but I do not think heals over time are effected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">1. Does improved healing affect heals over time like torpor or just instant cast heals?<br />
--- Just instant cast heals.<br />
<br />
2. Does extended enhancement affect heals over time like torpor or is there a min duration for buff spells?<br />
--- Does not affect Torpor.  Min. duration 48.0 seconds.<br />

3. Can more than one focus item be activated at a time? Eg: can mana preservation combine with improved healing?<br />
---  Yes, different focus effects do stack.  However two different effects that do the same thing will not.  i.e. spell haste is 10% haste, affliction haste is 33% haste to DoTs.  Affliction haste will take precedence and spell haste will do nothing.  Think of it just like item haste for a melee character when multiple items can affect a spell. ;)<br />
<br />
On AA and focus:<br />
<br />
4. Do Spell Casting Reinforcement and SCRMastery affect heals over time like torpor.<br />
--- Yes, see above post.<br />
<br />
5. Do SCR and SCRM stack with Extended Enhancement focus items.<br />
--- Yes...  Spell haste and quick buff also stack to a point.  Apparently, spell haste is capped at 50% however and once you have quick buff3, spell haste will do nothing additional for you when buffing.  Not sure if the same applies for duration increase though.<br />
<br />
6. Does Quick Buff reduce the casting time of heals over time like torpor.<br />
--- Yes.</div></div><hr />
