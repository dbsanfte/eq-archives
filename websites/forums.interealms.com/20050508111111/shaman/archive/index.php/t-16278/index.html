<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just looking for a list of things that are good items to give the dog...  I tend to give him gnoll hide lariats when I fight casters...  However I am wondering if there are any GOOD fairly cheap procing weapons that do lots of damage or other neat things for a pet...  1/40 with a 40 damage proc that procs almost all the time would be an uber item for a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I buy Serrated Bone dirks whenever I see 'em for 250 and less.  (Procs engulfing darkness/snare)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">velium weapons arent bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I harvest Velium weaps and Gnoll Hide Lariats when I'm going xping on my own.  Started soloing/duoing the dead things in Veksar so mobs running is no longer a problem.<br />
<br />
For normal groups, it's just 2 rusty daggers, unless I have a plethora of GHL/Velium on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gnoll hide lariats don't work on a lot of mobs in Veksar because of the level 55 and under limitation.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">go to the bazaar and look up summoned.  There are usually people selling mage summoned items for about 10pp per...<br />
<br />
Gear up dog dog for about 40 pp.  My usual is hand and/or blades, collor and mask.  Fairly standard package.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah :(<br />
<br />
I've started parsing Goner's damage output with the various weapons.  Sadly, it's a mismatch of prey, so the parses don't hold a lot of weight for me yet, but early reports seem to indicate that 1hs and 1hb weaps land more often than piercing and h2h do.  <br />
<br />
Makes sense, since he's a warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I usually try to get blade of the kedge. Walnan ones are magic, so more easily resisted. Ixiblat fists are h2h, so melee damage isnt as good.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, if you've got some money to burn and you're gonna solo in howling stones, buy a dawnfire, morningstar of light for his primary, you won't regret it  :D</div></div><hr />

Yep, me too.  Less than a pp each from vendors...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">My standard Pet Pack includes at a minimum a girdle and muzzle. That's assuming I can find a mage to summon me some. There's usually a mage or two selling summoned items at the bazaar.<br />
<br />
However, you really have to be careful with the walnan swords and ixi fists. The proc on those breaks root constantly which can be fatal in a dungeon when a runner is dangerously close to aggroing others. When soloing I find it much more safer to just stick with rusty weapons and if I can find an SBD then all the better. In groups or where mobs don't run then I prefer the walnan/ixi weapons for max damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well playing a beastlord on beta, I gave a blade of carnage and a steel hilted flinge dagger(625dd proc) to the pet on one adventure, that was kinda fun. But on normal servers where I can't risk that much pp just a standard gnoll hide lariats, or mage weapons, and if its somewhere like droga, a kunzar kujuch or serrated bone dirk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When fighting a summoning mob solo, I usually equip my pet with obsidian shards, mage summoned fists or swords.  In exp grps I give Goner a couple rusty daggers or proccing weaps (see soloing summoning mobs) if I think I want to give a small boost to DPS.  When soloing OS for cash, I dump double gnoll hide lariats on Goner and watch him piss off froggy casters.</div></div><hr />

My parsings with fido on the same mob indicate that the weapon doesn't seem to matter. All the different combos where with in a small enough range of each other that weapons don't seem to matter outside the procs/stats they might add and getting him to attack with the off hand.<br />
<br />
Personally i use either<br />
a) what ever pet weapons the mage in the group feels like summoning up<br />
b) a single off hand only weapon like a chill dagger or a etchaka.<br />
<br />
You can see my parsings in my other post at<br />

<br />
<br />
That has been my experience as well. <br />
<br />
Given that kedge blades are not as easy to find compared to the other two, I generally equip him with mask/girdle/walnan/fist.<br />
<br />
It does vary though, depending on mobs and availability of summoned. Sometimes he gets a dragon horn ykesha, or icy blade, etc.<br />
<br />
I never give him nonproc weapons anymore however, why limit his damage?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>vivala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used to go from vendor to vendor looking for weapons.  This got old and annoying when I couldn't find any for sale.  I found a nice easy solution:<br />
<br />
In Shadow haven, from the nexus,  There are 2 doors on the right side as your running towards the shaman spell vendors.  The first door has a dwarf that sells smithing hammers, 1hb.  1 silver each i think.  He has an unlimited supply.  The second door sells food and water.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Perelandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Does dex buff help your pet proc more ?<br />
<br />
Yes - the more the better. My pets normally have Focus of Soul and Primal Essence on. If I have an enchanter, they get NDT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I also used to go Vendor mining searching for weapons, until I stumbled upon, Wooden Practice Daggers.<br />
<br />
These are sold for 1sp on a merchant in Shar Vhal, south of the bank, through the arch, and outside the second building, I forget his name.<br />
<br />
For Kitty Shaman with a soulstone these are great, I always stock up whenever I'm in town.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Its all about gnoll hide lariats baby!<br />
<br />
Just make a run through Paw (or if you're rich, just buy em in the bazaar at 20p each) and pick up a couple bags of em.  Just gets irritating when you group with a bard who for some unknown reason likes to sing his invis song after every kill, poofing your dog and his weapons...<br />
<br />

Bah, bards  :mad: !!!  <br />
<br />
( apoligies to the good bards out there, but I've been on the receiving end of uncontrolled bard 'swarms' so many times in PoD that I get a bad taste in my mouth every time someone mentions bards...:))  I even thought of making a hotkey after evacing asking if that was a train or just another bard... :p <br />

About 1sp per rusty dagger I think.</div></div><hr />
