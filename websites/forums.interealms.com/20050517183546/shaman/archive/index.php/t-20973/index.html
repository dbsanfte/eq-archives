<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Pen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey a friend and I recently started back from EQ, he quit about 2 months ago and has has many lvl 65 chars ect and I quit right before pop and had a 60 druid with 40 AAs and 51 monk so we both know the game well. On returning we decided we would start over on a server we had never played before and after playing Daoc on both the pvp and rvr servers I could not return to a blue server so we decided to start on Tz. The only aid we will have is about 400k plat to self twink ourselves until we can start getting better equip through planes ect. Well the thing is he decided to make a SK as his main b/c it is one of the few classes he has not played. <br />
Because of his choice of class and the fact that we will primarily be duoing most likely solely in pvp so being on the same team is very important ( he is an ogre so I have to b a troll/ogre/iksar/DE ) I want his partner to be a good choice in terms of pvp espesually at the high end and I want to choose something knowing that later when we start encountering EP equiped players that they will have up to 300+ resists causing most spells to be resisted.. We are very serious about pvping espesually once we are 65 b/c one of the main reasons I quit eq in the first place was the lack of anything to do on a blue server when raids weren't in progress except to get more AAs or roll a new alt..Also we will most likely be duoing together xp wise up until we can enter pop xp zones ect so I would like a good xp combination too..don't forget at 65 we'll be grinding through AAs ect.. <br />
<br />
Well the choices i'm considering right now is a necro or a shaman to duo with him, however i'm under the impression that in high end pvp a shaman will mainly have all his spells resisted, yet I would still have buffs/heals to give him not to mention debuffs/dogdog ect...Plus in xping/AAs i'll have haste/other buffs/debuffs/dots/slows/dogdog which imo would work well..but on the other hand as a necro I would have very powerful dps dots and pet for xping plus fearkiting so the sk would take minimum damage and at higher lvls agro kiting and him running behind it with pet hitting..but in pvp the only real damage I would have is splurt and maybe other dots + lifetap if we are not fighting someone with insanely high resists, but I would lack a real heal for him and buffs..<br />
<br />
Also factor in that I love being able to solo really well and having high survability in both pvp/pve which is one of the reasons I loved both my monk and druid so much<br />
<br />
Well sorry for being so drawn out..i've been researching classes for days now and just can't decide and my lack of knowllege due to not playing since luclin.. so i'm comming to a forum full of experts on their class..thanks =)<br />
<br />
Oh one more thing, I think I would enjoy the necro more in personal preference but i'm more willing to pick the most beneficial class to our combo in the long run..also we plan on having EP gear ect later down the road after aquiring 65 and  150+AAs to meet the requirements for the high end guilds ..btw we plan on getting much of these AAs probally duoed together or in groups.whatever we can find =)<br />
<br />
..please factor in the roles of the classes in a raid situation and how beneficial the class would be for them also for instance multiple shamans not being as useful in a raid once the mob is slowed and GoD and hw slow is not very useful there b/c of the speed of combat..thanks =)</div></div><hr />
