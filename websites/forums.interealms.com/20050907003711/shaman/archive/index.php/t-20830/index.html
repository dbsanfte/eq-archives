<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>DankShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hullo everyone, im going to get back into everquest soon, had to take a break because of school and such.  And well, my com is an HP, model POS.  Money will not in great abundance over the summer so i need an affordable alternative to a custom PC. Has anyone ever gone with EBay? I'm looking at such auctions like this http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;category=51139&amp;item=4123399851&amp;rd=1  where i would need a video card, a hard drive and some memory, a CD drive or two, and an OS, I have some friends who built there own systems that could help me put those things in.  My real questions are this. 1) Has anyone ever gone with EBay for there computing needs? 2) What speed processor/amount of RAM/Video Card should i be looking at? 3)what else would i need to put in?<br />
Thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">To be realistic ebay is a crap shoot.  I personally sell a bunch of stuff for the computer store I work at on ebay, usually refurbs or customer returns.  We are reputable and back our products but can't say the same for everyone.  <br />
<br />
NEVER buy anything that is sold AS-IS! Quite a few people put known bad parts on ebay as-is for free money. It sucks<br />
<br />
DO buy parts that have a manufacterer's warranty that you can return strait to them.  If the processor is retail box it has a 3 year warranty. MSI, Asus motherboards have 3 year warranties and have end-user RMA service, for example.  <br />
<br />
Reguarding the acution you listed:<br />
1. Does not say CPU is retail. If it is OEM it probably has no warranty at all.<br />
2. ECS does not have an end-user rma process.<br />
<br />
So if something goes wrong your screwed!<br />
<br />
You really are better off buying a system from a local retailer or a reputable online store like newegg. Yes it will be more expensive but there is always someone to talk to face-to-face if something goes wrong.  Most will also give you tips on installing yourself.<br />
<br />
For your second question, the low end processors you can get these days are pretty much 2ghz and up. Anything you buy will be plenty fast enough. RAM is really expensive right now so you will probably only want to get 256 or 512, but plan on upgrading to 1gb after the prices drop. Video card you want as fast as you can afford!  Plan on $150-250 and get a Radeon 9600xt, FX5900XT or a Radeon 9800(pro).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you dont mind waiting watch some of the hot deals boards around such as Fat Wallet or a multitude of others. You can find some amazing stuff posted on them and they usually have For Sale/Trade boards that people post on individually. If you do use the For Sale/Trade boards a good site with info is Trollhunters (http://www.trollhunters.com) <br />
<br />
Another good place to check is the small business section of Dell. Yes Dell computers, they often run specials on the low end servers that are really desktops in hiding. You dont actually have to be a small business to register and buy from them. The biggest benefit besides a good deal is the awesome tech support you will get with the system.</div></div><hr />
