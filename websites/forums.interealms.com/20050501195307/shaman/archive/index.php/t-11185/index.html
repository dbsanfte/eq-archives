<br />
No matter what the case, verant would be slapping itself in the face for RP purposes, if the only way you can get spells you need such as torpor or malo, is to kill off your own kind.  It's putting those frogs that like to RP at a distinct disadvantage.  So I was wondering if you think because of this, and because the shaman community has roared for years about our spell drops, and Because theres now 5 more levels and new drop upgrades that are easier to get then the old.....<br />
<br />
Do you think they're going to somehow make it if not easier, than give us more options of obtaining Malo/Torpor?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As the frogs of Sebilis follow the dragon Trakanon, I rather doubt they would be on good terms with the amphibian followers of Mithaniel Marr.  From the little bit of exploration of Gro... err, Gukta I did earlier, the new froggies seem pretty hardnosed about anyone not following the path of righteousness.  Fighting in Seb for the new froggies might well be considered a holy crusade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Last time I went to Sebilis killing frogs there gave positive Gukta faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you'll find killing in Seb gives +ve &quot;Frogloks of Guk&quot; faction - as far as I know there are no &quot;Gukta&quot; factions yet. Killing frogs in Grobb (that's its name!) doesn't give any faction hits.<br />
<br />
And Sebilis is hardly the only place to get level 60 Kunark spells. How about Ragefire, Talendor, Gorenaire, Severilious, Veeshan's Peak, Skyfire, Chardok ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both the goblins and frogloks on Kunark have separate factions from those in Antonica and Faydwer.  Unless something has changed in the past week or two that I missed.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">something has changed Zatriz.  Froglocks in seb, when you kill them, now give +Froglocks of Guk faction.  That changed bout the same time as that woodelf mask went live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The frogs of seb give positive guk live side faction to prevent level 60s from aoeing lower guk for faction. For about a week before this change was made you would be hard pressed to find a single frog in lguk.<br />
<br />
People still do it to some extant but most would rather get xp + cash +sellables from seb than mosh lower guk.<br />

Torpor and Malo now drop from Sontalak, and perhaps other Velious dragons.  My copies of both these spells came from Sontalak in the past month.  A great change IMO because, like everyone else here, I found zero interest in killing Kunark dragons in a guild capable of doing NToV.<br />
<br />
But there are also Guardian Wurms, King/Queen of Chardok, and all of VP to get them from.  I don't see why you say it's required to kill frogs to get those spells.</div></div><hr />
