<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was soloing in PoF today starting out w/ Putrid Decay instead of Malicious Decay to debuff, then root with Virulent Paralysis 3 at my favorite camp, Tables .<br />
<br />
This is the first time I've tried to use PD as a debuff.  The Lucy info makes it look better than Malos.  Unfortunately Lucy didn't tell me that the Doomfire Soldier would break VP early and I am now a corpse. (lucy states Disease -55 for PD and -35 for MD {so shouldn't PD work better})<br />
<br />
I have never had a problem keeping the Soldiers rooted w/ VP while debuffed with Malicious Decay.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else tried PD successfully in PoF?  Has shaman soloability in the Plane of Fire been nerfed, or is Malicious Decay still the way to debuff while soloing in Plane of Fire?<br />
<br />
Any experiences/info my fellow shaman could share would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malicious Decay debuffs disease resist by 55.  Putrid Decay debuffs poison and disease resists by 55.  They should be equal.  However, there is no reason to use Putrid Decay since after Malos and Malosinia, poison dots never fail to land.  I've soloed in pofire after all the patches and VP3 still works. You must have the highest level of VP for them to remain rooted the entire duration, otherwise they will break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do have VP3.../cries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually, I believe that Manson's point is this; PD debuffs both poison and disease resists by 55 for 250 mana.  Using Malos and MD you get the same poison and disease resist debuff of 55, but it costs you 550 mana and takes at least 9 secs to cast both vs. 3.5 secs for PD.  So, if you are doing root/rot, and are not worried about slowing (so you don't need the MR debuff) then PD would be a better choice, as long as the -200 resist check is good enough to ensure that it will land.<br />
<br />
So, the question remains, was he unlucky, or is there an issue with PD.  If not, then PD should be the clear choice, unless you feel more comfortable slowing the mob just, in case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pre-OoW, soldiers would break VP even after MD; although very rare it did happen.  Sounds like you just got unlucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd guess just an unlucky break.  I was at the tables in Fire last night for a few hours and never had root break early with MD + VP3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Where abouts do you solo ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Heigelyac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any root can break on a really lucky roll of the die.  Sometimes it's just better to use Petrifying earth, which lasts longer than VP's recast and save VP for when you are in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Batuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is a little off topic but I have solo'd for 100's of AA's in PoFire and I don't think I have died once.  I always slow the mob (even though I plan on avoiding contact) and I always have root up.  I'm extra cautious in that zone because I know that clerics are rarely found there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kriyn Nutzforcatnip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I don't have vp and have solo'd there with very few deaths.  Only time I've died is when I was root rotting on ramp and someone brought a mob that they didn't have enough agro on, and it jumped me while I was looking away.  I pull with malos and on pull i cast md.  Once I get mob to spot i want o cast petrifying earth and then malosinia on the mob.  From there I use breath of ultor, bane, blood of saryn and epic till it dies.  With CannV and Pained Memory + Horse I can keep pulling till I get tired.  Haven't seen a differeance in lasting time for root, it's pretty much random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So, if you are doing root/rot, and are not worried about slowing (so you don't need the MR debuffNot if you have bane and epic....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Oh yeah. When I solo there, my spell lineup looks like this:<br />
<br />
1) Bane<br />
2) Blood<br />
3) Trushar<br />
4) Malos<br />
5) Turg<br />
6) Ancient Scourge<br />
7) Yoppa's Mending<br />
8) Chaotic Pain<br />
9) Malicious Decay<br />
<br />
I use ancient cause it's hard to run out of mana otherwise, and also click my pox pants cause it's free. I demem Malicious decay for Greater Immobilize once it's in.  Really with my HP/AC it's easy enough to survive a round or 2 of melee to re root em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have had VP3 break before at tables and in fact made a post about on another similar topic.  All you people that have absolute faith in VP need to realize that it can still break and be prepared for it or face getting a rez.</div></div><hr />
