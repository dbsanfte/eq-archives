<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">These two are botted so macroing the shaman and putting him on /follow is a probably an important factor.<br />
<br />
The L51 shaman has decent Bazaar HP gear and decent mana pool.  Shaman has a drog.  The L65 Ogre SK has mostly cultural armor and 27 AA.<br />
<br />
So far the best I can come up with is The Hole.  I grab a KEI and head over via PoK stone.  I don't need Virtue because SK has plenty of HP with just HOS and I'm not doing complete heals anyway.  It's fairly convenient to get to, and of course a nice XP bonus.  I just group the two and SK basically chews through the upper part of the zone while the two pets help.  Very low risk, even if I aggro three I can easily let my SK pet offtank (he can almost solo one).  <br />
<br />
Shaman is getting I'd guess about 0.75% XP per kill.  Not every kill counts as 1%, but sometimes two in a row will move the % up.  So I'm guessing it's more than 0.5% XP per kill but it's not quite 1% XP per kill either.  Kills go fairly, I don't even take the time to slow.  Shaman is just there to haste the SK and both pets, and heal once in awhile.<br />
<br />
The annoying part is that I have to move around through halls a lot because the respawn on the upper part is lacking.  Plus I can't use the shaman's drog so that complicates life trying to get him med time while on /follow.  I'd much rather stick him on a drog and not have to deal with sitting and also sit aggro.  Also, the SK is killing greens so he doesn't even get minor amounts of XP.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking maybe I should head down into the city a little.  Those things tended to be very light blue to the SK (XP) but that also means that they caused a greater need for healing.<br />
<br />
Any other obvious suggestions?  Think outdoor zone for horse, good XP modifier, and relatively easy cannon fodder for a Bazaar equipped 65 SK to chew through without requiring much healing from the shaman.  If moving around is required, that's ok as long as it's easy to navigate with /follow (i.e. no cliffs, no hallways).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last night things worked out well after a slow start.  I was on my way to join a friend in Cazic Thule.  I thought I'd try to twobox the two entrance mobs.  Got em both slowed and got a feel for how much aggro I need to generate on the off mob to make sure heals don't draw attention to the shaman.  The slow wore off on one of the mobs when it was at like 7% (as a powerleveler, I still don't have a &quot;feel&quot; for duration).  SK ended up dying in the confusion but the moral of the story is that CT is not a great place to bootstrap a lower level character.  <br />
<br />
I got a tell from my nephew and brother-in-law.  Now that they are done moving, it looks like they may be back to EQ.  Low 50s warrior and high 50s warrior, and it seems they've picked up a mid 50s cleric bot along the way.  Hey, perfect!  I got the slows, they got the CH and a few melees to beat on stuff.. let's go to PoP!<br />
<br />
Chose PoN because it seems like there are decent camps close to the zone in.. that's good when stuff goes wrong.  Third pull, it went wrong.  I forgot that stuff is very social there, and ended up bringing in 3.  We weren't in the groove yet so my slows didn't go off quickly and his CH didn't either.<br />
<br />
After that mishap, we grabbed a L51 enchanter as insurance.  He got bored but did save us on a two-pull where a third popped in our camp.  Near the end of the night we grabbed a 54 BL for SR and DPS.  In about 4 hours my shaman got through 53% of L51.  The L51 warrior got through the same.  The L58 warrior got about a gold he said.  My SK got like half an AA which is far from great but beats the hell outta no gain.<br />
<br />
It looks like Tier 1 is still the best way to go.  Not sure what I'll do if I can't get a CH cleric, but I could slowly muddle through with just Superior Heals.  I'm considering whether I should just give in and do the Stoicism quest.. I don't mind the run speed, but it drops ATK which really sucks. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you tried maden's eye?<br />
 I was also very surprised at velks, I went there just to get a ebony hate ear for my shammy (10ac 6 wis 50hp)<br />
Spiders are pretty much wusses, they can be pretty resistant sometime, but with a 65 sk should be no prob, the ear is a great earpiece too,not much can come close except the solstice. Velks seems good only if it's not too busy after so many ppl are there spiders are sparse and not worth it, you can sit the shammy down in one place too, dunno if your sk will get any exp though they are all lblue to my 61 shammy.<br />
BTW I think the stoicism quest is very much worth it, helps with mana regen quite a bit, I would never use it as a main healing spell though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xzellos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This was posted quite a bit ago, but I'll post for future readers. Recently I've been leveling up my Shaman twink, but not wanting to go looking for group on offtimes when I'm not sure how long I really want to play I would 2 box my friends 65 paladin.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how your gear compares to his, he has close to 1500 ac, and about 5.9k hit points, I found doing fly's in PoD were really easy. Paladin required almost no heals, so with average bazaar gear against slowed mobs I would say it would easily be doable. They hit for max of about 170ish, are lightblue so can be single pulled by a level 65 character, and gave 1% every 2 - 3 kills (Iksar penalty). The fly's are near the zone, named something like &quot;A Tsetsia Fly&quot; don't mistake them for &quot;A Malarian something or other&quot; which spawn near the water, they are much more difficult, (hit for 400ish, lifetap for 700). <br />
<br />
I would set up camp in between the fly area and where the diseased rats spawn. I pulled the rats too, but I'm not too sure on the situation with different characters, considering the paladin can heal himself.<br />
<br />
Snare would be a big plus here, I was able to keep them stunned as they were running away, and root if they got too far.<br />
<br />
I tried the hole route as well. Same two characters. I fought down near the undead tower, where most everything was yellow to my shaman at 52, the mobs were harder than the fly's and the exp wasn't much different. It was pretty risky since a few times I would get several wandering add's, was up to 5 mobs at one point and had to use lay hands. They're really magic resistant deep, I wouldn't suggest doing it with just 2 characters.</div></div><hr />
