<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I'm there, bound and started hunting.  Haven't had to eat an unrezzed death yet, but I've come close.  :)<br />
<br />
Anyway, had to gate a few times ignominiously in retreat because I, well, suck.<br />
<br />
A couple of questions, and yes, I have poured through the PoM website.  <br />
<br />
1) Do the halfing guards in AiW, Brenn and Grenn (?), assist each other?  If so, successfully soloers can just root one and kill the other?  Or do you skip them?  I skipped them.<br />
<br />
2) Do the audience members in the theatre assist each other?  Do they assist Chuckles the Great?<br />
<br />
3) Solusek Ro, Tunare, Rallos Zek and Inny Puppets all are KoS.  No idea what Tunare's problem is because last I checked, I wasn't kos in PoG.  Can I just start at the end of the line, (Tribunal puppets) and work my way down?  I understand they are 32k hp mobs.  If pet is getting whacked by the 4 kos ones while I work on one, that doesn't work too good.  <br />
<br />
4) Where can I find a single gorilla to kill to get my library card?  I see 3 in one room, and I haven't tried any crazy break by rooting two of them.  <br />
<br />
5) I thought My Right Hand was actually pretty tough to kill, if that gives you some assessment of my skill.  <br />
<br />
Rorgg, you wrote a great post for folks getting started.  Nektar also had a very useful post.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, just curious to hear people's thoughts about PoM and hunting there.  I'll primarily be solo just because I'm liable to have erratic hours.  Soloing isn't as much fun, but it's what is most reasonably available to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am still bound there bro, I can show you around.<br />
<br />
As for your questions:<br />
<br />
1) Do the halfing guards in AiW, Brenn and Grenn (?), assist each other? If so, successfully soloers can just root one and kill the other? Or do you skip them? I skipped them.<br />
<br />
Yes they assist.  Yes they can be rooted and pulled to the Grink room.  The other one will forget about you if your root hold long enough for you to get to Grinks room.  Grink and Glonk will assist so make sure they are dead first.  I have done them in their room before. its tricky but once you know the drill its not too bad.<br />
<br />
2) Do the audience members in the theatre assist each other? Do they assist Chuckles the Great? <br />
<br />
Not any more<br />
<br />
3) Solusek Ro, Tunare, Rallos Zek and Inny Puppets all are KoS. No idea what Tunare's problem is because last I checked, I wasn't kos in PoG. Can I just start at the end of the line, (Tribunal puppets) and work my way down? I understand they are 32k hp mobs. If pet is getting whacked by the 4 kos ones while I work on one, that doesn't work too good. <br />
<br />
I am KOS to those puppets as well, I dont like to solo them much because its a real chore with summon AND being KOS. You have to make sure they are both slowed and WATCH your pet.  If Rallos hits you while youre fighting Inny, your pet will jump right on him before you get a chance to med up for the Rallos fight.<br />
<br />
4) Where can I find a single gorilla to kill to get my library card? I see 3 in one room, and I haven't tried any crazy break by rooting two of them. <br />
<br />
AiW 3&amp;4 Glonks for sure.  AiW 1&amp;2 Glonks may drop them.  I have one in the bank you can have I think if you dont get one by the time I see you.<br />
<br />
5) I thought My Right Hand was actually pretty tough to kill, if that gives you some assessment of my skill. <br />
<br />
I havent killed the Hands solo but have tanked them during a fight and they can be tough but if you can kill one solo, you will do well up there.  You have more then enough power to get your BP and Boots at least. <br />
<br />
Get me in game tonight if you have questions, If I am free, I will gate up and join ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i had bad luck with chuckels and the audience .. they run fast and path into the pit <br />
<br />
the puppets are warriors, i.e. the shield each other.  not sure if that will get you in trouble <br />
<br />
theres a jumbo gorilaa in a room by him self .. near dinner<br />
<br />
<br />
if your gonna spend a long day of soloing in pom ... go to the upside section .. the room with the water has 2 little halflings (green cons) kill them for the weapon .. <br />
if ya give that weapon to dogdog it increases there max hit to 72<br />
<br />
<br />
havent been there in 4 months .. things may have changed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the AiW rooms are the best place to solo. AiW 3 and 4 can drop thrones very rarely. I normally go through and kill the gorilla first (don't let him run, or the rat will assist if he gets to the door), and then the rat. Then I'll go and root one of the halflings and kill one while keeping the other rooted on the side and then kill him.<br />
<br />
Here's an excellent message board for PoM: http://pub57.ezboard.com/btheplaneofmischief</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys, that's helpful stuff.<br />
<br />
I've run AiW x2 now, and My Right Hand x2.  Definitely easily the second time as you get a feel for things.  Also dropped Chuckles the Great.  I have pulled the rat to the hallway and killed him there.  Then I pull the gorilla to the rat's room.  Except in AiW4, then I just used the gorilla's room.<br />
<br />
Got a Jester and a couple of Knight cards.  Glonk isn't dropping the library card, but good to know that he's a source.  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the link Patito.  I've been all over that I think.  It's not used much now I think.  I did print out a bunch of stuff that's extremely helpful.  I'm mighty impressed with the folks who figured this all out.  It's all I can do to read the spoilers and understand them, much less operate in a pure void.  <br />
<br />
Sorry I couldn't catch you last night Walknot.  Evenings have been pretty hard for me.  I get a couple of hours in the morning before work if I'm lucky these days.  Getting a feel for the layout finally.  Soloing is not as fun as grouping though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dead Stomples, and 12 dead Glonks and Grinks.  <br />
<br />
Only a couple of knight cards and 1 blue crown.  I guess I need to go kill the Jumbo Scholar for the library card.  <br />
<br />
I can see this is going to be a very very slow process.  <br />
<br />
Oddly, I've gotten 3 bottom rights, which I understand are the rare pieces to the Words of Wealth.  I also got a Jester off My Right Hand.  It would be nice if it functioned like a wild card and substituted for any other card in making an item.  <br />
<br />
Stomples was a pretty tough kill.  If I had KEI or cleric buffs, it certainly would have been easier, but self-buffed it was pretty close.  I can be more efficient fighting him though, so I expect it will get easier.</div></div><hr />
