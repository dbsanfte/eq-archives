<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sordar Spiritrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hit 60 a couple of days ago, and i only have focus and group focus out of our 60 spells. I'm also missing pox, VoB, and a couple of group buffs that aren't really important. Now im wondering if i could possibly solo the emp at 60 without torpor. I've got epic and JBB, no fungi. I have Bane but as i said before, no pox. So am i just a dreamer? Or is there a chance of taking him down?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">from what I've heard, he's hard to solo even with torpor, so without torpor would be a pretty long shot I think...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The only way I could see it even being close to possible is if you were a 60 troll, with regrowth on, fungi, fungi staff (but now this doesnt work so /shrug), and a 10 charge potion of the 40 hp a tick ones, as that would put you near 100 hp a tick haha...maybe even still without the staff for 85ish a tick, BUT it would be VERY hard, and you would need at least 2 indoor clickies (gob ear and 8th + ring come to mind) plus some junks so he couldnt dispel your regens.  Other than that I cant think of any way, cause he has almost killed me before and I have torpor, but havent died to him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">depends on yer soloing skills really.<br />
<br />
i find him to be a very easy kill....but i also solo the 4 arm things in ME for regular exp.<br />
<br />
if you work on your soloing skills then i think he is very doable without torpor.  with torpor...he is mearly a exp mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I really dont see how ya can take him down without torpor with no insane regen just for the reason that you wouldnt be able to cann and torpor for mana.  I mean I see how ya could stay alive with cloro but seems like staying up on mana would be really tough.  Though, if you had went back to early velious and said that a shaman could solo a dragon, most people would laugh at you.  It may be worth a shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you sneak up to him and give him some pudding he will die instantly.<br />
<br />
No joke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried to solo a 4arm once. It chain nuked me with judgement. I just zoned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">4 arms really would be a good way to test your soloing ability...they are trivial with torpor but see if you can solo one.  If you can get a cleric one down and still have ~50% mana and not almost dead then it may be possible to do emp.  Emp is much harder than them though, hits harder, more hps, and has ignite blood which really really sucks.</div></div><hr />
