<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was taken from Caster's Realm:<br />
<br />
<br />
The June issue of PC Gamer has a lot of information on the upcoming EverQuest 2 project being developed from Sony Online.  From the reading of the article the designers have learnt a lot about the world of Norrath and how they can build upon it.  This knowledge has been garnered not only from EverQuest but from many of the other MMOG's which have been released over the last three years.<br />
<br />
It's system requirements when released (currently slated for October 2003) will be a P3-733 (or Athlon XP), 512MB of Ram and GeForce 3 or higher.  It's graphics engine was developed along with that used in the upcoming Star Wars Galaxies title.<br />
<br />
The world of EQ2 is set some time into the future from the current EverQuest world.  There will be only three continents however at release.  50% of the zones will be entirely new, and 50% will be rebuilt areas of the traditional Norrath.  But the world has changed.  The article describes how Freeport has been taken over by the corrupt Freeport militia and the remnant paladins isolated in a new area known as Marr.  The Iksar still roam, but the Vah Shir have disappeared (Kerrans are however playable).<br />
<br />
Banks will no longer be global.  Rather each town will have a unique bank to be accessed, and if large amounts of goods need to be moved from one bank to another then a horse and cart or boat can be acquired for the journey.<br />
<br />
Players will be able to purchase houses.  As towns develop from the placement of houses the world will spawn guard towers and NPCs to man them to protect the towns. <br />
<br />
No stats will be assigned at creation.  Simply race, appearance and sex.  Classes and any stat assignment will occur later in the game.  At Level 6 you will pick a base class: fighter, priest, mage, rogue or tradesmen.  At Level 15 you can then specialize these classes further.  At Level 30 you will make a final specialization choice and that will determine your class for the rest of that characters life.  The current planned Level cap is 100, though it could be extended up to 200 through expansions.<br />
<br />
Items will be able to decay or break.  Items will have recommended levels, and use of items far above you will have diminished effect and a greater chance of breaking.  This is obviously to address twinking (the equipping of high level items on low level players).  Item decay will however ensure tradeskills are more viable and a greater part of the economy.  <br />
<br />
There will be 3 'skills' which enhance your character.  Knowledge, Technique and Arts.  According to the article Knowledge affects what level of items you can equip , Technique determines how well you can use weapons or items, and Arts handles more basic functions like foraging or kicking.  This system will be interesting to keep an eye on, most particularly in relation to its advancement model.<br />
<br />
The death system is still not fully determined.  The article does show however that the development team will ensure death still has a reasonably heavy penalty.  Whilst doing corpse recovery for hours will be probably become a thing of the past, death will still be a pain.  One change however is that death will simply incur an XP debt: extra experience you will need to recover before continuing to advance through your level.  This means no more loss of level from death - ever.<br />
<br />
The graphics engine apparently looks amazing and we are beginning to see the first signs of it (click here to view our gallery of EQ2 images).<br />
<br />
There is a lot more in the article which begs reading and it should be on stands within a couple of weeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm scared.  100 levels of xp grinding!  =)  Hopefully they've got the graphics engine flushed out so there aren't random framerate issues in random places for no good reason.  I hate luclin.  Will have to see when they get it out, and what competition is around at the time, but I'll probably get it a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can only guess the latest newsletter and it's clues lead to the announcement of EQ2, which suggests character transferability without guaranteeing it. Should be interesting, all us high levels will be midlevel again wearing twink gear hehe.</div></div><hr />

Move over DAOC, EQ has stolen your idea! <br />
<br />
<br />
Remind me again, how many did DAoC take from EQ in the first place? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RrumofXev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I thought the same thing, until I considered how many thing DAOC took from EQ.  A lil'bit  of turnabout is fair play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>balith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am sure with verants focus on the uber guilds over 6 person groups they will **** it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">item decay SUCKS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Generally not enthusiastic about EQ2. Sorry, VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm all about warcraft 3, star wars galaxy, and world of warcraft. then I'll probably be done with all the constant computer games. eq is getting really boring lately. not sure how much longer I can put up with it. I still have the urge to get to level 60, but it's been getting weaker and weaker lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I still have lots of goals in EQ1 before even thinking of EQ2. Just thought I'd spread the word that the announcement has been made.<br />
<br />
Seems alot of the ideas they are throwing out seem like DAoC. If it seems too much like DAoC by the time it comes out, and I've completed or nearly completed what I want to in EQ1, then I'd probably switch to DAoC if it matures more - which it should. RvR sounds nice.<br />
<br />
I actually bought DAoC, but decided it wasn't for me right now. For one my system couldn't handle it at the time, and you can't customize the interface enough to my liking, with graphic settings and such. Along with the fact my friends are still in EQ ;)<br />
<br />
I do like the idea of starting over in a new world - even though some of it's revamped. I think I had the most fun in my entire gaming experience when I was a newbie, not knowing what was out there. Turning corners and not knowing what's around them. Seeing a Hill/Sand giant for the first time, running from big Kodiak bears and such. So I would like to experience that again, if it is at all possible.</div></div><hr />
