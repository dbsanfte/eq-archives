<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A pair of shissar scaled gloves (ac12, 5wis, 40hp, 40mana) dropped in the grey last night.  I remembered a thread where several people recommended these over coldain skin gloves (ac12, 9 sta, 6 wis, 20hp, 20mana), so I equipped them and bagged my coldain skin gloves.  This cost me 5 hp, presumably in exchange for some extra mana (40mana+5wis &gt; 20mana+6wis).<br />
<br />
Seems like most shaman feel that HP is the most important stat, so I'm wondering why several people felt that shissar gloves were superior to coldain?</div></div><hr />

In some cases they will yield more hit points, in other cases less. Also the Shissar have 40 mana while the Coldain have 1 more wisdom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i went all ac/wis untill 60 , then went all hp after 62 ( and dropped some of the wisdom , not that much of a matter after cann v )..... but you really feel the need of HPs past 60 with mobs who hit for alot , and where 3 or 4 hits can kill you and where a 5th would make the difference . add to that most shaman will probably go straight for Cann V , and that AA require you to be able to kill 2K hps without blinking to work at its peak of efficiency ( and god it IS incredible ) . then you realize that if you try a lil you will find that you can really increase your hps if you tweak your equip a tad . <br />
