<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loocen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone soloed or grouped in the mines of Thurgadin? I understand that it is a 30-35 zone, but i was wondering if any shamans have been there, and what tips they might have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did all of 35 there and found it to be OK hunting. The exp was fine but the loot was poor except for the doorf heads which went for 75-150 plat a head to other players if you can find someone buying. (The heads drop off the tar goos.) If you intend to use the dog while hunting I'd recomend binding just outside the city behind the waterfall so you can try to gate out when bad things happen and the dog runs off to gather everything down there to bring back. :) This is a great zone to develop good dog control and mob management because of the tight spaces and abundant number of mobs close by.  The best hunting I found was in the lower level all the way in the back at the end of the tracks. Levitate, shrink, and invis before you enter the mines. (If you're a big race remember that when you log out or go LD when ya come back you'll be full size, I got stuck down there after going linkdead in a small tunnel and couldn't move, cast, or even sit till a nice shaman agreed to come down and shrink me.)  At the end of the tracks is a room with several tunnels branching off it. I usualy set up fido in the room to the right with the big crystal in it. Pull mobs with slow and run back to the dog. (The dog won't come running till you or your target takes damage.) I found root to be totaly useless down there, but our cold based nukes hit for full damage most allways. I found Walking Sleep to be just fine as a slow, and used my mana to nuke and self heal and just meled the mobs. (They resisted the poison based DoT's a lot.) Make shure to save enough mana to nuke the mob just before it turns around to run.  Good luck and good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kenlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went down there with C3 and SoS, thinking I would have me a big old time...but whew...<br />
<br />
I couldn't land EBreath or Scourge at ALL. It got pretty nasty with just the the pet's melee and mine, as I didn't have any nukes memmed (I think my evoc is 70 something) and Instill wasn't sticking either. <br />
<br />
I think I'm gonna try to pull with Malx next time I log on to see if that works better with the dots, as I can just not imagine fighting a mob without a dot...<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
Malise allows me to land envenomed breath easily on spiders and goos. Still can't hit it on rats. Was flushed out by a training monk before I could try a bat. In short, either gain a few levels, or make sure you have a good weapon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shmokie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definite problem with this area (for shamans) is high resistances to Poison/Disease DoT's.  Every time I went there, everything was conning blue to me, but resisted 9 out of 10 of the DoT's I cast.  Made it rather hard to solo when it was just melee damage :-P</div></div><hr />
