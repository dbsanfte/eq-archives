<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is all best guess at this point, we mucked around for a long time on the big ship in Abyssal Sea this morning and talked to every mob.  To get to the ship, wait on the left dock in Nedaria for the ferry (can also catch it in Natumbi sp but not as safe).<br />

Main Progression Quest?<br />
<br />
I think this is the main quest series because alot of the text is *yellow* i.e. same color as pop flag text.  It’s just an assumption, for all we know at this point there’s no progression at all...<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
“if you ever find yourself inside Tacvi, and you come across the remains of an adventurer, bring back what you find. For me, I would like to have the writings of Xenaida, Wijdan, Rytan, Kaikachi, Vahlara, Frizznik, Zajeer, and Valtron. As for the rest of them, I would ask that you return the memories to the six they left here on the boat.”<br />
<br />
Ok so 14 adventurers total.  Writings of 8 of them (Xenaida, Wijdan, Rytan, Kaikachi, Vahlara, Frizznik, Zajeer, and Valtron) go to De’Van Szoslek.  Writings of the other 6 (Rashere, Silius, Lyndro, Prathun, Maddoc, Absor) go to the respective NPCS listed below.<br />
<br />

De’Van Szoslek – loc -432, -229<br />

[Wed Feb 11 13:24:15 2004] De`van Szostek  focuses his attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:15 2004] De`van Szostek says 'Well, hello there. Have you come to listen to my tale of sorrow?  Please say [yes].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:18 2004] You say, 'yes'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:18 2004] De`van Szostek says 'Find a place to sit, for what I am about to tell you is a tale of fourteen great adventurers who met the full force of the Muramites head on . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:34 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:35 2004] De`van Szostek says 'When the brotherhood first arrived here, we sent out scouts to gather information about the area. Those scouts were some of our best and they were executing their task flawlessly until one day the information stopped. All of the brotherhood began to worry. We sent a young scout named Falcin to investigate.  Soon after his departure, he returned in bad condition. Falcin died shortly afterward, but not before he detailed the gruesome practices of the Muramite army. This upset many, including a group of fourteen legendary adventurers who had arrived shortly after we hit land . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:55 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:24:56 2004] De`van Szostek says 'Feeling that things were getting out of hand, these fourteen came to me and asked that I help them by telling them everything we had found out about the continent thus far. Seeing the light of determination in their eyes, I decided to reveal confidential information to them. I figured they would just leave things to us once they knew how serious the situation was, but knowledge of how dire things could become just fueled the spirit of honor within all of them. I told them that it would be brought under control by the brotherhood, but they refused to listen. They decided that the only solution was to destroy the leader of this invading force . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:13 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:14 2004] De`van Szostek says 'That morning, those of them who chose to save us said goodbye to their friends and family, and the rest -- all good friends of mine -- asked me to honor them.  They wanted me to say that I believed they would accomplish what it was they set out to do. I told them I would have a mug of ale waiting for all of them upon their triumphant return, but while I said this aloud, deep inside I knew that this would not turn out well . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:27 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:27 2004] De`van Szostek says 'The next morning I gathered all of them together and cast a spell on their leader that would allow me to communicate with him through his mind and see what he saw. So, off they went, leaving behind six of our residents -- Sophia, Verna, Irena, Jenna, Gizzmu, and Aprilia -- to wait for their return. Days passed and nights of unrest became worse and worse as visions of their battles popped into my mind. I saw them fighting through Qinimi and stalking through the sewers. I witnessed their arrival in Yxtta where they begin to have problems making it through. I saw one of them almost fall before the rest rushed to his aid and saved him. Even through all of this, they never once considered turning back . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:47 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:48 2004] De`van Szostek says 'A short time went by and my mind was oddly silent. I spent those moments trying to comfort the others as they began to ask me questions. Fearing I would reveal my worry, I reassured them that everything was fine and that our heroes would return shortly.  There was more silence and my hopes began to wane. Then, I had another vision. They were still alive and were fighting in an area with a huge crater at its center. This, I surmised, was where some kind of explosion occurred that had caused all of the destruction I'd seen. Our friends fought on through this until they finally went as far as they could go . . . [continue].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:58 2004] You say, 'continue'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:25:59 2004] De`van Szostek says 'They had finally made it to the entrance of Tacvi, the broken temple of the enslaved trusik. It was inside this temple that the trusik worshipped a false god named Trushar. It was here that the army's leader could be found, this ominous being we knew only as the Zun'Muram. It was here that I would receive my last vision and the link to my friends would disappear. The last thing I saw was all of them bruised and beaten, yet still determined to stop this threat to Norrath. Before entering the lair of the fearsome beast, they all embraced each other. That is where the visions stopped and the [mystery] began.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:26:15 2004] You say, 'mystery'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:26:15 2004] De`van Szostek says 'Well, you see. this happened some time ago and as each day passes, me and the others sink deeper into depression. With our hope quickly dying, all we can do now is pray for some sort of closure. While I do not want to fully admit it, I believe our heroes all met their demise and now I just want them to be honored in death. I have taken enough of your time and I appreciate that you listened to me. Telling the story helps me feel better, but now I must go back to wondering what has happened [unless] . . .'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:26:29 2004] You say, 'unless'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:26:30 2004] De`van Szostek says 'You seem quite interested in what I have said here and while I could be wrong, when I look at you I see a glimpse of the same honor-filled spirit I saw in them. I know it may be too much to ask, but we have all been suffering for a long time and . . . well, if you ever find yourself inside Tacvi, and you come across the remains of an adventurer, bring back what you find. For me, I would like to have the writings of Xenaida, Wijdan, Rytan, Kaikachi, Vahlara, Frizznik, Zajeer, and Valtron. As for the rest of them, I would ask that you return the memories to the six they left here on the boat. While this task is not an easy one, I shall handsomely reward anyone who returns all of these things to the proper people.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:27:17 2004] You say, 'Hail, De`van Szostek'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:27:17 2004] De`van Szostek says 'There is nothing more I can tell you. If you accomplish what I ask, then I will reward you. Until then, there is nothing left to say.'<br />
<br />
Jenna Gurell – loc -172, 240<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:57:46 2004] You say, 'Hail, Jenna Gurell'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:57:47 2004] Jenna Gurell  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:57:47 2004] Jenna Gurell says 'Please do not disturb me. I am mourning the loss of my dear Rashere. While I do not know if his fate has yet been sealed the empty feeling in my heart tells me so. If only I could see him once more, if only I could read his words again.'<br />
<br />
Verna Abella – loc -137, 220<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:58:19 2004] You say, 'Hail, Verna Abella'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:58:19 2004] Verna Abella  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:58:19 2004] Verna Abella seems to be deep in thought. She ignores you at first but eventually turns towards you with a somber look on her face. 'Forgive me. I am not much of a talker these days since Silius left on his journey with Lyndro and the others. Sitting here everyday wishing that they would return has consumed me to the point that I can do nothing else. If only I had some proof of what has happened to Silius. Anything at all would help me in this time of wonder and worry.'<br />
<br />
Sophia Florence – loc -127, 233<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:59:41 2004] You say, 'Hail, Sophia Florence'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:59:41 2004] Sophia Florence  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 12:59:41 2004] Sophia Florence wipes away a tear as she turns to face you. Hello Kylt, sorry if I seem somewhat antisocial but it has been many days since I last saw my father Lyndro and as each hour passes the possibility that he may never return becomes more apparent. While I have not given up hope it gets harder each day not to. If he is never to return to me I wish that I had something to remember him by, something that let me know he died just as brave a man as he has always been.<br />
<br />
Aprilla Marrow – loc -110, 228<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:02:01 2004] You say, 'Hail, Aprilia Marrow'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:02:02 2004] Aprilia Marrow  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:02:02 2004] Aprilia Marrow groans softly as she turns to face you. 'Please leave me be. My darling Prathun has yet to return to me and each day weakens my resolve. I know in my heart he is out there somewhere, but with no word since the day he left, I fear that my heart may be wrong. If only I had something that would let me know what has happened to him.<br />
<br />
Gizzmu the Wise – loc -254, 106<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:03:07 2004] You say, 'Hail, Gizzmu the Wise'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:03:07 2004] Gizzmu the Wise  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:03:07 2004] Gizzmu the Wise says 'Forgive me but sometimes I get so distracted when I stare out at the water here. I hate this feeling of worry that has overcome me. Here I am waiting for my son's return and yet something keeps telling me my wait is for naught. He is not coming back that is all I can think, but something keeps me hoping. I am sure you have heard our story, there are several others on this ship who have been awaiting the return of the 14 adventurers who set out to stop the Force Commander, one of them was my son Maddoc. While I am close to giving up, I would at least like to have something of his to remember him by. Something I can keep with me so I know somehow he is still looking out for me.'<br />
<br />
Irena Perera – loc -314, -176<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:27:54 2004] You say, 'Hail, Irena Pereira'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:27:54 2004] Irena Pereira  focuses her attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:27:55 2004] Irena Pereira says 'You must be the one De'van spoke to.  I'm not looking for any of your help. I know that the mighty Absor will return someday and until I am proven wrong I will continue to wait for him to arrive.'<br />

Quest Series 2<br />
I’m not sure that this is essential for progression, it seems like a really long collection quest for a nice item.<br />
<br />
Fezben (main quest giver) gives you 2 items:<br />
Vaifan's Experimental Sealer (4 slot container)<br />
A Socketed White Crystal (no stats).<br />
<br />
Completing different &quot;tasks&quot; for the 3 sub-npcs will presumably upgrade the crystal into a more powerful, useable item (charm?).<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
L'diava Rexxen<br />
Yxtta - Find and kill Xounii Resnen.  Bring &quot;proof of what happened&quot; to L`diava Rexxen.<br />
Kod'Taz - Go to Kod'Taz and speak to Kevren Nalavat. He should be able to help you access the three trials. Enter each trial and bring back anything you find of Kitren's to L'diava Rexxen.<br />
<br />
Taminoa Bialu<br />
Qinimi - I believe that the scout for this area was caught sneaking around the housing district, but I have no proof. If you were to search this area, maybe you would find some sort of sign or marker he may have left. <br />
Riwwi - Find something of Reyna's and return to Taminoa Bialu. (slaves in the area would not interact with her until she proved herself).<br />
Barindu - Find two of Talwin's journal entries and bring them back to Opury Foop.<br />
Ferubi - Find Smith Rondo and give him the farstone (supplied by Taminoa Bialu).<br />
<br />
Vaifan Cogswin<br />
Tipt - Five different types of Vaifan's Power Cell. The cells are named from A to E. When you have collected all of them, place them in this power pack (supplied by Vaifan), activate it, and return it to Vaifan Cogswin.  Cragbeasts, a pack of ghosts, numerous Muramites, and a native riddlemaster are all mentioned as possible droppers.<br />
Vexd - Collect flickering finkenheimer, a tarnished sprocket, some uncoiled springs, a greased bolt, and some connection rods. Combine 4 parts in Finkenheiemer and return to Vaifan Cogswin.<br />
Sewers - Go to the four sewer areas and find a timing gear, a rusty spring, an oiled belt, and a processing gizmo.  Combine in gearbox (supplied by Vaifan) and return report (product) to Vaifan Cogswin.<br />
<br />
Fezbin Fizzles – loc -31, 52<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:49 2004] You say, 'Hail, Fezbin Fizzles'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:50 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Greetings adventurer, have you come to explore this new [continent] we recently discovered?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:54 2004] You say, 'continent'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:55 2004] Fezbin Fizzles  focuses his attention on Kylt.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:55 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Due to some rather odd events with Calliav, we, the Wayfarers Brotherhood, were guided here to the continent we have come to call Taelosia. It is a continent which has suffered through a great magical explosion and now the native inhabitants are in dire straits. Our goal was to investigate this continent and find out more about the strange pieces of matter that we recently found in various places. All signs led us here and so we decided to build this magnificent floating city you are standing in. Unfortunately, we have found out some rather disturbing [news] recently that has all of us rather concerned.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:57 2004] You say, 'news'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:52:57 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Well, when we finished the city, we began to send out scouts to various locales all over the new continent. Right away information started to flow in. They gave us details on the layout of the land and its current inhabitants. We began to piece together this picture of the current state of things on land. Many of the reports gave details on various things like wildlife and climate as well as the local inhabitants and level of advancement. All of this seemed promising to us as we thought we might be able to talk to the natives and find out more about the strange matter that seemed to originate from this place, but then we begin to receive some very [upsetting reports].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:00 2004] You say, 'upsetting reports'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:01 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Apparently, the event that spread these strange pieces of matter all over Norrath brought with it a group of beings more horrifying than a shaved dwarf. These creatures seemed to be an organized army of some sort. They have apparently taken over the continent and enslaved the natives. Curious about this, we ordered our scouts to find out more about these beings.  Specifically, if they could be reasoned with and if they knew anymore about the odd chunks of rock we found recently. Shortly after we made this demand, everything [stopped].'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:11 2004] You say, 'stopped'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:12 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'The scout reports stopped coming in. We figured that maybe they had just not found anything yet, but as time went by we began to worry. That's when Morden suggested that we send someone to find one of them and learn what was going on. Young Falcin did not know what he was getting into when he volunteered to check things out for us. Falcin left here under the light of a full moon and returned soon after barely able to breathe. He had been caught spying on the beings that currently control the continent. They had tortured him for hours trying to get information. Being the resourceful human he is, he managed to escape only to be mauled by what the natives call ukun, a humanoid creature that is twisted and lethal. Left for dead, Falcin dragged himself back to us and explained what he had [discovered] during his ordeal.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:32 2004] You say, 'discovered'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:32 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Falcin told us that all of the scouts had been captured and were either dead or were enduring extreme torture sessions. These invading beings are a vicious lot who show absolutely no mercy. Falcin's wounds were proof enough of that. Falcin explained that the scouts who were still alive are being held near where they had been discovered. Those who he could not find he assumed were dead but he still tried to get some proof before he wrote them off. Unfortunately Falcin would not live to see his desire through, he passed on shortly after revealing this information to us and now we are at a loss as to how we can help our scouts who are still living return to us and provide a proper burial for those who were lost. We cannot afford to send anyone else out there as it seems it will require a significant force in order to have any chance of accomplishing the [task] we need completed.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:51 2004] You say, 'what task'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:53:51 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'With half of our numbers back home dealing with the investigation of the recently unearthed dungeons and the rest here on the ship handling what information we have and trying to decide the best plan of action, Morden figured it might be a good idea to ask some courageous individuals to assist us. Morden has authorized some form of valuable reward for those who can bring us any information regarding our missing scouts or the scouts themselves. Seeing as how you have been so interested in all I have said so far, do you think you would be interested in helping the Wayfarers Brotherhood?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:54:13 2004] You say, 'i am interested in helping the wayferers brotherhood'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:54:13 2004] You have received the 'Breakdown in Communication' quest.  Now you must find those mentioned by Fezbin and help them the best you can. If at any point you find you have made a mistake in your scouting, please return to Fezbin and say, &quot;I need to rescout (zone name)&quot; and he will reset your status in that zone. If you lose your reward at any point, return to Fezbin and hail him and he should give you the appropriate reward based on your level of progress.<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:54:14 2004] Fezbin Fizzles says 'Most excellent. Please take these as a token of our gratitude. It is not much to look at now, but by helping us you will find ways to make this stone more [powerful] when combining it with certain items in that sealer. Please take the time to find Taminoa Bialu, Vaifan Cogswin, and L`diava Rexxen. They are all located on this ship. Each of them is responsible for information from certain areas of the continent. Taminoa has all the information on the city area, Vaifan keeps the information on the mountain passes, and L`diava collects information on the temple areas. If you truly wish to help us, talk to some or all of them and they will help guide you to the right path. When you have finished helping them all, return to me and I shall give you the reward that has been approved by Morden.'<br />
<br />
Note he gives 2 items at this point:<br />
Vaifan's Experimental Sealer (4 slot container)<br />
A Socketed White Crystal'<br />
<br />
Also, speaking to any of the 3 NPCs he mentions before you speak with Fezbin results in... nothing.  You must speak with Fezbin first.<br />
<br />
L’diava Rexxen – loc -51, -55<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:57:51 2004] You say, 'Hail, L`diava Rexxen'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:57:51 2004] L`diava Rexxen says 'Yes, yes.  What is it I can do for you? I am a very busy woman and do not have a moment to waste on just anyone. Are you one of the adventurers sent here by Fezbin?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:58:08 2004] You say, 'yes'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:58:09 2004] L`diava Rexxen says 'Very good. You are just in time. I am in need of immediate assistance in the temple areas known as [Yxtta] and the [frightful temple], Kod'Taz. While our scouts have been missing for quite some time, I recently received some information that leads me to believe they may still be alive. Which one we help first is up to you. Which area do you wish to investigate?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:58:13 2004] You say, 'yxtta'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:58:13 2004] L`diava Rexxen says 'Yxtta is one of three smaller temple areas where a group of natives known as the trusik used to worship a god called Trushar. We do not know who this god is, but we believe he is a false god centered around a belief in natural destruction. Xounii Resnen was the scout assigned to this area. She was given this task because of her expertise in shapeshifting. I told her to take the shape of a trusik native and interact with them to find out more information. She managed to fit in quite well. Perhaps too well.  Gradually, reports came less frequently until they eventually stopped. While everyone feared she had suffered the same fate as the other scouts, I think she started to believe she was really a trusik and has abandoned her assignment.  What I need you to do is go there and find her.  Now, be careful, the trusik are not a friendly race of beings and they are even more irritated by the invasion of the Muramite army. When you find Xounii I fear she may attack you. If this happens, I will not fault you for defending yourself, but if it comes to this I want some form of proof as to what happened.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:59:06 2004] You say, 'frightful temple'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 13:59:07 2004] L`diava Rexxen says 'Kod'Taz is made up of multiple temples that were once used for worship by the trusik natives. Many of them have since been destroyed or made into strongholds for the Muramite army. Due to the sheer size of this area, we sent a scouting force there to investigate. All of them are still alive, save one, named Kitren Lanom. None of the scouts left in the area know what happened to her or her belongings. Last time they remember seeing her was when she entered the Temple of Tri-Fates in an attempt to pass the temple trial. Please go to Kod'Taz and speak to Kevren Nalavat. He should be able to help you access the three trials. You will have to enter each trial and bring me back anything you find of Kitren's from each temple. Even though the scouts there have searched many times for something, I think a fresh set of eyes may help some. Kevren is the only one who knows you are helping me. Please do not let the others know you were sent by me. I have not yet ruled out the possibility of foul play and if they are aware of your affiliation, it may place you in more danger.'<br />
<br />
Taminoa Bialu – loc -84, 26<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:11 2004] You say, 'Hail, Taminoa Bialu'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:12 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'Greetings. You must be one of the adventurers that Fezbin told me about. It is a pleasure to meet such a brave individual. Where are my manners? My name is Taminoa Bialu and I compile all the information from our scouts in the [city] area of Taelosia.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:15 2004] You say, 'what city'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:15 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'Well, it appears the native inhabitants of Taelosia lived in a grand city once. This city is made up of four different areas named in their language. They are [Qinimi], [Riwwi], , and [Ferubi]. Based off of early information, we believe each area had a specific purpose. I am still trying to decipher the native language to figure out what the names mean, but going off of visual information I can assume that Qinimi served as their court, Riwwi is where they held games, Barindu was a lush garden, and Ferubi was a central place of worship once. That is about the extent of my information as far as the intended purpose of each area. What they are now used for I can explain in further detail. Which area would you like to hear more about?'<br />

[Wed Feb 11 14:00:20 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'It appears the Muramites have made this some sort of stronghold. Destroying many of the native symbols, the invaders have converted the building that once served as the court into fortified headquarters. It is here you will find a structure called the Chamber of Souls, various pens to hold ukun, and a moat of sickly black sludge. The structures that the nihil once called home are all but destroyed now.  Very sad indeed. That's where the legion keeps the bulk of the [slaves]. I believe that the scout for this area was caught sneaking around the housing district, but I have no proof. If you were to search this area, maybe you would find some sort of sign or marker he may have left. That would be helpful.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:24 2004] You say, 'slaves'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:25 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'I see Fezbin saved some of the more dismal news for me. The legion has enslaved the natives of the continent. In the city area, these slaves are used mainly for menial tasks. Due to their fragile bodies, they cannot do any heavy lifting, but their knowledge of shaping stone makes them perfect for building new structures for the legion to use as well as altering current ones. They command the stone workers. I am not sure how the slaves are used in the temple areas.  That information is held by L`diava.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:22 2004] You say, 'riwwi'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:00:22 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'Riwwi has to be the most interesting of all of the city areas. You see, this is where the coliseum is located. Now, we are not completely aware of how it was used before this invading army took up residence in the area, but now it is used for the merciless slaughter of the nihil. Early reports from our scout, Reyna, indicate that the slaves in the area would not interact with her until she proved herself. How she was able to do this I am not sure, but I would suggest trying to find something of Reyna's while I go over my Riwwi information. Come back to me when you find something.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:01:15 2004] You say, 'barindu'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:01:15 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'This area holds the remains of what was once a place to build stone workers. We can only guess what purpose this part of the city served and all we know now is that it is home to some of the cruelest acts of violence against the nihil. I assigned this area to Talwin, a young wood elf new to the brotherhood.  He was a proven scout eager to assist. Initially things were going well, but the information he was sending was not helping much.  I think this worried him and resulted in him pushing his luck a little far. Ever since I told him his reports were lacking the vital evidence we needed I have not heard from him. Before Falcin passed on, I asked him if he had found anything out about Talwin and he shook his head. I know Talwin is still alive . . . he has to be . . . and I know that there must be some clues in the area of Barindu somewhere. He was diligent about recording what he found so I would assume that if he has been captured that his writings must be lying around the area somewhere. See if you can find two of his journal entries and bring them back to me. When you return please give what you find to my assistant Opury Foop. She is trying to help me organize my reports a little better.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:01:22 2004] You say, 'ferubi'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:01:22 2004] Taminoa Bialu says 'The area called Ferubi was once a Taelosian temple. Now it is a place that reeks of pain and suffering. The invading army has desecrated the temple and the slaves within endure unimaginable torture. Based on the information our scout Smith Rondo sent to me before his disappearance, the invaders use this area to craft weaponry and conduct strange experiments. Smith's ability to sneak in and out of places quickly made him the ideal choice for this job, but like most of our other scouts he eventually got caught trying to reveal a vital piece of information. We have confirmed that he is still alive and I need you to go find him and give him this. It is a special farstone attuned to his aura so only he can use it. Please make haste in your mission, but be careful. You are entering the lion's den and if you are caught, I cringe to think what will happen.'<br />

[Wed Feb 11 14:02:12 2004] Vaifan Cogswin says 'Well, hello traveler. You here to help with the scout problem we've been having?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:02:16 2004] You say, 'yes'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:02:16 2004] Vaifan Cogswin says 'Good to hear. I have been going out of my skull trying to tinker another one to find the first. Now that you are here, I can stop that and focus on compiling the information I already have. Let me tell you, being in charge of something like this is very taxing on the nerves. I remember being a young gnome and whenever I tinkered something it worked the first time. Ah, how good it felt to put the Cogswin family emblem on my wonderful creations. Nowadays it seems like everything I make has some intermittent flaw or defect. I might have to accept that I am getting old and a little slow, but I still have the wits to invent. I should stop rambling and get to the point. I am in charge of scouting the mountain areas known as [Tipt], [Vxed], and the [sewers] under the city. Which would you like to know about?'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:02:33 2004] You say, 'tipt'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:02:33 2004] Vaifan Cogswin says 'The mountainous areas of this continent hold many dangers within them. Tipt in particular is thick with members of the invading army, dangerous creatures, and the angry spirits of nihil refugees. Looking at the information I have, the clockwork scout tried to take a direct path to the other side of Tipt and had some serious problems.  Apparently, it had a run in with some cragbeasts, a pack of ghosts, numerous Muramites, and a native riddlemaster. While he made it pretty far, he took significant damage each step of the way. My last report received for this area stated that it was returning to the Vxed area to recover, but had lost multiple power cells in the process. I need you to retrieve these power cells. They are vital to rebuilding the scout and getting that report. There are five different types of cells, each one is called Vaifan's Power Cell -- named after the most ingenious gnome there is, of course. The cells are named from A to E. When you have collected all of them, place them in this power pack, activate it, and return it to me.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:03:12 2004] You say, 'vxed'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:03:12 2004] Vaifan Cogswin says 'We have discovered that this continent holds many dangerous creatures, including the strange beings of the invading army. Many of these beasts can be found in the mountain area called Vxed. After being severely damaged in Tipt, the clockwork scout made its way back to Vxed to perform self maintenance, but I believe this is where it met its final demise. While the chance is slim, I believe you may be able to salvage enough of the parts from the creatures within Vxed to reassemble the frame. What you will need to find is a flickering finkenheimer, a tarnished sprocket, some uncoiled springs, a greased bolt, and some connection rods. When you have them all place, the sprocket, springs, bolt, and rods in the finkenheimer and bring me the result. I must warn you to be careful though. If these things could stop my clockwork, they must be pretty powerful creatures.'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:03:19 2004] You say, 'sewers'<br />
[Wed Feb 11 14:03:20 2004] Vaifan Cogswin says 'According to my records here, the sewers are a pretty vile area.  Filled with some strange creatures, I hear.  So, being the genius that I am, I came up with a plan to use a prototype clockwork scout I built when we were having problems exploring the catacombs in Mistmoore. He appeared to be working fine.  I received constant detailed reports on the sewers and mountain areas until one day it stopped. For some time I tried to make contact with the clockwork, but nothing. I started working on a second one to retrieve the first when Falcin stumbled onto the boat. In his struggle to get back to us he had to make his escape through the sewers.  While going through there, he found this. This is the reporting module used by the clockwork scout. It does not look like much now, but you should have seen it when Falcin gave it to me.  I have repaired most of the damage in an attempt to access the information stored within, but there are four vital components missing. I need you to go to the four sewer areas and find a timing gear, a rusty spring, an oiled belt, and a processing gizmo.  When you have them all, place them inside the gearbox and combine them.  Once this has been done, the gearbox should give you a report. Return the report to me.'<br />
