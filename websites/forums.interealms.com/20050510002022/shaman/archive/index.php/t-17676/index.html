<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Snarlfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I went back to playing my shaman after about 9 months of not playing him. I was invited to an LDoN group and off we went. I was main slower. Chanter malo'd and cast haste, mezzed, etc. So my only job really was to buff and slow.<br />
<br />
The mission was to kill 50 mobs in 90 mins. We completed it with plenty of time to spare. The problem I am wondering about is this:<br />
<br />
Is it normal to be CONSTANTLY cannibalizing during a run like this? I mean, I never sat down to med because I was constantly cannibalizing (don't count my sitting to canni-dance). I think I wore out my hotkey on this run. I'm not sure whether this is normal or whether my wis/mana is way too low.<br />
<br />
Here is my magelo: http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=365942<br />
<br />
I am not guilded and don't have any plat to speak of so upgrades are gonna be very few and far between if this is what I need to do to be effective. =/<br />
<br />
Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know when I do LDoN if I do not have KEI then its cann the entire time.  If I have a kei I can slack a little or even add a bit of damage.  The rule of thumb for me in LDoN seems to be 40 mana.  No matter what I do I seem to hover at around 40 the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Snarlfang, you need to upgrade your rings, mask and earrings as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
As far as the medding vs. cannabalizing...that should be the usual shaman modus operandi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Unless you have lots of FT and/or mana regen buffs like Po9, KEI/Tranq/VoQ, SD... Yeah, you're going to be cannibalizing a lot since you generally do LDON at a fast pace.   Since you're only 52 you obviously don't have Canni4 or 5 yet which is why you probably feel like it's a pain in the ass to keep up.  Once you get canni4 it won't be so bad and with canni5 it'll be a TON easier to keep up.  Them's just the breaks at lower levels.  It'll get better, have hope!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Same here.  Even with KEI, if you decide to add any damage besides what doggy is doing, then debuff/slow mob (you do get resists in LDoN), buff and regen on group keep my mana around 30-40% with lots of canni.  Of course, I'm only lvl 53 and only have canni 1, so I hope this gets better next level when I get canni 3 (already in bank :) ).  <br />
<br />
I had a very similar situation last adventure.   Had a very good chanter and healer and great dps (Pally, Ranger, BST), so all I really did was slow, debuff when necessary, and buff.  Was ready to spot heal, but never needed, cleric actually got bored (quick kills and good pulling kept damage low).  Although doggy and I were doing our part, I actually felt underutilized, since I did not need to heal, haste or CC.<br />
<br />
But, bottom line, is that all team members were happy I was there and as a group we did a great job.  <br />
<br />
I also noticed that while I was canning, the chanter was sitting (cleric was in melee mode, she was that underutilized).  So you can sit or canni, but in the fast paced world of LDoN, you will be using mana at a quick rate, so some regen is essential, and normal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LorriLou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree.  I am constantly canni-ing in Ldon...it's so fast paced.  And there are resists there too...some mobs in EF have resisted my slow 4 times in a row.  Make sure you have KEI or better, and at least a 9, along with some good equipment.  With a good enough group you shouldn't have a problem.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I know I have some serious upgrades to do, but, like I said, no guild, and no money. I haven't played in over 9 months, so, in that time a lot has changed, including gear. Any suggestions on a tighter than tight budget?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Personally, I wish SOE would remove the sound effect for cannibalize. The number one thing I dislike about my shaman is the CONSTANT ANNOYING SOUND of cannibalization, lol. <br />
<br />
In LDoN I continually cannibalize even with KEI and other mana buffs. Having mana buffs means I have extra mana for DoTs or DDs over an above my usual slows, debuffs, malos, heals and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I never sat down to med because I was constantly cannibalizing  <br />

You did well because real shaman don't sit to med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">go to rathe mountains and spend a few days killing giants. depending on how many ppl are there you can easily make 350-600p in a few hours time, or go do the boats in LoY, also check my magelo to get a few ideas, the rust encrusted bracer dropped off one og the boats, my shield I got for around 500p and the BP I picked up for 2k, the sleeves for 1800p, also add me to your friends list as we are on the same server and I will partner with you and there are a few more places we can go to get some good stuff...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have FT 1 from the Earring of the Solstice and always have KEI on for LDoN and I still canni constantly (mostly because I'm in canni1 hell awaiting release at 54 with canni3...2.5 more yellows to go).  Once I have canni3 I won't have to canni quite as much.<br />
<br />
LDoN is fast paced...so anything you can do to gather more mana is good.  At lower levels I used a slow that was one step down from my biggest slow and kept one even lower memmed too (in case the first was resisted I could cast the other instead of waiting on recast time).  At lower levels I didn't really need my biggest slow since most critters got mowed down pretty quick and critter damage output wasn't that extreme.<br />
<br />
At 53 I use the big slow from 51 as mana cost isn't as much a factor for me at this point, it casts faster (and the people said 'yay'), battles often last longer (more value out of the spell), and critter damage output is scaling up so the more slowed the better for relieving the cleric, who is often doing pac in addition to healing.  I still keep the next lower slow memmed for times when I'm resisted, running a bit low on mana (like when I redo tank buffs on-the-fly and need to conserve mana a little), times when an accidental multi-pull occurs and I want to root/slow a bunch of critters in a hurry, etc (I've found on many occasions that if I can root/slow adds in a bad pull it can make the difference between easily surviving and wipeout (this is if there's no mezzer - and once slowed it's easy to reroot critters that break root and aggro me)).<br />

<br />
If you are not standing and casting something 95% of the time(including canni) something is wrong.  If you have extra manna, Nuke.  If you are short on mana, canni.  <br />
<br />
The only time i've ever sat in LDoN is when we had a partial wipe and i was FM, waiting for rezz's so i could buff again... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">In LDON the goal is generally to dump as much mana as possible onto mobs in order to kill them as fast as possible.  Not cannibalizing = not regenning mana = not able to dump more mana.<br />
<br />
Our typical LDON group is warrior ranger ranger shaman cleric +1.<br />
<br />
Both rangers, myself, and cleric own manastones and will bolt outside to regen mana back up after blowing it all.  The rangers are able to do *insane* damage doing this and we're able to complete slaughters in 16-20 minutes.<br />
<br />
It's pretty bad when a shaman owns a manastone but shrug its faster = more damage I can do = faster xping.  As we get deeper into a dungeon then I'll start chain canni'ing as the time to run to the exit and back outweighs the benefits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Think of it this way... you will never have enough mana no matter what you do.  A good shaman will be keeping his melee alive and dealing any damage he can with his mana regen.  It doesnt matter if you dont have PotN, VoQ, C5, C4, MC3.  A good shaman should be canna as much as possible to maximize his mana regen and dump it as fast as he can to help the group also.  It just means that the guy w/o all the goodies only slows or heals instead of dealing damage also.  If you ask any sham on these boards (and many of them have very good gear) they will say that with all the goodies they will still canna every time it pops so that they can deal extra damage.  Not cannabilizing just means that you are not dealing all the damage you could be.  <br />
<br />
We are a very busy class in LDoN.  That is why anyone that says they run a sham and another class in LDoN just tells me that they are slacking on one class or the other.  I run my sham / rogue in LDoN and admit that I'm not 100% as effective as I could be.  Things just go way way too fast to keep up the attention deserved to both classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">In LDoN I often don't even bother slowing .. mobs drop so quick its almost not worth it .. DPS seems more important for some groups ... if you have wimpy melee .. well ya got to slow then.<br />
<br />
I'm on Bristlebane also .. so look me up if you have any questions .. can look on my vendor for some old stuff if its not already gone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is normal for me to be constantly cannibalizing when I'm grouped, unless I am casting something else.  I don't sit and med.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grunx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm always canning in a LDoN mission. But then I am just about always canning.<br />
<br />
I'm normally the healer as well as the slower in the regular group I do missions with, so I am normally pretty busy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have mostly /Bazaar gear or stuff that I have looted on my own but I am by no means gimp or in need of a hand...I CONSTANTLY cann, even with KEI+ and find that probably 75% of the time when cann 5 has refreshed I am hitting it.....of course I am slowing each mob, and depending on the area (Tak and Miraguls mobs are the worst for resists) having to Malo and/or attempt to land slow again; then of course I toss in a Anathema (dont have Bane or Blood yet) or a Tears and add spot heals where and when its needed.<br />
Doing this, I hover in the 50% range on mana, sometimes more sometimes less, just depends on how fast a particular mob dies or if we have crowd control and the skill of the controler......if I have to root park a lot, my DPS is for crap.<br />
Just be glad we have cann, I much prefer it to mod rods (which I have had to use on my ranger and SK) and it sure as heck beats sit aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Myst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Thats what we do in LDoN Snarlfang if you find that you are not casting something for more than a couple of seconds something is wrong or the puller needs to get busy.   :p   Something should be going off all the time be it Malo, Slow, Debuff, Heals, buffs etc...  If you don't have Stoicism yet http://www.interealms.com/shaman/guides/stoicism.html this spell will help you quite a bit and it isn't hard to do, just maybe a little time consuming.  You should look for a set of http://www.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=15399 rings, they are usually pretty cheap in the bazaar these days and would be a major upgrade for you.  Goodluck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Koushirou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unless a group is super-fast paced, I'll usually still cast slow on everything.  My typical routine is to slow first, then start meleeing and canni while I melee, then nuke once I get back to FM, which usually doesn't take too long.  I always have KEI and regen on for the larger mana pool because it does help.  But, this way, unless I'm doing rebuffs, I'm pretty much always FM or close to it.</div></div><hr />

Its amazing how often I group with other shaman and they never canni! I never stop and even with KEI and dividing shaman duties, don't see how they can keep their mana up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yep just about every time there has been 2 shaman in the group and whichever role I get put into -- I am constantly canniing and doing at least TWICE what the other shaman does... Other shamen make me sad ;)<br />
<br />
As for groups that are fast enough or simply well equipped enough that they do not take much damage and you want to do mana elsewise...  Waking Sleep is your friend...  It is only 60 mana and DOES make a noticable difference in the attack speed of the monsters(35%).  The other possibility is tagars at 125 mana for 50% slow.  Tugurs for 250 is not always the best use of mana when monsters just go splat fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I've attually caught myself canni'ing at FM.... LOL dam that wasted mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Man, I'm sitting here reading this post and my hand is hurting from hitting the canni button, and I haven't even hunted today. You can get away with just slowing, and then just sit on your butt the rest of the time, but with canni you can actually do some damage too.<br />
No matter what else you may be using for mana, you should always use canni. Thats just that much more mana you have to do other stuff of use to your group.<br />
And yes, I too have caught myself hitting canni when I'm already at full mana, its such a habit that I do it whenever I find myself not doing something else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I am always canni dancing in ldon. I just hit 50 and no canni 2 yet :( so no uber mana regen, but with kei and canni dance I can usually keep up most of the adventure and even add some dots to most mobs. course im twinked terribly for my lvl hehe. just remember canni dancing is your friend !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Man, I'm sitting here reading this post and my hand is hurting from hitting the canni button, and I haven't even hunted today<br />
<br />
Heh... I took a page out the Ranger book... the page there they set up a gamepad to auto-attack Archery.  I set up a gamepad to auto-cast Canni IV every six seconds.  Press button to start &quot;auto-wince&quot;, press button to stop, and no problems interrupting it when you have to.  Works great.  Just don't go afk auto-wincing. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As for rings you could look into doing a few quests for them like I did. Regal Band of Bathized isnt too bad with the 25hp ds and the 85hp only bad thing is it has 5 charges and you constantly have to go get it recharged. Another one that would be good for you is Signet of Grisk decent wis, hp, and mana plus regen. Maybe when you hit around 57-58 you can get a group and go to Chardok B and do the Golem Heart Ring (Ac10 str20 sta15 wis10 hp70 mana50) which IMHO is the best shaman ring in the game. of course i threw a wis 6 on mine so i got 16 wis instead of 10  :p <br />
As for BP and Shield, easiest thing you could do is get a group and head to CT and farm Tae Ew Blood. You need 2 for the Shield and one for the BP. You could also get the legs for one more blood if you want. Then just get the rest of the components and go find a nice person to do the combines for you. Alot of people these days seem to do them free if you provide the materials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">65 shaman here and i almost never stop canning on a LDoN adventure. On these adventures your always pushing yourselves to move as fast as you can and part of our arsenal is the Cannibalize line, its specificaly made for this.<br />

You did good, welcome to real shamanhood.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
Hotkey can be your friend btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 51<br />
/cast 3<br />
/pause 51<br />
/cast 3<br />
<br />
51 basicly = 5.1 seconds.  3 = 3 seconds  1 = 1 and so fourth. Itll never be as good as not using a hotkey and when it gets heavy i just move the gem back in the hotkey place, but you can save yourself alot of work with it in any case.</div></div><hr />
