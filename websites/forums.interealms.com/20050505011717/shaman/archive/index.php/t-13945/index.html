<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korsib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, as far as I can tell, this is a pretty old question, and I have heard many different answers, and not quite sure which one to believe.  The question has to do with wis and int while tradeskilling.  Basically, I've heard stuff like wis increases your chance of suceeding, and int increases your skill ups, or whichever one is higher effects it and the other one will have no effect.  I am basically wondering if there is a 'set' system that has been tested or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only thing that effects your sucess is your skill versus the items trivial level.<br />
<br />
For skillups your wisdom or int effects your skill up rate, whichever is higher. Some tradeskills use a secondary stat, for smithing its your wis, int OR str, whichever is higher that effects your skill up rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has been tried and tested over at eqtraders.com and to a degree confirmed by the developers. However most people feel that getting your stats as high as you can before doing any important combines couldn't hurt. Personally I give myself an Avatar before doing any combines &quot;just in case&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cahyre kitty</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There's all kinds of info on this at www.eqtraders.com that will go into all the details. Basically get either your wis or int high as can be for increased chance of successes and skill ups - either one works equally as well. A few trades might use strength or dex for additional modifiers but generally as a shammy I keep HoS/focus and charisma (for sell/buy prices) up and get my Wis high as possible for trades. A KEI is helpful for the Wis boost. Bear form also helps Wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've only done alchemy and baking so nothing to fret about, but for shaman increase your wis =&gt; cap to get skillups, and skillups are the only thing that can help with successes (and luck). BUT if I spend 10k on materials I would FA myself and CHA myself and bust out sta + raid buffs.. can't hurt :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ya always gotta do the avatar while doing combines, its probly all in my head but i think it helps hehe<br />
<br />
skill mods help alot too, the 15% tailoring mod from shei and the 15% smithing hammer/gloves/belt will help ya churn thur them with ethereal combines<br />
<br />
i went from like 192 smithing to 212 in under 30 mins,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I recently started smithing, and brewing as well(since smithing used some brewed items). My smithing is 145 and brewing is 162. Smithing goes up extremely quickly, like a skill up every few combines, though sometimes there are some rough spots. Brewing however went up very very slow, but it was dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
I've got a 5% hammer for smithing and a 5% thing for brewing. I always cast bear form on myself, as well as hos and rage, and KEI if I can get it. But when smithing I've got 252 strength, and my wisdom without C3 is 174. So yeah, either strength does effect smithing, or I'm just lucky. :)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, somewhat off topic here, anyone know a cheap way to get from 145 to 160  or so in smithing without farming stuff? I don't really have much time to farm items, and I have about 125p to my name. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The only skill that uses something other than INT or WIS for a learning rate is Smithing, and smithing can use strength as well. This was publicly stated by Verant quite a while ago, (but if you joined us since then you might not know :) ) and has been tested extensively by EQ traders. <br />
<br />
In summary, whether or not you get a skill up is determined by the following: <br />
<br />
Smithing = WIS or INT or STR<br />
All other tradeskills = WIS or INT<br />
Random Number Generator (RNG)<br />
<br />
Wether or not you have a successful combine is determined PURELY on: <br />
<br />
Your skill level compared to the trivial of the item<br />
Random Number Generator (RNG)<br />
<br />
On any item there is always the possibility of failure of 5% regardless of skill, that cannot be lowered by any means. The only combines that are NO FAIL are some combines for quests. Hope this helps, and happy tradeskilling.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true. DEX has been proven to help with Fletching.</div></div><hr />

What stats do for tradeskills:<br />
http://mboards.eqtraders.com/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=31<br />
<br />
The basics: <br />
INT &amp; WIS: whichever of the two is higher will affect skill increases when practicing any tradeskill. The higher either your INT or WIS is, the greater the chance you have for a skill gain while tradeskilling. <br />
<br />
CHA: higher charisma, along with faction, will affect your buying and selling prices with merchants. <br />
<br />
Exceptions to the above: <br />
Smithing: skill increases for smithing are determined by INT, WIS or STR, whichever is higher. <br />
<br />
Fletching: skill increases for fletching are determined by INT, WIS or DEX, whichever is higher. <br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting: skill increases for jewelcrafting are determined by INT, WIS or DEX, whichever is higher. <br />
<br />
While tailoring has been mentioned several times as needing DEX, at last check it was still not implemented. <br />
<br />
<br />
Stats have no impact on your chance of success or failure when practicing tradeskills. (Only your current skill is supposed to impact your chances of success or failure when creating an item.)</div></div><hr />
