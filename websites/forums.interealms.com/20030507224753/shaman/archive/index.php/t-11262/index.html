<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did 55/56 on Katta guards, but I have a jbb and horse (no epic).  You could also try HK, but at 55 there are enough L.blues that its not insane exp anymore - and its more highly contested than katta.  If you're wary of losing katta faction, camp nathyn's guards - killing them actually raises other katta factions.  The hole is a good zone with a 25% exp bonus, but be aware of adds here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dulak is an easy camp. I go in invised and veer off to the right. Just before you hit a building you will see a scout spawned. Back up just abit to get out of aggro range. Make a dog and buff him.  Pull the scout (green or light blue) w/ a slow , root and let dog eat him.After that run out and pull w/ slow. Avoid scouts as most are green or light blue and root likes to break on them. These drop random gems (best is diamond ,so far) and weapons that sell for 3-5pp. They are easy to kill and rarely resist slow. I hit w/ an ebolt and if i have extra mana I'll add a second to speed up the kills. Another thing is if you get an extra add or 2 , dont panic they are way easy to kill. Exp is ok and loot isnt bad.<br />
<br />
P.S. Very low aggro range, even with the wierd pathing they never bring friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, I just went to Dulak, and got 1% every other kill at 57.  With alpha dog, C3, and other toys if you have them (epic, jbb, etc.) one can kill almost an entire ship of pirates before they respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">can I ask how you guys are navigating through these LoY zones, I can't find any map information on how to reach or the good camp locations of these Dulak and Gunthak zones.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how others do it, I just invis into zone and look around. Keep gate loaded in case of problems, and call trains if you have to. lol. Not the best method, maybe, but it seems to work. Dulak is pretty easy to get around, I just hollered and asked how to get to it once I was in Gunthak.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MadWitchdoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oddly enough i was once in th same position you are in, having a difficult time finding a spot to solo for exp much less cash as it seems all of the usual shaman soloing spots for lvl 55+ are perma camped not just by shaman anymore...<br />
<br />
So i did a little exploration as often i am prone to do when my lizard brain flatlines from boredom.. heres what i did, though the method may vary depending on your race if your KOS or not the result is the same..<br />
<br />
As an iksar i am KOS but i had heard much talk about Jagged pines.. so i went to see it for myself while helping a guild cleric with their final badge of courage.. <br />
<br />
Get kei first then go to qeynos hills. Invis yourself in qeynos hills, and run through sure fall glade and zone into jagged pines.. once inside jagged pines head north east from town until you see a cave opening with gnolls.. keep an eye out for defiler and oracle gnolls.. they can see through invis but most are warriors and can't..<br />
<br />
Follow the the tunneling leading into the caverns until you hit the first intersection.. go right and follow that until you come to a second intersection.. go right once again and keep following that tunel until you fall down a pit with an illusionary floor... don't worry at your lvl and guessing you have at least decent armor for your lvl you will survive the fall with minimal damage..<br />
<br />
at the bottom of the pit you will see that your inside of a tunnel.. and should see at least 1 gnoll in the tunnel.. as long as you don't move towards him you will be out of agro range giving you time to drop invis, buff up, including regen and summon Dyno Mutt.. buff dyno mutt up and regen /haste him as well and med back to full or canni up depending on your masochistic you are.. once your full mana and hp's again your ready to begin your long hunt..<br />
<br />
Pull the gnoll with slow, root him and back away while letting dyno mutt eat his lunch, stack a Dot like envenomed bolt on top of him and just keep the gnoll rooted, slowed and doted until he dies.. this is just your break into to the main cavern.. once your past this gnoll you can move in to an area that slopes up.. here there are 3 gnolls evenly spaced apart..<br />
these will be your night long victims..<br />
<br />
All of the gnolls have short agro range, so you don't need to worry about anything as long as you keep them rooted during combat and especially if they try to run.. at lvl 55 most are Dark blue cons until you hit 57... Most of them should be warriors and they hit very hard in hth melee.. defiliers (necro's) use standard necro based spells and often fear your pet so having summon companion up during a fight helps.. oracles being gnoll shaman mostly use scourge or malaise so it's best to take down defilers and oracles first..  killing the gnolls also gives you positive faction with with the jagged tree folk so eventually after hundreds of kills you'll be able to bank in town if your initally KOS..<br />
<br />
repeat the killing cycle of these 3 gnolls (very bottom near tunnel entrance, side of hill, very top of hill)  using the same method as the first gnoll and you will be lvl 57 in no time.. the gnolls are on about a 4 or 5 min spawn timer so you won't be bored very often and gives you plenty of time to recover mana..<br />
<br />
they typically drop about 4 - 6 plat each as well as crude weapons that sell for about 7 plat a pop and occasionally drop magic items and sabretooth forged armor.. the armor drops sell for around 70 plat a shot..<br />
<br />
You don't need an epic, Jbb or horse for any of this.. i didn't have any when did it.. Exp is fast and very good not to mention the loot is excellent.. <br />
<br />
once you hit 56 and get bane of nife it becomes even easier as the mobs die faster..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>MadWitchdoctor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm not sure how much Xp% per kill it would be at 55, since i started doing it at the begining of 56 but i know at 56 i was getting 2-3% Xp per kill..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well I have been living in this zone ever since I hit 51. I have been in the pit till I hit 55 and got a few yellows into 55. I now have 3 aa from killing these dame things and maxed faction with the people of JP as well as darkpaw's not liking much any more. I have told many of my friends to come with me to this spot(the pit) but no one seems to care much about this great cash cow of exp and pp. I am guessing the biggest problem would be that it is not so tuff to get to but getting out could be hell....<br />
<br />
Getting out if your a none gater class is tuff cause the caster mobs see thru invis and they are every where as you travel to the exit.<br />
<br />
As far as exp goes I dont know what the % means....but I get 1 and a half blue bubs of aa exp for 7 kills. I kill the first 7 darkpaws before the first one spawns. I get about half a bub with all exp going to lvl'n.<br />
<br />
The actual spawn time on these damn things are 12 minutes....excuse me for cursing these mobs but i have been so spoiled by the exp and loot that I am unable to find anything better. I tried Katta, Chardok, Dulak, PoD, the deep and Skyfire....but nothing compares to the exp I get here!<br />
<br />
I am now thinking that the telling of this wonderful spot will create a new hell camp that will always be camped. I have not seen a real line up for this spot on my server....yet! And I found this spot by accident...was just cruising around at 51 looking for some good camps!<br />
<br />
<br />
I do have JBB and let me tell you it is awesome with these darkpaws they dont have too much hp's and they hit like little girls when slowed.<br />
<br />
<br />
I just had to post on this spot.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah, I just went to Dulak, and got 1% every other kill at 57.  With alpha dog, C3, and other toys if you have them (epic, jbb, etc.) one can kill almost an entire ship of pirates before they respawn.<br />
I can clear either of the first two boats at 52 with little to no problem, at 55+ with new canni and dogdog you should be able to take on the 3rd or 4th I'd think.  That and I can't immagine the xp being very exciting on the first two boats after hitting 55 or so, there's just not enough spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried out Oceancrasher (I think that's the name), boat #4 in Dulak this morning 2-boxing with my druid.  I am level 57 with fungi, horse, JBB, no epic 950 AC, 2200 HP buffed and the druid is 55.  I usually keep KEI on the druid, but didn't have that today.  That would increase kill rate substantially.  I couldn't clear the whole ship before repop, but the exp per kill wasn't the greatest.  I got just shy of 4% (1 blue)and the druid got just over 4% in an hour.  I will likely stick around to try it for a bit longer, see if I can get into a good groove and increase efficiency.  Very few resists, but some.  They were hitting for max 100 or so, but averaging much lower.  With fungi and regrowth, I was canning mid fight and still ending up almost full health at the end of the fight.<br />
<br />
Word of warning: do not setup your camp on the side of the boat closest to Windscorn, opposite the boarding ramp.  You can aggro the mobs from the dock between the boats.  Yesterday morning, I wasn't paying enough attention to my druid and she got nuked a bunch of times for 500 a pop.  I couldn't get a heal off in time once I noticed she was getting hit.<br />
<br />
I am considering trying Windscorn (the 5th boat and hardest) at some point to see how exp is for us there.  The boat has a lot of casters, so it will be a different fight.  We shall see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When you say &quot;half a bub&quot;, do you mean blue or yellow?  I decided to try gnolls, and went to this spot.  I only killed 5 before they started respawning on me, but I made about 2/5 of a blue, and I can't imagine the last two mobs are worth a blue each.</div></div><hr />

I get half a bubble of blue exp when I have &quot;aa&quot; off. With &quot;aa&quot; on I get 1 and 1/2 blue bubble killing the first 7 spawns. After the first seven die I have just enough time to canni down/up and get full mana before first spawn pops.</div></div><hr />
