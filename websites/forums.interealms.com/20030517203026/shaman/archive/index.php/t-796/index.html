<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Other than buying a new neck slot item, is there a quest upgrade for this item i got in a halas based quest around lvl 9?  I couldn't find any trainer that seems to mention one.  If not what's a good piece to buy for it?  I have a lvl 24 shaman with about 300pp in bank.  I don't really want to spend it all, but if I can get something that will last quite a few levels it would be worth it.  Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No there isn't an upgrade quest for it :(<br />
<br />
but there are some nice player made items you can get. <br />
<br />
Neck - Imbued Ivory Platinum Necklace AC+5 WIS+5 SVCOLD+8<br />
Ear - Imbued golden earrings - AC+3 WIS+4 SVCOLD+4<br />
<br />
I'd suggest that you get three pieces of ivory get a level 29 Shaman to imbue them for you then find a jeweler to make a neck item and earrings. Not sure of the cost but I think it's less than 300pp These are really nice items as they give you WIS AC and SVCold :)<br />
<br />
Check my magelo to see them (click on my sig)<br />

[Edit - Forgot to list items!]</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Am i the only one who has problems viewing them?  Whenever i got to magelo.com with netscape 6.2 or IE 6 (using win xp) i get a &quot;magelo security error&quot; window pop up.  And nothing is dsiplayed on page.  If i follow a link to someone's profile a few things show up but it's like a plank form, no parts of the profile.  Am i missing something?<br />
