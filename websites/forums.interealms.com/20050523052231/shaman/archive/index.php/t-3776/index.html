<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, now since the healing pentaly is lifted, with an improved healing II item could we now just canni I for 300hps(150mana if im correct) and get a free 60hp out of it, which makes us able to canni one more time which makes 350hps, for 175mana and costs 150mana, making it so we get a free 25 and 10pt heal? Or would this be worse/equal to chloro'ing yourself(which is 10hp regen, plus natural). Just a thought i had, sorry if it was already posted.<br />
<br />
Edit, cause I'm not 54, didn't notice Canni III with sup. heal would be better, sup.=720(with healing III) and -74hp for 40mp.</div></div><hr />

exactly what I was going to say.  Our heals (except for torpor of course) are too mana inefficient to use with cannibalize.  You might be gaining more mana than you would if you were just standing there, but meditating w/ regen up and cannibalizing every now in then is by far the best option.</div></div><hr />
