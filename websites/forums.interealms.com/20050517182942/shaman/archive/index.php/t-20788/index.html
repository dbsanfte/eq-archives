P.S. I remember people talking about &quot;avoidance AC&quot; - supposedly this AC, in addition to increasing mitigation (like regular AC), also increases how likely it is the mob will simply miss you. Is this theory still considered valid?<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<br />
It's still valid - there are 2 portions of the AC, mitigation and avoidance. This can be seen with the Time armor with +avoidance. <br />
<br />
Every ~ 6 agi from gear or buffs converts to 1 avoidance ac. <br />

Whatcha guys think of this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">One aspect helps with how often the mob hits for max damage, the other helps with misses.  It's the same AC number though, just for 2 calculations.  If the mob hits, the AC seems to be used again as a factor in determining max damage.<br />
<br />
There's also different mitigation levels set with plate, chain, leather, and cloth - or directly tied to their respective classes as what happened to monks recently with them being moved to a lower mitigation level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So does that mean they are wrong?<br />
<br />
I'm just trying to figure it out..</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're a shaman, it's not like mana's an issue.</div></div><hr />
