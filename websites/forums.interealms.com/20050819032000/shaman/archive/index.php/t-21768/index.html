<br />
Because I would get no satisfaction from using it, I'd feel I'd cheated. Every time it procced it'd just feel... wrong. <br />
<br />
I'd far rather spend 2 weeks camping it with friends, time spent in their company having fun, and have the satisfying buzz from when it drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No. Personal satisfaction from gaining an item is nice. Also, it's nice to show others and be seen with a high end item that everyone knows you worked hard to get. What's the point of working hard to get something when 10 losers are standing around you holding the same damn thing they just bought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">no. I refuse to pay RL money for pixels<br />
<br />
This response has always been interesting to me.  Ive seen it every time one of these threads gets started, and every time I have to ask myself if people really think about the answer before writing this type of response.<br />
<br />
What do you think your $13 goes for every month?  <br />
<br />
Pixels and a little bit of memory storage.  Thats all.  <br />
<br />
Now, if you qualify your statement and say &quot;I refuse to pay money for pixels that I didnt work for and somehow earn&quot; then I can agree with the statement.  But saying you refuse to pay RL money for pixels and yet continue to pay SOE for your character and all the items on said character is hypocritical.  <br />
<br />
I, for one, dont really care that people make money buying and selling items and plat in EQ.  It really has very little impact on how I play the game and the enjoyment I get from it.  I am impressed at the scope and scale of this internet business and do have to applaud the initiative to even try and do something like it.  <br />
<br />
I'm sure this is going to bring a few negative rep bumps, and I actually expect that.  I personally fail to see the distinction between paying Sony for pixels and paying someone other than Sony for pixels.  Either way, Im spending real life dollars for a few bits of memory storage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Friend of mine was griping that his (close to dinging 59) necro main couldn't afford any spells. I gave him some pointers as to where to go to make some cash, sympathising that it took me ages to get my 64-65 spells.<br />
<br />
So he went and bought the plat with proper cash. *Sigh*<br />
<br />
Worst of it was, he pleaded with me to head over to PoK after he gated out and STR buff him cos he couldn't move, weighed down with his ill-gotten gains.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Worst of it was, he pleaded with me to head over to the Bazaar and STR buff him cos he couldn't move, weighed down with his ill-gotten gains.<br />

Overweight code doesnt apply in the Bazaar.  Weight of 0 and encumbered by 300 weight still move the same rate in Bazaar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely not. I consider that an exploit, whether or not SOE makes it legal to purchase items/plat for RL money, and I will not take part in such crap. I would rather spend all the time and effort to flag myself and my guild, and go camp the thing with a couple of groups of friends. Call me old-fashioned, but I like to work for what I have. That is pathetic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You took the words right out of my mouth thorzion about people not wanting to spend money on pixels. Want a good example? How many people bought LoY? Almost everyone, why because of the bank slots not many people go to the zones because they have to travel sooo far.<br />
I think it does affect us though.. specifically the people who use exploits making plat worth less and less. If they could eleminate this(yea right) everything would be alot better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It'd be so tempting to be able to buy equipment that I know I'm never going to see, but in reality I'm not that arsed about it. So long as I'm having fun I could care less if Mr Jones has got a TA and a complete set of Time equip, I'll be happy with my stuff. <br />
<br />
I just wish my kilt wasnt sooooo close to being pink. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have some friends that years back got into Magic: The Gathering -- one of those dueling collecting card games.  It quickly became a sickness with them to get the most powerful cards by buying deck after deck in hopes of a rare one and tossing the rest away.<br />
<br />
It also killed any enjoyment playing against guys who spent probably a thousand dollars just to have the edge.<br />
<br />
It would be a profitable but terminal disease for EQ too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hell yeah I'd spend twenty bucks on a TA.  I hate juggling spell slots, and it would be more than worth that to buy a ninth spell gem.  It would be just like buying an expansion with nothing I wanted except a ninth spell gem.  Sharkspine?  Well, I have one, but even if I didn't, I wouldn't.  That's just a hunk of stats, whereas the TA bypasses some annoying clicking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For $20, I'd buy it, because that would be the ONLY way I'd ever get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not sure about buying an item or PP, never have.  However, if I could pay $20 and get a way around joining a raiding guild to get flagged..sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, SOE should do that.  What a profit.  People pay to unlock parts of an expansion they already paid for.  wow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Based on that question alone with the current game status, I would say no because:<br />
<br />
1. Both items require flags (EP or Time)<br />
2. Both items are no drop (exploit to transfer no drop items)<br />
3. It would be an exploit for you to loot a TA without proper flags (you cant be raided into Time)<br />
<br />
If the TA/Sharkspins club was tradable and I had no other way of getting it, I would consider buying it.  It's like buying LoY so I can use the in game map.  Whats the difference between buying an expansion for the map and a TA for slows?  I didnt get a CD for LoY.  I sure as hell dont get one for the TA/club.  Both are used to help make my gaming experience more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">A lot of people who are not ever going to see the plane of timesink will buy a TA for 20 bucks,  that I think is a reality.  But it opens up a whole truckload of worms.   SoE wants your money bad,  I can see them placing newer and better items way way beyond the last GoD trials thus making sure that even some Time equipped players will never see it.  Then just sit back and rake in the cash from that one item.   It's evil I know .. but it's SoE we're talking about here and they are not known for critical thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Barm McLir,<br />
You Make a very interesting point, with your &quot;Magic the Gathering&quot; comparisons (I used to play pretty heavily).  The interesting note is that &quot;MtG&quot; is on par with playing PvP.  Being able to spend $1000 on a whole bunch of rare cards, is unfair to the person who just picked up a bunch of &quot;starter decks&quot; and &quot;booster packs&quot;.  I don't play PvP, but I would bet that those people that do play PvP would have a very negative view on buying high end equipment, and it wouldn't have &quot;squat&quot; to do with the feeling of accomplishment for having the item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Drool, so you're suggesting that gear would suddenly be based on your disposable income and not on how much time you can comit and what guild you're in? Woot! I would be teh uber!<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is a crappy idea. If I was in a guild capable of getting these I'd be pissed. But sure! I'd buy a TA for $20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Sorry Thor, your analagy is wrong. I am not paying for pixels and bits, I am paying for entertainment. If I paid $20 for a TA, in my mind, I shorted myself on the entertainment I paid for. In effect, I am paying twice. With none of the fun or reward of the effort I put into getting it. But I expect some people don't care as long as they have the item. It seems absurd to me I guess, if you buy something for PP you can at least say well we hunted here and did this and I scraped and saved my PP and I bought the item whereas in using RL money you get to say well I pumped gas for 4 hours so I could buy this TA!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Yeah, I'd buy a Time's Antithesis to free up a gem - you betcha. It would make me a more effective Shaman, and I would enjoy the game a little more by having greater spell diversity available.<br />
<br />
They could even give bought versions a stupid graphic so we'd stand out to be ridiculed, if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Aikoiko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Quick answer... NO.<br />
<br />
Made it thus far without it, and the rides been fun.  Heck, made it this far without an SoF.  Like someone said above, I don't care what others do... makes no difference to me.  More power to 'em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lumor2000</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Well, maybe not $20, that just seems alot for one piece of equipment.  I'd bid $10.  Be great to have nother spell slot freed up.  What I'd rather have is a bigger nuke (just for the fun of it).  I'd spend a few dollars (and trade in some of my other spells) to be able to nuke for 2k now and then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Wow, some great responses.  Personally, I don't think I'll ever see the EP and I know I'll never see PoTime.  But, I said the same think about level 60 and level 65, yada yada yada.  No, I don't endorse this idea; however, I'd have a hard time knowing I could free up a spell slot for $20.  The best comparison I thought was the extra bank space.<br />
<br />
Instead of an item, would you pay for an extra spell gem?  If so, how is that different than buying TA?<br />
<br />
Food for thought.  BTW, I really see this happening the closer EQ2 gets to release.  SOE can get a big money binge right before a lot of folks leave, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Azadark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd pay $19.95 for a TA =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
OH NO!!! You're putting ideas in their heads!!! Hehe, I hope soe is ignoring our posts as much as we think they are :D<br />
<br />
Actually, I figured the poll was a response to the fact that plat selling is going on anyway.  After all, since we're going to do it, they might as well get a cut, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Agrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">while I have neither of these ingame, and would love them, I might be tempted to pay $20 for one.. but the question itself is loaded because youd NEVER SEE THAT EVER.

You pay for the priviledge of playing the game.  That includes the potential for obtaining items if you choose to do quests or fight critters that drop items (or fight critters that drop items that you can parlay into items you want).<br />
<br />
Everybody has to pay the subscription fee - and that places everyone on even footing - everyone has the same in-game opportunities and potential.  Some may be limited by play time or brain power - but the potential is equally there.<br />
<br />
Once you start paying extra cash to accomplish your virtual goals/gains the potential is no longer equal.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think buying game data is cheating - it's no different that turning on console mode or using a trainer and giving your character items he shouldn't have in a single-player game.  People that &quot;play&quot; games this way are missing the point of gaming and are basically pathetic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I don't understand how the meaning of that poll got twisted the way it has.  The poll did not ask if you would like it if SOE sold items to people.  It asked if you wanted SOE to take the place of Yantis and IGE.  SOE would just become the middle-man and facilitate the sales.  Sort of like an EQ-only Ebay ran by SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Yes, but unlike Yantis or whatever else, SOE doesn't need to buy the equipment from other players to sell..they can just code one up to sell.  The other places are driven by supply/demand.  SOE can make all the supply that we can demand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Yes, but unlike Yantis or whatever else, SOE doesn't need to buy the equipment from other players to sell..they can just code one up to sell.  The other places are driven by supply/demand.  SOE can make all the supply that we can demand.<br />
<br />
Just curious, but why can't SOE just make a character in game already and post it on Yantis's site?  They get the money from the sale, but Yantis gets his commision too.  Taking Yantis out of the picture just means that SOE gets all of the profit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Predicus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Just curious, but why can't SOE just make a character in game already and post it on Yantis's site?  They get the money from the sale, but Yantis gets his commision too.  Taking Yantis out of the picture just means that SOE gets all of the profit.<br />
<br />
Exactly, and I think that is what people fail to see.  Yantis can only control how much he &quot;farms&quot; for the said items, and he can only &quot;control&quot; the sale of droppable items.  SOE already controls the supply and demand of the very items that Yantis profits from.  Putting the power of selling those items to someone who controls the flow is creating a nasty monopoly.  People assume that bestowing this power on the game's creator will be beneficial because it would be controlled by the &quot;good guys.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Power corrupts and Absolute power corrupts absolutely&quot;<br />
<br />
It would be in SOE's best interest to not only create &quot;bottlenecks&quot; in game content, but also create &quot;bottlenecks&quot; in item/plat/level acquisition because it would profit off of both.  This idea hurts the casual player more than anyone because large amounts of plat and high level items will be out of reach of them by a larger majority than people with larger playtimes and resources (guilds) to get the items in question.  SOE would be profiting out a player's &quot;inability to play&quot;- something that has already been argued in multiple threads already.<br />
<br />
Players assume that an item in question like &quot;Time's Antithesis&quot; would be &quot;only 20 bucks&quot;, and here is what they are not thinking.  An item such as this has a high demand (low drop rate), and a small supply (need to be in a Time guild).  Therefore, due to this many players would purchase the item due to &quot;well...I will never see the content, so why not?&quot;  You set a dangerous precident by doing this, what was a rare item is now common and, thereby, accepted as a standard upgrade in progression.  You still have a high demand (it becomes standard), but a restricted supply (still need a Time guild to get one) so people are forced to shell out $20 bucks to &quot;keep up with the Jones's&quot;.  Multiply this a few times, and EQ quickly becomes a game of &quot;how much is in my wallet&quot;.<br />
<br />
My answer, obviously, is a resounding &quot;no&quot;.  I would not ever buy this item.  If it comes to a point where it is almost a requirement to buy an item such as a &quot;TA&quot; then I take my money elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Took  me forever to get torpor.  Literally six months auctioning for it EVERY day in Freeport back in the old days, and saving up for long, long before that.  Paid a fungi tunic and 50k for it back then, when 50k was actually a LOT of money.<br />
<br />
For something that was game-changing and basically unavailable, and I had already done everything within my power to get it?<br />
<br />
I don't know.  But honesty, the temptation would be so strong I couldn't say until I would get there what I would do.<br />
<br />
Kind of like nobody goes into marriage expecting to cheat on their spouse(well, mostly), but it happens in half of all marriages.  And, people who find wallets tend to keep the money, but those same guys would never have thought of themselves as thieves before they found the money.  And every guy you know is a tough, courageous fighter -- &quot;especially if I get mad,&quot; one of my personal favorites. <br />

Yes, bad monopoly indead.  If new subscriptions dry up, Sony would have the power to scale back the drop of pp in the game, so the established buying base would have to pay more RL money for virtual pp that Sony could set prices on because they own the distibution network also.
