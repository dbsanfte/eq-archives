<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Many people here at the crucible feel that Sony doesn't care for Shaman.  We do not get pampered like many of the classes and have received sub-par upgrades throughout the last few expansions.  Our AA's suck and the best one we have ( Can 5 ) doesn't even kill anything but ourselves.  Sure it gives us a shot of mana, but if our spells weren't overpriced in the first place, we wouldn't need it.  Our petitions go un-answered.  Our spectral turn-ins are soo bad that many shaman turn in to other vendors to sell then try to buy their shaman spells.  <br />
<br />
Absor has visited this board. what.. 5 times.  That shows a lot of care.  Last time he came here he flat out lied to us about more mobs getting mitigation.<br />
<br />
But here is the proof:  If anyone at sony played a shaman ( even occasionally ) they would have realized that affliction items were affecting malo / slow / etc.  It would not have taken them 9 months ( and probably a druid complaining ) to realize this. <br />
<br />
And if they were meant to affect only DoTs, how come our primary ability ( debuffing ) got no focus items while so many other classes got focus items for their primary abilities.  Just one more straw on the camel's back.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ultrazach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only real thing that irks me to no end about playing the Shaman class is how rare our high end spells are. Maybe i'm ignorant to other classes and the availability of their spells...On Cazic Thule the most expensive sub-61 spells I see (non-Shaman) are KEI and the 59 Necro pet spell. (30k and 40k respectively).<br />
<br />
It's an achievement to reach 60 in the first place let alone struggle to obtain the spells needed to fill our role in the high end game.<br />
<br />
Take the Mages Mala for example...farily common, does the same thing as the Shaman spell but can be had for pocket change. What's the deal SoE?<br />
<br />
Recently SoE stated the level 60 Shaman spells are no more rare than any other classes level 60 spells...well a server's economy speaks for itself..if thats the case, then why does Torp/Malo range from 50-70k on Cazic Thule?<br />

<br />
Yeah, you are all right..we suck :)  Guess that's why groups are so easy to come by.  Guess that's why you always see shamans on raids.  Guess that's why other classes consider us GODS of soloing high end creatures.<br />

Yeah, I should go delete my shaman. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not because of any problems with the shaman class...<br />
<br />
but because *I* feel betrayed by Sony/Verant over things I spent MY time and effort on. That kind of betrayal.... gives me no motivation to do anything else in the game. They'll only nerf it. I was a hard core quester, I put up with a lot of buggy ****, but now I have lost faith.<br />
<br />
That and there's a cleric in my guild who is a royal bitch, but I won't go into that here.<br />
<br />
Although I must ask... why do some clerics think they should be spoon fed off a silver platter?</div></div><hr />

Pull down your pants, bend over and grab your ankles because someone at Sony has been enjoying the shaman's lately.</div></div><hr />

Geting smaked hard with the nurf bad is not fun.  And I bet you are a potter also?  The people that invest massive pp / time into pottery have gotten slamed far harder then any shaman has.<br />

I hate it when people say things like this. Why would he want to do that? He's invested tons of time in his shaman, just like I have and the rest of the people who visit this boards do. An update like the one that just happened a few days ago is like just sony saying,<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello valued user, the character in which you have invested hundreds of hours which you easily could have spent out in the real world earning more money instead of throwing it away to us has now been changed. In light of the feedback from druids and bards, the Shaman class has to be made useless. We really do wish we could reimburse you in some way for the hundreds of hours you wasted on developing your shaman POS, but we just can't do that, because our HR people would consider that customer support.&quot;<br />
<br />
Why should he walk away? Why should ANY of us walk away? Why should we be WANTING to walk away right now? God knows I do. I wish more than anything that I could say &quot;**** you SOE&quot; and cancel my subscription, but thats just as bad as folding to them on the other front. I payed for this game. I invested time in my character. I'm not just going to give up when they turn my time into a waste, and nobody else should.</div></div><hr />

To stick you head in the sand and pretend thats not the case is really funny. Will I quit I dont know but I tired of this crap. I dont think anyone at sony has a clue. To you who think sony is so wonderful good for you. Let them keep screwing you patch after patch I hope you enjoy yourself when they are done but I for one will not keep quite when I feel Im getting bent over.</div></div><hr />

I do love playing my shaman, but sometimes I wonder if it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">ok, i don't know what is going to be coming down the pike for shaman in this Legacy expansion.  so far i have not bought it, but knowing Verant they will throw in somthing that is a shaman must have and i will pay extra for it.<br />
<br />
i have now run a shaman on 3 different servers.  40 on Vallon, 52 on Sullon, and now 23 and counting on Prexus.<br />
<br />
shaman have always had certain issues.<br />
<br />
dots doing less damage if the mob was moving.  they fixed that.  but not being able to quad kite really but the solo shaman on the slow track for exp.<br />
<br />
cold DD immune zone (Kedge) and mob (great bear), they fixed that with poison dd<br />
<br />
the thrown weapon use was an insult.  i would bet every shaman has an item in the range slot they never use as a weapon.<br />
<br />
STR spells that do nothing unless you are encumbered.  Then stacking issues with HoS and etal.  that really hacked me off worse than most of you, because on pvp servers i need something to take up those spell slots.<br />
<br />
our spell drops are HIDEOUS.  and i don't have to be lvl 65 with 200 AA to realize that.  find the upper lvl Lev or EB.  find Purity of Spirit (whatever the 1st pet only buff spell is) and compare the costs relative to other classes with drop spells.<br />
<br />
also, imho our gear is getting behind the curve on PoP.  to havee the premium gear we need smiths for the blacksmithed chain.  i now see tons of items that are BST/Rog/RNG/Cleric/Druid but not shaman.  we are starting to share more gear with the necro class.<br />
<br />
imho, shaman do not campaign Verant like other classes.  i think that is a personality trait of the people that play the class.  but, i also think it is a mistake.  the squeaky wheel gets the grease.<br />
<br />
give shaman Bash as a trainable skill.  increase our spell drops, and increase our melee skill.  new cleric hammers put us to shame in the melee dept.<br />
<br />
give us an AA for Debuff at the high lvls.  <br />
<br />
nothing massive, nothing unbalancing, nothing that is the realm of another class.  just some things to ease the pain a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">well ill say one thing that has crossed my mind . I mean im pissed , very pised , but fact is VI has done a PISS POOR job of things but you know what ? We arent dealing with VI anymore are we. We are dealing with SoE and it seems to me  that SoE might take this game a lil more seriously. This is good and bad .<br />
<br />
In the long run it could work for us cause they have rolled up their sleeves and are slinging fixes and changes around to make this game what they want it to be. alot of thigns show promise for the future , like how LoY story is playing out. they are showing inovation and thats a good thing , even if its hard to be joyed about cause of the bat we got hit with.  This game was a mess as VI let go of the reigns , atleast SoE gives me the impressiont hey give a rats ass about their product even if its not the vision i have.<br />
<br />
Again , im not siting back adn changing my tune , but trying to step back and see a silver lining in the grey clouds , i mean if they are this willing to make such huge changes int he game ( frogs taking voer grobb ) and trying to fix thignt hat have been floating around for 9 months , who knows.<br />
<br />
I guess in the next 60 days we should tell what direction this is all going</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you are all right..we suck :)  Guess that's why groups are so easy to come by.  Guess that's why you always see shamans on raids.  Guess that's why other classes consider us GODS of soloing high end creatures.<br />
<br />
Yeah, I should go delete my shaman. :) <br />
<br />
This statement is flat out wrong.  Just becuase we could solo a gimp ass dragon almost 3 expansion ago doesn't make us the best at soloing high end creatures.  Enchanters, druids, bards, and necromancers can not only solo for more exp, they can take down stuff shamans can't even attempt.  <br />
And on raids, i always see lots of classes, it doesnt mean that they are more useful.  Shamans are becomming more and more of a wasted raid slot nowadays.  No bosses can be slowed.  All the ****ty &quot;normal&quot; mobs mitigate, and our mana regaining advantage has dwindled considerably in comparison to other classes.  A druid is way more useful on a raid then a shaman.  One shaman for buffs is all you need.<br />
Telling me to just &quot;quit because you're unhappy&quot; is a really moronic attitude.  I want some fixes, not to stand idly while we take more VI **** up the ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was really hoping that someone could provide a counter-point to my post.  I am not the only one to indicate that I feel this way.  I was hoping that someone could point out some upgrades that we have received that another class didn't get the better of.   It is called discussion.  That is what messageboards are for.<br />
<br />
I have provided many constructive ideas in other posts.  I don't feel that I need to link to them to prove something to a flamer.  I even made a post a few days ago praising the shaman for being a jack of all trades.  My post didn't say that shaman sucked, or that we couldn't solo high end mobs.  I don't understand why people insist on reading things into posts that aren't there.  I never said I couldn't get a group or that slowers weren't needed in PoP.  I said that since I have been playing, it seems that we get subpar upgrades with each expansion, and that it doesn't seem to me that Sony cares for what the shaman class thinks.<br />
<br />
The main point of my post was that if anyone at sony actually played a shaman, they would have realized what was going on 9 months ago.  They would have also realized that there were no other focus items ( other than the generic ones ) that really help our class.  Noone has refuted these points.<br />
<br />
Bartmeista,  I don't know you, but if you think you are cool for flaming my name, you can go f u c k yourself.  Yours seems so much cooler than mine.  :rolleyes:   Krakster, you can do the same.<br />

NOTHING you do in EQ is &quot;worth it&quot; unless you are one of those people who ebay platinum.  Nothing else is worth doing in this pointless excuse for a game.  <br />
It's not a real game if all the rules change every couple of months.  <br />
<br />
That's why I quit MTG as well.  I would buy a bunch of cards and trade for the ones I really wanted.  And the next month the card makers would come out with a list of all the cards banned or restricted  . . . and my favorite cards would be on the list.  It was pointless to continue that sort of fruitless activity.  So I quit. <br />
<br />
Funny thing is, I'm getting that &quot;deja vu&quot; vibe from recent developments.  Purchase new items!  Get new skills!  Buy new focus items!  <br />
O wait . . . we never intended THAT!  /nerfbat <br />
Ok carry on with your game . . . minus all that stuff you &quot;bought&quot; suckers!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Durich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Take the Mages Mala for example...farily common, does the same thing as the Shaman spell but can be had for pocket change. What's the deal SoE?  <br />
<br />
This is something I have been wondering for over a year now and now that I am level 60 I would like to know why such a class defining spell is so rare. Granted it was rare before but now no one &quot;Farms&quot; the classic dropping spots for these spells so they have become even more of a myth. <br />
<br />
Spells are what Casters are Built around its what we use. Why make such night and day difference is the spell drop rates for 2 classes. I am sure at one time Mages where given the advantage on this to make them more &quot;wanted&quot; at raids but they have been balanced into the scene. Topor and Avatar and I can see the rare status but Malo come on. <br />
<br />
More and more the Balancing skips the Shaman Class. Some argue that our spell line is the same thing over and over again and are guessing at what the new spells will be. I rather not have any new spells becuase frankly what new can you added other then another classes spell line up with a new name. Sure there should be a few &quot;time saver&quot; spells added like group this and that maybe some self spell haste or better bear forms but asking for more will only net us the same spells we already have.<br />
<br />
Instead of new spells what a Shaman needs is our spell line up changed and modified to adapt to the change of the game and be balanced with other casting classes. Mana/Timecasting ratios, Spell level progression, Drop Rates, Stat Buff and stacking issues.<br />
<br />
Yes Shaman is a powerful class but you can't say we are what we use to be 2 expansions ago. Our power has fallen behind the curve and our class has gotten no real thought placed behind what needs to be done to fix it. Not major just minor tuning and someone at SoE to sit down with the community to see what we are talking about not &quot;whining&quot; about.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Won't happen. I have lost the faith that SoE cares or has ever cared. I think they are all just looking at the profit margin. Sad too, because that might work for awhile in business, but if you treat customers bad you start to lose money.<br />
<br />
Or maybe I don't know what the hell I am talking about.</div></div><hr />

I am very sorry to hear that Harvyst.  I am also sorry to hear about you problems with the cleric.  I truly hope that you can work somthing out in your playing so that you can find the fun again.  Perhaps you can join the 1750 club and do that massive new quest in PoP that requires major numbers in all the trade skills.  Having people in the guild that you just can't stand can make things quite bad, and you don't apear to be the type that casualy changes the tag over the head.<br />
