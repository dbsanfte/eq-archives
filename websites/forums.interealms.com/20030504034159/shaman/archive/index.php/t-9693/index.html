<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slomoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ive been offered the chance to buy Torpor from a guild, with the<br />
addition of stoicism what do you all think would be a reasonable <br />
price for the spell. Ive offered 30k and by the prices ive seen posted here pre-patch its cheap, go for it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yup go for it. 30k is pretty cheap from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i paid 40k for mine, generally sells for 60+ on quell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">70 and 75 on the nameless in the last few weeks.  Got mine for 25 a year ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i just payed 75k on tholuxe..     <br />
<br />
then with my luck :(  2 days after i buy it i go to SF GW drops it and then we kill talendor and he droepd it :(   kidna sucked but i got avater so /srhug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Glad you posted this. I'm worried about this spell already, and I'm 39!!!  Hehe :)<br />
<br />
I was thinking like 100k, so 70 is a little better.  Hopefully, since I have a lot of time, I'll find it for cheaper.  Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>The Lawful</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got lucky enough being the only shaman available when an open raid took down Sev in EJ.  Torpor dropped, and I immediately wet my pants knowing it was defaulted to me (because the guy running the raid is a really cool guy with good intentions.)  I've seen people offer 40 and more on Firiona Vie.  I was lucky enough (very lucky...) to acquire a SECOND copy of Torpor via greed and luck (no, I did not screw any other shaman by rolling!  it was clear that I had it, and it was a total greed roll.)  Rather than trying to jack a shaman, I traded one of the uber guilds the spell for some Boots of Superiority.  (there isn't NO DROP here) On this server, spells like Malo or Torpor might not be half as horrible pricewise as other servers (no real demand.  there are like 20 50+ shamans that I know of, many of them won't see 60 for quite a while.) but good frigging luck finding it, especially if you are guildless.  I doubt anyone would even sell it, but there's always luck.  whenever someone takes down a 60 kunark mob its like a huge deal, lol.  hope that helps, even though it's the backwater forum. ;)<br />

And malo? I saw a guy trading a SoD for a copy and no takers.<br />
/Rude SOE and anyone remotely related to the spell drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Every time I've seen it for sale on Ayonae Ro, it's for around 60k. :\ Maybe the new spells will drive the price down some.</div></div><hr />
