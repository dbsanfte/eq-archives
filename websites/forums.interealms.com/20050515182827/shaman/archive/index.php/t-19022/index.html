Haha, that's your ranged item tho even tho it appears to be in secondary =p</div></div><hr />

If Henora clicked her shield off and on it would appear in the offhand.<br />
When you take off and put on your range item it gives the graphic to the offhand.  I'm thinking you probably already knew this though. ;) <br />
<br />
Sad thing is our GM Alchemy bag has the same lousy small brown bag graphic as something you toss on the ground.  My normal range slot item (Brain of CT) also has that stinky graphic.<br />
<br />
Those are both nice items Henora, I wouldn't mind equipping either of them.  :) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

Hen has THREE books!  Not just the two she normally uses.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sadly it's all true.  I often run from mobs screaming don't hurt me... or HEAL HEAL ahhhHHHH!!1<br />
<br />
Gwain is right also that I have 3 books.  The one not shown in my magelo (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=43438) has extended range 4 on it.  It is so I can stand farther away from mobs that might hurt me.  It is also helpful in giving me a head start over my other groupmates when I need to run away.  Let them stay and tank in teh face while I flee.  I mean, if I die I might lose my KEI and stuff.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I love books.  I like to read them while I am sitting down medding.</div></div><hr />

I can actually verify this.<br />
<br />
I was running thru Droga and ran into Henora. He/She asked me if I wanted Pot9. I thought it was strange coming from a Barbarian, until I saw the elf behind her.</div></div><hr />

Last time I offer you buffs Frog!  Would you question the gender of a woman just because she has a male puppy?  That's no different than my little druid, I have to let him out of his cage to exercise him sometimes.</div></div><hr />

This is a euphemism for masturbation.  &quot;She&quot; uses it all the time in guild chat.</div></div><hr />
