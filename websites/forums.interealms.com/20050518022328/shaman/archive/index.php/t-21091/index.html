<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I know it's here. I just can't for the life of me find it with search or browsing the medicine cabinet. Yes, I suck.<br />
<br />
What are the levels of slow mitigation and their percentages? I know there's mostly and slightly, but I could have sworn there were four tiers and I just don't remember to save my life. The percentages would also be helpful. I was trying to give a friend some information and hit a big fat mental block, and now it's driving me nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are three levels of slow mitigation.  When slow is mitigated, you will see &quot;Your spell was slightly/partially/mostly successful&quot;.  These are in order from worst to best effectiveness.<br />
<br />
To my knowledge, the exact percentages have never been parsed, but it comes out to around:<br />
<br />
slightly - 25% effectiveness (~18.75% slowed with turgur's)<br />
partially - 50% effectiveness (~ 37.5%)<br />
mostly - 75% effectiveness (~ 56.25%)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really doubt that it's exact to those numbers. I'm more convinced that it's a range and that the description is an approximation of the value. Those numbers seem accurate for the most part, but on Fennin for example, Slow like almost does nothing, but gives a &quot;Slightly&quot; slowed message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Verileah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you Jinheim. That was driving me batty. And I guess I was nuts thinking there were four teirs :D.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Three tiers are correct but those are definitely not the numbers. Our best guess at this point is that slow mitigation is really two numbers, a base amount that does not get mitigated and an amount above that which does get mitigated.<br />
<br />
So you might have a 30/50% mitigation which means a 75% slow has it's first 30% not mitigated at all and the rest (45%) mitigated by 50% for an overall 52.5% slow.<br />
<br />
a 60% slow would be mitigated down to 45% and a 30% slow would not be mitigated at all.<br />
<br />
As far as I know noone has done the extensive parsing necessary to determine if any numbers are fixed for a given tier of slow mitigation. My guess is they are not, but I am not sure at all of this. The bit about a base percentage that does not get mitigated is pretty much given though - Henora was it I think who did some pretty conclusive parses and posted the results.</div></div><hr />
