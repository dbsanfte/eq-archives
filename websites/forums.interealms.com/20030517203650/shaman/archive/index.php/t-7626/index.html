<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I always thought I was too much of a powergamer to be fashionable, but I guess not. I'm looking at upgrading my trusty helm i've worn for 35 levels to a Barbed Rubicite Coif, but I've got no idea what it looks like on Iksar. Something with the sarnak-skull helm would be preferable if the BRC is horribly ugly. I'd also like some new pants and Skyshrine are on the top of my list, but they're so god-awful ugly that I'm willing to consider alternatives. My guild is ToV capable and Dragon Aligned but we haven't done any bosses and NToV is a few months off, so Onyx Chain are out of the question for now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I bought a Slime Covered Rubi Coif tonight (I had been thinking barbed rubi). Oh my dear lord. Ug-frickin-lee. So that's out. I picked up a Metal Linked Crown as a temporary replacement but I know I can do better.<br />
<br />
Gloorriiiii... help meh :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is an easy fashion question!  Either try and get an SS helm (no graphic) or do this quest!<br />
