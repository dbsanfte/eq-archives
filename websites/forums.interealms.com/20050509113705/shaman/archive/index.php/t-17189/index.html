<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Once hitting 65, delevelling back down and experiencing the journey again? I have a load of elemental gear that I know I would have to put in bank if I did it but I have a couple of items I can use at lvl 10 or whatever. I was thinking of augmenting a proc onto a weapon and taking it with me. But not sure if there is a lvl restriction on them. Half in the mind to do this sometimes,  but also half thinking of starting a beastlord. Noone else ever thought of this? Or is it absurdity in its full bloom=p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Why?  You spent time and effort getting to 65; you would want to throw that away just to feel uber at level 50?<br />
<br />
I dont know how it is on your server, but on mine level 30 to 50 is a wasteland.  If you have a character at that level its hard to find a group.  <br />
<br />
Im putting my vote to absurdity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Thorzion.  I'd rather twink out a brand new character, preferably another class, and work my way up than delevel 55 levels and do it again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That sounds totally silly to me. Just make a new character instead. You can twink a new guy like mad if that's what you want to do. I couldn't imagine delevel'ing just to &quot;do it over again&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am sure you would get a diferent response in the necro boards, but here i think the vote goes to absurdity. <br />
Anyway, if you finally decide to delevel, at least make a necro happy :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ahve had three post 50 shaman hehe, the journey is indeed fun. Deleveling would be silly indeed. Try a whole nother class, that way can always do raids and tough stuff with shammy, and don't twink too hard with new guy, play it like it used to be.<br />
<br />
Mill the old</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL! I just got 65 and they'll have to pry it out of my cold dead hands.<br />
<br />
While it's an interesting thought, not sure it's been done before, and the journey is often more interesting than the destination, I think you're nuts if you do.  Honestly, there is only so many know it all twinks (who do not really know anything at all) out there that I can stomach grouping with.  It seems that I don't have the patience anymore for real newbies, which is a shame, because I was every bit as silly as they are.  I'm pretty sure you'll regret it when you find that soloing 55 lvls isn't all it's cracked up to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dikkakor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stay off the crack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The reason why essentially is because I have basically hit the end game, I have like 200 aa and all my spells and its boring. I have started twinks before but the thought of getting all skills up again just drives me mad. So I thought about this, by changing the rules of the journey back. But I guess I am underestimating the journey back up and will be less fun than I would imagine. Its just boring with pop and Ldon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm with Tarthug. Though I occasionally wonder what I would have been like at 50 knowing what I know now, or even with the gear I have now, I have grouped with enough clueless twinks with my alts (and indeed on my shaman) that I wouldn't want to put myself through all that again.<br />
<br />
I think maybe it would be interesting on one level, but playing the same character without all the spells I'm used to, and without being able to group with my friends and guildies, wouldn't be the same. If I had to do it again, I'd start a new character, probably a different class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have free reign on a friend's cleric account, so I made a troll beastlord on it.  If you have the chance to do this... use your shaman for dex and agi buffs (if nothing else) and skillups will NOT be a problem.  Well, not with physical skills.  *grin*<br />
<br />
It's fun using the new leveling grounds and seeing the new stuff.  Especially with a class I can't just stick the fungi on.  My nonguilded and totally anonymous alts are starting to gain reputations and friends of their own.  It's like a breath of fresh air.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If it's only the thought of getting skills up - don't worry about that so much. Start your new character with only light twinkage and don't PL him much if any. If you work on your skills as you level by using them normally, they should keep up with you mostly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Level 10 with 300aa.  I know the pop aa with the hotkeys wont work, but I wonder if all the passive aa skills would still be active?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I remember reading about some rogue that deleveled from 55 down to 20 on one of the Zek servers.  At that time melee classes got to keep using their melee skills at the high skill level.  Apparently he was quite tough to kill and had it easy when killing others.<br />
<br />
But since then SoE has changed it so that melee classes no longer have that advantage if they delevel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I killed a rog of mine from 61 to 45.  Its lots of fun being in old school zones getting crit backstabs with a Ragebringer, and peeps asking me how I got the name in front of my name.  I will never be uber with my main, but it sure is fun fealing real powerful again when I log to my rog &quot;twink&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zeepon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yep zat, they did that with all skills, not just melee ones. i knew a mage before kunark, that leveled to 50, then deleveled to 5. he could channel a spell through a lvl 20 guard hitting him(not that it mattered, he got wasted anyway) <br />
<br />
also, spec checks were still working even though he wasn't the right level for them, or so he said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">passive aa's work last I heard, it has been awhile, it would be easy enough to test, get a lvl 51 with run3 and delvl him to 50, that will tell you all you need to know about passive aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">i deleted my iksar shaman at level 55 and rerolled as a troll shaman and releveled. It was tedious and I regretted it quite a few times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Currently, I'm pretty sure all level-based skills will drop down to a maximum of two levels higher than your current level.  Meaning if you deleveled to level 8, for example...<br />
<br />
Your defense would be 50<br />
Your offense would be 50<br />
Your weapon skill would be 44<br />
Your spell skills would be 55<br />
<br />
Etc.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what they'd do with dodge, or specialization, etc., as you don't get those till level 15 and 30 respectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well at least you aren't a damned egg laying lizard anymore :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Don't do it mcroc! You'll regret it. As suggested earlier start a new char. If you really want to level a shaman up again start a new shammy of a different race and 'lend' him some gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Screw that.  1-65 one time was enough for me.  The challenge now is getting new toons to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Working on getting my 7th alt over 40 atm...go to another char, play a different class. Not only does it break it up you actually learn more about the game, which should help you play your shammy better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Magneuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">If de-leveling your shaman, and grinding XP again is what you want to do, go for it.  I am all about having fun in the game, and I can see how being lvl 65 with a couple hundred AA's would be boring at times.  As I am not in that position, my suggestion to you might be a bit biased as I am still striving for that almighty lvl 65. ;)   Why dont you set a goal to max out your AA's?  Does anyone in here know of a shaman on their respective server's with max AA's?  After you accomplish that, try to solo outrageous mobs.  Put yourself to the test.  Maybe even try to take out every named mob in every zone.  With the info you already know about EQ, starting over with the same character would probably leave you bored again, as learning the who/what's of each level and new set of spells is part of the fun.  At the risk of sounding like a broken tape recorder, try a different class.  I personally have a Warrior alt.  Although I know that it's not necessarily the best for melee (holding aggro and no spell abilities), the &quot;no spell&quot; abilities is why I chose it.  When I get bored of the same ole same ole with the shaman, I log on my warrior and just go to town on mobs.  It helps me refresh my enthusiasm with the game and sometimes makes me appreciate having the shaman.  The point is, do what makes the game fun for you.  Set goals, even if they are just bragging rights goals.  Keeping a light at the end of the tunnel will make the game fun again, and give you something to look forward to.  Just my opinion. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">There are still things for you to accomplish...<br />
<br />
get 500aa, get 1492 a point in all themes<br />
<br />
that will keep you busy for at least one more year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">last thing I do before retire is re-visit unpolular newbie dungeon and try explore the spot I havn't seen; it take a while to clear whole zone to see every corner.<br />
also re-visit some harder zone and and see how far I can break in, like HS, Seb, Hole, Lguk<br />
<br />
it was really bore when you care about more aa/exp; and making alt isn't fun since you have to solo your way up again. all left is chat/play with friend or raiding, but it can get bore too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hehe yeah I done some of these things, I soloed Zelnithak in UP for example that was challenging. I fought my way through HS around all the wings to get the master key. I have 100 adventures now in LDon not 1492 points in each theme but it kinda gets old. What revitalized some fun was playing a different class betabuffed when LDon came out. Which basically was you could create any lvl 65 class. 65 Rogue was fun, and chanter. I guess I won't hastily delevel my character down, only as a last resort. Anyway thx for feedback.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually, what people are forgetting about is that you could try a new game entirely...<br />
<br />
Other games are MUCH DIFFERENT from EQ and even if you only play them occasionally or hardcore for a few months it will give you new perspective on what you like and dislike about everquest...<br />
<br />
A good game to try (that is MUCH different in all ways from EQ) is the original asherons call (AC 1).  It is a *MUCH* better game than AC 2 and is really cheap to buy and is only $9 per month.  If you do however -- remember to give it a chance -- a lot of EQ people quit it around level 6 -- that is not a chance and does not do justice to it... If you get to about level 40(equivalent of level 16ish in EQ) then you will know whether it is worthwhile to you or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">yeah that is a possibility too. I think I am put off by the time investment to get anywhere, but if a game can retain a certain amount of novelty value and depth it is worth a try.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Zeeta</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Although I get nervous ticks thinking about going back to Karnors at lvl 40 it does open up for an interesting perspective if all passive AAs are maintained.<br />
<br />
I imagine maxed defensive AAs would be pretty insane at lvl 30...<br />
<br />
De level with a CLR and SK friend and go take on all the old world bosses.... Heck - you could probably solo Vox &amp; Naggy in the early 50s with maxed AAs and lvl 65 equipment (dis counting equipment with level restrictions)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Avenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">They need a server that is only oldworld (no expansions, or zone revamps). This in my opinion, would be a blast to play. I remember running around in full bronze on my warrior with langseax's at level 20 thinking I was hot-stuff. I would loooove to do again. Nowdays, 90% of the EQ population has a character over 50. It takes a lot of fun out of the lower end game. One suggestion is make an alt on a different server, this way you cant twink him :) Pvp is fun, or annoying, depends on how good you are, or how twinked the person your after is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">When Kane Bayle came out, it was very fun and I started a new character there. Tradeskills were in demand, low level quests were done, and some people were in their own levelling race. However it got to the point at around lvl 34 of impossibility of finding groups and they introduced focus effects so I wanted to play around with them back on my original character on my old server. So I never went back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I remember a rogue that delevelled from 55 to 16ish way back when you kept your skills.. he was totally evil, wasted a few of my twinks in blackburrow ;) them backstabs for 200 kinda hurt when ya got 1k hp..<br />
<br />
But I have thought about doing this.. level up a new character to lvl 62(or whatever). Get him full ornate(no level req) and delevel. Bam, you're uber ;)</div></div><hr />
