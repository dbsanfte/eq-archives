<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry about the dufus question but this has been boggling me for a little while now.  I have 2 accounts, I used to run 65 Sham and 65 Sk on them.  Some time ago I lost the ability to use the spellset on 1 of my accounts.  Its as if that ability never ever existed on that account ( I know it did but its as if it never did).  My question is does anyone know a file I can delete and repatch or have any other suggestions to get the ability back.  I used search and came up dry.  My thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do /loadskin default<br />
<br />
Then right-click the spellbook icon normally.<br />
<br />
If you still don't have it, try deleting your .opt files and anything with your character name on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Make sure &quot;context sensitive menus&quot; is turned on.  It's a pretty poorly described option, but when you turn it off, all right click menus are blocked, including the fancy spell-memorize menus, and the right click spellset menus.<br />
<br />
You should be able to save/load them by typing still though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Context Sensitive menus was turned off, I'll be damned.  I went through the general options menu over and over trying to figure out what I was missing.  Thank you very much, I probably would never had gotten it straightened out on my own.  /bow Jaruden</div></div><hr />
