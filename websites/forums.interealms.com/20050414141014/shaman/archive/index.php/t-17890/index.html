<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since this latest patch I'm having random crashes when switching characters and also encountering complete lockup occasionally when using vendors or bankers.  I'm really sick of this!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm having the first problem and a friend is having the second problem.  we're both on windows xp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had no problems until the ability to alt +shift + R was added.  Now I go LD way too frequently.  Usually any LD is will cause a server crash notification if I try to log back into EQ without completely rebooting my system.  This little pop up causes my mouse to freeze and I have to get around using {tab] or [Ctrl + Alt + Del].<br />
<br />
Just for the record: 2 PC's. One a brand new Pentium 4 1.5mhz with 1 GB of 133mhz DDR RAM, a new nvida 128mb video card. The other, an older rebuilt Pentium 4 2mhz 512MB 133mhz DDR RAM and a 32mb nvida video card. Both running XP and both LD, crash, and lock up tighter than Hillary's knickers with Bill in bed.<br />
<br />
Also, Im sharing a 56K modem too while playing EQ which could account for some of it, but not those crashes.  If I dont zone both PC's simultaneously, everything just slows down a little.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well, the recent undocumented stealth patch has eliminated the problem I had with logging/switching toons...and things were peachy for a while...but now I'm having simply TONS of crashes when zoning, clicking on merchants, or clicking on bankers.<br />
<br />
Nothing has changed on my machine except for EQ patches.  They can say it's an XP thing...but I say they need to write code that works on all platforms, particularly the frickin newer ones like XP.  They obvisouly can fix these problems with patches....I just wish they'd test stuff better to avoid releasing patches with game destroying bugs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">who knows.  What I do know is that the problem is spreading, as your is, to clicking on bankers and vendors now.  Of course zoning has always been a touchy thing for me, and I frequently go LD zoning. However, now I dont relog in the new zone but find myself in the old zone.  1 day, I found myself in a ghostly world filled with nothing but mist, like a scene from an old Star Trek movie.  Everyone could hear me, but there were no graphics just empty space and mist.  I had to camp reboot EQ and log back in to fix that.  Could it be possible that they are just trying to cram too much crap into the program?</div></div><hr />
