<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did sewers lastnight in the hopes of finaly picking up a GoD spell , I have none thus far . I had a pick up group . Its consisted of the following .<br />
1 . Warrior , well equiped I think all Ele type stuff but i dont think time level .<br />
2 . Shaman , Myself .. Vex thal level gear with some early ele .<br />
3 . Cleric , This guy is non guilded but a LDoN hog .. close too the best possible LDoN gear in every slot .<br />
4 . Enchanter .. roughly Vex thall level gear .<br />
5 . Monk , Anouther LDoN hog .. loads of LDoN gear .<br />
6 . Rogue , This guy was the only person in the group that was in poTime I would say he was decently time level geared .<br />
<br />
Well anyway Monk was a stellar puller , he was awesome ... Singles virtualy allways . Chanter remarks &quot;Glad theres a shaman Im de meming slow&quot; , thats how I know he wasnt slowing .<br />
At first i malos/Slow as usual then i realize .. these freekin mosquitoes are dieing in like 30sec .. i kid you not DPS musthave been unreal these things were DEAD in 30 sec ... <br />
Well my slow was only sicking too these guys for like 15sec before they were dead ... So ... I didnt even bother ... I DEMEMED SLOW .<br />
<br />
8-10 pulls later I comment &quot;Is mana ok , im not even bothering too slow these there dieing too fast .&quot; The cleric responds .. &quot;Manas fine .&quot;<br />
I was STUNNED .. the &quot;Role&quot; of slower was NOT NEEDED in GoD content &quot;at least the sewers&quot;<br />
I asked the chanter if he was slowing .. &quot;lol of course not these things are dead in 30sec or less .&quot;<br />
<br />
We finished Sewers .. I didnt get a spell /sigh ... The only thing i contributed too the group was a few tnargs mendings and chain nukes .. my &quot;core role&quot; as a slower that everyone says is SOOOOOO overpowered not only wasnt needed ... but it wasnt even NOTICED in its absence .</div></div><hr />

I havent done the the 5 and 6 mountain trials with my shaman yet, but I'd be willing to bet we will be helpful with our slows and backup healing, stuff hits extremely hard and fast and even decently equipped tanks can have trouble staying up.</div></div><hr />

/em feeds dugann some words<br />
<br />
So basically, what you are saying here, is that sham are only useful in groups that aren't very powerful (ie sub-baz geer, and 50AA's).<br />
<br />
Honestly, i couldn't agree w ya more.  When i played through a ldon w crap gear and only 50 AA's, i was useful becuase i was with similarly equiped people.  Now that i have 150+AA's and am EP geared, I feel useless becuase i'm with similarly equiped people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh Sorry dude I'm really not trying to slam you but to say Slow isnt needed in trials is sort of like saying &quot;I took my group of lvl 65s to Velks and you dont need slow!&quot;  The beginning runs of Trials arent ballanced for PoTime equipped folks.  Just like Velks isnt ballanced around lvl 65 folks.<br />
<br />
Not everyone is in a group full of PoTime, VT+, or 50,000AP people.<br />
<br />
Get a full group of folks in the new Abysmal SeaCrafted and people will be saying &quot;We had a ranger heal us through all 4 Trials!&quot;<br />
<br />
As the general group gear gets better the tank will take less damage and the dps will increase so instead of taking 400dps for 40 seconds the better group is taking 300dps for 30 seconds.... big big difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the underlying gripe here is that shamans are SO &quot;balanced&quot; around having this &quot;Awesome&quot; ability to slow mobs, that we have very little else to bring to the table that is of a competitive level with other classes.  <br />
1) Heals? Please, a pally can do just as well or better.<br />
2) Damage? Arguably the least DPS class aside from cleric.<br />
3) Any necessary utility?  Nah, just some buffs that nobody really needs at high end.  At the best we can add 540 hps.  Beastlords can add about that much with their buffs.  Again, why have a shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beastlords can add about that much with their buffs.  Again, why have a shaman?<br />
BLs buff considerably better than we do. There is a thread somewhere, not bothering to link,  but suffice it to say they out-buff us by a LARGE margin in todays MUDflated Gear of EQ.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slow is no longer a function high end but got to disagree on that 2nd quote.<br />
Yes you can kill SoL/PoP mobs etc without slow because of healing power of clerics but slowing saves a damn lot of time with no med breaks etc.<br />
Who remembers back in the old days killing a mob then having to have a break between nearly every mob.<br />
Dont forget this was in the days before FT15 on non uber clerics,KEI etc etc.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hail,<br />
<br />
I did Tipt yesterday (twice).  Mixture of unguilded and Elementally geared folk.  Most the the unguilded were previously in EP guilds.  I was probably in the poorest gear overall but second in terms of AA's (over 400).<br />
<br />
I honestly felt like a leech through large stretches of the trial.  I did my best to keep FA up on anyone meleeing and ensured the charm pet always had it.  I kept up Malos &amp; Malosinia to ensure the pet was debuffed on every  charm break.  I slowed the pet when the enchie went LD or had a bad run of luck &amp; then cured the pet using SS legs afterwards.  I cast Tears of Saryn whenver it had a chance for 2 waves or more to go off.  I was casting like crazy only to see whatever dps contribution I could make (aside from dogdog &amp; FA) usually end up landing on a dead target.  I was quick on the Radiant Cure button whenever someone had a nasty proc on them.  I topped off people with Tnarg's whenever someone wasn't at 100% in between pulls.<br />
<br />
Mobs just died too fast.  Aggressively slowing just meant I took alot of damage &amp; the mobs would ping-pong a little.  The only reason this didn't screw us over was because our cleric was amazing the first go around.<br />
<br />
I have never felt so worthless in any situation ever before.  Sewers trial attempts I felt I was adding at least some value.  Tipt I was good for a Tnarg's a few times that helped, but in many cases I'm sure the cleric heal landed a tenth of a second later, so it was just doublecoverage.  While I'm sure the FA over the long haul added to group DPS, with the insane offensive output of the charm pet it wasn't needed.  Every time a situation arose where the cleric was going down, it was the Paladin heal that landed instead of my own.<br />
<br />
The only buff most of the melees wanted was Focus.  They didn't want Bih'li because SoE is faster.  I also gave the casters stamina of course.   I buffed all pets with Diaku + Focus + FA as well.<br />
<br />
I could have been AFK on auto-follow almost the whole fight and I don't think it would have mattered much, even on the named. :( <br />
<br />
The good news at least is that I won the Bracer of Exploration.  I actually lost the roll against a ranger (just the 2 of us there in chain), but he looked at it and saw me drooling and defaulted it to me even though he won.  /hug Banadas! :cool: <br />
<br />
I think I'm going to have to call in some major favors to get folks to carry me through the other trials. :confused:   That's just not the way it should be. :mad: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So basically, what you are saying here, is that sham are only useful in groups that aren't very powerful (ie sub-baz geer, and 50AA's). <br />
<br />
Not exactly what I said, my whole point is about where you are fighting, and in trials 1-4 slow may not be all that necessary (especially if your group is well equipped as the first poster suggests) but I'd like to see any group with any very well equipped tank do trials 5-6 without some form of slow without adding massive downtime (can be done without a backup healer, but its riskier).<br />
<br />
Its all about where you hang out and what the zone was designed for and I dont beleive trials 1-4 were designed for Time/best LDoN geared folks to be a huge challenge as were 5-6.<br />
<br />
edit- Just read Frekkels post and the point I also made earlier is that even though its not all noticable and sometimes you dont see what would/could have been if you were replaced by another class, you make the group harder to kill.<br />
<br />
As hard and fast as those mobs hit, its hard to tell just what you did and if you saved someones life.  Who knows how much your malos brought to the table and that charmed pet and how they would have done without it, or the fact that you had an 'amazing' cleric this time doesnt mean they will be so great next time.  Adjust to do what you can to help, you dont have to do rains if they arent all landing.<br />
<br />
With someone else in your place maybe they would have wiped twice, we are in the background, a support class that makes everyone elses jobs easier, if you want to be in the limelight you should be playing a different class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">From what I am reading, I shouldn't even think about going to GoD.  Cause even thinking about it would kill me.<br />
<br />
See my Magelo.  You'll understand.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm sure your tanks could tell the difference. They'll be able to tell the difference even more in vxed/tipt, and in IK they will probably die a lot. I've play both shaman and warrior, so I see it from both sides. When you are doing trivial content the need for slowing decreases, thats obvious. It does not mean that slowing has no value, even in fast fights.<br />
<br />
It's all about risk v efficiency. You can be very efficient by maximizing dps, but that comes at the cost of increased risk. When you are doing trivial content that risk is very small to begin with, but if you are doing challenging content that risk becomes greater. As a shaman it is your responsibility to minimize and manage that risk. So, even though slow might be minor according to the numbers game, the impact on risk reduction is huge, especially in trials like tipt or vxed where a wipe near the end can literally waste hours of game play. It's important to realize that allthough it seems like you are doing little, that little can be a big deal when it matters.<br />
<br />
Ya, I know that feeling you get slowing in places like sewers. I also know that feeling tanking in tipt or IK when slow doesnt land (or the pet is chasing the chanter around and your only healer is focused on keeping two people far from each other alive) and you see your hp plummet to 5-10% before a heal lands in the nick of time.<br />
<br />
You need to adapt you tactics to the content you are fighting. It kind of burns me when mature time+ equiped players come in and claim that slow doesnt matter in Tipt, and then some poor shmuck for whom the zone is cutting edge comes along and gets their ass handed to them because people who are &quot;experts&quot; told them that slow isnt needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">. . .am I the only frigging level 65 Time Geared Shaman that CANNOT get slow to land in Sewers and Normal LDon's without Malos or Tash.<br />
<br />
:(<br />
Can't speak for the sewers, only been there a few times trying to farm spells before they nerfed it. However, I never mem any form of Malos in LDoN normal, not in any of the camps. In fact, I almost never slow the primary pull, and only work crowd-control, slowing and parking adds. Just no need to waste the mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">In LDoN I will cast slow once without malo, it if bounces then I begin dot/nuking/crowd control.  Depending on the puller I may keep tigir's up instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">What Tugela fails to mention in his ever present litany of disinformation is that while Slow can certainly be a part of good &quot;risk management&quot; in any group, BL's and Enchanters can fill this role and bring other more desireable abilities to the table in addition.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Focus is pretty useless at the highend actually. <br />

Slow is not needed. What is needed is damage prevention. What I and a lot of other people having been saying for ages now is that two clerics will outdo a cleric and a shaman in the damage prevention department.<br />
<br />
Short term, long, term, damage spikes, dealing with multiples, dealing with adds - two clerics will be better at keeping the group alive then a cleric + shaman. By a considerable margin.<br />
<br />
Of course if you dismiss the shaman and do not replace him the group may well die - shaman do not yet have zero value to these groups, just a lot less then clerics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:(<br />
<br />
I seem to have fewer resist when I'm right up on the mob just slightly out of melee range.  If i'm hanging out in the back I seem the get more resist.  I don't know if distance really does affect this, but it sure seems that away to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is just a quick note to Frekkels, and anyone else in a Vxed/Tipt group with a charming enchanter.  Groups with an enchanter playing pet are all about controlling the pet. The only people who really get to feel useful are the puller, the cleric, and, of course, the enchanter. <br />
<br />
Everyone else is just there as support for the enchanter pretty much; your snarer, your debuffer, and your agro magnet.  I personally haven't done the mountain trials as a shaman, I've been playing my bard only for the last 5 months or so, but I can say that without a doubt, a pet group gives a *very* skewed vision of the effectiveness of slow.  We've farmed Vxed/Tipt with only bard slow, and a botted enchanter for charming, and it barely made a difference because the mobs died so fast.  However, try going through them without the pet, and the advantage of slow is far more noticeable. So you needn't feel useless until you hit Kod Taz+. ;)<br />
<br />
Kod Taz is much different, and, frankly, from a non-shaman point of view, I'd never bother to invite a shaman in, unless it was a friend or guildmate. Frankly, they just take up a spot which could be far better utilised by almost any other class.  I feel horribly guilty for saying/thinking this, but it is the unfortunate truth.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for your comments Kryscha, unfortunately it doesn't make me feel any better.<br />
<br />
I can't imagine trying to do VXed and Tipt WITHOUT using a charm pet for dps.  It would take hours of slogging through mobs.  Our ench went LD a few times, and we had to kill w/o the pet and it seemed to take forever.  Realistically it about tripled or quadrupled our kill-times w/o the pet, and was a severe manadrain on the whole group just to kill 2-3 mobs.  The trial took long enough as it was with the pet.<br />
<br />
Another cleric or a druid would have been of much more use than any benefits I provided.  The fact that this gets even worse in KodTaz (not that I'm remotely close to getting there) is really sad.<br />
<br />
I don't mind not being the group rock star (Yay, it is slowed!) any longer, but I'd like to be at least moderately useful to my groups.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With a CoD pet, everyone in the group minus the cleric has one job... try to die instead of the Enc. I remember parsing some ArchLich fights in Ssra and having the whole raid of ~30 getting around 2k DPS on him (minus DoTs). A hasted Pooka can do 2k DPS on it's own.<br />
<br />
Without that crazy imbalance (which is **** retarded as is), slow is invaluable. You say it wasn't worth slowing in those 30sec fights, but it sure as hell was when the Enc went LD wasn't it?<br />
<br />
The even better news is virtually nothing is CoD'able past Vxed/Tipt so an Enc becomes dead weight too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have never done Vxed without a charmed pet, nor have I done Tipt with one.  <br />
<br />
I will have to agree with the post about controlling the pet.  Regardless of the situation in Vxed, if charm broke I would slow it.  If I did not take aggro, it gives the chanty a bit more time to get control of the pet again.  By this time, I have usually drawn aggro  while the tank continues to control the pulled mob.  Resinia during this and gtg again.  A simple cure loses slow and back to the quick kills.<br />
<br />
In Tipt, the first success I had was with no cc at all.  The group was War, Cler, Monk, Ranger, Rog, and me.  Never had a problem through the whole thing.  If I was to say I was useless I would be a danm liar.  Slow was landing on most mobs (after malos) between 90-95% health.<br />
<br />
I have also grouped in KT (with friends of course :p ) but have found a role to fill as well.  It aint the most glamorous role, but we do well together.<br />

Work with whatcha have until we get fixed.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure the Enchanter was COD'ing (Command of Druzzil a level 63 - innm Charm spell) a Mosquito.  Not sure why you would define that group composition as &quot;crap&quot; but to each their own.<br />
<br />
But a charmed pet, Rogue and Monk for DPS, Warrior to avoid one rounding, Cleric for healing and Shaman for Maloing, spot heals and spot CC.<br />
<br />
Sounds like a decent group to me.</div></div><hr />

You use a chanter as slower in them if you need one because they can charm and add DPS to make the trial go faster.

<br />
Nowhere did I say we were NEEDED (most classes are not NEEDED), in fact when my rogue was flagged we only had a cleric for heals (no backup) and an enchanter and bard for cc/slows (they did not charm).  I believe (and we'll see when I get my shaman flagged), that we CAN be useful in helping the group achieve the final goals and make it easier to win (not necessarily faster) by making it harder for the group to die.<br />

I did 5 &amp; 6 without a charmed pet, xps is xps imo, if I wasnt doing something there, I'd be doing it elsewhere so not sure what amount of time it takes to complete has to do with much of anything.  5 took a long time, but I thought I read recently (here) that it was going to be reduced from kill 100 to 50 which will halve the length of time it takes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Remember that charms have been nerfed in many of these zones now by making most creatures immune to charm. The fact that charmed pets had such massive DPS was clearly an oversight on SOE's part and has been fixed. Just be glad they didn't make all creatures in these trials unslowable. Then shaman would really have been useless.</div></div><hr />

Must be ya low Charisma  :rolleyes: <br />

On a more serious note, the original poster is just starting to realise what has been said here all along :)  Shaman need something to add to this new fast paced GoD style playing (both Raiding and Grouping) because we were originally designed around long drawn out battles.<br />
<br />
Evidence for the statement that we were designed for long fights is obtained by looking at our orginial spell line ups:<br />
<br />
debuffs, including slow - poor effect on short fights, but a compounding return on longer fights<br />
buffs - a +200 Str or Attack buff does nothing for a single fight, but has a compounding effect over multiple fights<br />
DoTs - self explanatory, designed to be effective for long fights, pointless casting in short fights due to cast time + effect time, <br />
HoTs - regen in its original form, Torpor and Qu in newer forms... with old content + slow + a good defensive tank, HoTs were a viable method to heal ... but with slow mitigation, huge DPS mobs and fast fights, there is no way we can heal a tank.<br />
<br />
I hate healing, but I did a bit of an experiment just to prove to myself that the developers are FoS when they make claims that the 100 / 75 / 47% heal ratio is justified for priests... this was my experiment:<br />
<br />
In a Vxed trial, I tried HoT the WAR on incoming + slowing a vxed mob with Turgurs (luckily it landed first time without Malos, so this is an EXTREMELY rare case, but it did mitigate) + spam healing the WAR in /defensive with Tnarg's (maxxed healing AAs) ... he died before Qu wore off (~30 secs into fight) ... there is nothing else I could have done to heal him any better .....<br />
<br />
Interestingly enough, a Cleric had no trouble keeping him alive without /defensive and without HoTs and WITHOUT slow ....<br />
<br />
Even more interesting, a Druid managed to keep him alive without /defensive and without slow, but he opted to use SoTW at start of fight ....<br />
<br />
Same was repeated in KT as well ....<br />
<br />
So if the developers think we can heal sufficently in GoD with HoT + Malos + slow + spam heal with Tnarg's + max healing AA + a WAR with /defensive, they are sorely mistaken ....<br />
<br />
If they think a fast cast slow with a slight resistance modification will change things, then they are sorely mistaken also (as shown by my experiement, my Turgurs casts in 2.2sec, and that spare 0.7 secs that Nihil would have saved me would not have made a difference to the dead WAR) ...<br />
<br />
I challenge ANY developer to make a 65 Shammy, 65 Cleric, 65 Druid and give them all same healing AAs (hell, even give the Shammy all the healing AAs and forget the AAs for the Cleric and Druid) and try to keeping a WAR alive in vxed, Tipt or KT ... <br />
<br />
My next experiment is to see if an enchanter with a pet for massive DPS + chain runes can keep a /disc WAR alive better then I can ... I am betting with Tash / Slow / Pet / Runes, the fight will be ~20 secs and the chanter can keep a Warrior alive with Runes ....<br />
<br />
Now I don't want to be a main healer, but I would like to bring SOMETHING to a GoD group ...maybe massive DPS boosts thru buffs, something like a group over haste cap + 150 attack (is this really that unreasonable, think of the DPS a chanter brings, and they have slow) .... maybe better defensive abilities thru buffs / debuffs (+avoidance buffs, +shielding buffs, +fizzle debuffs, etc etc) .... a DI type spell that rarely fails (hell, we can't heal fast enough, maybe some way of compensating for it :P ) ... some minor Rez functionality for when the Cleric dies cause we can't heal them fast enough .... etc etc (there are plenty of creative ideas already on these boards) ...<br />
