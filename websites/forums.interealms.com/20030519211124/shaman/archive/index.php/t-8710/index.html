<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">your gear isn't all that great, dont worry about peeps being upset that you have better gear than they did.<br />
You didn't give a budget but I will try to guess. If you have a lot more plat than your gear shows say so for some higher end advise.<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
earing of the solstice(should be about the same as bs electrum for you now and will just keep getting better, replace the fingerbone hoop.<br />
Amulet of insight(a very nice focus on this and neck is quite a tough slot to upgrade pre 51)<br />
shissar scale hat<br />
hardened grey flesh sleeves do give a bit more hp but not a lot so replace as budget allows<br />
ods(focus till 60 rather than 44 will help a lot, alternatively get a sharp claw whatever from pop with affliction efficiency 4 for a better focus, except when buffing)<br />
Fungi tunic(this should be a big priority for you as you should be able to at the very least downgrade some other slots to afford one. If you just cant manage it get an ikky bp)<br />
Heiro cloak(I assume that you can afford this as it will last you a long time, otherwise get an ancient seahorse hide cloak)<br />
brown chitin legs(loose a bit of ac for more hp and mana, or go for mq thurg or ss legs)<br />
barbed dragon boots<br />
sarnak battle shield, or skull marked. if you have the cash go for ooiv<br />
your range is nice but if you have to sell to buy fungi do it and grab a sandwich of foul smelling herbs or even goranga.<br />
<br />
Dont worry about dropping a huge chunk of wis to get more hp and regen. What you should be most concerned with at this point is getting a fungi and a horse. Your manapool will only be a concern for a very short time in your late 40s and early 50s, and only if duoing with a poorly geared tank. As you level up and get can 3 and 4 your hp pool becomes much more important. Also without having good hp/ac you cant be as effective in duo/group/solo or even raid type situations. <br />
<br />
Personally, I had a similar(if not better) quality of gear as you do and I have been quite happy with having 150 wis. I am able to tank pretty effectively and I am never afraid to slow on inc. Now, at level 50 I am only looking for ways to get more hp and higher ac, wis is a very distant concern for me, except when I tradeskill :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taiden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the suggestions,  I wasnt sure what lvl wis would be passable but if you can get by with 150 then i can give it a shot and dump some wis stuff. <br />
<br />
I will take a look for ods and amulet of insight in bazaar and pickup the stuff for earing. I imagine that will give me a few hundred hp upgrade anyways. <br />
<br />
 I keep seeing everyone talk about how nice a horse is, dont want to drop too much on it. I could probably get one of the slower ones since it wont be used for travel anyways.<br />
<br />
edit- Switched fungi, shissar hat, barbed dragon boots, hiero cloak and hardened grey flesh arms from monk to shaman. Put me back to 171 wis but picked up close to 200hp and 15ish or so ac thanks for suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">looking better now.<br />
For the horse: pick up the cheapest one then turn off all luclin models. This will enable you to summon your horse and still use sow speed to run with. You will never see the horse, or have the anoying start/stop that I have heard about. I have been using a horse for about 5 months now and only saw it once when someone posted a pic of me on it :)<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />
