<br />
World of Warcraft 3 for the PC is AWESOME.  For those who haven't played, the campaign game involves a lot of history and the coming of the Chaos (Shades of Warhammer 40k) forces.<br />
<br />
You start off watching an Orc (Thrall) lead his forces to and thru the Human lands. One episode only.<br />
<br />
Then you switch to the Human side as a Paladin named Arthas.<br />
<br />
After that (10 scenarios) you switch to the Undead (8 scenarios).<br />
<br />
Next up is the Orcs (Thrall again), for I don't know how many scenarios.<br />
<br />
Fun, fun, fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, that would be &quot;Warcraft III.&quot;<br />
<br />
I agree Faern - it should be required playing for all future WoW players.  The RTS game helps you understand the history, interrelationships, locations, and main characters that you see in the MMORPG.<br />
<br />
I remember how much we used to complain about EQ not having a story line when it first came out (and never did really develop one).  WoW comes out with a three game (plus expansions) storyline already on the street.  Very clever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe you can read all of the Warcraft lore on the worldofwarcraft.com website, also. But it is much more fun to play through it than it is to read it - it's absolutely good preparatory gaming for anyone planning to play WoW.<br />
<br />
I also purchased the Frozen Throne expansion, but never finished the campaign. I still don't know what happened, but from what I hear the Frozen Throne lore doesn't play too large of a part in WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I wonder what it is with Frozen Throne - I only got about halfway through it, too.  Not that it was particularly bad or anything, I was just easily distracted from it by other games.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah me too. I think I had difficulty with one campaign mission and just abandoned it for multiplayer. I had been playing Warcraft multiplayer for a while, so my main utility for the expansion was online.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Warcraft 3 was an amazing game. The expansion i didn't like as MUCH. It still added a lot of cool sheet.<br />
<br />
Btw the cinematics Blizzard makes are amazing.<br />
The video at the end of the ORC campaign was AMAZING. So was the video at the end of the Human campaign.<br />
<br />
The only one i can say was too short and not very epic like was the one at the end of the game :(<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that Warcraft III was released in order to introduce the story of World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
<br />
2004 will see HL2 world of warcraft and Knights of the old republic 2 OMG :D oh and we had doom 3 also. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've completed the first two campaigns of Frozen Throne - Night Elf and Blood Elf.<br />
<br />
I'm also playing the bonus campaign which is a lot of fun.  Basically you start off as a Beastlord type guy and help the Orcs.  My dude is up to level 5 or so.  It is almost non-stop killing which is nice.</div></div><hr />
