<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I used to twobox a 65shm and 65wiz but wanted the chance at playing a mele char for abit more fuction in dungeon crawling and the like.<br />
<br />
I started a SK and that char is now lvl 65 aswell.<br />
<br />
Now to my question, what could this duo take out?<br />
I am looking for fun targets I could try, was thinking of the King in Seb that dropps the Fungi maybe. Well that is just one target I could think of straight away, looking for more possible targets.<br />
<br />
Also a follow up question, I have a 65wiz and 65clr I could invite some times for bigger targets like Zland or such.<br />
Just looking for targets my two chars could take out or maybe with the help from these two friends. I love doing these &quot;mini raids&quot;.<br />
<br />
My shaman is close to 2900hp unbuffed with 100 AAs and the SK is almost at 4100hp but only 15 AAs :)<br />
My two friends are OK outfited aswell.<br />
<br />
Any help would be helpfull, fun and tough targets are the goal here :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kunark dragons migh be doable, sev, talendor, gorenaire. Maybe woushi, ww dragons definitely. SOme of the minor named in UP, etc etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my advice is to pick a zone...look at the targets...see what loot drops..pick some loot you want and go for it..worst case you get the cle to come and rez you.  Kunark dragons might be fun to attempt as a duo..not sure t he probability of success though..guess thats what would make it fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not exactly on-topic, but I tried to solo crawl The Hole about a week ago. I got down to the ramp before earth town before I gated. I probably could have continued - only had a ratman and a golem and I had taken a golem and 2 elementals simultaneously on the way down - but there were a lot of possible adds nearby so I figured I better get out before it got ugly. I'm going to go back and try that again one of these days. I would like to fight down to Kirn's tower at least just for fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wise choice, shaman+sk are excellent duo partners.<br />
<br />
Some things that you can do, as mentioned before, kunark dragons depending on your resists, ive done severillous with me + a warrior.<br />
<br />
You can do ww dragons.. most likely clear your way down to trakanons lair if you play it smart as well as partner in most tier3 zones.<br />
<br />
with 65 wiz and 65 clr with you Zland would be doable, as well as Dozekar maybe, ive heard of a 65war/cle/shm hydra team doing doze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Kunark Dragons (gore / talendor are the ones i tried) are NP duo with a 65 war so should be np with a SK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I highly recommend going back to zones like Seb and exploring all those little rooms you never got to see while sitting in camp waiting for the puller.<br />
<br />
Not incredibly uber but pretty fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Nice, I will try a kunark dragon when ever I can find one up, should prove fun.<br />
<br />
One of the reason why I was thinking of doing king in seb with my duo was just becouse I have never done the camp before, should be fun to see what it was all about when the &quot;ubers&quot; back then camped it with one grp or less.<br />
<br />
Those two ghost in UP might be doable with my duo or the 4 of us?<br />
Cant remember name straight up but think they have a normal version then a ghost version.<br />
<br />
Was also thinking wing mini nameds in BoT after I have got some defense AAs.<br />
<br />
Many things to try out, just got to find out where the fun targets are :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies so far</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Faydedar and that other seadragon in CS should be doable as well</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes talking about the spirits up in the cave gorlaan? With 4 of you should be a piece of cake. Ive done it with 5  but the 52 shaman thought ebolt was too cool and went splat pretty quick. With your two would be fun to try. Just make sure you fight the first verions outside of the room so you dont have to fight again dircetly after you kill it. If you do that and are able to keep canning mana at a reasonable rate i would think its possible to kill with two. Id like to try it with my pally and shaman but been doing alot of other stuff and havent made it out to ups yet.</div></div><hr />
