Fricken 5 day spawn, so annoying.<br />
<br />
Gosh I love killing endless gobbies non stop, the joy of faction farming on greenies....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">droga.  /cry<br />
<br />
I have killed about 1100 goblins now.<br />
I have the head of warlord skargus, all I gotta do is finish factioning.<br />
<br />
*shudder*<br />
-Henora</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, I probably should of logged all my kills, but I know I haven't killed 3k goblins/spiders yet. Just hit amiable when i turned in a couple stacks of salts and 5 skins today! Almost there, shouldn't be too much longer now to get ally :) <br />
<br />
I've been at this for the past week leveling in Nurga and started in Droga last night. I just hit 40, so all I need now is a couple more steps in the faction ladder and hit 50, shouldn't take too long. Hard part now is going to get the angry goblin in Droga since there are always level 60's in there now farming faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">==================================================<br />
<br />
The small sarnak just inside the zoneline in Chardok, Herald Telcha gives out a quest for two chardok rings. He won't attack you even if you are kos and won't fight back. He has low hp and may have been killed. Quick respawn time (same as the rest of the dungeon).<br />
<br />
To do his quests you need faction. Kill goblins/spiders in Nurga/Droga to gain faction, and save the 'Mt. Death Mineral Salts' and 'Green Goblin Skin' they occasionally drop. Turn in two salts at a time or one skin at a time to the Herald for decent faction hits.<br />
<br />
Max Ally Faction from Max KOS: 3700 faction hits<br />
One Droga/Nurga goblin/spider kill: 1 faction hit<br />
One turn-in of either skins or salts: 2 or 3 faction hits (unconfirmed)<br />
<br />
All rewards are ALL/ALL and MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br />
All rewards require that the quester is level 50 or higher<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
1st Ring:<br />
<br />
Requirements:<br />
High warmly faction (100 points below ally, 1000 points in absolute terms).<br />
<br />
1st ring steps:<br />
<br />
Talk to Herald Telcha in Chardok and say &quot;I serve the sarnak&quot;. You will be rewarded with:<br />
<br />
Di`Zok Signet of Service<br />
AC 2 CHA/WIS/INT+1 HP+65 Mana+45 - Weight 0.1<br />
<br />
==================================================<br />
<br />
2nd Ring:<br />
<br />
Requirements:<br />
Ally faction<br />
<br />
2nd ring steps:<br />
<br />
1. Talk to 'a goblin traitor' (2-3 hour spawn) in Nurga and say &quot;what evidence&quot;. He will give you a note. (-50,-75)<br />
<br />
2. Take this note to 'a Sarnak spy' in Frontier Mountains. Follow the dialogue and you will eventually say &quot;I will get the report&quot;. He will give you a forged note. (+1880,+3635)<br />
<br />
3. Take this forged note to &quot;a shady goblin&quot; in Warsliks Woods near Cabilis along with a 'Drogan Warlord's Insignia' (random drop in Nurga/Droga off goblins). He will give you a report to Skargus. 24 Hour spawn approximately. (-1645,-1135 on the 2nd floor of the building outside the city entrance)<br />
<br />
4. Take this report to 'an angry goblin' (5 day spawn) in Droga (+180,+1940). This will cause him to walk through the tunnel and into the dining room, then into a small cubby at approximate loc (+250,+1600). Then he despawns and Warlord Skargus spawns. He's a level 56 SK, has 10-15k hitpoints, hits for 165. Beware of his ~850 point harmtouch and possible fear spells. Kill Skargus and loot his Head of Skargus.<br />
<br />
5. Bring the Head and the 1st Ring back to Herald Telcha and you'll be rewarded with:<br />
<br />
Regal Band of Bathezid<br />
AC5 CHA/WIS/INT+2 HP+85 Mana+65 - 5 Charges of 'Aegis of Bathezid' (25pt dmg shield, 25 min duration) - Weight 0.1<br />
<br />
You may hand back the ring to Telcha and get it back with 5 full charges. Make sure you're still ally.<br />
<br />

<br />
Requirements:<br />
Ally faction<br />
Undead Dragon Sinew (Trakanon, Sebilite Juggernauts)<br />

2nd ring<br />
<br />
Trakanon is a 3 day spawn in Old Sebilis, Juggernauts respawn in about 27 minutes in the deepest area of Sebilis. Can also drop off the Sebilite Protector. Trakanon requires several groups to kill, while one (strong) group can hold juggernaut area.<br />
<br />
Drusella is supposedly a 24 hour spawn deep in the east wing of Howling Stones. Easy with one group.<br />
<br />
Cords Steps:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tenoq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">oh yes, yes indeed i'll agree that sitting in droga for hours with a pet and a dream is no fun... what helps immensely is getting a 60 rogue to run around with you for a couple hours at a time. the faction goes by *much* faster this way seeing as how a good percentage of the goblins you fight will get assassinated. have fun with it. run ahead and pull yourself a big train and torpor and panic until your melee buddy sorts through all those screaming green critters. what i used to do is run laps around through droga from the FM entrance, down the drop off, to the dining room with the warder, and back up the ramp to the entrance over and over again. check your faction on the goblin traitor. getting out of KoS is rough. when you're apprehensive do what i did and treat yourself to some uber chardok food and terrify the pickup groups hunting there. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So I can say &quot;what evidence&quot; to the goblin traitor as soon as I get out of threatening? Since I'm going to be down there faction farming, I'd prefer to try and catch the angry goblin while I'm at it...<br />
<br />
What faction do I need to get the goblin traitor to hand over the evidence?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i read the angry was 3 days on allakhazam's. Can anyone confirm which is correct? I'm ally, i just need the angry :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The Angry goblin is a 3day +/- 10% spawn. So he will spawn again anywhere from 64.8 to 79.2 hours after being killed.<br />
<br />
Best time is after server resets. If he is up DO NOT waste your time getting a group and waiting at entrance. Other necro/shamans who know how easy he is will engage asap so do the same yourself.<br />
<br />
He does NOT summon and can be rooted. So you can either tank him with pet slowed or root rot him..either way engage right away.</div></div><hr />
