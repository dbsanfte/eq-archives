<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently completed my Veeshan's Peak key.    We're doing it as a guild... and currently right now I'm the only 1 finished.<br />
<br />
I'm 65... most of my spells (no malos, no blood), 64 AAs... 5401hp fully buffed.<br />
<br />
I can solo a guardian wurm without breaking much of a sweat.<br />
<br />
How safe is it to zone into VP?   And is it possible to solo the yard trash... single pulls... etc... ?<br />
<br />
I'm not looking for a source of amazing xp or anything... I'm looking for a challenge and something new.<br />
<br />
What worries me is a possible CR... if it's not safe to zone in... well CRs would kinda suck :)    I also heard something about not being able to gate out ... is that true?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They &quot;redid&quot; the zone, so now you can gate out.  I think that was about the only major change.  Inside I believe there are more gwurms, which is a nice chance for level 60 spells, but some of them spawn that can hit for 1500 instead of the normal 550's.  I'd wait till a cleric was keyed myself before trying anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo in there quite often, it's really not much harder than regular guardian wurms in Skyfire.  The zone in is &quot;practically&quot; safe, the g-wurm that roams to the zone in rarely gets close enough to agro and even more rarely sees invis, just zone in invised to check things out.  I suspend minion and invis past the pairs of racnars, as they always come in pairs for me, and just stick to the g-wurms.   I've never had one hit for more than 530, but some of them do have AEs ... some are fear, some are DD + dispell, and one that I've always resisted was some thing with the word &quot;Mind&quot; in it (forget the full name, sorry).   Just have your resists up, a clicky buff in first slot, and be careful when they start to run so you don't get adds.<br />
<br />
Spell drops are usually junk, even inside VP unfortunately, I've managed to get a couple Voice of the Berserkers, couple of Form and Mask druid spells, couple wizard nukes, nothing much that sells for over 10k and lots of junk spells in between.  The cool thing is the g-wurms with the AEs aren't much more difficult than the regular ones, yet they give 11-12 percent AA exp versus the regular 5 percent AA exp.  Heck of a lot easier than soloing the Magmas in PoFire, almost the same exp, and you get spell drops to give to friends, hehe.<br />
<br />
Have fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I solo there a lot when I'm bored. It's real easy and the respawn time is fast so you never have to wait for new mobs. You can single pull with no problem.<br />
<br />
As for spells I have got 3 malo, 4 torpor, 2 cleric group complete heal and some other random rare spells and then hundreds of useless random spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Lol, well... <br />
<br />
Wispr 0.5, Veeshan's Peak 0.5<br />
<br />
I went in... first time ever... watched the pathing a bit... was worried about grabbing the 2 rancors and/or adding a guardian wurm.   The guardians both saw invis, but the rancors didn't.<br />
<br />
Finally got up the nerve to try it... what the heck, I'm 65 with padding, I don't care about the xp.     Manage to solo pull one rancor easily.<br />
<br />
Hitting me for a max of 400... the pet is alpha-toyed and doing nice damage... really was an easy fight for it... they summon.   Didn't drop anything at all.<br />
<br />
However, near the end of the fight I got sloppy and let the pet die to enrange... ops... that's what I get for telling people what's going on , instead of concentrating on what I was doing.<br />
<br />
So I'm gettin ready to summon up a new pet and continue... hit Cann 5.... ops... only 1600hp... dead.<br />
<br />
Lol.    The first time I've unintentionally killed myself with Cann 5, and it was in my first trip to VP.    I think it likes me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing to keep in mind is that some of the GW's have special abilities. They aren't that common maybe 1 in 10 or less. There some that have Dragon Roar they both fear and dispell. The mind burn one is a single target stun easy to resist. There is one with a large procced DD upto 1000pts, I got alot of partial resists in the 300-500 range. The one that will kill you however is the one that spawns 2 more wurms on its death (last few that have happened to me have been only a single wurm spawns).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">After smacking myself for the fun Cann 5 death, I went back did a few rounds.<br />
<br />
I'm sure it will get better as I get more comfortable with it, but I stayed at the zone.    Would kill the two rancors and then pull the guardian wurm that wanders up and down the hall.   None of the GW's had special powers at this point, but thank you for the heads up.<br />
<br />
I've noticed that the assist range on them is pretty small.   I can pull the 2nd wandering GW without agroing the 3rd static rancor.    As I was about to leave, for informational purposes, I tried to pull the 2nd wandering GW to zone, past one of the 1st static rancors... I was able to pass him no problem, but the wurm did agro him as he passed.<br />
<br />
I was getting about 4% AAXP per kill.    I dunno if deeper in it gets better or not... that's kinda nice... but not mindblowing.    I could kill super pansy stuff elsewhere for 1-2%/kill.<br />
<br />
No spells of note this round, but I'm hopeful lol.<br />
<br />
I also saw first hand that the zone is not always 100% safe, as one of the GW's rarely paths over there.  You can hide on the little strip of land going into the lava without agro.<br />
<br />
I think next time I'll take out the two rancors (I don't have pocket pet, or I'd use it) and then move up into the hall to take the first GW... then the Rancor or GW 2 (if it's wandered close)... and try there.   Don't wanna go too far since I'm the only one here right now lol :)   At least if I move up, I'll have 2 GW's in my cycle instead of the 1.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info everyone :)  I'm sure I'll get braver as time goes on... it's a fun spot that's not trivial to me (yet anyhow) and potentially could yeild some coinage or spells for friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One warning - the splitting guardian wurms are &quot;homed&quot; on their split point.  So if you fight at the zone in point (very nice normally, no adds) and you pop a couple &quot;quad for 1500&quot; guardian wurms on the zone in you have a hell of a CR coming.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">In my admittedly limited experience soloing here, I've yet to run into a famed 'superwurm' - the 1500 hitters.  Without a pet I can and used to wait for the first GW to roam as close to ZI as he'd come, then kill him.  Not sure if I could do it without sc3, but with it, bane &amp; blood, pox &amp; ultor, I can take one out.  Now that I have sm2 (great AA if you tend to use your pet much) it's not a problem.  I don't bother with racnars, friend tells me they never drop anything.  I generally head past the second set of racnars, set up on the ramp, and kill 2 per spawn cycle, 3 if I can handle it and can pull the third.  Be especially careful not to let them run, that's big trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Since the revamp, I'm fairly certain that there are no G Wurms that hit for 1500 anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Um, the one problem I think you will encounter while soloing Gwurms at the zone (2 min respawn on him) is Hoshkar or Silverwing pathing to the zone in area and waxing your happy ass.  That happened to me twice when I was soloing there.  I gave it up, wasn't worth it.  <br />
<br />
Only way to reliably do this is to solo the wurms while standing over the lava at the far end away from the zone in.  The aggro range on the named dragons is a bit huge, and you won't be slowing Hoshkar, and you won't be doing 32kdmg to him before he kills you with him unslowed.  He hits bout as hard as a PoV Golem, just to give you an idea.  Oh and he AE's a nasty Disease slow/nuke/dot thing that's resistable but rather nasty when it lands.  Think it's a 70% slow making the efforts of your melee friends useless if it's on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't path to the entrance anymore. And nothing is on a 2 min respawn.</div></div><hr />
