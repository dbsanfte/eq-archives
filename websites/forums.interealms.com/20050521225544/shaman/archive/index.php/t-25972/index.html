With this Magelo, if there any place for easy exp in the game?  Tactics has been suggested, but the amount of time required to Rot one mob is making it not worth it.  <br />
<br />
thanks for any advice in advance.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Emmhim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The best - non elemental - solo spot for a lvl 65 shaman is probably the golems in PoV. Look in the 60 - 65 section to find good information about this.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that you are missing two spells that are very important when soloing. Having Bane and Anathema from LDoN will cut the time for root-rotting down to less than what it will take you now. If I was you, I would get those two spells as fast as possible.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">even better than golems are the razor fiends in the second chamber in pov.   occasionaly you will have some see invis in the first chamber however so gettin there can be tricky.<br />
<br />
another option is nobles causway or a ds instance (get a couple people to get you in then can solo).</div></div><hr />

I've been rather impressed with the Drakes in Lavaspinner's Lair.  At level 70 I'm getting up to 3% AA per kill, which isn't bad when you consider how easy they are.  The max hit seems to be around 300, and often I'm getting hit for under 100.  They don't summon, are spread out enough to easily root/rot, and drop some gems and other items that can allow you to earn a little cash.<br />
<br />
I figure at 65 they'll be fairly decent experience, and not too hard to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I solo'd NC Murks for a while for AA EXP, but then I tried WoS Murks.<br />
<br />
WoS murks see-invis, run FAST, but they don't summon. I got 2-3x the EXP I got in NC per kill, which really wasn't any harder.<br />
<br />
Soloing works, but its not as efficient as grouping. get OoW if you don't have it already, start killing in those zones, its easier to get groups there. if not, you're pretty much stuck in BoT for group EXP to 65, until you can get into higher zones.<br />
<br />
PoP tier 1 &amp; 2 are pretty much soloable by a 65 shaman, Tier 1 you can just plow through melee with DB mobs almost non-stop, not great EXP per kill, but you can kill fast. Tier 2 is root-rot for a bazaar geared 65 shaman, doable, but slow and can be painful if you aren't careful. you'll get more EXP per kill in tier 2+, but don't expect it to be fast.<br />
<br />
grouping is always best exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slavage909</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am going to toss in my vote for PoN...not the trash mobs but the Maze Nightstalkers.  There lvl 60 and don't hit very hard at all(mid 400ish max).  The summon. Takes one epic/pox/breath and two bane/bloods to drop them.  Epic/pox/breath won't even finish by the time there dead.<br />
<br />
They give 4.5% of aaxp per kill at 65.  Two kills for 1 % of regular exp. at lvl 65.<br />
<br />
They drop Parchment,blue diamond.diamonds,raw diamonds and a bow worth 2400 tribute  its lore so I turn one in at least once a day.<br />
