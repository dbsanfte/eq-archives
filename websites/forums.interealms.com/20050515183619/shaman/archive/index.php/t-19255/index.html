<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torquil Northenstar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings, can anyone help me with this question please ?<br />
<br />
I play on an 2nd account that was given to me by a friend when he retired, I know that I cannot move his character to my original EQ account, but can I Server Transfer his character ? - or do I need to be the original account holder for this too ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">actually if you wanted to consolidate and move the toon from his account to yours you might be able to do it, reread the rules and regulations, change the registration infoz and try it.<br />
<br />
and if not you should be able to get the server xfer done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">u can change info and then transfer to your account and then to your server.  if u can afford two accounts though then why not? transfer his guy if hes high lvl to your server and now u can two box or PL</div></div><hr />

&quot;I quit! Want my account?&quot;<br />
<br />
2 months later....<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm back! Can I have my account back?&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;I'm back! Can I have my account back?&quot;That's one reason I never gave my account(s) away. You never know what the future holds. Even when I thought I was gone for good, EQ found a way to creep back into my life. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vladigar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">So then you could change the registration information, transfer the toon to an account originally registered by you, and safeguard against the original owner from stealing the toon back since the toon is no longer on his/her old account? Oh the possibilities...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually, I believe that, unless the original owner and credit card are the same, they won't transfer between accounts.  If you have all the relevant info, I don't think there is any restriction on server transfers--in fact, now that you can do it dressed, there is probably even less scruitiny on server transfers.<br />
