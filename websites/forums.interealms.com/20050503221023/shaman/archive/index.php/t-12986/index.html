<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all...I am a new Barbarian female Shaman named Xenah. My main is a 38th level Paladin, so I am some what twinked. I love this board already. I've gotten alot of great info just reading the posts. I do have a couple questions for you vets...what is the Cannidance? and Do we get any port spells or potions? When I started on EQ I tossed a coin to see if I would create a Pally or a Shammy...Pally won , but I every time I grouped with a Shammy I felt the pull to join &quot;the force&quot;.  :) So I did. I'm at Level 9 now (SOW YEAH!!) and having a blast! Any advice anyone wants to throw my way will be appreciated .  TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hang in there.  You have some tough levels ahead.  I was frustrated by 29-34.  Dont get great spells and it is hard to get good exp.  Once you get there, your pet and new dots make a huge difference.    Welcome to the board.  I am not to high as this is my alt but I agree that this is a good board and it is very usefull.<br />

<br />
I'm a lurker here, chiming in on occasion when the work load is light.<br />
<br />
There are no &quot;port spells or potions&quot;, but we get our own personal port to our home town via Spirit Stones.<br />
<br />
Be careful... shaman are addictive.  My ranger sat at 52 for months while my shaman caught up.  Now they are neck and neck for my attention.<br />
<br />
Advice?  Eeek!  Learn your craft, tank in teh face as you can, work all your weapon skills, and most importantly ... &quot;HAVE FUN!&quot;.<br />
<br />
20-34 was the slowest time for me, because I wanted a pet soooo baaaad.  Once you get there, it all gets better as you go.<br />
<br />
You'll hear folks talk about which equipment is best for the job.  Equip your pally with good AC with some Wisdom and some HP where possible.  More experienced Shaman can tell you more specifics.  But you've already made a good move by coming here.  Learn who to filter out, who to listen to, and you are golden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also started out with a paladin. Got him far enough along to realize I needed Spirit of Wolf potions, and started a shaman. The poor paladin has been moldering in bazaar for the last few months selling stuff while Shiuna has all the adventures. I have really enjoyed playing her, because she is as useful soloing as in a group.<br />
<br />
At season 24 you can learn the spell cannibalize, which converts 50 hit points to 20 or so mana. It has a short cast time, so you can be sitting, see your hp bar twitch, stand up, cast cannibalize, and sit before the next twitch. It's alleged that if you time it right, you regen mana and health at the sitting rate because you were sitting at the start and the end of the 6-second tic. You can pick shamans out of a crowd because they're bouncing up and down to squeeze that last bit of mana out of each resting tic. I think you don't see it as much because of KEI...but I do it all the time (especially when KEI runs out!).<br />
<br />
Shamans get the Gate and the Bind Affinity spells, which allow you to bind almost anywhere and gate back to your bind point. At season 51 we can use a Spiritstone, which teleports you to your home zone. You can make it with the pottery skill (trivial in the 240s) or buy it in the bazaar (3000-3500 on Tunare). I can hardly wait for this one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Welcome to our little brotherhood (err, sisterhood....  err, heyokahhood...). ;)  I might not be a vet like many on this board, but my shaman is my first toon and my main.  I find it hard to imagine playing any other class -- we're just so uber. lol<br />
<br />
Canni-dancing is a little trick that maximises our mana regen.  Sit down and wait for your mana/hp bar to increase tick and then quickly stand up, cast canni and sit down.  That way we get both the natural sitting mana regen and the canni as well.  My hot key for this uses the following macro:<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/pause 17 , /cast 2<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
(YMMV)<br />
<br />
We don't get any ports, but do get alchemy (which we all have a love-hate relationship with) and can create gate potions at high levels.  Alchemy is a labor of love for many of us as it is very costly and is almost completely useless. ;)  Don't get me wrong, there are a number of useful potions, but the cost of getting to a level to make them consistently is high.<br />
<br />
Some basic advise: get some good starting armor and a decent weapon to start with.  I don't have any particular armor advise, but there are tons of posts about that.  If you can swing it a REIF is a great starting weapon -- I'm still using mine.  I found that it helps during the lower levels (through the mid 40's) to make sure to max out combat and casting skills each level.  Reducing the fizzle rate is a huge help and getting that defense maxed out is important.<br />
<br />
The game changes when you get your puppy and some real dots.  If you can save the plat, get a JBB and a horse once you hit 45.  That can be another completely game-changing experience.<br />
<br />
That being said, it's not the gear that makes the shaman.  It definitely gives you an edge, but once you learn the class, being twinked is definitely not necessary.<br />
<br />
Oh, and learn to manage both your mana and agro.  In a group, you have spells that can make or break close fights.  Running out of mana at the wrong time will get everyone killed.  And getting (and not being able to lose) agro will get you killed every time. ;)<br />
<br />
Best of luck.<br />

***Thanks very much for the advice..But a question: I know what /stand is (sit/stand) but aren't you alredy standing?..and  what is /pause '17' or /cast '2' ?  Then hit sit? Sorry to be so slow about this one.   TIA</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Braag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No problem at all. ;)<br />
<br />
You can put the pause command on the same line as another command when separated by a comma (the pause goes first).  That will delay executing the following command in the macro for the time specified (17 = 1.7 seconds).  The cast command casts the spell in the spell slot specified.  And I make sure to sit down and see my hp or mana bar increase a tick before executing the macro (hence the stand and sit).<br />
<br />
Ahh, also, you can can create a macro that does all of this with one button press.  Go to the socials tab and find an empty slot.  Right click on it and you can enter these commands one per line (I think you can have up to 5 lines of commands -- one command per except for pause).  Then move that social over to your hotkeys.</div></div><hr />
