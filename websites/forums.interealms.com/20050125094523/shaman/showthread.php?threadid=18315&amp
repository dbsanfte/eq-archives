<br />
Mill</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>I don't think it's very different at all.  There's something very, very wrong with taking little kids and making them do something like that.  A 20 year old is too young to be allowed to drink, a 16 year old is too young to be allowed to have sex, but an 8 year old is old enough not to be allowed, but to be <b>forced</b> to swear their life and their alligence to something they don't really know anything about, not just once but day after day so it's ingrained in their minds.  I find it to be downright VILLAINOUS behavior.<br />
<br />
To you and everyone else that had no problem with the pledge...  I sincerely ask this, not as a flame...  Do even you consider your word to be worth anything?  If you've ever testified in court, did that oath on the bible to tell the truth mean anything to you?  If you're married, did those sacred vows mean anything to you?  If any of you said yes to any of the above... and really meant it... I seriously wanna know how you can condone being forced to perform a pledge on your life hundreds or even thousands of times before you even knew what you were being forced to vow your life to?  It doesn't matter if you now agree as an adult with that declaration because you didn't know when you were made to do it.  Just the fact that you were made to make such a vow day after day as a child, regardless of the cause.  Getting rid of the pledge was the best thing the liberals have accomplished in a very, very long time.<br />
<br />
I don't care about the religious notes in the pledge, I care that both my own word and all vows in general have been cheapened and desecrated by the U.S. government forcing them as a daily ritual.</p>

Sure, everyday at school, it's said over the announcements, but there's no one here that makes you stand up and say it, else you be shot out back.  I believe if you dislike your country enough not to even pledge to the flag, that you should just leave the country altogether, but 8-year-olds obviously don't have that choice.  Until they do, they'll keep on pledging if they choose.  If they grow-up not to like it, that's their perogative and they don't have to say it anymore.  And, sure, people and people and pledges and vows don't mean much to most, it's just the principle.</p>

It may be acceptable now to decline, but it sure wasn't when I or probably or any of the rest of you were in school.  I never saw a single person... no teacher, no student, no one not stand up and make that damn oath.  This implies to any kid "this is not optional."  Nobody ever said "this is optional, you can join in if you want or just sit there and gab with your friends."  What part of school was optional?  Was doing your homework optional?  Could you turn down taking a test?  All of this with no reprocussions?  Of course not.  So why would any kid assume that ridiculous pledge was any different?<br />
<br />
Even if they did know they could decline, what makes you think there'd be no reprocussions from the school staff or even their peers for it?  Kids will use any excuse to abuse and berate their fellow students, and I doubt coming off as an America-hating traitor wouldn't qualify for a confrontation with some other kids.  Not to mention the school staff.  These people are horrible people, IMO.  I rank teachers <i>below</i> lawyers and the common criminal on the list of average worthless human beings.  There's a few gems in the rough, but the majority IMO are nazi pond scum.  Example.<br />

<br />
Short story: kid was punished for telling another kid his mother is gay, and the school called his family saying he "said a word so bad they won't repeat it over the phone."  Yeah, these bunch of Hitlers are gonna take "I refuse to salute the American flag" well.<br />
<br />
Make no mistake about it, just because there's no law that says they had to doesn't mean they weren't forced to do it.  That's like saying a robbery victim wasn't forced to give up his wallet because he couldn't just tried to fight the armed assailant.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I believe if you dislike your country enough not to even pledge to the flag, that you should just leave the country altogether,<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Just because much of America sucks doesn't mean there's a Utopian alternative out there.  Canada doesn't sound bad, but Frenchies and 13 months of winter doesn't appeal to me too much.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />but 8-year-olds obviously don't have that choice.

And, sure, people and people and pledges and vows don't mean much to most, it's just the principle.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Exactly.  It's the principle that was forced upon people.</p>

<br />
Also, PC police I agree are stupid, but kids harrasing other kids is part of growing up, I would probably bean the kid who didn't say the pledge in the head during dodgeball(course, can't play that now, singles out the weak). If a kid is too much of a sissy to take the political fallout from other students, he should learn early that he is a failure, like Cerath is.<br />
<br />
Kids learn their place in society largely by their adventures as kids, and part of being a kid/adult is to compete and face challenges. Isolating them from this is stupid.<br />
<br />
Kid doesn't want to say the pledge, fine, if some other kid harrases him for it, it is go time and the anti-american kid better be able to fight, but then again, anti-americans are always the same, sniveling, whining cowards with a broomstick shoved up their ass. Wusses. That is why Americans who love their country rule it, while wusses protest and cry.<br />

	<p>I nominate this thread for Fastest Derailment of the Week. 5 Post and we are into the political implications of the pledge and its effects on 8 year old rugrats.<br />
<br />
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands one nation, under God, indivisible with liberty and justice for all.<br />
<br />
If you are a citizen of the US, either 8 or 80, what part of that statement do you object too? The pledge is to the Flag and the Republic not the government. The Flag represents the ideals of this nation. While it has flown over massacres and betrayals it has also flown for freedom and justice. It is not the Flag's fault that those that carry her do not always live up to her ideals. But I, for one, still hold to those ideals even when I can not measure up.<br />
<br />
The Republic is the totality of all the people living within the US. We are not pledging devotion to the President or Congress. We pledge to each other. How can any decent human being not extend this allegiance to his fellow countrymen?<br />
<br />
I respect anyone who stands up and spits in the governent's eye. Anyone that demands our government live up to the ideals that Flag is suppose to represent. But I expect that person to have the best interest of the people of this nation in his heart. Regardless of other differences, be them political, religious, or otherwise, I would call any person my brother (or sister) that could make that pledge and holds its meaning in their heart.</p>

	<p><blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Originally Posted by <b>Bufr</b><br /><i>If you are a citizen of the US, either 8 or 80, what part of that statement do you object too?</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>Okay, let's go through it piece by piece.<br />
<br />
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America"<br />
<br />
Pfft.  How do you pledge your allegiance to a piece of cloth?  That doesn't even make any damn <i>sense</i>.<br />
<br />
"and to the republic for which it stands"<br />
<br />
I got a big problem here.  I don't pledge jack to the entire country.  I think the majority of this country (as well as the majority of all humanity) are scumbags.  I give my loyalty to single people, not entire countries.  Especially not ones with which I find so much wrong on levels as basic as human rights.<br />
<br />
"one nation, under God,"<br />
<br />
And we start with the religious implications right there.  Personally, I'm a Christian, but I find something wrong with the fact this so-called "dream" can't go a one sentence pledge without showing heavy favortism towards the majority.<br />
<br />
"indivisible with liberty and justice for all."<br />
<br />
That's just downright funny.  This country is EXTREMELY divided.  The people are divided.  Hell, even the states are divided.  We seperate ourselves into FIFTY-ONE basic governments (fifty states and federal), and we call ourselves indivisible?  Yeah, okay.  Liberty?  You obviously have a different conception of liberty.  Mine includes equality.  Justice?  That's the funniest one of all.  We let murders off on legal technicalities, and we let child molestors off because of psychological evaluations.  Don't defile the good name of justice by associating it with the United States of America.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The pledge is to the Flag and the Republic not the government. The Flag represents the ideals of this nation.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Whose ideals are those?  The ideals of our forefathers who proclaimed "all men are created equal" before ordering their slave to make dinner and telling their wife she has no voice outside the kitchen?  Maybe the ideals of fascists like Bob Barr and George W Bush, who try to legally attack religions they don't agree with?  There's a million different ideals of what this nation stands for.  Why?  We've made ourselves out to be some kind of dreamland.  "Land of the Free, Home of the Brave."  "Land of Opportunity."  The way America is constantly put on a pedestal makes people think its spirit is "perfect and right."  <i>THEIR</i> version of "perfect and right."<br />
<br />
There is no true "ideals of this nation."  Sorry, it's all in the eye of the beholder.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The Republic is the totality of all the people living within the US.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Exactly.  And how many of those people wouldn't get your trust and loyalty individually?  A great number, I'm betting.  Same for most people.  So why make such a broad statement as pledging your support to them all?  It's not like you're encouraging the terrorists by admitting to yourself that you don't like all your countrymen.<br />
<br />
It's wrong to group millions of people together with a negative statement.  They call it stereotyping.  So why is it so great to group millions of people together with an oath of loyalty?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />We are not pledging devotion to the President or Congress. We pledge to each other. How can any decent human being not extend this allegiance to his fellow countrymen?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Because there's so many of them that deserve nothing but contempt and hatred.  Pledging allegiance to the entire country is like a massive stereotype.  All blanket statements are wrong. Wait, <i>that</i> was a blanket statement.  ****.  Okay, almost all blanket statements are wrong, and I see no reason this should be different.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />But I expect that person to have the best interest of the people of this nation in his heart. Regardless of other differences, be them political, religious, or otherwise, I would call any person my brother (or sister) that could make that pledge and holds its meaning in their heart.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Again, whose idea of best interest?

At this point I was gonna reply to Millie, but I don't wanna disrespect an otherwise reasonable discussion.  Maybe next time.</p>

	<p>Well allow me to examine the pledge as well...<br />
<br />
"We pledge allegiance to the Flag of the United States of America"<br />
<br />
It is not a peice of cloth. It is a symbol of our nation. And in being a symbol it makes perfect sense to pledge to it.<br />
<br />
"and to the republic for which it stands"<br />
<br />
No majority of people on the face of the earth, especially in America, are scumbags. The majority of people are decent and kind. Even if I accept your position that most people are bad how does that free me from my social responsiblities to them? This part of the pledge is a promise to hold your place in society in the face of tragedy, to take part in her governance, basically to be a good citizen. We are not excused from this responsibility by the failing of others. <br />
<br />
"one nation, under god"<br />
<br />
We are one nation. Hell I am an atheist so we can strike the 'under god' thing but to state 2 words make a 'heavy favoritism' towards a majority is silly. Something like 98% percent of people believe in some kind of God I think the last 2% can throw the majority a word or two in the pledge. We are already ahead in the game since we do not believe in invisible men.<br />
<br />
"indivisible with liberty and justice for all"<br />
<br />
This nation now stands completely indivisible. What difference do states make? Does a Texan need my permission to live next door to me? No. State government exist to address the needs of the people of their state. This is wholly right and proper that they do this. Califorians should decide decisions in their state ands each state to its own citizen. If I disagree with a law of an other state I have a disagreement but no division.<br />
<br />
I stand by our justice systems warts and all! I will take a jury trial, assumption of innocence, guarantee of council, and protection from unreasonable search and seizure even when those same guarantees are used to free a guilty man.  <br />
<br />
(Aside, I know of no instance where a pysch eval has turned a trial in a child molester case. I do know that incorrect evaluation have release predators after their time had been served. The ongoing story in SD might be an example.)<br />
<br />
Common ideals of America held almost universally by its citizens...<br />
<br />
We have the right to life.<br />
We have the right to happiness.<br />
We have the right to property.<br />
We have the right to be free.<br />
We believe in the individual.<br />
<br />
You can point out disagreement in the application of these ideals but must leave untouched that they are, in general, held by the people of the nation.</p>

<br />
It is not a peice of cloth. It is a symbol of our nation. And in being a symbol it makes perfect sense to pledge to it.</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>Fair enough, but why even mention the flag if the nation itself, or rather its citizens are mentioned a few words later?  Either it's totally redundant, or there's another meaning.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />"and to the republic for which it stands"<br />
<br />
No majority of people on the face of the earth, especially in America, are scumbags. The majority of people are decent and kind.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Let's say you're right.  Let's say, oh, 30% are Millman.  Why vow to support those 75,000,000 *******s?  Again, blanket statements are generally wrong.  And the bigger the blanket statement, the more chance it's wrong.  I find a blanket statement across the entire country pretty damn wrong.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Even if I accept your position that most people are bad how does that free me from my social responsiblities to them?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>LOL.  Let me reverse that.  Why would I have any social responsibilities to them to begin with?  Because they were born in the same country as I was?  Pffft.  Like I give a damn.  I'd kick certain blood relatives of mine into the gutter and walk away chuckling to myself.  I have absolutely no loyalty to anyone based on the luck of the draw of where they and where I happened to be born.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />This part of the pledge is a promise to hold your place in society in the face of tragedy, to take part in her governance, basically to be a good citizen. We are not excused from this responsibility by the failing of others.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>There's nothing in there about being a good citizen, there's crap in there about unwavering loyalty to a piece of cloth, and a giant mass of humanity.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />"one nation, under god"<br />
<br />
We are one nation. Hell I am an atheist so we can strike the 'under god' thing but to state 2 words make a 'heavy favoritism' towards a majority is silly. Something like 98% percent of people believe in some kind of God I think the last 2% can throw the majority a word or two in the pledge. We are already ahead in the game since we do not believe in invisible men.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Uh-huh.  God is capitalized, did you notice that?  That denotes a name, rather than a title.  Lots of religions worship a god, but not God.  God denotes Christianity, I believe.  I'm not sure about Buddhism and such, but I know several Wiccans and they're quite clear about that.  God as in a name is Christian.  I have a very big problem with the government showing favortism towards one specific religion.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />"indivisible with liberty and justice for all"<br />
<br />
This nation now stands completely indivisible.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Let's ignore the current situations which are bad enough... I have a question...  Were we indivisible when we split the country into two to partake in a civil war?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I stand by our justice systems warts and all!<hr size="1" /></blockquote>The "justice" system is easily the worst part of this country.  The dream has turned into a nightmare, and anyone that can't see...  I don't know whether to pity your ignorance or envy it.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I will take a jury trial, assumption of innocence, guarantee of council, and protection from unreasonable search and seizure even when those same guarantees are used to free a guilty man.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>There's nothing wrong with a jury trial, or assumption of innocence.  There's no more guarantee of council if John Asscroft feels you don't deserve it.  Protection from unreasonable search is handled wrong.  Rather than reward the criminal by allowing him to go free no matter how horrendous his crime, he should be charged the same and the officer(s) involved in the violation should be very severely punished.  Any system that lets a murderer go free because a cop didn't wait properly for a search warrant can kiss my ass.  Seizure is a funny thing.  You're wrong, actually.  The government can take anything of yours they please if they think you've done something wrong.  They have no obligation to give it back if you're proven innocent, either.  <a href="http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0103/forfeiture.html" target="_blank">http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0103/forfeiture.html</a>  Nice article.  For example it opens with a story of a woman at an airport told she was under arrest because a police dog scratched her luggage.  After searching her luggage, no drugs were found.  However, her life savings, near fourty thousand dollars, was.  She documented where she got the money, and was never even charged with a crime.  They kept her money anyway, and she's still fighting to get it back years later.  Yeah, lots of protection against government theft--er, "seizure."<br />
<br />
Kiss my ass, American "justice" system.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />(Aside, I know of no instance where a pysch eval has turned a trial in a child molester case. I do know that incorrect evaluation have release predators after their time had been served. The ongoing story in SD might be an example.)<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I know it's happened.  It happened to my brother in law after he confessed to molesting my neice for several years.  I personally don't think the kid's ever going to fully recover fom all the psychological damage, she's a mess.  That mother****er was released after the trial... I forget the exact details, but he's banned from going into the usual places... toy stores and the such.  He got probation and/or community service.  Lots, but who gives a damn?  Because he's one of those damn born agains that think no matter they do, as long as they're sorry it's okay and the psychological evaluations concluded there's little chance he'd ever do it again.<br />
<br />
I wasn't at the trial so I can't say I actually heard the judge give the verdict but I was told by family members what happened.  I kind of doubt my own mother told me that just to piss me off though, so I'm quite confident it happened as hard as it was to believe.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Common ideals of America held almost universally by its citizens...<br />

<br />

They're not inheriently American.  And as you say, we all have different ideas of what those entail...  some with very vast differences.  So I don't see it as being a big deal.</p>

	<p>I guess this is what you do when you can't form a logical counterargument?  Sounds like somebody lost to me.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Originally Posted by <b>millman</b><br /><i>Sounds like somone is retarded. He can't get it through his skinny head that there is something called patriotism that is inherantly good.</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>Spoken like a true mindless sheep.<br />
<br />
BTW, the ones failing to comprehend are you.  What you can't comprehend is that my original point was that <b><i><u>REGARDLESS</b></i></u> of the oath itself, it's wrong to make children make such oaths, and the fact it was done thousands of times was salt in the wound.  Saying it's okay because the pledge is good is like saying it was okay to molest a child if they said they'd have consented when they grew up.  This is a basic matter of forcing an adult decision on someone who is not reasonably capable of making such an adult decision.  What about that can you NOT understand?  Can you not understand why children aren't well enough informed or of mature enough mind to make an oath of loyalty?  Or can you not understand why this is important because your word isn't with the scrap paper it's written on?<br />
<br />
...  Or am I barking up the wrong tree?  Maybe you do understand.  Maybe you do understand, and that's exactly why you changed the subject to the actual message of the oath.  You knew you couldn't win on the actual point, so you went on to argue about the speech itself.  Either way, I'm done arguing about that.  If anybody feels like arguing about the other points made, such as the government stealing billions of dollars worth of goods and cash from citizens never even charged with a crime, or the way the government lets criminals of the worst kind go free with slaps on the wrist, feel free.  I'm done going through the words of a ridiculous speech, though.  Frankly I only took up the argument because I thought it'd be a mental challenge for me to find a reasonable way to invalidate most or all of it.  I'm quite satisifed with what I accomplished, so mission accomplished for me.  I made my point, and even if you have a different view you can't invalidate mine so it's pretty pointless.  Argue facts, not opinions.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />He cries about slavery in our early nation,<hr size="1" /></blockquote>No dip****, I made a point that the idea this country was founded on freedom is a lie.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />yet it still was the most free nation on earth at it's birth, the world was an entirely different place.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I don't know the history of each and every country, and neither do you.  You're talking out your ass and we both know it.  Considering the number of countries there are, and the fact America endorsed everything from slavery to whatever you'd call what they did to women, I don't think it's unlikely that another country at least matched our so-called freedom.<br />
<br />
Even if that weren't true, saying we had more freedom back then is like saying cow **** stinks less than horse ****.  **** is still **** and **** still stinks.  We didn't have freedom.  Period.  As they say, two wrongs don't make a right.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Think he is still just pissed about all the school beatings and the chicks he never got.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Thanks for proving my next point: you're inferior.  You are completely mentally inferior not just to myself, but everyone else I've met here.  You're the only one who doesn't even try to form a counterargument, and instead spew tired and stale second rate flames.  Even those I don't particularly like or get along with, such as Kilo, try to make a point.  Mindless flaming is a last resort for everyone else, it's a first resort for you.  The world would be a much better place without people like you.  You're not worth my time.  Go away.</p>

Counterargument? You can't get it through your baby-like mind what an argument is. I have yet to see anything come out of you that even remotely seems like an argument, you throw poorly worded insults around like a small dog.<br />
<br />
I am sorry you got beat up in school, I am sorry you can't get chicks, I am sorry you are a wuss, a good counciling session, maybe a hundred, can point you down the right path.<br />
<br />
<br />
by the way meat smoker, if you don't want kids recuiting the oath, hell, why have kids do anything against their will? Why nto let them sit in a puddle of their own piss, not able to talk, learn, read, nothing, what if we somehow offend a child? See how dumb you are? Kids need discipline and proper training, otherwize they end up, well, like you.<br />
<br />
I dont think all the meds in the world can fix you anyway, you are too far gone. You parents should have beat you, instead they prolly shoved vegetables up your crap shoot and burned American flags while chanting Satanic Verses. Nice folks you have there Cerath.<br />

Are you capable of reading?  Where was it even implied I meant present day?  The fact is, slavery was not absolutely everywhere.  It would've been gone from some cultures, even if simply because they were still too primitive.  I'm not history major, but I don't recall the Indians having slaves.

	<p>Cerath since your position seems to be having children, unable to truely make an informed decision at their age, recite the pledge is morally wrong. I will address that issue following one small point. The pledge was written around 1900. The indivisible clause of the pledge was written in light of a nation having faced such a terrible hardship, civil war, and endured. <br />
<br />
The position that, regardless of the content of the pledge, having children take the pledge borders on indefensible. If the content of the pledge changed to "I pledge to do my best in school today" there is nothing that you could object too. The content determines the offense here.<br />
<br />
Therefore it seems to me that whether the reciting of the pledge is right is based on two issues. First is there a benefit to society as a whole? Second does the pledge inflict harm upon the children? Both issues need to be considered since either can outweigh the other.<br />
<br />
The pledge does have a benefit to society. While you seem to disagree, the pledge is ALL about citizenship. It is the first step many children take on that journey towards citizenship. While a young child may not understand the full ramification of being a US citizen until adulthood, it is still a concept that in simpler terms they can grasp. There is a country called America. They are her citizens. They will be responsible for the nation when they are grown. The pledge may have a small part to play in the journey to citizenship, but it certainly has benefit to society on the whole.<br />
<br />
On the second issue of harm to a child I would argue the simple interaction of people can limit this to minimun levels. We are not a society of robots forcing compliance. Teachers are, for the most part, caring people. They will treat a child, who has issues with taking the pledge, with an appropriate degree of care and respect. While I am sure some teachers would fail in this regard, again, the majority would not. Considering the limited number of children that would have problems taking the pledge and the still smaller number that would have a teacher that fails to handle the situation appropriately I can not see how emotional harm caused by the pledge outweighs its societal benefits.<br />
<br />
On other issues raised in this thread ...<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I made a point that the idea this country was founded on freedom is a lie<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Incorrect. While it is true that the US was a slave state it does not change the fact the nation was formed on the principle of freedom. The issue of slavery was debated during the formation of the nation. Unfortunately, practicalitly won over morality. It was more important to forge the nation. This concession, and the subsequent inability of US leaders to deal with the issue of slavery, lead to the bloodiest war in US history.<br />
<br />
(Slavery, by the time of the signing of the US constitution, had been outlawed in Europe. We took a bit of ribbing on the diplomatic front as hypocritical to profess such a love of freedom yet allow the holding of slaves.)<br />
<br />
We were, however, remarkably free for the period, at least compared to our European friends. We had a much more balanced legal system compared to european equivalents. Access to wealth, property, and opportunity was much greater. <br />
<br />
I find the arguement that utopia was not achieved (your **** is still **** comment) unconvincing. As any culture grows it moves at its own pace. To argue that we were not free because we did not treat woman or Africans as equals belies the tremendous strides we actually made. Any journey must have a starting point and you do not arrive at your destination in a single step. On our journey towards a free society there were many rocky periods, many points when fundemental freedoms were yet to be achieved. We are still an incomplete picture of a free society but to focus on that dims the amazing accomplishments we have made.<br />
<br />
On the issue of property seizures, a minor point to start, the protect from unreasonable search and seizure is related to searchs and arrests. The state can not arrest you with out cause. It can not deprive you of property without due process. In the case of property seizure laws, which I ****ing hate, a civil case in brought, as well as, a criminal case. Since the two are separate you could be found not guilty, or the charges dropped, in the criminal case, but have the civil case move forward. In most cases this is not true but there are horror stories. <br />
<br />
Most of these stories come from the late 80s and early 90s. The one you mention about the lady that lost her life savings was from 1989. In 1993 or 1994 4 cases had made there way through the court system. All 4 were lost by the state. This up-ended the current paradigm of seizure law. A series of laws were past in 1995, 1997, and 2000 to refine and limit property seizures.<br />
<br />
Periodically bad laws are passed in all Nations. We live in a nation, however, were you can fight those laws and overturn them. In their earnest to fight the War of Drugs, an exercise in stupidity, law-makers tried to assail the assest of the criminals. This added an other hammer in the arsenal of prosecutors and police. While it looked good on paper in practice it legalized banditry. I am not aware of many egregious abuses of current seizure laws.<br />
<br />
On the issue of council and its denial to 'prisoners of war'. It has never been firmly established who gets to make the determination of who is an 'enemy combatant'. Ashcroft, and the Federal government in general, want enormous leeway in this area. In doing so they can effectively lock up any individual without the normal due process of a criminal proceeding. They can also more effectively fight the war on terror. <br />
<br />
This is an issue moving through the court system. It will be resolved one way or another. While I believe that such power is too great to hand to an authority in a free society I trust our judicary can make a fair and impartial determination on this matter. <br />
<br />
Careth, you seem to place great emphasis on instances of failure or injustice. You lack a fundemental faith in your fellow man. You gravitate towards any available wrong and by its presense negate any available good. You strike me as a glass half empty kinda guy. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /></p>

That pledge I would have broken thousands of times, and the same could be said for a great number of people that made it.  Very few people will betray their nation and break the real pledge.  The main focus of my objection is that kids have to stand and place their hands on their heart while staring at a flag.  That is what seperates a simple muttering from a very serious vow.  Even wedding vows, which IMO are the most important vows 99.999% of the population would ever make, don't require more than the pledge of alligence.  Placing your hand on your heart especially shows the incredible importance it should have.  Something like that shouldn't be thrown upon little children as a daily ritual. <blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Therefore it seems to me that whether the reciting of the pledge is right is based on two issues. First is there a benefit to society as a whole? Second does the pledge inflict harm upon the children? Both issues need to be considered since either can outweigh the other.<br />

The pledge does have a benefit to society. While you seem to disagree, the pledge is ALL about citizenship. It is the first step many children take on that journey towards citizenship.

Considering the limited number of children that would have problems taking the pledge and the still smaller number that would have a teacher that fails to handle the situation appropriately I can not see how emotional harm caused by the pledge outweighs its societal benefits.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I only wish all of that were true.  Teachers unjustly punish many children for a variety of things, such as the sickening story earlier from salon.com.  I'll admit though, that's not why I have such contempt for them.  I grew up with a severe case of depression.  It was dreadfully obvious something was very wrong, whether it be a chemical imbalance issue like depression or something like serious abuse at home.  Each year we had three different teachers, and I can't even remember how many years it went on for... and not once did any of them so much as ask if anything was wrong, let alone try to do anything to actually help.  In fact several of them actually treated me worse than the rest of the class because I "wasn't putting any effort into anything."  There was the yearly trip the school councilor, but that was only because despite my beyond-F grades, my standardized testing came back in the "holy ****" range and they wanted to know if I was just failing because the work was too easy to bother with and I needed to go to a different kind of school.  You'd think that alone would've alerted them that there's beyond a doubt something up.  Granted, I may have had just come up with the short end of the stick on the luck of the draw about which teachers I got... but I doubt it given the number of them I went through.  Teachers are not understanding, and they're not caring (or they're INCREDIBLY stupid) as a general rule.  Considering the way patriotism is viewed, I find it hard to believe a reasonable number of those bastards wouldn't have punished kids who ignored the pledge in some way.<br />
<br />
That said, I don't see it having a noteworthy social benefit as you say.  Let's face it, most kids are thinking about video games or the opposite sex while they're doing that pledge.  They're just going through the motions without a thought.  The few that do truly notice it probably aren't lacking in patriotism to begin with.  Remember the D.A.R.E. program?  That thing were the cops came to schools and educated kids about drugs, their dangers, and what to do in situations?  They didn't stop it for lack of funding... they stopped it because it turned out it was actually increasing drug use.  Given the surprising results of D.A.R.E., I'm at best shaky on the benefits of the pledge.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Incorrect.

Access to wealth, property, and opportunity was much greater.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>While a good legal system is good, it has little to do with actual freedom.  I think slavery would be far and away the biggest part of how free a place is, since slavery is the total opposite of freedom.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I find the arguement that utopia was not achieved (your **** is still **** comment) unconvincing. As any culture grows it moves at its own pace.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Actually, that wasn't what I meant.  Bad wording I guess.  I meant that a lack of freedom is still a lack of freedom even if the rest of the world isn't free either.  Being the best of the worst isn't something to be proud of.  I didn't mean anything about current day America.  My only issue with freedom in America right now is gay/trans* rights, especially marriage for the former.  The rest of my gripes aren't really about freedom.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />To argue that we were not free because we did not treat woman or Africans as equals belies the tremendous strides we actually made. Any journey must have a starting point and you do not arrive at your destination in a single step.

We are still an incomplete picture of a free society but to focus on that dims the amazing accomplishments we have made.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>That's a nice speech, but the fact still remains, when white males are the only ones with rights and freedom it's not truly a free country.  It may have been one of the best at the time, but that doesn't change the fact it wasn't free.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />On the issue of property seizures, a minor point to start, the protect from unreasonable search and seizure is related to searchs and arrests.

I checked an older report, and it said 1991 644 million were "seized."  In 1992, seizures look as if they'll likely exceed a billion.  Given those numbers, it looks as if that 2 billion listed in that story was a year number.  I was hoping it was total.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Most of these stories come from the late 80s and early 90s.

Only one I found was the 2000 one, and while I don't have time right now to read that huge review (I don't even have the time to be writing this really), it looks as if while the new law helps a bit, the problem is still quite bad.  Even if they fixed it tomorrow, it's too little too late.  They've known about this problem for too long and not fixed it.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Periodically bad laws are passed in all Nations.

They can also more effectively fight the war on terror.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I'm not quite sure either.  I do remember Asscroft trying to get a law passed that gave the attorney general virtually absolute power over that and given the way they got that ridiculous anti-terrorism bill passed, it's not a big stretch.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />This is an issue moving through the court system.

You lack a fundemental faith in your fellow man. You gravitate towards any available wrong and by its presense negate any available good. You strike me as a glass half empty kinda guy. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><hr size="1" /></blockquote>Quite correct.  I'll freely admit I'm quite the pessimist.  Especially in this instance, I've seen so many failures by the system I can't possibly muster any optimism about the system.  People claim in court, and correctly (though not rightly if that makes sense) that taxes are illegal.  Judges still give them the finger.  Female child molestor winds up pregnant and sued her victim's parents for child support, judge says there's nothing he can do, the law says she gets it.  I just don't see any proof that the U.S. government cares about its own citizens.<br />
<br />
As for humanity as a whole, I do believe the majority feel what they're doing is right.  But you know what they say... the most harm comes from the best intent.  Too many have ideas of good that involve hurting others which are (IMO) innocent.  This is why I have no "faith" in my fellow man.</p>

	<p>Ok, first off D.A.R.E, isn't this the program you are saying is dead? <a href="http://www.dare.com" target="_blank">http://www.dare.com</a> Ken Malcolm was named "Officer of the Year". So it seems the organization is still in operation. I am not aware of D.A.R.E increasing drug use, not that I follow it much <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /> . If you have a source please cite it. I would like to know more.<br />
<br />
Second you present me with an interesting conumdrum. At one point you state...<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" /> Placing your hand on your heart especially shows the incredible importance it should have. Something like that shouldn't be thrown upon little children as a daily ritual. <hr size="1" /></blockquote>And then later ...<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Let's face it, most kids are thinking about video games or the opposite sex while they're doing that pledge.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>On one hand the pledge is too important, too much ritual for children, but then, later, it is too trivial to be of issue. Allow me to infer your meaning and please correct my mistakes. The pledge is too much for very young children since the ritual of it conotes such importance, facing the flag, on your heart, and the group ascept of everyone reciting at once. A particularly young child, say 12 or less, may object but not have sense of self to challenge his participation. This leads to resentment and bitterness by the child.<br />
<br />
The second statements address children later in life, young adults. Teenagers have their own sets of priorities and Civics and citizenship generally don't top the list. They would simply move through the pledge as mere drudgery.<br />
<br />
Let me address the second issue first. If it is an action in drudgery then let it be. There are plenty of annoying things to do in life, standing in line at the DMV, paying taxes, and baggage claim at airports. All suck major ass. If the action has no meaning to most its presense can not be a great affront, therefore its meaning to the few warrents its continuation. I would still argue that if it could on occasion forced someone to confront the words of the pledge then it is of great social benefit.<br />
<br />
If the pledge is too important or too filled with cermony at certain ages I disagree that this is bad. The pledge is basically stating "I am an American citizen". That is an incredibly important statements. (As is citizenship in any country, especially a democracy.) I can not fathom how, even with its pomp and ceremony, taking the pledge is bad. Even if you don't agree with it.<br />
<br />
The pledge is not an oath. It is not a vow. It is not binding in any manner. If you get married and back out of it you can legally have your property divided between you and your spouse. If you swear an oath and then give false testimony you could then lose your freedom and your property. If you back out of your pledge of allegiance absolutely nothing happens to you. <br />
<br />
On the issues of teachers I grew up around them. My Father was a teacher and my step Mother. Most of there friends were teachers. While I have never seen them around their students they have impressed me of being a caring and compassionate lot. Your interaction with teachers are certainly personal to you. It seems the life has dealt you more than your fair share of body blows. I am sorry that someone, teacher, parent, or otherwise, wasn't able to identify and address the pain you were feeling. Since I do not have some impartial statistic addressing teacher 'caring' rating I will have to disagree with you, our personal observations simply contradict each other.<br />
<br />
You still hold to your negation policy in regards to the nation's origin. Could you concede that Vermont, New Hampshire, Massechusest(sp?), and Maine, since they outlawed slavery before signing the US constitution, embraced freedom? That they did so for broader segment of their population than other nations?  If the "best of the worst" is no good who were the "worst of the best"? Who are these mythical other nations that were more free, that provided greater rights to the common citizen? If you expand "the worst" too broadly then, of the worst quarterbacks to ever play the game, Joe Montana was the best. <br />
<br />
The use of property seizure, while I loathe it, has a legitmate place in the prosecutorial arsenal. It removes vast assests from criminal organizations, however it was too broad and mis-used by police and needed to be curtailed. Not all the 640 million you cite would be abusively seized. Property used to commit a crime can be seized, and in certain cases, should be seized.   <br />
<br />
The problem began in the late 80s with an expansion of a 1979 seizure law. Its hey day lasted thru the ealry 90s, a period of about 6 or 7 years. While any period of injustice is bad it takes a while to shake things out. Seizure laws are not currently that egregious, though I would like an automatic return of property on a not guilty verdict. <br />
<br />
The other issues that we disagree on rely too heavily on opinion to warrent pursuit. My faith in the justice system is not shared by you, so lets just hope for the best.</p>

While they don't outright lie, let's just say the media in my city doesn't have a huge budget for fact checkers.  It's possible they meant that only happened locally here.  Also possible they were just being idiots.  50/50 chance, I guess.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />On one hand the pledge is too important, too much ritual for children, but then, later, it is too trivial to be of issue.

What I meant at first was that it's a very serious affair in my book and it's not given the proper respect.  By that I mean that it's not given proper respect by the system and the adults, not the children who just go through the motions.  And by the second, I meant all ages, not just particularly teenagers.  I guess I should've rephrased that comment about the opposite sex.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Let me address the second issue first.

I would still argue that if it could on occasion forced someone to confront the words of the pledge then it is of great social benefit.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Perhaps.  My gripe with just letting it be part of the drudgery is that it's not giving it the proper respect.  Anything that involves pledging your life, which is what I assume the hand over the heart has to mean, shouldn't just be part of the routine along with brushing your teeth.  Maybe I'm crazy, but I just think something like the pledge is too important a thing to just be another part of the day.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />If the pledge is too important or too filled with cermony at certain ages I disagree that this is bad. The pledge is basically stating "I am an American citizen". That is an incredibly important statements. (As is citizenship in any country, especially a democracy.) I can not fathom how, even with its pomp and ceremony, taking the pledge is bad. Even if you don't agree with it.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I'm not saying that.  I'm saying that it should be an incredibly important statement as you say.  Too important to just become part of the routine, and too important to put onto the shoulders of children.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The pledge is not an oath. It is not a vow. It is not binding in any manner. If you get married and back out of it you can legally have your property divided between you and your spouse. If you swear an oath and then give false testimony you could then lose your freedom and your property. If you back out of your pledge of allegiance absolutely nothing happens to you.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Those aren't the only kinds of oaths and pledges.  Just because those two hold legal ramifications doesn't mean they all do.  A direct dictionary quote for the defition of "vowing":<br />
<br />
1. To promise solemnly; pledge. See Synonyms at promise.<br />
2. To make a pledge or threat to undertake: vowing revenge on their persecutors.<br />
<br />
The pledge of alligence fits all the standards for either vow or oath and in fact, "pledge," "vow," and "oath" are fairly interchangeable.  It just so happens that the two most well known of vow and oath hold serious legal ramifications if broken.  Think of, say, a priest's vow of celibacy.  That's another well known one.  Yet it doesn't hold any ramifications either legally, or apparently with the church (at least if it's broken with a child, I'm not sure about an adult as sad as that is).<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />On the issues of teachers I grew up around them.

I am sorry that someone, teacher, parent, or otherwise, wasn't able to identify and address the pain you were feeling.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Ugh.  I didn't mean to come off as whining, and I definitely wasn't looking for pity.  Frankly, I think I'm a better person now because of it.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  I just meant that given my experience with quite a number (rough guess 15-20) they were at best uncaring apathetic souls.  The stories about the teacher that turns a kid's life around is the gem in the rough, not commonplace.  Teachers teach, they don't look out for the overall welfare of the children.  Or at least, quite a number of them are that way even if the majority aren't.  Enough to be dangerous.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Since I do not have some impartial statistic addressing teacher 'caring' rating I will have to disagree with you, our personal observations simply contradict each other.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>True.  I suppose it's a matter which can never be proven one way or the other because no one could have dealt with a large enough sampling for a long enough period of time to make an accurate judgment.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />You still hold to your negation policy in regards to the nation's origin. Could you concede that Vermont, New Hampshire, Massechusest(sp?), and Maine, since they outlawed slavery before signing the US constitution, embraced freedom?

Who are these mythical other nations that were more free, that provided greater rights to the common citizen? If you expand "the worst" too broadly then, of the worst quarterbacks to ever play the game, Joe Montana was the best.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Bad phrasing I suppose.  I meant that despite the rest of the world being at least somewhat worse, the US was not free.  Calling the US back then "the land of the free" is like setting up a bunch of cans of black paint of varying shades, picking the lightest shade of black and calling it white.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The use of property seizure, while I loathe it, has a legitmate place in the prosecutorial arsenal.

	<p>The arguement about America centered on it being founded on the principle of freedom. I am happy to concede that not all in America were truely free since this a practical fact. Are you will to concede that, while incomplete, freedom was a founding principle of this nation?<br />
<br />
Pledges, vows, and oath are different. They are not really interchangable. A pledge of celibacy invokes a different connotation than a vow of celibacy. An oath is definitly different as it implies a promise, generally made before a witness, with a penalty for breaking it. <br />
<br />
A vow in the church if broken can be repair by asking forgivness. Focusing on sexual conduct between adults, since I think those pedophilic priests should have been tossed out on their ass and into prison, a priest that breaks his vow is asked to go through a process where he determines if he can hold himself to the vow. If he finds he can not he leaves the church. <br />
<br />
A pledge holds the lowest significance in this word set. You pledge to be a good citizen, you vow to be a good husband, and you take an oath to become President.<br />
<br />
The hand on the heart is a non-military salute. It does not imply a swearing of your life. It is an acknowledgment of respect. It is only used during the pledge and the singing of the National Anthem.</p>

While they were misguided they certainly seemed to have hero's hearts, given the way they fought the British.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Pledges, vows, and oath are different.

<br />
A vow in the church if broken can be repair by asking forgivness. Focusing on sexual conduct between adults, since I think those pedophilic priests should have been tossed out on their ass and into prison, a priest that breaks his vow is asked to go through a process where he determines if he can hold himself to the vow. If he finds he can not he leaves the church.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Hell, I'm STILL laughing my ass off at that incident with the pedo priest a few months back.<br />
<br />
For those that don't remember, a priest that molested over a hundred children was "accidently" made cellmates with a murderer.  He killed a child molestor.  He was given life without the possibility of parole.  He had nothing to lose.  So he beat the pedo priest and strangled him to death.  Just so funny....<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />A pledge holds the lowest significance in this word set. You pledge to be a good citizen, you vow to be a good husband, and you take an oath to become President.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>*shrug*  I'm just saying that as far as the dictionary is concerned they mean the same thing.  Which means that they're close enough that most people won't know the difference.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The hand on the heart is a non-military salute.

Ah I know your 1 of these people who wants everything done for you.<br />
You would like someone to found your total Utopia and make it nice and comfy for you to move into ?<br />
If theres not 1 other country in the world that appeals to you well youre a pretty sad individual.<br />
If there is just 1 country that appeals to you well you know what to do.Get of your ass and move there instead of sitting in your Country of birth whineing about how bad it is.<br />

Thanks, coming from one of the few countries I can call allies, it means alot. It is my sincere hope the US/UK friendship continues, always, been there each other through thick and thin, while others just use us when it suits them.<br />

Much of america sucks? Haha. Suckiest American place is still better than all of France. If you like canada, go try that out too, ultimate welfare state.</p>

What the hell's your point?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Sorry gotta agree with Mill here if you think your country stinks that bad well just quit then.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>This always has, and always will be last resort of a man totally beaten in a patriotism debate.  "Love it or leave it!"  Kiss my ass.  I'll do what I want.  I have ties here.  I refuse to leave my girlfriend, my blood relatives, and my friends so I can spend a ridiculous sum of money to move to a country that's only marginally better where I can spend years of my life having to learn another language.  That's an idiotic idea and it's an idiot's argument.  Only an idiot takes up an idiot's argument.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />"oh but theres nowhere better for me to go" <br />
Well what the **** do you want ?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I want people like you and Mill to go away forever and be replaced by people with common sense, that's what.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Ah I know your 1 of these people who wants everything done for you.<br />
You would like someone to found your total Utopia and make it nice and comfy for you to move into ?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I didn't think it could get any stupider and more petty than "love it or leave it," but you've made it possible.  Congratulations.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />If theres not 1 other country in the world that appeals to you well youre a pretty sad individual.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I refuse to accept mediocrity.  I don't half-ass things.  If you do, you're a half-assed person.  Not my fault that you need work.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />If there is just 1 country that appeals to you well you know what to do.Get of your ass and move there instead of sitting in your Country of birth whineing about how bad it is.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Let me think, off the top of my head, I complained about the follow:<br />
<br />
1.  Children being forced to take an oath every morning like clockwork.<br />
2.  People like Ashcroft trying to take away freedoms like the right to an attorney.<br />
3.  The government legalizing theft for themselves and then stealing billions from innocent citizens.<br />
4.  Letting the worst kinds of criminals such as murderers and child molestors go unpunished.<br />
<br />
#1 is debatable, and was debated with intelligent people.  If you condone any of the rest, someone should slap the taste out of your mouth.<br />
<br />
But I'll go one better.  If I hate my country so much, why am I going on in another one of the threads defending it?  In fact, I just came from that thread.  And why isn't "Captain America" Millman over there?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Sorry for the rant but there nothing that pisses me off more than people whining about their country.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Then go to China or deal with freedom. < /sarcasm ><blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />England is a pretty ****ed up land at the moment but id give my right arm to move back there.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Then why don't you go back to England?  Love the land you're in or get out!  < /sarcasm ><blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Thanks, coming from one of the few countries I can call allies, it means alot.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>So your opinion of someone is based on what country they were born in?  You're a 'tard.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" /> It is my sincere hope the US/UK friendship continues, always, been there each other through thick and thin, while others just use us when it suits them.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>News flash, Captain America.  Guess who it was we originally had to fight oppression from?<br />
<br />
Oh, wait, I'm not done.  We deal with the governments of other countries, not their people.  Did you know that in England, the United States is viewed as a bigger threat to world peace than Iraq?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europe/02/11/british.survey/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/europ...rvey/index.html</a><br />
<br />
The British government may be firmly on our side, but their people are most assuredly not.  Still not done though.  The following I don't have the time to research and confirm, but I was told by a very reliable source that France isn't nearly as bad as we thought (at least in this situation).  A while back their two major parties each had a ridiculous idiot candidate.  One was such a right-wing extremist that he made Rush Limbaugh look like a left-wing hippie.  The other was a left-winger with the mind of a 5 year old.  By this, I don't mean he had no grasp on his own native language like George W Bush, I mean he was a naive little fool that just plain doesn't realize how the world works.  Much to the chagrin of the French, not one but BOTH of them were nominated.  They were forced to choose between a nazi and a 5 year old.  They reluctantly picked the 5 year old.<br />
<br />
Hence, France has an idiot in office that still thinks all violence is wrong even though they aren't really satisified with him.  Not to say they're on our side.  Most of them are too busy shopping for berets and practicing surrending techniques to give much of a damn about the Iraqi situation.</p>

The arrangement of a webpage, the size and effects such as bold or underlined, ect. are done by something called HTML tags.  They're two < > marks with something such as "u" or "i" in them to denote what that particular flag is supposed to do.  To turn them off, a / is put before the command.  Thus, these symbols are commonly also used in chat rooms, message boards, and the like to denote the tone in which the message is said.  A message that has "< /sarcasm >" on the end denotes that the previous statement was sarcastic.<br />

That said I'm basically saying most of the "justice" system is broken and in need of a very serious overhaul.  Though is the majority of the problem, there are other bad ones such as corrupt officials trying to their own personal religious beliefs into the constitution.  I think these things are big enough to be called "much," at least of the government.</p>

3. The government legalizing theft for themselves and then stealing billions from innocent citizens.<br />
4. Letting the worst kinds of criminals such as murderers and child molestors go unpunished.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Well I will fly into the teeth of this collection of strawman arguements. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="" title="smile" smilieid="1" /><br />
<br />
1. My only comment on this one is the chuckle I get that replace pledge with oath whenever you can. The pledge is a pledge not a vow or oath. These are the definitions... <br />
<br />
Pledge - a formal or solemn promise or agreement, esp. to do or refrain from doing something<br />
 <br />
Oath - a solemn pronouncement to affirm the truth of a statement or to pledge a person to some course of action, often involving a sacred being or object as witness<br />
<br />
Vow - a solemn or earnest pledge or promise binding the person making it to perform a specified act or behave in a certain way<br />
<br />
If you mean to argue children can not tell the differnence then make that arguement. But your number 1 contention is a factual mistake. They are not forced, though some children might think they are, nor is an oath involve.<br />
<br />
So to rewrite #1 to coincide with facts ...<br />
<br />
We ask children, though some might think they have to, to state that they will be loyal citizens of this nation.<br />
<br />
Number 2<br />
<br />
I am not a fan of Ashcroft or the current administration, however I appreciate the pickle they are in. Confronted with an enemy using tactics and means that this nation has not had to deal with before, they are tasked with protecting the citizens from these enemies. <br />
<br />
While I vehemently disagree with Ashcroft interpretation of enemy combatant laws, I am forced to support his right to make that interpretation. My disagreement, and more importantly those being held, will get their day in court so to speak. Already suits have been filed and are working their way through the courts asking the Judical Branch to better outline the restrictions and ability of the Executive Branch during this War on Terror.<br />
<br />
All nations must respect their own Laws. The citizens of a nation must also respect them. Ashcroft is using a set of Laws designed to address combatants from traditional wars in a new paradigm of warfare, Terrorism. In doing he seems in violation of many important civilian laws, not the least of which right to council and right to a speedy trial. However, there is no great evil here. This matter will be determined by the courts. The history of the courts most often side agianst undue expansion of prosecutorial authority. So I am willing to be patience and see this play out.<br />
<br />
Number 3<br />
<br />
We, the citizens, have legalized seizure of property. It has been voted on in a many states and is generally support by the public as a tool against drug dealers and organized crime. I dispute that billions have been stolen from innocent people. He made a statement that 80% came from people who had charges against them dropped. I have not found anything to support this.<br />
<br />
In many cases, the seizeing of property used in the commission of a felony is justified. If you agree with that statement then your only arguement could be its application. Most of the horror stories, that verge of governmental banditry, occured over 10 years ago. The state had its power curtailed by court rulings in the 90s and the law written as recently as 2000. So why is this such a big deal?<br />
<br />
Number 4<br />
<br />
Murderers must go free to maintain justice in the country. There I said it. I feel better. The fact that a person is guilty can only be determined by 2 things, a jury, or if requested by the defendant, a judge. If evidence is improperly seized or some other 'technicality' violated then that evidence is excluded. Period. If it frees a rapist, though it is horrible, its is less of a sin than giving up our freedoms and civil protections.<br />

<br />
1. My only comment on this one is the chuckle I get that replace pledge with oath whenever you can. The pledge is a pledge not a vow or oath. These are the definitions... <br />
<br />
Pledge - a formal or solemn promise or agreement, esp. to do or refrain from doing something<br />
 <br />
Oath - a solemn pronouncement to affirm the truth of a statement or to pledge a person to some course of action, often involving a sacred being or object as witness<br />
<br />
Vow - a solemn or earnest pledge or promise binding the person making it to perform a specified act or behave in a certain way<br />
<br />
If you mean to argue children can not tell the differnence then make that arguement. But your number 1 contention is a factual mistake. They are not forced, though some children might think they are, nor is an oath involve.</i><hr size="1" /></blockquote>No.  Just plain no.  We've been through this.  I've checked two major brands of dictionaries and they both say the exact same thing: an oath is a pledge.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Number 2<br />
<br />
I am not a fan of Ashcroft or the current administration, however I appreciate the pickle they are in. Confronted with an enemy using tactics and means that this nation has not had to deal with before, they are tasked with protecting the citizens from these enemies.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Pfft.  There's a lot of of these "anti-terrorism" laws that have nothing to do with terrorism.  In one of those bills they banned credit card companies from knowingly accepting charges from online casinos.  What the hell does a virtual casino have to do with terrorists?  Especially ones based in friendly countries such as Canada?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />While I vehemently disagree with Ashcroft interpretation of enemy combatant laws, I am forced to support his right to make that interpretation. My disagreement, and more importantly those being held, will get their day in court so to speak. Already suits have been filed and are working their way through the courts asking the Judical Branch to better outline the restrictions and ability of the Executive Branch during this War on Terror.<br />
<br />
All nations must respect their own Laws. The citizens of a nation must also respect them.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>No, a citizen must <i>follow</i> them.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Ashcroft is using a set of Laws designed to address combatants from traditional wars in a new paradigm of warfare, Terrorism. In doing he seems in violation of many important civilian laws, not the least of which right to council and right to a speedy trial. However, there is no great evil here. This matter will be determined by the courts. The history of the courts most often side agianst undue expansion of prosecutorial authority. So I am willing to be patience and see this play out.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>That's nice, but what does this have to do with the argument at hand?  I said he was trying to do it, not that he is doing it right now.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Number 3<br />
<br />
We, the citizens, have legalized seizure of property. It has been voted on in a many states and is generally support by the public as a tool against drug dealers and organized crime. I dispute that billions have been stolen from innocent people. He made a statement that 80% came from people who had charges against them dropped. I have not found anything to support this.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>The original page I linked on the matter.  <a href="http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0103/forfeiture.html" target="_blank">http://www.lp.org/lpnews/0103/forfeiture.html</a><br />
<br />
And I quote, " According to the Pittsburgh Press, 80% of seizure victims are never even charged with a crime."  Note that it doesn't even say had the charges dropped.  Charges were never even filed.  Later it was said, "Asset forfeiture is a growth industry. Seizures have increased from $27 million in 1986 to over $644 million in 1991 to over $2 billion today."  80% of 2 billion is 1.6 billion.  More than likely, that's simple year estimates they're giving.  Thus billions.  Even if not, it's highly unlikely another .4 billion wasn't stolen before it ended (if it fact it isn't still going on).  Again, thus billions.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, "We, the citizens," legalize nothing.  The citizens do not have the power to legalize a damn thing.  This is purely politicians.  Whether they did it without realizing they left such huge loopholes in it or whether they knew and just wanted "their cut" too is the only matter of debate.  Frankly, I don't know and I won't argue that point though.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />In many cases, the seizeing of property used in the commission of a felony is justified. If you agree with that statement then your only arguement could be its application. Most of the horror stories, that verge of governmental banditry, occured over 10 years ago. The state had its power curtailed by court rulings in the 90s and the law written as recently as 2000. So why is this such a big deal?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>In many cases?  Given the incredible number of times it's happened, it's impossible to logically disagree with that.  As for the laws, I've not seen any evidence that they've stopped the rampant thievery.  You mentioned three or four rulings, indiciating that multiple times before the ruling didn't do anything or didn't do enough.  So why believe the 2000 ruling killed it off?  Especially since the article I read on the 2000 ruling only said it "helped a bit?"  Granted, I haven't had time to do much research on it, but what I've seen hasn't been earthshattering.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Number 4<br />
<br />
Murderers must go free to maintain justice in the country. There I said it. I feel better. The fact that a person is guilty can only be determined by 2 things, a jury, or if requested by the defendant, a judge. If evidence is improperly seized or some other 'technicality' violated then that evidence is excluded. Period. If it frees a rapist, though it is horrible, its is less of a sin than giving up our freedoms and civil protections.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Not when there's other alternatives.  Such as what I mentioned earlier... if an officer does an illegal search, severely punish the officer but don't let the criminal go free.  For instance, if some cop wants to commit career suicide to stop a killer who's too good at covering his track, I'm fine with that.  He's not going to give up his job on some punk stealing car radios, though.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />Cerath, the more you talk, the more your ignorance shows. Keep talking and jsut show us all how much of a moron u are.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>D00D S0W PLZ!!!1111<br />
<br />
At least learn to type, you steaming pile of elephant dung.  After you're through with that, why don't you take some blood pressure pills?  You look like you're about to burst from the stress of having to deal with a differing opinion.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />btw, your 'girlfriend', if not brainwashed, must be a masochist to put up with your mouth.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Those are some big words for you.  I do find it amusing that people with differing opinions are "brainwashed" though.<br />
<br />
And do I detect a hint of jealousy over the fact you've been engaged to your wrist for three years?  Well I've got some good news for you, Jerry Falwell.  With something as minor as completely recreating yourself, you too may be able to get a girlfriend*!  First, get up and do some push-ups, lardass.  Only 42,832,474 of them and that massive tub of blubber glued to your midsection will be shrunken enough that you can see some of your feet.  Next, I've got some good news for you.  Lots of women actually like degenerates, lowlives, and general *******s.  Needless to say, this works in your favor.  In order to get yourself up to snuff with this requirement for the bottomfeeders, you need to stop focusing all of your bigotry and hatred on yourself, minorities, and "heathens" and begin to focus on everyone you see.<br />

They are not the same word. And to construe the pledge of allegiance as an oath absolutely incorrect. Try this web site<br />
<br />
<a href="http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=pledge" target="_blank">http://thesaurus.reference.com/search?q=pledge</a><br />
<br />
Go to the third entry for pledge, when used as a verb oath is NOT a synonym!<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />No, a citizen must follow them.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I believe respect is a better term. Martin Luther King respected the rules of law in this country, but he did not follow certain laws. There are occasions were a citizen must not follow a law. However if you meant a citizen must follow them or accept their punishment I will agree with you.<br />
<br />
The 2000 seizure reversed the burden of proof to the government. Before a person had to place a bond of 10% the value of the property and prove that it was not used in the commission of a crime. Now the bond has been eliminated and the government must proved that the item was used in a crime. A meaningful innocent owner defense was added. The "80%" figure comes from a 1991 newstory. I do not argue that during the period of 1984 to 1993 seizure laws were horrid. Do you have any evidence that federal seizure laws have been broadly mis-used since 2000?<br />
<br />
I find your position almost comical regarding police powers in crime. You rail against federal seizure laws but happily surrender your personal freedoms. You would allow evidence if the police violate the Constitution just as long as the guy is guilty. Of course in case where the accused is innocent such evidence would be disallowed. I wonder why have rules of evidence at all I am certain that the police given enough authority can find the correct people of crimes. <br />
<br />
It is impossible to achieve a balance between our personal freedoms and an unchecked police force. Your arguement that the officer should be punished and that will protect us is worthless. It simply will not work. Officers that violate procedure are punished. Our justice system is based on the assumption that the accused is innocent until proven guilty. The person shall not be deprived his rights until found guilty by a jury. This is a great strength of our nation. You seek to weaken it.</p>

They are not the same word. And to construe the pledge of allegiance as an oath absolutely incorrect. Try this web site<br />

Go to the third entry for pledge, when used as a verb oath is NOT a synonym!<hr size="1" /></blockquote>"Vow" is though, and under the first definition so is oath.  So?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I believe respect is a better term. Martin Luther King respected the rules of law in this country, but he did not follow certain laws. There are occasions were a citizen must not follow a law. However if you meant a citizen must follow them or accept their punishment I will agree with you.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Yes, that's what I meant.  I don't see how you mean they "must" respect the laws.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The 2000 seizure reversed the burden of proof to the government. Before a person had to place a bond of 10% the value of the property and prove that it was not used in the commission of a crime. Now the bond has been eliminated and the government must proved that the item was used in a crime. A meaningful innocent owner defense was added.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>What about double jeopardy?  One of the biggest problems before was that even though people won in court, they still didn't get anything back.  Even after winning multiple times.  Helping them win the case doesn't matter if winning the case isn't going to get them anything back.  And what about the billions stolen previously?<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The "80%" figure comes from a 1991 newstory. I do not argue that during the period of 1984 to 1993 seizure laws were horrid. Do you have any evidence that federal seizure laws have been broadly mis-used since 2000?<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Well to start, I'm wondering why that 1991 story that was cleared up in 2000 reads "March 2001" on a site whose copyright starts in 1994.<br />
<br />
*much searching later*  Ah-ha.  <a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/felkins11.html" target="_blank">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/felkins11.html</a>  I'll quote some of the worst parts, but there's much more to it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
"The reform bill (Civil Asset Forfeiture Reform Act, "CAFRA") only applies to a portion of the federal government and not to states at all"<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
If "the property subject to forfeiture is real property that is being used by the person as a primary residence, the court, at the request of the person, shall insure that the person is represented by an attorney for the Legal Services Corporation with respect to the claim. " By now, you should be fairly well educated as to the workings of our geniuses in Congress and should already be saying to yourself, "I wonder who the hell 'Legal Services Corporation' (LSC) is and if they know they have this new responsibility." OK, you got them pegged ? according to Brenda Grantland in her book, Asset Forfeiture Defense Manual, LSC is a non-profit organization who does not actually have any attorneys (but they can hire them) and, no, they were not consulted before this bill was signed into law!"<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
Now, according to the government, if the "value of the seized property is small" (see box), there is no need to go to all the expense of having a trial and all that idealistic stuff ? you just take the property with an "administrative forfeiture" or as it is sometimes called, a "summary forfeiture". Now before you start ranting that $500,000 is not all that small around your house, remember that this law was written by the government and to them $500,000 is essentially insignificant.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
First one must prove that he is an "owner". Trivial? Maybe not. The government's definition of an owner is sort of like its definition of "fresh" with regard to foods (until recently, the government standard allowed producers to freeze chicken as low as 1 degree Fahrenheit and still label it as fresh), it may not jive with what you think an "owner" might be. Without going into all the gory details, I will give just one sentence from the code: an innocent owner must be "a person who was a bona fide purchaser or seller for value". That means that outright gifts such as the Rolex that Aunt Minnie gave you for Christmas does not qualify as being "owned" by you if the government decides to take it.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
But it gets worse. Did the person selling to you subtlely suggest that he may have obtained the property illegally? Did he jokingly hint that he might have acquired it illegally? Did he make a remark that sounded like a joke to you (Like, "Man, I can make you a deal on this property because I practically stole it")? A couple of years ago a business friend of mine was attempting to sell his property. A man came to him showing an interest. They spent several hours discussing the details one evening over drinks and dinner. What my friend didn't know was that the potential purchaser was actually a government agent wearing a recording device and the whole setup was a sting. Later in a court hearing, the government alleged that the agent had sometime that evening hinted that the funds that he would use to purchase the property had been obtained illegally. Further, the government said that my business friend indicated that he would sell to this agent. <br />
<br />
That claim along with another equally sleazy was used as the basis for seizing my friends business inventory worth nearly $2 million dollars. He never challenged the seizure but instead "plea bargained" to avoid prison time in addition to the forfeiture.<br />
<br />
---<br />
<br />
This is all very bad, but I found something far more sickening.  Remember the story about the rancher who was shot-- no, murdered by police after following their orders to lower his weapon while they were stealing his ranch?  They were never even indicted, let alone punished.  Not a one of them.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />I find your position almost comical regarding police powers in crime. You rail against federal seizure laws but happily surrender your personal freedoms. You would allow evidence if the police violate the Constitution just as long as the guy is guilty. Of course in case where the accused is innocent such evidence would be disallowed. I wonder why have rules of evidence at all I am certain that the police given enough authority can find the correct people of crimes.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>Ummm... no.  In fact, my suggestion would likely DECREASE illegal searches.  In the face of serious punishment, police aren't likely to do it nearly as much as they do now.  Further, where did I say the evidence would only be allowed "if they're guilty?"  That doesn't even make any damned sense.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />It is impossible to achieve a balance between our personal freedoms and an unchecked police force. Your arguement that the officer should be punished and that will protect us is worthless. It simply will not work. Officers that violate procedure are punished. Our justice system is based on the assumption that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>I'm quite aware they're punished.  That's why I specifically said severely punish them.  I mean something along the lines of terminating them and banning them from ever working in law enforcement again.  Or perhaps even give them a prison sentence themselves.<blockquote><span class="smallfont">Quote:</span><hr size="1" />The person shall not be deprived his rights until found guilty by a jury. This is a great strength of our nation. You seek to weaken it.<hr size="1" /></blockquote>No, I seek the greater good of the majority.  Which this would probably accomplish, IMO.  If you disagree, fine.  If you want to debate it, fine.  But making things up like claiming I said the evidence should be allowed only if the suspect is guilty... well... whatever.</p>
