<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hate tradeskills. I love having max alchemy! What is the easiest(money not an issue) to get up to 200? Grow went triv at 180, and that's all I know!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hardiman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Do Hawk's Eye Potions up to 191 (they go trivial then) and then do the +10 all resists potions...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">and don't expect to sell the Hawk's Eye in the bazaar.  &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">None of it sells.  I was a little embarassed when a guildie asked me to make the component for his gate necklace because I had a alchemy skill of zero (level 65 shaman doing elemental planes with zero in alchemy).  I recently noticed the addition of the tradeskill trophey so I decided to max the skill.  I've spent a chunck of cash getting a skill from 0 to 196 in 2 days and I really am not at all enthusiastic about it.  No one buys sow potions, shrinks (thanks minimizing device), etc.  What is the point to this trade skill?  <br />
<br />
Take hawk's eye potions for example.  This could be a super neat specialtiy potion for rangers.  Something to stack with their already awesome archery skill, but they already have higher level spells that this doesn't stack with.   Name someone that is NOT a ranger that is going to pay like 500pp for a 10-dose potion that boosts their archery skill (with a stupidly short duration).   It is totally pointless.  The potions in general have a very very limited use and are expensive as hell.  The only people that ever did buy them were the occasional port potion from a melee and now they are all getting gate necklaces for emergencies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shaman_Braveliver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'll tell you one reason alone to get your skill up: DS potions. Being in a raiding guild that battles unslowable mobs (Vindi, etc) DS potions are GODLIKE. Stack one with a Epic Bard in the group, a High-level Mage DS, and a Clerics reverse DS you could easily have up to 100hp damage sheild on your main tank. Parce a Vindi fight one day and see how many times the MA gets hit. Good, Now multiply that times 100 = INSANE DAMAGE<br />
<br />
I was dubious at first when a buddy told me about this, but I decided to give it a shot. Our Vindi fights used to last 8 minutes average. With DS strategy in effect we cut the time down to 4.5 minutes with only half as many clerics.<br />
<br />
Get your skill to 130-150 so Kilva's Skin of Flame is trivial and leave it at that<br />
<br />
Also, they sell REALLY well in PoJ trial area where DPS is a must. I often go there to sell potions and trade shammy buffs for KEI. No more paying for me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">why not just skill past 180 with mystical infusion since they are cheaper?<br />
<br />
i did hawk eye to 191 and then check the prices of the other stuff and found mystical infusion.  i did not skill up 1 time and now have 10 mystical infusion 10 shots in my bag along with all the fails...is this just bad luck with the random number generator???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">well i just hit 200 making resist potions, i would venture to guess that you can't up skill by making potions that only cosist of 1 type of herb...maybe people already knew that but i sure didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">-180 Titan Potions Maliak Leaf,Tri-Fern Leaf, (11p) <br />
180-191 Hawk's Eye Tonic. Star Reach Clover,Tri-Fern Leaf (20p). <br />
191-200 Mystical Infusion. 2 Sickle Leaf (not stacked) (29.4p).<br />
It is a potion there  for i do not know why you would not be able to skill up on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The resist potions are kinda neat I guess, got backpacks full now lol.<br />
<br />
Ranger in my guild mentioned that the hawks eye tonic is the same buff he casts on himself. <br />
<br />
Guess these potions could be mildly useful in a few fights...4th warder in ST, where most of the mele are shooting arrows instread of whacking the mob. (xev still has warders =D ) <br />
<br />
Otherwise they are going on my twink...he has a pitiful archery skill (50)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">HAHAHAH OMG.<br />
<br />
I just looked hawks eye tonic on lucy.<br />
<br />
Improve Archery(10)<br />
<br />
WOOOHOOO ENDGAME ALCHEMY AT ITS FINEST!!!<br />
<br />
What a freeking joke. Its a level 15 ranger self only buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">baror,<br />
i don't know why i didn't skill up either.<br />
well over 100 combines without 1 skill up (i would say close to 200).  then i did resist potions and i got at least 1 skill up every stack of herbs.  seems like something is wrong to me.  i have never run into a case in alchemy where i did over 100 nontriv combines without a skill up. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baror69</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hum i tried this as well and with 50 combines i did not get a skill up eather this is very odd and i am glad that you cought it. thanks very much for the info Galelor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I found Greater Concerntration gave good skill ups and able to sell at cost to guildies and others</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had the SAME thing happen with Mystical Aptitude.... wasted 5K on the potions (was going to a doze fight and thought we could use the edge up on him) got a few potions out of it, but not 1 skill increase !!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tagra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah, I made a ton of Hawk's Eye tonic thinking... &quot;Prezzies for my ranger friends!&quot;.  Then I looked up how it stacks on Lucy... gah!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I gained skill 176 making the new gate to bind potions... So not all single ingredient potions are broken for skill up purposes.</div></div><hr />
