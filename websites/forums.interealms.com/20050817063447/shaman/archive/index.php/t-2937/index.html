<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am learning a lot of new things at my new job and am about to apply that knowledge to rewriting some of my applications on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
I need your help to do this.<br />
<br />
I know everyone and their brother thinks Magelo is cool. I think it's nice as well and wouldn't mind doing something similar, though it requires some massive database work to stock all of the items.<br />
<br />
So, I want to redo my Weapons, Armor and Profile sections and I want to know what you all want to see on the site. The front page will also contain more updated information, the ability to log in site-wide (for board comments, guide updates, etc.) and I hope to tie it into the forums. I hoep to tie it into Sdassil's excellent Best of the best lists he maintains. (You can see it in the Ranger's equipment forum.)<br />
<br />
So, let me know what you want to see on the site and I'll try to incorporate it into the grand scheme.<br />
<br />
Thank you all for any ideas and assistance!</div></div><hr />

<br />
For armor/items/weapons - there's plenty of 'item databases' out there, but one of the things the Monk's have is an 'upgrade chart'.<br />
Maybe something like that with a descriptor of what's required to get it; ie: End Game Raid, Raid (approx levels), Group (approx levels), Solo (approx levels).  Spawn time, location and rarity of the item would be nice too ;)<br />
<br />
A comparision chart of our 'Armor' types would be nice too ;)<br />
<br />
A really good Shaman Quest database would be awesome!  Items such as the Shield of Bane Warding, Earring of Essence, Epic, Cani2, etc.  <br />
<br />
Also willing to help you collect raw data for these things.  Just let me know.<br />
<br />
Thanks for all your time and work ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I really like Magelo, but one of the things that I wish it had was a tag to let you know where an item comes from. Even if it was just the zone where it dropped, or the name of the mob, or the npc who gave the quest. I like looking through the database of items for possible upgrades, but half the things I have no clue where they come from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Velarius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmmmm....<br />
<br />
Any of you guys ever use Allakhazam?<br />
<br />
Cause if you do, a lot of your questions would be answered, and contrary to what  most ppl think, it doesn't require membership to use the database given there...<br />
<br />
Just my 2 BD's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you are going to list equipment a few things would be nice to show.<br />
-show where the item is acquired, whether it's a random drop, named drop, quest piece, or trade skill<br />
-show links to items you might want to acquire that are upgrades you might want to get if you have that piece.  For example, if you had velium fire opal rings listed, add a link from that item to the shadel bandit ring, the coldain ring quest, the rings that drop(ped) from TT, etc.<br />
-possibly show equipment that shaman should be wearing at a particular level.  for example, give sample gear selections for a low level shaman who only has about 500-2000P.  show what kind of gear you should be equiped in for 10k, 30k, 100k.  etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Alminah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A shared account for all boards would be so sweet :) If you just make one thing - please, pick this! :p<br />
<br />
Sample gear of equipment per level and/or per size of purse would be a good thing too (if nothing else it might minimize the more general posts about 'What is good at my level?').</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'd like to see an advanced search type function where you can search by slot and 1 or more attributes.  For instance I could search all face slot items with ac &gt; 7 and hp &gt; 30. <br />
<br />
None of the eq databases I use frequently use have this ability.<br />
the most that is offered is a basic sort by one attribute.  One other thing noone offers yet, searchs by focus and effect (example you could search for all items with FT2 or Affliction Haste 3 etc)<br />
<br />
I also agree with several of the other posters, we need zone/mob/quest location for each item.  That is my one pet peeve with magelo.<br />
<br />
Prices are nice but not that useful because it changes so often.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well, I'm not sure how much I am going to tie the profiles into an equipment database. I don't want to compete with Magelo and creating a massive application like that for just Rangers and Shamen wouldn't be too smart time-wise.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the suggestions thus far though... will consider them all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you should make a joint shaman-ranger asskicking realm, or the shamanger cruciglade.<br />
<br />
I think an upgrade chart ala monkly buisness, or a BoTB list for shaman gear ala the ranger board.  Upgraded quest database with stuff like shield of bane warding and others.  Armor page which includes ry'gorr, totemic, JB, velius quest pieces, and other sets, which includes stats, quest info or drop info, etc. (wouldnt be to hard to do as you could pull the info from various sites).  <br />
<br />
Or perhaps even eliminating the sites and posting sticky'd info that would have orriginally been on the site (alchemy, quest, armor, spell info, etc.)  The necro board did something similar.  for example you would have an equipment board with a stickied post that has a BoTB list or upgrade list or whatever.<br />
<br />
But im rambling, so you should probably disregard most of this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The best search DB I've used for doing multiple queries is the one at http://eq.jeuxonline.info/guides/objets/search.php<br />
<br />
Even if it is in French.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would love to see a list of equipment like the monky-business one. Makes the upgrade path much clearer for my monk friend</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Magelo will soon support item searches with the new version coming out soon. It already works but is currently only accessable by mods/admins.  It has the following search options:<br />
<br />
<br />
Race<br />
Class<br />
Deity<br />
Slot<br />
Category (1H Slash 2H Slash Piercing Armor Shield Brass instrument Percussion instrument Potion Poison Lockpick Jewelry Spell Reagent, etc)<br />
Modifier 1 (Str, Sta, HP, etc)<br />
Modifier 2 (Str, Sta, HP, etc)<br />
Modifier 3 (Str, Sta, HP, etc)<br />
Text (User entered text)<br />
<br />
You can easily pull up a list of all items that go in the Arm slot that have Wis, HP, Sta, used by a Barbarian Shaman, and sorted in order of your choosing.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for having zone/mob info linked to the Item in Magelo, it isn't possible for many reasons.  One being there is no way to guarantee the info to be correct, items can be handed to charmed pets and then break charm and kill them.  When you loot them they would have the items you handed them.  So its very possible someone could intentionally hand a very nice droppable item such as a Mithril Helm to a charmed Kobald in Sol B, then kill the Kobald, loot the Helm back and then Magelo would show it dropping in Sol B off a Kobald.  There are also many other situations that would cause data corruption.<br />
<br />
As for entering that info in by hand, thats something that isn't going to be done on Magelo.  There are far too many items in the database (19282 as of this post) and as you can see on many other sites, having humans entering info just leads to wrong info being put in on many items.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like using this site to determine where i'm going to upgrade.<br />

<br />
Lets you put in weighted values for whatever you value the highest, so you can decide what your best upgrade path is.  Database isn't completely up-to-date, but makes an excellent starting point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">http://www.eqprices.com is also a really good item database that I use when looking for an upgrade.  Although it claims to be a pricing database, they also have most no drop items in the game, and by just picking the slot and stat I want I can find upgrades pretty easilly.  The only problem with it is that you have to pay to see any page other than the first of your search results.  Since the first page is always the very best stuff, its great for finding high-end gear, but worthless if you are looking for lower level equipment.  I also use allakhazam's site extensively (I've been a paid member for 6 months, and it has totally been worth it), and their look for upgrades feature is very helpful.</div></div><hr />
