<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Backwards</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey :) <br />
<br />
I'm new to the forum.. Name is Backwards Forwards, 51st Ogre Shaman on Antonius Bayle.<br />
<br />
I'm struggling to level :/<br />
<br />
I can't seem to find anywhere to hunt at level 51 which reaps reasonable experience.<br />
<br />
PoJ is slow, and I just can't seem to solo to save my life :)<br />
<br />
I tried the boats in Dulak's, hunting blues, and I had to have 40 mana and at least 75 health to kill em.. It was taking ages to kill the mobs and ages to regenerate my health and mana.<br />
<br />
Any ideas where I could try? I have all expansions.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the repeat question of where to hunt at 51, but I've tried most of the mentioned options.<br />
<br />
Many thanks,<br />
Duncan.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I soloed most of 51 - 55 in 2 zones.  Nobles in Highpass and in Dulak on the 2nd boat.  The Assassin Tavern in Dulak is a good (and seldom camped) spot too.  The Nobles and Bards (I didnt care about faction as I had already helped a friends pally kill Lucan so FP was shot) are ridiculous xp.  Loot wasnt as good as Dulak but the XP flew.  I even did my first 6 AAs there.  At 54-55, the Nobles start going LB, but until then...reap the rewards.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">51 is the beginning of the hell levels, ringing in at approximately doing level 50 2 times. Finding 1 percent per kill is going to be the best you can do. Nadox elementals will be the best exp at this level, but nobles and the first 2 boats in dulaks are great places to get a break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Backwards</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Atm I'm in CS.. Wyverns seem to be reasonable xp (approaching 1% per kill), but every time I've been on, I've only been able to get a few due to friggin druids and wizzies :)<br />
<br />
When I was in Dulak's boats 1, 2 &amp; 3 were camped.. and I tried 4 and got owned :)<br />
<br />
If I was to group, where would I go?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Nurga is where I hunted at 50 and 51, nice exp, almost 1%/kill and usually pretty easy. After zoning in, drop down invised and run through tunnel, straight down the train-tracks, stay left on the wall and drop down the ledge. The gobbies down there are all dark blue (even at 52) and unless you get 2 casters in a pull, you should be able to handle them. GL</div></div><hr />

I wish I could be more help, I haven't been able to play since I got deployed and just can't remember more specifics for you.</div></div><hr />

Key is easy... Howling Stones is Charasis...<br />
<br />
Here is the quest link http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=682.<br />
<br />
Summary<br />
1) Go kill head dude in the Sarnak fort in LoIO.<br />
2) Go kill Xalgoz at the bottom of Kaesora.<br />
3) Find a friendly froggie named Durgaz in Swamp of No Hope (he is outside the froggie city not in it.)<br />
<br />
Taa daa.<br />
<br />
At your level you have nothing to worry about... I invised for a while, then just let dogdog eat his way through the rest of it.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't mind information on hunting Howling Stones though...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">DO NOT try hs solo, until u been there with a grp.<br />
<br />
IF u zone in at lvl 51 and find 2 HT skellies up ur a gonner.....<br />
<br />
Even with virtue, they probably gonna get ya, unless u are lucky or twinked.<br />
<br />
Great zone tho!!   definately worth it, but much easier if u know a lvl 50+ cleric with a key!!<br />
<br />
hmmm actually since the revamp, id rate COM castle area just as good as HS ent for exp.  Heaps safer to do and as far as i know its the same zem.<br />
<br />
If u can get a grp of guildies there to kill reavers,[then go up to 2nd sky house: locked door] and some them are 61+ then u can rake in the exp; they get exp on mobs 40+ otherwise u get exp off all there greeens )  ok soo in the castle most mobs are 41+<br />
<br />
Anyway, imo stay here till 54 ish, then try a grp in veksar? or droga.<br />
<br />
at 55-58  Charasis solo is MUCH easier, esp after bane.<br />
<br />
btw am a fan of kunark,  bet ya didnt spot that !!<br />
<br />
58+  hate to say it, but POV cave grp is mega exp, just sicknily boring.<br />
<br />
I did to 60 here then swoped back to Kunark for fun and frolicks :)</div></div><hr />

ALSO its easy and you may run  across your 55 pet spell.  The loot is good too.  Jewels, spells, and tradeskill items.<br />
  Make camp at BW zoneline and pull non stop with KEI.  Avoid the Chromdracs though, they are a pain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just want to expand on why the chromadracs are a pain, in case you get bored and feel like trying them. They dispell your buffs, nothing more crappy than having your fresh kei go away. It used to be the top buff would be removed, but I believe it is now random. From my experiences hunting there, most of the time it was indeed the top slot, might have been luck though, don't count on it. To be safe, make sure you put some junk buffs in the top four slots. If you have your black fur boots, have sow in top slot, so you can instantly recast when it gets dispelled. <br />
<br />
Also, I tried having pet tank so his buffs would get dispelled and not mine, but they still were dispelling me. <br />
<br />
There really is no need to hunt them, they don't drop anything good, so definitely stay away. <br />
<br />
Actually, I wouldn't try Skyfire at all solo at 51. From my recollection, even the lowest level drakes and wyverns are in the high 40s. While the xp might be 1%, kills will probably take a while. A virtue and kei would be necesary, as you would probably have to tank cause pet would get chewed up fast.<br />
<br />
If you want old world, try Karnors Castle, with maybe one or two others you could do fine. <br />
<br />
Your best bet though is PoN or PoD, at your level xp would be awesome. Slowing will be difficult though, probably mostly red to you, mostly in the low 50s. Use maloXXX first, try and grab a pally for stuns to reduce damage taken while waiting for slow to land.</div></div><hr />

I did hoppers up through 54 I think, after about 53 the XP is non existent, but the hides sell well, and you can make someones day with the shard that will drop too.  <br />

  This is totally incorrect, I've been there since 50 and I don't need either Virtue OR Kei.  Old World mobs are much much easier then any Luclin mobs of the same levels.<br />
  The resists are almost non existent in SF and their HP is so low its laughable.  I was even doing the named ones at 51.</div></div><hr />

OK, I reread your original post. You're referring to the mobs near the BW zone line, I never hunted there, but the mobs in that area are easily soloable. Just about everywhere else in the zone though, the mobs have a lot more hp and are much more difficult (I believe some of the dragons have up to 15k hp), and that's what I had in mind when I posted.</div></div><hr />
