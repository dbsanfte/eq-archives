<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sekin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm already losing interest...<br />
<br />
I don't know if it is just me but...<br />
<br />
First of all, the game is very beautiful. However, in order to play in such beautiful settings, you need a very powerful, top of the line system. I have an intel 3.0 mhz cpu, 1G ram, Geforce 6600gt and I can only run smoothly in medium setting (balanced mode) with shadow off in most places. When grouping with 4-5 players, especially in dungeons like Blackburrow, the lag is so bad that I have to turn settings way down to minimum and everything becomes so ugly...I just don't feel like playing that way.<br />
<br />
Secondly, for some reasons, this game feels like a single player game to me like Ultima 9/10. With locked encounters, I can't help, heal or buff anyone. I also feel that people talk a lot less in this game. I think everyone is too busy doing solo quests including myself. That might change in the future when the game gets more complex but this is how I feel at the moment.<br />
<br />
I remeber 5-6 years ago when I first started EQ1, it was a great experience: I was so afraid of dying and lose my mino axe, so happy to get my first pair of magic boots from Runnyeye, so envy of that ranger with 2 well-balanced long swords...I can't find any of that feelings from EQ2. Everything is so well guided with compass, waypoints and detailed in game maps, it is almost impossible to get lost in places like Anotica and Commonland. The new world doesn't give me the sense of danger anymore. I am never afraid of dying now.<br />
<br />
The freshness is dying quickly for me. The first time I stepped foot in Blackburrow the lag was so bad that it is almost unplayable unless I put every settings to lowest. Then I was thinking...now what? another $500 to upgrade my system so I can run this game smoother with a little better fps...hrmmm...i don't think so.<br />
<br />
It has been 2 days since my last log in...the graphics lag really kills it for me. I think I am going back to EQ1 for a while...well at least my system can handle it.</div></div><hr />

As most people know, I am a fairly large supporter of EQ1 overall, and in general, I think it is a &quot;longevity&quot; type game, as opposed to the instant-gratification of EQ2 and WoW. However, with no offense intended to the poster, you are NEVER gonna find the kind of magic you describe here in another video-computer game. That &quot;moment&quot; in time is gone for you, and EQ owns it. I am not ashamed to admit EQ owns that &quot;moment&quot; for me, either. I have given up trying to find a game that will re-kindle that experience for me. The current EQ certainly doesnt, but then, I dont expect it too. <br />
<br />
When I find a new game to replace EQ in my life, it wont be because of the &quot;magic&quot;. I have found semi-magical moments in new games before. What will make me cancel my EQ account is a game that can grab, hold, and maintain my attention over a period of weeks and months, not days and hours.</div></div><hr />

Haven't found it, and still like EQ.  But when your guild crumbles and you can't do much without screaming &quot;lfg&quot;, that really blows.  <br />

I don't think that's really true Blazz, I have the same feeling playing EQ2 that I did when starting EQ1 as a newb. All wide eyed wonder ;). WoW has a bit of it (I play both games btw), but it seems too pat and simplistic somehow, and most of its attraction seems to be the exploration aspect rather than the challenge of fighting. I still play EQ1 of course, mainly because I enjoy raiding. I have done most of what there is to do in single group content, but a spark has definitely left, at least until the next expansion. That part of the gaming experience is currently being filled by EQ2 and to a lesser extent by WoW. Raiding on EQ1 still kicks ass though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">you are NEVER gonna find the kind of magic you describe here in another video-computer game. That &quot;moment&quot; in time is gone for you, and EQ owns it. <br />
<br />
Actualy blazz i have to disagree and tell you about why cause i used to think just like you did. I am here to tell you that my runs to stormwind through high level lands and PvP enviroments only to meet up with a  gnome that decided to help us, then to get to the dwarf cities with their towering cave like swellings just like you saw in lord of the rings, it was beautiful and awe-inspiring. The magic was there trust me bro, EQ doesnt own it.<br />
<br />
True EQ was the first, but thats all. That experience, that moment is there for you to experience again in WoW, but i think it would be hard in EQ2 cause its all the same lands. See the thing that makes it work in WoW is that its all new lands, its a new world, the rules and perceptions are not pre-defined so that leave it open to experience the magic if you let it. the real trick is letting it. If you come to it with the mind set that you will not find the magic, then you will not. I remember after a few years of coming here and dealing witht he SoE crap i started to hate my shaman, i hated the game. But when i let go and just tried to enjoy it the best i could, i found i liked it very much again, it was the perceptions that guided the rules of my digital reality. I was stopping myself from truly enjoying the game cause i focused on what was wrong.<br />
<br />
I find this is the same thing with WoW, i see a lot of people miss the experience cause they hold on to memories of EQ and do not start fresh and clean. I wish i could share that moment in WoW that had me feeling like a excited child all over again so you can see its out there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now i dont share this with you to say EQ sucks and play WoW, I share this with you to let you know i didnt quit EQ cause it sucked, i quit cause it was time to move on is all. To start fresh and experience the new and grow. I share to let you know the magic lives on.</div></div><hr />

The underlined statement is completely false.  They are the same lands in name only.  You may recognize an old feature or 2 such as an old portal to luclin which doesnt even look like the old portal.  This statement is taken from somebody who has never played EQ 2 otherwise you would know the old lands look nothing like the new.</div></div><hr />

Thats correct, you haven't played EQ2. Beyond the names (and many of the zones dont even exist in EQ1) they are completely different. EQ2 is more like WoW in many ways than EQ1.</div></div><hr />

I agree with blazz to some degree that you will never get the same feeling that you first get when you step into a mmorpg. the sense of wonder, the feeling of newness, the scale of it etc. Sure like litgruv says you can get your breath taken away by the graphics of an new game but ou will still know how it works or at the very least have a good idea of how it should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zillanex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tend to agree, everquest was the first mmorpg for me and that feeling i have never felt in another online game, my second mmorpg was anarchy online and even though i was looking in awe at some of the graphics the same feeling that eq brought on i never occured.<br />
But i do enjoy the game anyway :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">EQ wasn't the first MMORPG for me, so no &quot;virginity&quot; is lost to it. First game in that genre of all for me was Meridian 59, shortly after that, Ultima Online. Now I don't care that much about M59, but UO was first game I really played, for a long time. Well, long for me anyway, over 2 years.<br />
<br />
Later came EQ. I was at first exited as always, heck, new game, new things. I was invited to beta at early stage and during the beta, the game felt different. Heck, even SOE people were like real people, meaning they were there when you called, they were acting like people, listening, goofing off with you.. Me and some of my friends were first people EVER in EQ to see a dragon. Not a &quot;real&quot; one, no, we were in Permafrost getting XP and had one EQ Devs with us, in group, play with us. He changed into many different forms and shapes, showing to us different mobs, so we were actually the first ever to see even many other models as well beside the dragon.<br />
<br />
At first EQ was fine, it was new and naturally it was more fun to do things together, as we all were exploring. And we werent familiar with the game. Later however it started to slowly annoy, how the person really matters nothing in EQ. How at first, up to level 20, you are something as a person, but after that, slowly and more and more, you'll become just a number among others and can't do anything yourself, not even your basic everyday XP'ing (I played warrior too). It is very annoying. How you could not really simply explore the world, if you weren't one of the classes who could Gate, SoW, Levi, invis. But, it was still all new, so these gripes were secondary, because the newness and discovery took over them. After couple of years, EQ was dull, but, it were the people who kept me in the game. I still had fun in company of the people, and I liked to do things together with them, even if the stuff we did wasn't what I liked due to the grind. And you know, I actually still am in the game because of the people. I like the people I hang out with and do things together with them, no matter how dull the thing itself may be. I don't even log really on now during non-raid days, because I just can't stand the grinding. When there are raid days, I get on and have fun with the guild, when raid is over, I log.<br />
<br />
And EQ hasn't really changed to the better. Heck, it's even worse, as now even more people are just a number from the mass and mean nothing on their own. You still can't really explore anything if you're not one of the classes who can gate, levi, invis, SoW. Yeah you now can get the 'tools' to do this even as a warrior, but those tools work slowly and, no matter that you may now be wearing meanest armor there is and sport biggest buff there are, still die faster then newbie in Blackburrow. SoE finds it fun to add mobs into the game, who still all, everywhere, see through invis, run about 5 times faster then you and can deal over 10k damage within couple of seconds, and even more. And new expansions - all they have brought is just more and bigger grind, on bigger scale. For bigger things, yes, but still a grind.<br />
<br />
WoW in this case is like a cool glass of drink on hot summer day. Suddenly, even as a warrior, I can explore the world. I can even solo and quest alone whenever I want it. I actually see the world, and if I get into tight situation, I can get out of it. Not always, at times I still may get too deep into it and bite the dust, and death is annoying still. But, the death isn't the agonizing thing like it's in EQ. And I still enjoy the grouping in WoW, I join any time a good group of good players and we'll go do something crazy. There's LOADS of stuff for solo person, group, groupS, raids. And it's all enjoyable, because it isn't a grind. I have my warrior over 40 and I don't have that sinking feeling I had in EQ at the same level, when I realized that as a person, I am nothing now in the game. Of course, being a working person now for years and years, I don't have as much time at hand as I used to, so my gaming times are casual still (usual gaming, not raiding :) ), but when you have to choose where to spend some quick casual time, between WoW or EQ, then WoW wins here easily. Heck, even EQ2 as there are also plenty to do for casual player.<br />
<br />
EQ2, the lag there can be annoying. Heck, it is annoying. With some tweaking, it's working more or less OK. Typica for SOE, request some crazy configuration and let people know that their game is built for &quot;future&quot; technology just to cover up their own bad programming. But, once you're out of the city, the lag is bearable, mostly. And EQ2 has some improvements over EQ, which are handy. Heck, you know, warriors can actually really tank and KEEP aggro from low levels, all because this is now coming from using the skills and not tied to gear. You can even explore as a warrior, it's still dangerous and can get you killed, but it's not outright deadly and impossible as it is in EQ1. EQ2 uses alot of instancing, but this is only for good, as it ensures that the areas don't get too crowded and lagged. And also resolves issues with camping of mobs and/or items. And, heck, you can even solo if you want and that even at higher levels. Naturally, groups can still do more and faster and are more fun, but if you just don't have that time, you can do something quickly, solo. And quests, there are actually quests which are fun and not crazily annoying to do, which give you rewards you can put to use right away and also give very good XP bonus. In any case, it's a step into right direction, but all in all, not much is yet known about it, especially about high level content. I've only seen some shots about one Vox run in beta, it wasn't very detailed but what it did show was that a good and coordinated group and raid work is needed to do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">My first online game was 'The Realm.'  Talk about backwards compared to today's offerings. (Interestingly enough however, The Realm is still alive.)<br />
<br />
There is lag in WoW. I call Stormwind (Human capital city) &quot;Lagwind.&quot; Granted my puter is slightly below minimum specs, but sheesh.  Note - DAOC had the same lag problem in cities. Personally I think it's partially tied to the number of people online and the number of people in that city. <br />
<br />
One reason I chose a 'west coast server' was to avoid peak time lag.  <br />
<br />
FWIW Blazz, WoW is to EQ as EQ was to The Realm. <br />
<br />
Oh, and I had a friend leave EQ2 after two weeks. (Maybe 10 days). He didn't like the changes (according to him there were a slew of drastic changes days before release - Sony - go figure), the crafting system or the game in general.<br />
<br />
He did say it was a very pretty game though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I bought EQ2 the weekend WoW came out (tried the beta of that too  and didn't like the color scheme) when there were 6 people on from my guild.  Now we're back to raiding with close to 50.  Looks like the talk of the demise of EQ was a bit exagerated.<br />
EQ2 just cant' excite me, too similar to EQ, and there I have a character that doesn't have to run from goblins.  Maybe I give it a shot again in a year when some of the old friends there can twink and PL me through the newbie phase.  But somehow starting over doesn't have quite the appeal to me anymore.  Medding to kill the next goblin in 3 min is just a terrible waste of time - and not the least bit challenging.<br />
That's what I loved about EQ most of the time, that any pull worthwile the experience could be your death.  Adds galore - but also the friendly neighbor tossing you a couple of heals when you're in trouble.  EQ2 the encounter is basically pre-programed, you even know when you get adds, and how many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">EQ2 DID seem like a lot of the same ol.  Less downtime than EQ1, but still a lot compared to WoW.  Tradeskills they somehow made MORE tedious than in EQ1 - you have to stare at the screen so you don't blow yourself up, in addition to spending a a lot of money (or a ridiculous amount of time making the components) and time foraging.<br />
<br />
EQ2 is definitely better than EQ1, and doubtless has a lot of new stuff.  Compared to WoW, however, I found it to be full of complexity for complexity's sake, aggrivation for the sake of drawing out the game, and the same old mindset of punishing the player.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">FWIW Blazz, WoW is to EQ as EQ was to The Realm. <br />
Never played The Realm. I came to EQ from Quake 2. I was in a top OGL Quake 2 clan, and a couple of our members got into the EQ Beta. They came back, told us all how incredible it was, and we went, as a unit (70% of us or so) into EQ. So I was very fortunate, as I had a pre-established gang of fairly hardcore online game players that I played with. We started on Povar, decided we fell behind the &quot;curve&quot;, and 2 weeks later, when Verant opened Bertoxx, we moved there. I still have my original Povar character. He is wearing patchwork, using a Rusty Long Sword, and a Buckler for a shield. Heh, its kind of amusing. <br />
<br />
My next character was the 12th player to log into Bertoxx the night it opened (my original Main, a paladin). I know this because in those days, if you typed /who all you got the WHOLE list of who was on the server. None of that &quot;your request has been cut short&quot; crap. I hit &quot;/w all&quot; the instant I hit the ground in G Fay and there were 12 players in all of Everquest. By the time I typed it again, there were well over 100, heh. I still chuckle about that, its one of my best-ever gaming stories. I remember sitting in chat, watching the scrolling message about when the new servers were up, hitting &quot;play&quot;, knowing EXACTLY what I wanted for name, race, stats, etc, and landing in G Fay. I will tell that story until the day I die, I am sure. <br />
<br />
Anyway, that character was Bleys, his magelo is linked, he is my only real &quot;alt&quot; and I rarely play him. He had 120+ days played pre-Kunark, and now sits at 132, heh. I got him about +500 hps, +100 AC, +90 resists  in new gear since OoW and havent killed a single mob with him since OoW went live, LOL. <br />
<br />
But I digress. Coming from a FPS game, into a PvE, immersive enviroment, EQ grabbed me and held me HARD. I tried other games, and I have gotten some of that &quot;feeling&quot;, but lets face it. MMORPGs are solved. People KNOW what to do. Level level level, and use your higher level character to secure gear easier and faster. I am not saying thats how EVERYONE plays, nor am I saying thats the &quot;right&quot; way to play, but the genre is solved, as far as min-maxing. <br />
<br />
I highly doubt I can ever find another game that makes me look over my shoulder while playing (like I did when we decided to explore the Brownie area in L Fay at level 10, at night, and got attacked by unseen forces!) or a game that can make the hair on the back of my neck stand up like it used to when I was pulling from the House in Unrest at level 15 (omg, I was actually SCARED), or a game that just made me sit there, mouth wide open, gawking at the screen, when I first crested that hill and saw the gates of Kaladim. The wide-eyed wonder of cool graphics and HUGE fun factors are certainly available in other games, I still find them in EQ occasionally, but that &quot;magic&quot; thing . . . thats gone forever, and to be perfectly honest, thats ok. Its what makes it special. If I got that feeling every day, it wouldnt be special.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't think so either, but I get that a lot in EQ2.  Combine that feeling with nostalgia (such as exploring Blackburrow for the first time...again) and I'm totally hooked.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people are having the same reaction to WoW too, and really both games are great.  I think the largest deciding factor that will determine who plays which game, on a person by person basis, will be who they decide to play with and not really the game itself.  I'm into EQ2 now but have a lot of friends in WoW, so if I had chosen WoW first I probably wouldn't bother with EQ2.  However, now I'm making friends in EQ2 so I don't want to switch. :)</div></div><hr />
