<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Estrosiath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay...<br />
I have a VERY badly scratched CD ( Go figure... My CD case fell open, and it fell on the street... ). Is there anything short of buying the whole game again that might make it readable again?<br />
Thanks a lot for the help... It's an old game too, no chance I can find it again :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">there is a package you can buy to remove scratches from a CD, not sure how much of a gimmick it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hmm old game.. hence not EQ.. hence does it really matter ??</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Estrosiath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I sleep at night, like normal people :p<br />
And I have other times to study :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The rest of the time is for EQ!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shyvalya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have Lunar 2 Eternal Blue Compleate, collectors set type thing so i understand. It is a great game. I never got to play Silver so I dont know if they are similar but hey, still a good game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Andraxson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, it depends on how badly (how deep) the scratches are.  If they are very slight, you can get some nice CD polish and a soft cotton cloth and buff it repeatedly.<br />
<br />
If the scratches are more severe, then you can try an EXTREMELY fine sandpaper and just sand the disk down a bit to get past the scracth.  After you do that, get the CD Polish and buff the entire disk multiple times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fedora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Electronics never fail, mechanics do.  You're CD may have gone bye bye.<br />
<br />
In this case, I would suggest a small burial ritual, it really does wonders for the survivors ( your other CDs ). Be sure to arange them so that they can all see Lunna 2 and bid their farewells.  It is specially important for the close relatives ( those in the case closest to the CD ) to let go, lest they try to follow their companion to the next world.<br />
<br />
It may be difficult to find a spiritual leader willing to devote time to such a pursuit.  If this does prove difficult , I would suggest going here : http://www.ulc.org and becoming ordained.  It will be more special to those left to have a friend conduct the ceremony.<br />
<br />
In any case, I would try to save the CD first using the sand and buff method, but do give some thought to its passage to the spiritual world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shyvalya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Is it Lunar 2 silver Star or Lunar Silver Star series? I found Silver Star on Gamestop.com for sale. Look and see if ti is what you needed.</div></div><hr />
