<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone really know how this works?  I've heard that the reason we get crazy aggro from our DoTs is because of the counters they add. I find this hard to believe.<br />
<br />
Looking at some spells with counters:<br />
Turgur's is medium/high aggro, has 16 disease counters.<br />
Pox and BoUltor is very low aggro, has 9 disease counters.<br />
BoSaryrn is high aggro, has 9 poison counters.<br />
Bane is medium aggro, has 24 curse counters.<br />
<br />
For comparison<br />
Tash is medium/high aggro, with only 1 poison counter.<br />
Snare is high aggro, zero counters.<br />
<br />
Heals are medium aggro.<br />
Nukes are low aggro.<br />
etc.<br />
<br />
If I stack a bunch of DoTs, the mob might initially stay on the warrior, but after a few ticks he will be glued to me for the rest of the fight. If this was because of the counters, shouldn't I get aggro right away as soon as the spells land? First I thought that maybe the counters are gradually applied as the DoTs last, but considering how the spell can be cured that is obviously incorrect.<br />
<br />
So what decides how much aggro a spell gives? Is there a hidden hate-figure in the spell? If it was just that poison counters give ****loads of aggro, Blood of Yoppa (18 poison counters) will suck when you're not soloing or kiting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Aggro is primarily DPS based.<br />
<br />
BUT...<br />
<br />
counters are probably used for spell aggro from spells with no dmg component.<br />
<br />
watch a mob bee-line for a shaman after Turgurs lands, if it is cast before the MT engages, (e.g. cast as the mob closes ranks).  Slow spells have no dmg component, but slap on quite a few counters.<br />
<br />
YMMV<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, some of what I'm about to write is complete speculation--take it with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
I am fairly sure that they increased the agro at some point for poison counters.  They wanted to balance the 1 second cast time and unresistability on tash with some negative effect.  Back when tash was introduced (kunark), I don't think they had the ability to add hate.  So, I think they increased the agro of poison counters.  I'm basing this speculation off certain subsequent indicia.  (see next paragraph)<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, tash has 1 poison counter.  When they changed the agro on poison counters, it made shaman and necro DoTs substantially more agro on landing.  Many of you old school shaman may recall when that happened.  Slows were massive agro, as were (and still are) our poison DoTs.  Some of that slow agro appears to be offset via the SCS3 ability.  The poison counter agro doesn't appear to be reduced, perhaps because it's like a recourse-type effect--not part of the direct agro.  (Keep in mind, this is largely speculation based on empirical data).<br />
<br />
Curse counters and disease counters have substantially less agro than poison counters.  Nothing pulls agro like a poison DoT.  The only issue with the MR DoT line is that the damage is fairly high--so it does a decent amount of agro per tic.<br />
<br />

*edited to correct an error, but not before some fast posting folks beat me to it below!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hehe, you sure edited that fast ;)<br />
<br />
I do remember the change that made slows give more aggro, but slows DOES have disease counters, not poison. And it still doesn't explain why the aggro on DoTs seems to build up rather than give all aggro when they land. I often have a tank taunt a mob off of me but after another tick or two of my DoTs I'm the main attraction again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Add this to Chutoi's post:<br />
<br />
Somewhere on the crucible is an excellent post that shows that DoTs generate aggro equal to the amount of damage done, including crits, every tick.<br />
<br />
So a Bane tick for 420 generates the same aggro as a melee smacking the mob for 420pts of dmg.<br />
<br />
Nukes have a set amount of aggro independent of the amount of damage they do.  <br />
<br />
Thats the big reason a wiz can nuke for 5k with no probs, but we stack 900pts of DoT dmg and we get summoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Close but not quite chutoi. Slows have never had poison counters. They had nothing and then got disease counters. Anyone who was around back when that change should know that counts do have aggro. Way back when sk's used thier low level disease cloud dot as an aggro spell. When disease counters where added to slow shaman complained and verant admited that it added aggro. Initially they added a neg aggro component to all the slow spells to counter it. They then decided that disease could shouldn't be an aggro spell for sk's and changed the aggro disease counter generated and removed the neg aggro component of our slow spells. Thats when sk's started getting the terror? line of direct aggro spells. It was actually in the patch msg way back when that they changed the aggro generated by the disease counters.<br />
<br />
Poison counters where and still are fairly high aggro. As far as I can tell from the lack of aggro generated by malo compaired to tash is the difference in poison counter or not.<br />
<br />
Bane on the other hand seems find probably because curse counters never had high aggro associated with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh, and on the DoT agro, I believe one of the crucible members made a nice comparison for us with some creative experimenting with a SK alt.  The SKs have a line of pure hate spells--no damage, no counters, just a +hate spell.  Using that, the gentleman in question (whose name I have forgotten) estimated that we are generating on the order of .87 hate per point of damage.  This also explains the tendency of mobs to turn on critical dot tics.  With focuses and a critical, you could well be doing 870 hate in a single tic with 1 DoT.<br />
<br />
Further, SCS3 doesn't appear to work over tics of the DoT, merely on spells that land instantly and directly.  There is no hate mitigation for subsequent tics of the DoT.  That also goes to explain why agro builds and you may not get it immediately.<br />
<br />
Rytan denies all this vehemently, of course.  &quot;Working as intended.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">DPS... DPS... DPS...<br />
<br />
aggro is PRIMARILY DPS based.<br />
<br />
since the DoT is STILL doing dmg, you regain aggro, unless the tanks are out-DPSing your dots.<br />
<br />
as an experiment, go out with your pet, and solo something with alot of HPs.  land the epic dot and maybe put on a disease dot.  the pet should hold aggro thru the battle.  now try it again, but instead, stack on a few poison dots.  the poison dots are higher DPS, and your pet will be chewing on the mobs heels while it plays tag with you.<br />
<br />
counters, i would speculate, are only used for &quot;hate&quot; when the spell has no dmg component, like Tash, Malo, Slow, etc.<br />

<br />
<br />
I dont believe your correct here.  If I stack BoS and Anc Scroung of nife on a mob, I have aggro through most of the fight.  This is even with a tank doing 1.5 to 2x more dps then the dots.  Additionally I can keep 3 Disease dots on Emp Ssra, keep him slowed, and do more DPS then the MT and some of the melee yet never get any aggro.<br />
<br />
I believe Dot aggro is broke for several reasons.  There is the aggro component of a Poison dot that is out of whack due to the tash issue.  I also believe there is some cumulitive effect on the dots aggro as each tic goes by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">didnt say aggro was solely DPS, i said primarily, there are, i'm sure, many other aspects, that the sony coders have wired in, like counters, taunt, procs, and other stuff.  but asside from AA's, Discs, and specific aggro related spells/powers, you will find that by and large, aggro goes to the fastest, highest dmg.  this isnt a hard and fast rule, but a general case that has many modifiers, because... <br />
<br />
lets face it.. unless we can peruse the actual code, we're all just speculating, based on experience.<br />

<br />
And another Poisen dot. Low level. Slap em both on something. Then come back and tell me what happens?<br />
<br />
It isnt the damage. The damage is a part of it. Yes. But The larger aspect of it is the poisen counters. Now The most likly aspect is The mob looks at how many poisen counters are on it but instead of only seeing the aggro once. They add up. So the first tick it has taken 200 damage from the dot and has 9 counters worth of aggro. Well next round it takes 200 damage but thinks it has 18 counters. Boom aggro. <br />
<br />
Tank taunts. Mob turns back. Tick of damage 200 damage  24 counters. Boom it turns to us. And the warrior starts cussing. But once the dot drops off once the warrior gets aggro again we are fine. Even if we are still doing damage by a curse spell. The warrior is generating more hate than our dps.<br />
<br />
Disease counters were huge aggro. That was changed. But poisen counters are still huge aggro. But it more than likely will never be changed. <br />

Ahh well. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Joril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You would probably have to go to Steelwarriors (warrior board) to get a good explanation of how argo works in all its aspects.<br />
<br />
Argo IS based on both dps and counters.  <br />
<br />
There is also an initial amount of argo generated by the first person to land a offensive spell/melee attack.  Which is why some people tend to get more argo faster then the MT, because they hit the mob on incoming and get those initial hate points.<br />
<br />
Disease was added to slow way back when and gave us ancient shaman no end to argo problems.  they removed the amount of hate generated on disease counters because, as was already stated, SK were getting argo lock using a low level spell that cost like 10 mana.  No one could take argo from SK's and the warriors complained about it and they changed it.  changing the argo on disease counters helped shaman, one of the few times shaman got helped instead of nerfed by SOE nerfing another class, because our disease dots and debuff no longer generated any significant hate.  I remember any time i wanted to lock down argo all i had to do was cast the old disease debuff a couple times (low mana FAST casting) and NO ONE would get that mob of me.<br />
<br />
for poison counters the problem is, and this is speculated NOT confirmed, that those counters are added for EACH tick of the dot.  so you have 16 counters added on the initial landing of the spell, then another 16 at the first tick and so on and so on.  Which means your argo builds faster then Melee can generate dps argo to counter it.  Wariors with anger procs and the incite line can overcome it, but one crit (double counters for that tick) and you are the center of attention again.<br />
<br />
also remember healing generates argo and healing spells have no counters at all.  Healing use to generate argo based on how many hps was healed, sorta like melee doing dps, which is why mobs hated healers so much.  they changed it awhile back and i dont remember the new system, but it is still similiar.  maybe they just cut the argo in half for heals, no idea there really.<br />
<br />
Argo has long since stopped going to who does the most damage otherwise rogues, wizards or rangers (depending on gear) would ALWAYS have argo, which isnt the case at all.  not saying it isnt possible for any of these to overcome the MT argo, but its not common.  there are always exceptions... MT CAN fail on taunt, stun is resisted for pallys, sk spells are resisted, etc etc, and the wizard chained nuked and for that one split sec they managed to overargo and got pulped.. happens.  <br />

If I decide I want to tank. There is jack crap he can do about it. Unless he sits there and spams Darkness. And even then on ticks I get the aggro again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>windfinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">this is my throry. back when SK's could not keep aggro from everyone. only one class that I know could couse it to ping pong, and that was shaman. why you ask that was becouse we could use our unresistable level 35 debuff for disease as a rapid fire aggro genarator that did no damage but added what 9 or 10 disease counters? anyway thay changed that. sence I have been useing dots for a very long time, it used to be that disease and posion dots generated about the same aggro exsept the posions did a bit more. since thay had at appropet levels the same number of counters on each I figured that thay coused the same amount of aggro per counter from posion and disease. the reason posion was getting slightly more was becouse doing more damage then the disease. now I was duoing with a warrior and I could and did at many times take the aggro off him becouse that was how we did it. he was almost always doing more damage then me but I could pull aggro by just droping a dot. and giveing him its back.<br />
<br />
fast forward. in todays state of the game, a bane attracts less attention the blood even though it is doing more damage and has more counters. that has to be becosue the posion. now the way I think that aggro is generated is not becouse it thinks it has more counters every tick but becouse it sees them again every tick. here is the exsample say I land blood, bane, and anathm. that is 1026 damage not including focus effects or getting very close to 200dps. now of most normal tanks this will not pull aggro unless I get a high crit or i sit down while its running. now before I even got crit affliction it was not that I never got aggro its that it happoned very rarely. now what I think is happoning is that every tick it sees oks this guy just did 1026 damage and hit me with 9 posion counters and 40 curse counters. and that is very tick he sees the counters again so next tick yep that guy just hit me for another 1026 damage and 9 posion and 40 curse. so in 12 secs I did 2000 damage and he saw the conters (and thay gave the added hate) twice. yet in this same time I see a 5k nuke go off from a druid/wiz (so you see in DPS wise I have been out done by them). but next tick 2 things happon A the druid/wiz lands another 3k nuke and blood crits and the warrior is alsee and not watching. I do another 1354 damage and the monster &quot;sees&quot; (becouse thsi is what I think critting does) 18pos counters and 40curse. mob then runs over to me. I have only done 3.3k damage where as the nuker has done 8k and yet I get more attention the them. that is not DPS based aggro then. heck its not even double aggro its more. more then I care to count this has happoned ..... but it hapons more offten and sonner if  stack Blood,Bane and BoN wich is actully less damage at 952/tick but is 19posion and 24curse counters. bane critting does nto seem to just pull aggro like no tomarow unless it crits 2 to 3 times in a row. I happon to think that curse counters are around 3times less aggro then posion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Aggro is based on counters and dps and modifiers in specific spells. Because you have 3 variables, its always been confusing.  <br />
<br />
Within the counter variable, you also have variable amounts per counter type.  Within the modifier variable, you have any number of tweaks that SOE can come up with.  <br />
<br />
1. Counter<br />
    i.  counter types guessing order of aggro<br />
        a. poison<br />
        b. curse<br />
        c. fire<br />
        d. magic<br />
        e. disease<br />
2. Modifier<br />
    i.  who knows what soe has done.<br />
        a.  set amount for nuke X<br />
        b.  increase tash x amount<br />
        c.  etc.. <br />
3. Dmg<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, what makes dots lame, especially poison, is that they seem to hit with an initial high aggro amount upon landing, and then generate further aggro tick per tick.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well in my mind, you have to consider a few things when you look at dot agro .  The first couple of things revolve around the dot itself - duration, dmg/tick, types of counters, and # of counters.  The other considerations have to be in how we look at agro - when we drop a dot, we see the initial agro generated and we see the overall agro generated, which includes the initial agro component.<br />
<br />
Damage alone cannot be the sole reason for why we generate the type of agro we do on our dots.  1) Curses out damage poisons per tick but do not generate the same type of crazy agro; 2) Although any good melee will outdamage any dot I drop before the dots duration ends, I still generate more agro; and 3) Low level poisons generate a similar agro level to higher level more damaging poisons.<br />
<br />
Agro speculation:  Agro is a combination of agro per tick and the initial agro from nukes (assuming there is one).  The counters on a dot are multipliers against dmg/tick and the initial nuke, and poison counters are a larger multiplier than either curses or diseases.  So given that,<br />
<br />
Agro = initial agro + agro/tick<br />
<br />
Agro/tick = (counters)*(dmg/tick)<br />
Initial agro = (counters)*(initial nuke)<br />
Counters = (multiplier)*(# of counters)<br />
And multipliers are p.counters &gt; c.counters &gt; d.counters<br />
<br />
Total Agro = [(multiplier)*(# of counters)]*[dmg/tick + initial nuke dmg]<br />
<br />
In this way, agro isn't solely a function of damage dealt, rather it's a function of counters multiplied against damage dealt.  It also explains why curses can deal more damage per tick and have a similar number of counters, but because the multiplier is different, it can generate less agro.  But this is all my speculation on how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The entire dot system needed an overhaul yesterday.<br />
<br />
Nukes:<br />
-can drop all their damage at once.<br />
-can be partially resisted.<br />
-absolutely no stacking issues.<br />
-slight agro.<br />
<br />
Dots:<br />
-if not cast early, will not deal all of their damage, and over short fights, will not deal all of their damage no matter when cast.<br />
-either resisted completely or lands for full.<br />
-stacking issues and competing debuff slots.<br />
-crazy agro problems.<br />
<br />
Because they deal damage over time, and not all at once, dots should not only be more mana efficient, they should generate slightly less agro than nukes dealing similar damage.<br />
<br />
-critical affliction aa should mirror fury of magic aa in cost and performance.<br />
-dots dealing a similar amount of damage to nukes should cost less mana and generate agro in a similar way to those nukes.<br />
-dots should be resistable on a per/tick basis.<br />
-dot foci should be as widely available as nuke foci.<br />
-dots should cost slightly less mana than nukes that deal similar damage.</div></div><hr />
