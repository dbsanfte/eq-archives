<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone,<br />
<br />
I am currently Lvl 43 trying desperetley to get to 44!  First a little of my current game style...I have a 3 month old baby that doesnt let me on for long periods of time so I am looking for areas with static spawns that are soloable.  With that said I have tried the Echo Caverns with little worth, either the Underbulks are camped or people come and take them from the other room when I am medding making the spawn times agonizingly long  I tried to pull the Stonebeggers but end up getting my pet killed and running for a guard due to there constant resists?:(   Can anyone tell me where I can hunt ?  Ive gone to DL when time allows but I just dont have the 2-3 hour times to play that groups there want?  <br />
Looking for some advice.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try city of mist. May be hard for you at that level but if you can split the spawns up at the bridge it's easy. It's a dungeon so you get an exp bonus, its also a city so you can bind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>baazak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can also try Dawnshroud Peaks, setup camp between the Grieg's End zone and the shroom ruins(Best place in DP to avoid trains), and pull Large Zelniaks, Wolves and other blue MOB's after that hit the Spirocs on Ogre Island in Timorous Deep.  Both are fairly relaxed camps with lots of MOB's to pull.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know your predicament.  I have a 3 yr old and a 9 month old so playtime is limited... But it's all good :)  I dinged to 44 fighting large zelinaks and wolves in Dawnshroud.  I actually set up a 100 yds or so out in the front of sanctus seru ( and a little to the left).  80% of the zels are dark blue, all the wolves are dark blue.  At 44, I headed to tenebrous mountains and hunt sonic wolves and dark wing bats in front of the katta zone or in front of the grimling zone in the tunnel.  Exp is great at this level, lots of mobs for everyone, and the guards wont KS the wolves.  Unlike DS wolves and bats are social , but single pullin is extremely easy lots of room to work with.<br />
<br />
And remember, KEI is your friend.  I always run to nexus and get one before a hunting session.  Lasts for 2.5 - 3 hours , and at level 45 it takes me about 50 minutes per yellow bub with a KEI, no JBB either. One gold from 46.  I'll let you know if they are all still dark blue at 46.<br />
<br />
Good Luck,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blackke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the input everyone:D   What tactics do you use with the Zels and Wolves just outta curiousity?  I've had good luck pulling with Togurs and then dots and Melee but shoul I Root and Rot them or is melee faster?  I like staying close to the nexus due to banking;)   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pull with slow spell, (not necessarily the highest one you have) to save mana.  By pulling with slow, it allows me to sick dog-dog on the mob while I cast VoS.  Once VoS lands join in the fight and tank for dog dog.  At 43, when I pulled with VoS, the mob would ignore dog due to dot affect.  The 44 pet seems to do enough damage to keep the mobs attention even while he is dotted.<br />
<br />
I'm a in da face shammy, so I try to avoid root/rotting if I can. Also, in most fights the dot is wearing off just before the mob starts his death walk.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Im doing the same thing in the same place, done it from 39-42.5 so far. I just buff myself up with fury, tnarg, and what not, pull with the 34 slow (tagar's) and tank. When it hits 20-25 percent (right before it starts to run) I back up and let dog get the last little bit, sit down and med. That actually puts me at a HP/mana gain most times, so when its running I just go start on the next one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seefar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems to be the THING to do, because that is also how I have been levelling from 40+.  I am starting to get a little bored because I have been there so long, but at the rate things are going, I should be moving on soon anyway. Unless I can figure out a way to solo those Coteries????? <br />
<br />
You can bank in Katta by the way.  They are tolerant to evil races.  An Ogre friend of mine had no problem.  I don't know about Trolls and Iksars though, so you might want to test faction before running in.  This would save a trip back to the Nexus.  <br />
<br />
Also, if you are camping near the Grimling entrance be sure to snag the Runner whenever you can. Then take the bag to Rallic (forget the full name) in Katta to exchange for the Rallic Pack Pattern.  This item is LORE, but it isn't NODROP which means you can sell it in the bazaar.  If you want to move it fast (which I always do so I can get back to the action) price it at 200pp and watch it fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Troll was in TM helping a friend gather acrylia for backpacks shortly after Luclin was opened...got overwhelmed and made a run for Katta...as I approached the gate I conned the guard and discovered myself KOS...so I bit the bullet and died out of their range to make corpse recovery easier...I had not yet had opportunity to hunt anything on the moon that would have affected faction, so I would say pure, out of the box attitude of Katta toward trolls is hostile...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giladari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've been levelling thru the 40s in Crystal Caverns.  The geonid spawn (if you can find it uncamped) is ideal for soloing since they don't aggro you unless you're KoS and  it takes a great many of them (as in killing them for 6+ levels) before you ever hit KoS.  I've gone afk medding up sitting in front of one many times.  Unless some twit from spiders or geonids can't handle his pull and trains you running to zone out, its perfectly safe.<br />
<br />
7 (or 8?) mobs going up a tunnel to zone out spaced so that all but 1 mob will get you a single mob if you pull with a spell.  (I usually pull with slow or my best DoT if I'm buffed from a trip to the Nexus)<br />
<br />
The other option is Terror Tunnel in Crystal Caverns.  Tunnel is on an approximately 13.5 min spawn.  Starts with 2 mobs at the entrance (root one so you can break the spawn up) then a mob mid tunnel and one at the end of the tunnel just before the room of about 8 that I think you can single pull relatively safely.  Even without any form of clarity, this should be a nice little spawn for you and it also has the benefit of being trainfree, often open and totally safe to med at the entrance of the tunnel (just sit far enough in that the spiders from the next tunnel don't aggro you)<br />
<br />
CC also has the benefit of a wonderful XP bonus too.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pick out a corner of the castle, have your pet guard there a pull one at a time.<br />
<br />
Helps to get KEI in Nexus before you begin!<br />
<br />
Good Luck</div></div><hr />
