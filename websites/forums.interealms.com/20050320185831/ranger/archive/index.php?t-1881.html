<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lasalle Stormreaver</div><div class="date">04-25-2002, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Either they are going to be hiring a completely new team of GMs for this, or maybe they're going to close some existing servers down and transfer those GMs to the EQ2 project.  Tough to really tell when a GM is on, since /who all GM doesn't show CS-invis GMs..  but anyways what do you think they will do about customer service?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The biggest issue about CS levels though is cost.  It is a fair assumption that the base cost of EQ2 will be more than EQ1.  The question is will Verant increase CS levels and if so by how much.  And how much more will that make the base subscription price.  <br />
<br />
When it comes down to having to pay people to help and watcher over the players its all about the green pieces of paper.   <br />
<br />
Course... who watches the watchers?</div></div><hr />
