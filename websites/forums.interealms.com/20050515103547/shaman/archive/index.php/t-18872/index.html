<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A slow with a -MR check?  Truly my eyes doth decieve me.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think there needs to be some tweaking done here.  The higher level and % slow costs less mana and has less disease counters?  Makes no sense.  Also, the lower level slow is conjuration based whereas the higher one is alteration (as it should be).<br />
<br />
As for beastlords getting similar slows, I could care less.  PoP has come and gone and for all the hype about beastlords taking over for shamans, it hasn't happened.<br />
<br />
I'm just going to ignore the disease dot and pretend it doesn't exist.  I'm hoping they typoed on the level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pray that enchanter slows are not being boosted as well (but probably are). If these go live, I doubt I will ever cast Turgur's in any PoP encounter ever again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And by rights we shouldn't be casting Turgur's anymore.  It's a level 51 spell from 6 expansions ago.  It's about time to get an upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well it's still got the long recast times so I'll probably put Turgurs where Togors currently resides in my ldon spell set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Both the Shaman and the Beastlord slows have a target type of: Unknown(34) instead of single. New AE type?</div></div><hr />

Game Description: Incinerates the blood of your target, causing @1 damage every 6 seconds for %z. <br />
 <br />
  <br />
And we got that new disease dot linked earlier. They'll probably make that our lure we've always wanted, only thing it'll take 2 minutes to work and do crappy dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">These are probably going to change a lot in the next weeks but here is what I think so far.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient Balance    <br />
Slot Description <br />
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 70% <br />
3:  Increase Disease Counter by 16 <br />
   <br />
Mana: 300 <br />
Skill: Alteration <br />
Casting Time: 3 <br />
Recast Time: 6 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 <br />
Resist: Magic <br />
Resist Adjust -30 <br />
Range: 200 <br />
Deletable: Yes <br />
Target Type: Unknown(34) <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
Classes: SHM/65 <br />
Duration: 6.5 mins <br />
   <br />
Game Description: Engulfs your target in a swarm of insects, slowing their attack rate for %z. <br />
<br />
Interesting things:   Target Type, apparently it isn't single target.   It's Deletable meaning its going to be purchaseable.  Same amount of Disease counters as Turgur's so its really not an issue other than in PvP because I can't remember the last time a mob cured itself.<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
Ancient Order    <br />
Slot Description <br />
2:  Decrease Attack Speed by 60% <br />
3:  Increase Disease Counter by 24 <br />
<br />
Mana: 400 <br />
Skill: Conjuration <br />
Casting Time: 6.4 <br />
Recast Time: 5 <br />
Fizzle Time: 2.25 <br />
Resist: Magic <br />
Resist Adjust -30 <br />
Range: 200 <br />
Fizzle Adj 10<br />
Deletable: No <br />
Target Type: Unknown(34) <br />
Spell Type: Detrimental <br />
   <br />
Classes: SHM/57 <br />
Duration: 2.9 mins @L57 to 3.3 mins @L65 <br />
   <br />
Game Description: Surrounds your target with a foul cloud of plague, slowing their attack rate for %z. <br />
 <br />
Based on the Description and Skill I'm betting this is going to be changed to a Resist of Disease not Magic.  Its also not Deletable, meaning its going to be a Dropped spell as its set now.  I'm not sure which way that Fizzle Adj is but I'm guessing its going to be fizzling a bit more than normal.  This would be our upgrade to Cloud of Grummus.   This of course is going to completely trivialize many fights from prior expansions but thats never stopped Sony before.   I'll be attempting to solo Lord Seru should this become a DR based spell, once I have a 20 hour period to take a shot  :D <br />

<br />
Like the ornate glove focus, except just for this DoT...why does it have to be a DISEASE spell? For all that DoTs are crappy, disease ones are by far the worst with their incredibly long durations. Would it kill them to make this work on poison?<br />
<br />
30% duration increase on Malos type and Tash type spells.<br />
<br />
Yea, cause those spells wearing off with their base duration in the 15 minute range has been keeping me awake at night. It's nice that they are adding more foci for various effects, but they really need to take a look at the actual game and put in ones that might actually be something people have a use for. The sad part is, they'll justify not doing something useful by pointing to abilities like this as compensation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Let su hope the extended duration for the debuffs is fixed and not random. If the duration is random then these foci are crap. IMHO extended slow will help BST / ENC more then us.</div></div><hr />

What looks like will be a better disease slow is good but these are hardly inspiring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hahaha i love it.<br />
grab a friend who plays an sk, get 1 weeks worth of rations for 2, and get 6 bottles of caffien pills per person.<br />
now all you have to do is figure out how much to charge for seru loot rights.<br />
<br />
my honest take:<br />
-it is nice to finally see what looks like an &quot;upgrade&quot; to turgur's.  however, the cast time, mana consumption, and slow % leaves something to be desired...and remember, you will now me casting a lvl 65 spell not a lvl 51s spell...<br />
-the dot is weak, and borderline worthless from what it looks like.  this spell is beyond a joke...it is sad.<br />
<br />
over all some nice ideas, but i am not very impressed at all =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hahaha, first they up all monster resists to a level were spells bounce regulary, and then they add negative resist modifier to most spells.<br />

Shaman spells are a start, a -30 resist will certainly be nice in ldon, its mana use is high esp compared to the bst one but I guess its good because we don't have to cast malos first. <br />
The disease dot is not lure as someone said, its 0 resistadj, it looks like a mistake at this stage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Only one comment I have...if it does end up being AE...wheres my -hate modifier? No way would I cast it unless that was in it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I've got a horrible feeling those slows apply to a specific type of mob, probably one only found in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
For example, the chest spells from LDoN have:<br />
<br />
Target type: Unknown(34) <br />
<br />
on Lucy, whereas the new ones are: Unknown(34)...<br />
<br />
Duh, until I was writing this I didn't realise that was the same target type. So as is, those spells will only work on cursed traps, which is worse than useless. Therefore, as no-one in their right mind would want to slow a chest, I'm pretty sure it'll change!  :p <br />
<br />
(And as a side note, although Shamans and Beastlords get slows for Unknown(34), enchanters don't.....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well IMHO, these new slows mainly benefit the BST, period.  It gives them a better chance to land a decent (up to 55%) slow eventhough they have no debuff spells.  We get a better chance of landing a 70% slow, but we all know that in LDoN and many areas, a quick 55% slow is all that is needed.  Yes, 70% is better, but certainly not required.<br />
<br />
And the BST gets a 742 hp dd?  Why did I get those ornate chain gloves?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Rofl... Sony is kidding us no ? It can't be serious.<br />
<br />
This new dot is crap at this stage. Even Pox is better (and mana free for those who have elemental greaves) and the real bad move actually... this damn freakin initial DD who break root  :mad: <br />
<br />
The new slows... honnestly = CRAP at this time.<br />
Sure, -30 rm check is a good move, but anything else is NOT an upgrade, pretty much the inverse.<br />

<br />
TI : single<br />

Will that mean that AB is a single target, AO an AE of some kind (please, hope it's a PBAE, not the same crap as Tirgir, limited to 4 targets) and they don't dropped it in the database.<br />
<br />
Or these spells will be required to fight some kind of mobs only, immune or highly resistant to all other slow ?<br />
I don't know, but as I said, even with the resist adjust, I don't consider these spells as upgrade  :p .<br />

What a crock of **** they are...interesting the point made about them being mob type specific, this would be about right to force a use of them. Now all i need id for them to make these bought on a point basis. W000t....Sony can suck my hairy bollocks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>jondolar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The minus 30 resist is gonna be nice.<br />
Specially for ldons where one gets resists every so often.<br />
Plus on really resistant mobs we can get a 70% slow off with<br />
-85 to resists including malos. That should help a lot.<br />
50 mana for a built in mini malo isnt bad imho.<br />

Someone refresh my memory tho...<br />
BL slow doesnt show a resist modifier on lucy but they sure<br />
seem to be resisted a lot less than turgurs.... anyone else<br />

        Right ! nearly all new spell are just relooked old spell. They add a neg resist and...it's finish ! Quick ,fast ,very low cost , that perfect for sony !!!<br />
<br />
       After it's really easy ,they will just increase resistance for mob . At the end we'll have to use the new slow ,and loosing power again.</div></div><hr />

hurry already blizzard !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">This is really discouraging.<br />
<br />
I don't EVER want a new disease DoT. The last thing I need is more spells exclusively for soloing. Low DPS DoTs are completely useless in groups due to kill rate and completely useless on raids due to limited debuff slots. They only thing they are good for is soloing, which isn't part of &quot;The Vision&quot; anyway.<br />
<br />
As for the new slows - too little, too late. This was an opportunity to allow shaman to gain a bit of an advantage over the other slowing classes, which was completely squandered. Mitigation narrowed the slowing gap, and now this narrows it even further.<br />
<br />
Beastlords really benefit from these new slows the most, since they have no spell to debuff MR on their own. Must be nice to have someone at Sony who acts as an advocate for your class. I wonder what that's like.<br />
<br />
Oh, well. At least I can take comfort in the fact that all mob resistances will be raised by 50 points - which provides Sony with the benefit of forcing you to get the new expansion to get spells which will actually land occasionally (though less often than before).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Think of it this way.<br />
<br />
Whereas originally, we could slow only 10% better than beastlord slow, we can now slow 15% better than the best beastlord slow (assuming that these new slows are going to be used predominantly in the new expansion due to high resists).<br />
<br />
If anything, this is a nerf to beastlords, not an upgrade, in terms of relative power.  And to the person who said that it helps beastlords more since they don't have malos (I forget if it was on this thread or another) -- this is not true, because malos stacks with this slow, and I have a strong feeling that we are going to need that extra debuffing to be able to land our slows, even with the new resist check.<br />
<br />
I'm very happy with this spell, it was the main spell that I was hoping for when I heard about this expansion.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, I forgot to mention, Beastlord slow also gets a relative nerf in casting time with the new slow.  Their slow has gone from 3.5 base casting time to 5 seconds (5 second recast), while ours has stayed at a constant 3 seconds.  Again, it seems to me like we are gaining the advantage in slowing that we should have had for a while.</div></div><hr />

I agree the 55% is a (needed) nerf to bst slows, but I expect there is an outpouring of outrage as we speak on bst forums or wherever. Let's see if the 55% survives that. I get the impression whoever first adds the new spells doesn't care about details, other than the writing of the description and the code aspects.<br />
<br />
As for our malos advantage, the -30 mod will significantly decrease the number of places we use malos I'm sure. <br />
<br />
But yeah I agree these slows are the first good news for shamans. Looking at them again, the lvl 57 shaman one has to end up disease based, while the lvl 58 bst one clearly isn't. Of course then there are some weird balance issues in that lvl range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">-30 isn't going to make this spell the predominant Slow...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Sorry, but I can't agree.  In LDoN and probably in the new expansion zones, no one will care whether the slow is 55% or 70%.  The only thing that will matter is that it is cast quickly and that it lands the first time.  The BST will always have the advantage in casting time because of the hybrid innate spell haste.  That is why a BST slow always lands before the shammy slow now.  The only real difference was that with MR mobs, the BST had no way of increasing the chances of his slow landing.  All he could do was recast and hope it sticks on the second or third cast.  We on the other hand could actively debuff MR and try again, hopefully getting it to stick on the second cast.  <br />
<br />
However, with the new spells, the BST should have a better chance of sticking his slow on the first cast.  The built in debuff will, in most cases, negate the need for the MaloXX.  Sure, there will be mobs with higher MR that will still require a separate debuff, but I think it is clear that Sony intentionally offered these slows as a way to help the BST.  The fact that it will help shaman on a smaller set of high MR mobs is a by product.<br />
<br />
Face it, most exp groups will take the tremendous advantage in DPS that a BST offers over 15% higher slow every time.  And yes, I have been in groups, as my BST, where someone stated that &quot;no, don't get the Shaman, we already have a BST&quot;.  You just don't know it because you did not get an invite to the group.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this will happen more and more.  Since I don't raid, which is the only situation where I can now see that a shammy is still vital, I will just play my BST as my main.  Ever hear the cheers that go out every time Paragon is cast?  I haven't gotten that reaction to a shammy buff in a long time.<br />

I'm very happy with this spell, it was the main spell that I was hoping for when I heard about this expansion.<br />
<br />
You're forgetting about the innate detrimental spell haste that all hybrids get. I think it's 50% - putting the beastlord slow casting time at 2.5 seconds, which is faster than ours.<br />
<br />
This is one of the spells I was hoping for in this expansion as well. After the botched implementation of slow mitigation, I was hoping for something else to make shaman the top slowers again in a meaningful manner (and no, the 5% advantage we currently hold is not significant). An exclusive 75% slow with a resist mod would let shaman stand out again - we could reliably slow most PoP xp mobs without an MR debuff. A lower recast time for our new slows would also be great.<br />
<br />
We pay so much for slow - significantly weaker heals, low burst DPS, and so forth. It would be nice to have something to make it clear that we are the best slowers in the game. I'm glad we're 15% up on beastlords now (less on mitigating mobs, of course), but I still think that the negative resist mod slows should be shaman only.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">One thing I'd like to see with a new slow is a shorter duration and lower mana cost.  Especially if they're putting in more focus effects to increase the duration of detrimental spells.<br />
<br />
As is, how often do you really need a longer lasting slow than you already have?  A few boss mob raid type encounters that you'll likely have multiple shaman around to reslow anyway.  In an xp group we spend a lot of mana slowing and in most cases the mob is dead in 1-2 minutes.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I'd like to see the duration on the 70% -30MR slow cut to about 3 minutes and mana cost brought down to around the same as the BST slow 175-200.  As it stands now, assuming this is a single target spell, we get a less efficient slow with a slight resist mod, IMO that kinda balances it out against Turgurs.  But the higher mana cost cuts into that 'upgrade' balance enough that I wouldn't consider this an upgrade to turgur's anymore.<br />
<br />
For us it'd be a situational spell similar to Grummus.  If a mob is highly resistant use the new slow at first then if it's a raid mob work on it till a Turgur's lands.  If it's an xp group, toss a cast or two of the new spell at it and then forget it because the mob's likely damn near dead by now anyway. :/<br />

<br />
The point of his post is, mitigation is more of a leveling factor than slow percentage.  Any time you get one of those mitigation messages on your slow landing, you have entered the &quot;you're no better than the other slowers are&quot; zone.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">well at least they are a step in the right direction with a (generally speaking here) slow upgrade.<br />
<br />
For people that are asking for pboe on a slow, consider the times when you have more than 4 mobs to deal with on a slow. For a non EP/VT player that only means ldon. The best pull i've lived through in ldon is 6 mobs at once (no mezzers) in a level 65 dungeon, but at best they were only 4 that i could tag with an aoe (barring landing any of the slows), the others were off running at someone in the back of the group, or rooted out of range. With a mezzing class it could be more useful possibly, possibly more useful in some of the tier3+ raids.<br />
<br />
If you guys think about it this slow is really an upgrade to togors, not turgurs, as in most instances I have both up because of the recast time on both spells. If the recast stays the same on the GoD slow then this spell will take the place of togors.<br />
<br />
Considering all the slow upgrade possibilities:<br />
<br />
upgraded aoe slow<br />
upgraded spell recast times<br />
upgraded dis/poi slow<br />
upgraded mitigation slow<br />
upgraded resist adjust slow<br />
<br />
Call me green (i'm still a newb sure), but the upgraded resist adjust seems like the most useful upgrade to the line considered how much power and ease of use it adds to normal every day slowing in ldon and tier3. Past tier3 I cant say.<br />
<br />
Cosidering the new dot? I think SOE knows that every level 65 shaman would never touch the spell if it had a dd component to it. If it turned out to be more than just a dot, then sure. But its just a silly placeholder at this point I'm afraid.</div></div><hr />

It's already been implemented in game.  Last night my guild was doing TT to flag some of our last members that needed this flag for a while, and she was near impossible to slow.  Malos and tash hit her at 99%, but mages couldn't get sinia to land until around 50%.  About a total of 12 Turgur's resist and 6 grummus and she went unslowed.  Also, none of the &quot;butterflies&quot; would slow with tigirs at all.  Due mostly to a lot of confusion (people new to the encounter), we wiped.  On the second attempt, TT was slowed at 97% and none of the butterflies resisted tigirs at all.  <br />

- Speculation and Conspiracy Theory ahead:<br />
<br />
(1) Plane of Time is getting over crowded.<br />
(2) New spells can ease a lot the progressions of guilds into Time.<br />
(3) SOE can't allow it because their next raid expansion is not ready yet for guilds to move on. And having more and more guilds in time would mean lot of CS calls, disputes and it will cost SOE more money to handle it AND it will give them very bad image.<br />
(4) SOE programmers are too incompetent to fully instance Plane of Time.<br />
(5) They need new spells without impacting old content. Remember when Emperor became a joke with Grummus? Yea yea, I know extra levels helped more.<br />
<br />
My guess is that type 34 target is any mob in the expansion. Thus with new spells you can affect them, and expansion is balanced accordingly BUT you can't use new spells on old content wich would make it easier if you could, thus SOE slows down a lot mudflation.</div></div><hr />

The difference isn't much but if you're going to upgrade a spell, don't downgrade other aspects of it to compensate for the upgrade, cause then it isn't really an upgrade...it's an upgrade/downgrade which just doesn't feel like a real upgrade (think Canni line before they adjusted), know what I mean ? At the very least it will be nice to cycle between this and normal slow when resists happen.<br />

As for feeling threatened by beastlords as slower in groups. I still don't see these as changing much from the present situation. They're a viable alternative, which is as it should be. They're the dps slowers, we're the healing slowers, chanters are the CC slowers.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Its kinda a moot point, since these spells are all currently restricted to the new content they're not upgraes, theyr'e spells we'll be forced to get to hunt there. And it'll probably either be through A) some really lame ass quest like LoY or B) cost way way too much time/points like LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">All i can say is wow, just wow.  Spells i want most as a shaman really is nukes.  I'd like to get a disease nuke, a cold nuke that doesnt take 10 damn second to cast and I'd like these nukes to hit for over 1000 base.  maybe a cool aa like ae knockback root upgrade to VP i can use once every 10~ mins and some better melee skills cause i like beating stuff up.  Shamans job is to get in the mess and toss things up, and we havent gotten anything which helps us do that in a long long time.</div></div><hr />

This line turns it into a raid spell only, for all intents and purposes. Crap now for me, I'll never use it.</div></div><hr />

Sickens your target with a fever, causing #3 damage initially and #2 damage every six seconds for %z.<br />
<br />
Maybe they havent fixed it yet, but as it stands now this looks like another dot that Will Break Root.  The innital Direct Camage portion of the spell needs to be removed.  I hope they dont over look the small important things like that.  Only time i use Dots realy is while soloing, i.e. rooting and doting.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, whether they fix the DD portion or not, this DoT is useless.<br />
<br />
Edit: Looks &quot;fixed&quot;. Still a craptastic spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">This new disease dot is as insulting than a charisma group.........that probably why they give it to us.<br />
<br />
None of the new spell are good.<br />
     * the slow could be nice if the %t is high enough<br />
     * the new canni need  to give really more mana or be an AA<br />
      *the  dot CAN'T be good ,that just damn impossible ,disease dot are just ultra supra crap.</div></div><hr />
