<p>*I posted this to the EQ QA board, but chances of it being answered are probably similar to my rolling abilities*<br>
<br>
Throughout my time playing everquest, I have noticed the random number generator to be VERY splotchy, both in trade skills, weapon skills, and in /random.<br>
<br>
In trade skills, I will be bored out of my mind making items trying to raise my skill (Which is another issue... what a waste of time!) and I will make 30 items without a skill increase, followed by 6 failures in a row, followed by 30 more increases, and then eventually I will usually get a skill increase, and *another increase* within 5 attempts<br>
<br>
Same thing in melee combat. Everyone goes on streaks of hits, then streaks of misses... and if your weapon skills are not maxed, you always go on small streaks of upgrades<br>
<br>
/random:<br>
<br>
Now this is by gripe. I am a BAD roller. I sat in gfay, and /random 100'd over and over again, recorded 500 numbers... ran the log through a script and plugged them into an excel spreadsheet. out of 500 rolls, 47 of them were above 35, and 32 of them were above 10.  That means in a /random 100, reapeted 500 times, I had 418 rolls between 10 and 35... suspicios? I think so!<br>
<br>
I then repeated the test, and had almost identical results, but the range was 15 and 50 this time, with almost no rolls outside that range.<br>
<br>
I then had a friend who is notorious for winning rolls run this test, and I logged his results. 500 rolls, and he had a grand total of 72 rolls under 80<br>
<br>
How can this be fair? Does our connection make a difference in how we roll? I have not won a roll on an item since I was level 38, 9 months ago, while I have had the same people beat me over and over again<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> bah!</b></p>

<p>Computers can't generate random numbers at all....well they aren't really random. I don't know the math behind it, but as someone has said before, you need an external source of randomness to be truly random.<br>
<br>
(I know it doesn't make sense, but I've cooked my brain on this digital communications project, ugh!)<br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/Cool_Face_Orange.gif" alt="" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Seed number.</b></p>

<p>Depending on how they generate the seed number this can happen.  If they assign you a seed upon logon and use it throughout the game until you log on again then this can happen a lot.  The seed might even be changed every couple hours, and this would still happen.  In order for you to have the true random nature you are suggesting, your seed would need to be random too.  (i.e. not going to happen).  <br>

<p>In a word, no.<br>
<br>
Random means can't be predicted.  Any software algorithm is predictable, eventually, unless it relies mainly on an external source like the temperature of the CPU.<br>
<br>
All "random" numbers generated by software are actually called pseudo-random, because they are generated using an algorithm from a starting value (or "seed").  Some algorithms are better than others, but none are perfect.<br>
<br>
BTW random does not necessarily mean a nice evenly distributed sample between 1 and 100.  Over a VERY large sample a truly random number would distribute fairly evenly, but you can have long "runs".  You could flip a coin 10 times in a row (a random result) and get all heads, for example.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<br>
yea I read a story once about a guy who set up a "random" program on his pc, then realized it would never really be random....so he used some sort of numbers from readings off of platonium(sp?) and still that wasn't COMPLETLY random..............in Vladrek's lifetime all his rolls have seemed random...I've gotten 0's and perfect 100's and prolly almost 1 of every number in between. It might seem that some people win more than you just cause they have better luck =/<br>
<br>
atleast that's what I think about it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Even if you <i>think</> you are getting the short end of the stick when it comes to randoms who's to say the person you are rolling against is not in the exact same position?  I mean, even if there are low randoms seeds if those seeds are given out randomly then it is still a level playing field.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well, there are several very good random number algorithms circulating out there, whose mathematical properties are well understood. External sources of randomness ( 'entropy' ) are easily obtainable, especially on UNIX/Linux boxes. So for the RnG ( oh my gosh thats short for ranger eek ) that VI is using to behave the way it does means that either they aren't using commonly accepeted RnG code, or are doing something else funky. I remember in a MUD I wrote I played around with the RnG quite a bit, trying to add in factors ( such as a 'luck' factor calced from attributes ), and doing things like breaking a 0-100 roll down into 5 seperate 0-20 rolls and adding ( produces a bell curve distribution ), rolling 3 times and averaging, or picking the highest ( skews average upwards ), etc. My point is that a good RnG is easy to do, so they must be jacking around with the results in some way that produces the streaky nature. Hell, the streakiness might be intentional, somebodies idea of how 'real life' works.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon6.gif" alt="Cool" width="15" height="15" border="0"> No, random numbers don't exist</b></p>

<p>From a strictly technical standpoint, random numbers cannot be generated.  This is because at some point it had to be decided how to arrive at that number.<br>
<br>
Now to address your concerns with /random. <br>
<br>
If I had your kind of luck with getting the lower numbers, I'd offer to ML for every group I was in, and I be damn sure to call "random 100 500 low please" for about a quarter of the rolls.<br>
<br>
Here's how I pick the /random numbers when I get the chance (and I take this job as often as I can get it):<br>
<br>
-First /random - 100 300 High<br>
-Second /random - 250 500 Low<br>
-Third /random - 100 300 Low<br>
-Fourth /random - 250 500 High<br>
<br>
I change up the number ranges from night to night but generally do something along these lines.  I also tend to be pretty adamant about class looting and fair distribution (ie. you are out of future randoms on equitable non-class items until everyone gets something, unless you put up your prior winnings for random should you win the random on the new item.)<br>
<br>
I know that last part sounds complicated, but it really works quite easily and well.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I don't know about random or luck, but it seems if I have a 50/50 chance at something, I lose (or am wrong) 100% of the time.  <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="images/smilies/mad.gif" border="0" alt=""> <img src="images/smilies/confused.gif" border="0" alt=""><br>

<p><b> Diff system</b></p>

<p>On guild raids we often use the system of assigning numbers to a player who is eligible for an item, then rolling on a very small range, i.e:<br>
<br>
1 - Fahren<br>
2 - Nanashi<br>
3 - Dyvette<br>
4 - Aalavar<br>
<br>
Then a group leader does /random 1-4 to see who gets it. Depending on eligibility of people for the item, numbers assigned will always change.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> The RNG is actually fine, if you actually test it...</b></p>

<p>I won't bother to repeat the entire thread, but this topic recently came up in the Tunare server EZBoard forums, where some folks felt that they were always getting bad rolls, and that the random number generator was poor.  Specifically, the thread got started when the originator stated his belief that when randoming in small ranges, i.e. 1 to 4 or something to assign loot amongst 4 players, that the value "1" came up much more frequently than any other.  That set of several rather interesting tests, the upshot of which - the RNG verant is using is pretty good.<br>
<br>
Here's the thread, if you care to read it:<br>

<p>It's not about randomness.<br>
<br>
It's about fairness.  <br>
<br>
If all players have to deal with the same issues with regards to rolling for items, then there isn't really a problem.  Even if the numbers aren't really random, as long as the players we are rolling against can't control the outcome, and as long as they have to put up with the same downsides, then it all washes.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon3.gif" alt="Lightbulb" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Possible Seeding</b></p>

<p>I read a post somewhere a while back where some guy was claiming that Verant used /loc result to seed the random number generator (this would make sense, as it would give a fairly random seed).  He went on to explain his reasoning for this claim.  He had found spots in a couple dungeons where spell casting was nearly impossible, recorded the /loc, and then had another caster move to that spot and repeat his test.  It was fairly indicative that usage of /loc for seeding was in fact the case, as several casters who tried the spot found themselves fizzling 7-8 times per 10 casting attempts.<br>
<br>
So perhaps if you get a bad roll, make sure you move a little before your next one.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>There are a few things I can attempt to contribute here..<br>
<br>
1. Some work has been done that indicates that EQ's RNG like many others is very unforgiving of being fed prime numbers.  example: doing tradeskills with a Wis or Int of 199 is far worse that doing the same with a wis or int of 195 or 198.<br>
<br>
2. GEEKLY TIDBIT: One of the most expensive and supposedly most random of all seed generators is produced by <a href="http://lavarand.sgi.com/">SGI</a>. It involves 6 different colored "LAVA LAMPS", digital cameras, and some sophisticated timing systems.  Using the digital data from pictures taken of the lava lamps at various times, a "truely" random seed is generated to feed to a RNG.  This is actually true, believe it or not, they sell these systems complete with actual lava lamps.  <br>
<br>
I highly doubt Verant employs this seed generator... heh.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>i would have to support the idea of them using /loc for the seed. i have found a certain spot in the doorway of the gaurd room in HK where i can roll 90+ EVERY TIME. i'll have to grab that /loc and post it here for all you tester types..<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Wow!</b></p>

<p>There is something very interesting there about the location. I didn't go as long as last time - only 100 rolls each instead of 500, but I repeated the test...<br>
<br>
I stood at on the same hill as last time and got similar results; I stepped down to the bottom of the hill, and My average range went from 10-50 to 40-70. This is ridiculous, but at least the problem makes a little sense now. I would love to see this /loc in HK... If I could figure out where to stand to get a 90-100 roll every time, I could be a very rich ranger =P<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

Seemingly random numbers made in this manner are not random at all. Simple software RNGs (such as rand(), seeded with srand()) operate much like this.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>One system someone told me was used for random numbers was that the computer took numbers from the clock...like the one one millionth place digit (if it is 4:32pm, the die might be the number that comes from 4:32.364272pm....and it being the last 2).  Simple system seems to me.  If you take say the last 4 digits from the thousanth place on down (4272) and then divide by some factor to generate a number from one to X instead of from zero to 9999, you have your die roll system.</p>
