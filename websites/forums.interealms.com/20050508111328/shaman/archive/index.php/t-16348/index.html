<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After modifications and lots of adventuring, items are purchasable that surpass Vex Thal loot, and for all we know may be better than Plane of Time loot. The thing that is most notable about this however is that now players who are willing to invest time in everquest but never had the chance to join a large and serious raiding guild will have access to very powerful items.<br />
<br />
The question at hand however is if the balance of this reward system is well tuned. One has to step back and think, &quot;does x number of LDoN adventures equal the same amount of work it takes for a person to progress to Vex Thal or Early Planes of Power?&quot;<br />
<br />
Hardly a rhetorical question - it has yet to be answered. Will folks be able to casually farm up points yet quickly be able to contend with people who do the old fashioned style of obtaining uber loot? Problems like mobilizing your raid and more importantly finding the mob you wish to raid spawned are problems not applicable to the system LDoN uses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In no way am I saying there is anything wrong with LDoN. I simply dont know right now; nobody does. The only thing that bothers me is that Sony just took a giant leap in a completely new direction, and I am worried about how that will effect the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think thats a good comparison: you can't be carried in an LDoN group as you can in a 72 man raid.  A player in a six man group has to do a lot more than, go where he's told, stand where he's told, and perform whatever 'monotone' role he's been told.<br />
<br />
The biggest concern I have is that the uber guild players on my server are already farming LDoN dungeons at a remarkable rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am liking the ideas behind LDoN very much.  It gives unguilded people a chance to work for something specific, rather than just &quot;go sit at that bot camp and hope i win some loot I can sell for pp to buy what I want.&quot;  You can now set a goal and go straight for it, which I really like.  Raiders, like myself, now have something to do when they aren't raiding.  In the last month or so, I have gotten very burnt out on EQ.  I have over 250AA, and really don't feel like grinding out more just for the sake of doing it.  There are also very few 1 or 2 groupable items or quests that I can do to improve my gear, so I am stuck there as well.  LDoN might very well be an answer to this.  I haven't seen the high end loot of LDoN yet, but I am sure that there is plenty of it that I can use.  Augmentation is also very very cool, and an excellent idea.<br />
<br />
Another thing I like about the expansion is how it was implemented.  It is VERY convenient to get started doing things.  You can just port inbetween camps instantly to wherever you want to go, then you just pick a mission and get to it.  There is very little bull**** involved with this expansion.  It is all very convenient and straightforward.<br />
<br />
The only qualms I can forsee myself having is that the missions might get very old, very fast.  Even though there are 4 different types of missions, it is really just the same thing:  Clear mobs until you reach your objective.  However, when you consider what a normal exp group is (clear mobs until you get so bored you want to cry and log out), it just might work out well :)<br />
<br />
The final thing I like about LDoN is the new skeleton models.  I own an AoN, and I am very pleased with how I look now:  Glowing green orb in my offhand, glowing green snake-stick in my primary, and they match my glowing green eyes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't really concern me.  Yeah, one of our uber guilds was farming stuff last night, linking some drops.  Am I concerned about?  Does it really matter?  No, not really.  <br />
<br />
They're not going to be locking down certain mobs or zones to farm them where you can't get in.  Not a big deal IMO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zalaton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I don't see anything to be remotely concerned about with uber guilds farming adventures.  If you play 18 hours a day, you ought to get 18 hours worth of rewards for that day.  I say best of luck to those who can stand (both time wise and boredom wise) to sit around and farm adventure points all day, same as I say best of luck to those who can stand to farm AA points all day.  Another shaman having better equip or more AA skills than me takes nothing away from me.  If anything, it gives me something to look forward to!<br />
<br />
Anyway, off the tangential commentary, I think LDoN is simply a fantastic idea.  I have plenty of friends with no guilds or non-raiding guilds (my own guild isn't a 'raiding guild' by definition, but we certainly do our share), and this will allow them to get high end items instead of just lamenting about the lack of 1 group content.<br />
<br />
I also see no problems with the quality of top end LDoN purchases being elemental/VT/Time quality.  Yes, a single adventure doesn't compare to the difficulty of a high end raid (assuming you aren't raiding far beneath your capability, of course), but I see adventure points as more like AA points.  Killing 1 easy, low blue mob a zillion times can get you canni5.  Canni5 is better than any piece of loot off any mob, yet I don't see anyone complaining that you can get it without raiding.  Adventure points allow people to put their EXP group time towards loot, instead of hoping for that 1 insanely rare drop out of the 10 drops they're simply going to sell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem or flaw in your question is that the casual people still wont be contending with the old fashioned uber people. The ubers will still have the numbers needed to kill the highend stuff - the casual people never will even with a bazillion adventure points.<br />
<br />
What LDoN might do is make some of the ubers realize they can get useful items without having to fight for spawns, without letting their RL come in a distant 2nd to EQ. That must be a good thing for them (but maybe not for their guild). But even then EverQuest has never been closer to DoneQuest for a lot of people in the uberguilds from what I have seen on various websites.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would be perfectly happy that if I could spent 10,000 adventure points and earn VT / Ele / even Time loot... and so would most of Norrath... except maybe the ubers who can't brag about all their loot anymore.<br />
<br />
I'm pulling numbers out my arse, but 10,000 adventure points will take you a long time to get... and that's for 1 item, no augments... who knows how much it actually is... could be cheaper, could be more, could not even exist.<br />
<br />
I know from the safehouse, Mistmoore has a caster robe with 90hp 110mana for 1500pts.  That's not VT/Ele/Time calibre... but it's probably as good or better than most people will have... I can only imagine it gets better.<br />
<br />
Ubers get the loot, because they choose the life of being uber and working hard to raid and kill big stuff.<br />
<br />
Good for you.<br />
<br />
Other people work just as hard or harder doing their tradeskills, xping, fun stuff, etc... and choose not to try and join raiding/uber guilds.<br />
<br />
I did the 8th shawl... I consider that a hell of a lot more work and time than it took me to learn my part for an AoW kill.<br />
<br />
My only point is... if people choose to work for their adventure points and buy &quot;almost&quot; top end gear... it's about time... Ubers have everything... just because they choose to group with people who want to focus on raiding... they get the best xp zones, best loot drops, see more zones, have access to tradeskill items, quest items, etc...  and now... well, at least we can almost even the score on loot.<br />
<br />
It will still take time for people to earn adventure points, just like it takes people time to earn guild points to buy stuff on raids.   The big difference is that I no longer have to deal with raid competition crap.<br />
<br />
Do whatever brings you fun... now those want to xp and hang with friends, have access to good loot... about time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn't have said it better meself. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">EQ needs to continually mudflate to survive.  Stuff that you needed a raid to get in the old world is a complete joke to get now.  Stuff that you needed a raid to get in Knark is available for pennies in the bazaar.  Stuff that you needed a raid in Velious to get can be gotten with a single group all over PoP, soloed in Veksar, etc.  Now Luclin loot is starting down that path.  This should surprise nobody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">However sorry the implementation... the IDEA of LDoN is so superior to that of guilds racing each other to rare spawns - I couldn't applaud the concept more.  A fantastic new direction for EQ, IMO - but then again, I abhor traditional raiding, so this is doubly a godsend.  If only they can make it not such a frenzied rushed slaughter show.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What I like about it best:<br />
<br />
7:30 Put kids to bed.<br />
<br />
8:00 Log in.  Say hi to guild.  LFG.<br />
<br />
8:45 Got group together; get adventure<br />
<br />
9:00 Enter LDON dungeon<br />
<br />
10:30 Complete LDON dungeon (win or lose)<br />
<br />
11:00 Finish exploring/triggering traps/loot dist.<br />
<br />
11:15 split loot, say good night to guild, go to bed.<br />
<br />
This is a perfect amount of EQ playtime for a weeknight.  If you have more time, you can do more adventures, or if you have a powerful group, you might be able to stick to a tighter schedule and do two in an evening.  But there's no question when the thing ends - it ends 90 minutes after it starts, and that's bedtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">weissblau summed it up prefectly. This expansion is the best one so far and am enjoying it to no end. Dungeon crawls are the best and I miss them. Nobody wanted to do them before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well said Weissblau...now the only trick is keeping the kids in bed once I send them there!!!  (if anyone has a suggestion to that, Please Post It, heheheh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shandrillar, I hear that at 10,263 points you can purchase a spell called &quot;sleep of the innocents&quot;. That might help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Woot!!! That alone makes LDoN well worth the money!!!! hehehehe</div></div><hr />

Duct tape maybe?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">heheheheh......hmmmmmmmmm (/em is in deep thought).  If only my wife wouldn't kill me if I tried...hmmmmmmmmm...</div></div><hr />

Duct tape works on her too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't expect to be upgrading all your VT loot right away.<br />
To get stuff that is VT quality or better you have to do a lot of adventures.<br />
Math time:<br />
<br />
1500 for VT quality item with say 3 slots in it.<br />
1150 for each of 3  +40 HP or +40 mana augments<br />
= nearly 5000 points<br />
<br />
50 points for a victory on normal.<br />
<br />
You are looking at doing 100 adventures in order to get a super high end item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Well, I mean that makes sense... how many 2-hour single-group runs did you have to make before LDoN to get a VT quality item?<br />
<br />
Sure was a heck of a lot more than 100 to collect enough sellable loot to buy one of the handful of items that qualify.<br />
<br />
That reminds me -- coins!  I have coins again!  In the dark corners of my little mind, my brain's telling me that a couple hundred pp in coin is not that much for 2 hours, but PoP is just SO money-low that the only coin I've gotten lately is when I upgrade something and sell my old item in the bazaar.  I've banked over 3k in pp since LDoN came out -- which isn't a ton, but will supply my tradeskill habit nicely.<br />
<br />
BTW, IMX Mistmoore's had the best cash, 250 pp+ per run, while most of the others have been in the 120-160ish range.</div></div><hr />
