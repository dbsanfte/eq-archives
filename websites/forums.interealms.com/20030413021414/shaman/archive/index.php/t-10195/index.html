Ive heard quite a few things conerning this.<br />
<br />
A few say clear the Kindle room and pull kirn to there.<br />
<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
What would be the best choice? <br />
<br />
We always pull to the top landing on that long ramp up. Pull Kindles room to there, move to that room and pull all of Kirn's room 'cept for Kirn, then move in and do the turnin. Just make sure nobody uses any AoE spells once you get inside the tower. <br />
<br />
I also wouldn't take more than one good group inside the tower. Even a low 50s group shouldn't have trouble with Kirn or Kindle and the more people you take in, the bigger the chance of ITU dropping and someone screwing up when it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks for the advice Thurdar will probibly pull him to that spot.<br />
<br />
Im still going to take two groups though. I have two clerics capable of doing that Group IVU spell and its a guild group so there smart enough to know to stand and die if they get agro. <br />
<br />
I have another question why im here. I have a pally in the guild who wan't to take down The tombkeeper if he is up (My halfling rogue reports that he isint but he might be by sunday).<br />
<br />
I  have heard this guy is very bad mojo. One of the guides I read reports he will eat 3 groups alive if agroed. He couldent really be as tough as reported could he? Illias reports him as Mid 50ish.<br />
<br />
Doh yet another question I wanted to ask.<br />
<br />
I plan to do the drop down the waterfall method. Is this the best choice if master Yael is up? Again my halfling reports no but raid is still 2 days away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Damn ezxcited about killing Kirn :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From what I hear, Yael will agro if you jump down the waterfall. Never seen him up on my server but we do check with a rogue before jumping down. <br />
<br />
I don't know a whole lot about the pally epic mob. I've seen two high 50s groups wipe to him once, but we pulled him by mistake, along with about 10 of his friends. We didn't die very quickly and our wipe was mainly due to not realizing there was an epic mob in that train until too late.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did the Kirn part of my epic just the other week. We had two groups, average level 59. The enchanter was level 55.<br />
<br />
We completely breezed through to the tower - so much so I thought everyone needed a challenge so we pulled the tower (61 monk pulling), and just killed everything. It wasn't very hard, but obviously the high average level helped a lot. The hardest part we had was just before the docks where we got about 6 to 8 mobs at once including a couple golems, but with an enchanter to mezz it wasn't so bad. If your 2 groups are more like 50 - 55 in level, then go the IVU route to the landing, and as mentioned above pull kindle's room to there, then kirn to kindle's room. Its worth noting that some ghosts are not KoS. Therefore its important that the puller gets the KoS mobs first, the non KoS ones will not add. If you want to kill them later you can, but there's no need. Kindle is also non KoS.<br />
<br />
To get there, we took the waterfall route. 2 people died - one didn't listen and went to far out, missed the pool completely. The other one, strangely, died and his corpse was at the bottom of the pool - right against the wall. I can only imagine he actually hit the wall of the waterfall on the way down - he was a monk but safefall couldn't save him on that size of drop. No idea if Yael was up but if he was he didn't aggro. From what I hear, just keep left after the dropoff and you should be ok, but there are some horror stories about Yael coming out.<br />
<br />
No idea about the tombkeeper.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well we just did this last night. group was lvl 65 pally, 63 ranger, druid, 58 mage , cleric and myself lvl 52 shammy. We worked our way all the way down to tower, by having mage debuff and the hitting them with turgur's. Once at the tower we had the cleric put on summerskin I believe and we went all the way up to Kirns room. Killed the first mob before his room and then killed the 2 that were in his room. Did turn in and killed him right there. Easy Easy......never a death along the way and a very simple early morning raid. GL :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Only 1 mob in kindles room will agro (the one on kindles right)...kindle in non-agro and so is the ghost on her left.<br />
<br />
I always just IVU from the corner out in front of the tower strait up to kindles room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this part of the quest is really fun and fast paced if you ahve the right group. i'd say if you are all over 55, i wouldnt bother with IVU and just kill your way down. if anything, it is very good aaxp and you can get some good drops on the way down (got a pair of imbused granite spaulders, couple other things).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We fought our way up :p all went will, finished up Neh today. Need tear, then rak, then epic :D :D :D :D<br />
<br />
Im happy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vadmir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When I did it 3 weeks ago we fought to the valley then IVU'd and ran up to Kindle's room.  Killed the ghosts in Kindle's room then pulled Kirn's room.  Killed Kirn in Kindle's room then took care of Kindle.  All in all pretty easy once we got there.<br />
