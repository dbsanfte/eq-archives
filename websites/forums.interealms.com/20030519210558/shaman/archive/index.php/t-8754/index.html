<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was wondering if its harder for a troll to get shammy epic?, Because you have to goto Freeport, or can this be fixed with some faction work?, Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">think you can invis to where you need to be... both the NPCs you talk to are fairly out of the way, but I'm a barb so I'm not really sure.. also been a while since I did my epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Okay, so its not really worth started over as a barb/cat to get my epic?<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks again<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Nope, not a gud plan!  Bein a troll just makes dat part of da epic more fun!  Shur, ya gotta invis in a cupla places, but da parts where ya gotta expose yerself hav no-one in aggro range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help u 2 : )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/shudders at the thought of Izzy exposing himself<br />
<br />
The other way to be safe in North Freeport is to BARSH the guards in E and W freeport repeatedly! I barshed so many guards that the stinky ooman paladins in NFP lurve my green ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't waste your time with faction work. Invis as necessary. Freeport is a ghost town and a complete waste for Trolls, especially with POK.  Invis, get the thing. Move on.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, I also did some west freeport guard killing, worked that faction up, and helped guild pallies with soulfire, killed lucan 2-3 times, got max kos in east/west freeport. The north freeport pallies love me too, I like banking there....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If it is shorter than you, it prolly needs to die.  Don't even think about wasting precious moments of your green life factioning a worthless dungheap of a city like FP.  Just invis on through.  <br />
<br />
You youngins got it soooooo frikkin easy nowadays.  It used to be that to actually get your green azz from Grobb to Butcherblock for snacks you had to crawl through the bowels of FP and pray no hiding shorties jumped you, swim through the front of the boat to avoid the guards and their mom, hide on top of the boat in the wee far corner to avoid mean treehuggers on docks and sharks in OOT, and then jump off the boat and swim to shore once you got near dorf country to avoid mean dorfs at the docks.  Now you just squeeze your big behind into that book in the swamp and pop out of its mate in BB.<br />
<br />
Troll Tips:<br />
<br />
1.  Get used to being KOS and use invis liberally.  <br />
2.  Short people are mean and should make you nervous unless they are rotating on a spit.  <br />
3.  If you had to shrink to get through the front door you prolly are not welcome.<br />
4.  Paranoia is your friend.  Finest known example of this is opening day of RoK when hordes of trusting elfs, barbs, and shorties rode wave upon wave on the deck of the Bloating Belly into the abusive arms of Overthere dragoons.  They all found out in one &quot;special&quot; moment what it is to be KOS. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Love dat line. Hope you don't mind if I borrow it for a while, Naag.:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had zero problems doing the Freeport part of my epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">well, I may be green, but I still get nervuss ...<br />
<br />
so I used a human mule to check the route from the turn-in guy drunk to the green jade place.  With my troll, I think my invis dropped twice on the way, but I knew I had time to recast and didn't have to kill any witnesses.<br />
<br />
but about that &quot;shorter than you&quot; line - the drunk an da spirits is shorter dan me, and I do not recommend trying to eat them after you get yer gem - it is bad for the one faction ya do need - True Spirit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I haven't killed the greater spirit in Freeport, but since none of the other Truespirit mobs give faction hits when killed, I doubt it does either.</div></div><hr />
