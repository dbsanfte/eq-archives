<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just heard a rumor and wanted clarafication if you could from the people that have done it.<br />
<br />
Rumor = first 5 AA points YOU SPEND at level 51-52 exp, next bunch at level 55-56 exp.<br />
<br />
1) Is that true?<br />
2) I have not tried for AA's yet.. going for 60.. then push for AA's, would it be better to save up all the AA's and spend them at one time?<br />
3) Is this total BS and I should just push on doing it the normal way..<br />
<br />
Thank you for letting me know.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NOt sure I understand your question but if it was me I would get 60 asap if I had an oppotunity to get my hands on Torpor at least. No AA is better than Torpor. After you hit 60, then you can decide if 65 is worth it or just get AA. A mage I know is staying at 61 because he gets an aa point every 40 minutes in POJ enforcer hall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lyzzt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are many many many threads here about how to spend AA.   Use Search or just scroll through the first several post pages and you'll find some.<br />
<br />
The consensus of most here seems to be Run3 at 51 then push to 60 not bothering for AAs as Torpor (and to a lesser extent Malo) redefine the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you are hunting indoors a log you might want to invest 3 points in run3 ... besides that get to 60.  It is a whole new game at 60.  Most people think to get cani 5 at level 60 and I would agree if you solo and have torpor.  Otherwise you might want to wait till 62.  The new focus and sta give quite a bit more hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is no certain way you have to do AA. Anytime after 51 you can earn exp towards aa but you'll never miss a window of oppurtunity to spend. <br />
<br />
    If you go to lvl 60 without any aa you can get as much aa from the general aa which are available to spend on at lvl 51 and up. Do you want to ? nope but you can. There are certain lvls you have to be to get an aa skill or to build more onto it but like i said will never miss any aa cuz you didnt get it at a certain lvl. Hope thats what you were asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>talas213</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The amount of experience that one AAXP point requires doesn't vary with level nor does it vary with # of AAXP points acquired or spent.  <br />
<br />
My guess is that the rumor was started by someone noticing the killing mob X at level 51 gave A% experience per kill at level 51 and killing mob X at level 55 gave something less than A% experience per kill.<br />
<br />
The reason isn't that AAXP points got more expensive it's that you receive less experience from killing mob X at level 55 than you did at level 51.  That is the close the mob your killing is to your level the more experience you receive per kill.  The farther the mob is from your level the less experience you recieve per kill.  This is intended to encourage people to kill mobs closer to their level.<br />
<br />
Short answer..<br />
<br />
1) No, it's false.<br />
2) No, the number of AA's spent doesn't affect the cost of the AAs<br />
3) Yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tify</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was trying to find out if the experience needed for AAXP points varies by how many you have spent.  I was in a group last night and two people were talking about needing more exp after you had spent 5 points off AAXP.  The way they were discussing it made it seemed like it was fact.  I had never heard or read of anything like that and  just wanted to confirm that it was a rumor.<br />
<br />
I have been reading/searching thru the different post and know how to spend the points when I do get them. <br />
<br />
Thank you all for responding to my questions.</div></div><hr />
