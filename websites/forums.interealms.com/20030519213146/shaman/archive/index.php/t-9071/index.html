<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im was hoping that one of you guys would know of or have a shammy epic guide in french that you could post or email me at<br />
maniacmagoo@msn.com. Thanks any help would benefit my friend very much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can always just cut and paste the guide into a translator like Babelfish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is also this translator:<br />
<br />
http://translation.lycos.com/systran/cgi?partner=systran-Lycos-en<br />
<br />
As an example, it translated this:<br />
<br />
Getting the tear of the Iksar Child will torment you for an eternity, eventually causing you to give up in frustration.<br />
<br />
into:<br />
<br />
Vous obtenant à la larme du torment de volonté d'enfant d'Iksar pour une éternité, par la suite vous entraînant donner vers le haut dans l'anéantissement.<br />
<br />
Is it accurate?  I have no idea.  You tell me.  If it is, this might be the tool you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Never trust an online translator.  I used one to generate some French when I needed to ask a french guild if I could tag along on a Fear raid to get my Tear.  Wasn't pretty.  They laughed..... hard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A good way to check accuracy is to put the translated french sentence ya translated back in and see what ya get in english (and its just fun)<br />
hehe<br />
<br />
and voila....<br />
Obtaining to you with the tear torment of will of child of Iksar for<br />
an eternity, thereafter involving itself to give upwards in the<br />
destruction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">We had a guy who used to cuss people out in german.<br />
<br />
I used the babel fish to translate most of it, then reposted what he said in (bad) english, and he quit doing it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">back when i was playign TFC there was this guy in my clan we called him cowboy.<br />
Well I went to a german translator and translated &quot;Cowboy likes man ass&quot; into german and sent it to him.<br />
He laughed so hard again and again i thoguth he was crazy then went to german to english translater fed it the german line it said &quot;Cowboy likes male donkeys&quot; :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention that &quot;go back to china&quot; got translater to go back to (china-the material they make coffe cups from but that has a separate name in german) :P<br />
<br />
Moral of the story is don't use onlien translators.<br />
Unless u need a good laugh.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im not sure if the &quot;run it back through the translator approach&quot; really works.  After all, the translator translates your so/so english into not-so-good (even somewhat broken) French.  If you then give it the not-to-good (even broken) French as input you will get Really Bad (tm) English.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that the translators are great, just saying that the quality of the translation should be judged by someone who speaks the language and should not be used to source a second translation for judgement.  <br />
<br />
The phrase:<br />
<br />
I want to go to the store soon.<br />
<br />
becomes:<br />
<br />
Je veux aller à la mémoire bientôt.<br />
<br />
but when you retranslate it, becomes:<br />
<br />
I want to go to the memory soon.<br />
<br />
As the text becomes more corrupted, the translation degrades.  And thats with a remarkably simple statement.<br />
<br />
Wish I spoke a second language so I could really tell.  :)</div></div><hr />
