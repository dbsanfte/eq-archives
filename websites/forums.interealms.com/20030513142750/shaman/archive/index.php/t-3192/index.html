<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all.  Maybe some of you other shammies have been or are in the same predicament as I am.  I began the epic and have progressed through the boot portion (tasty little boots).   As I read ahead in the epic guide I realize that some steps in the quest may require having multiple groups (correct me if i'm wrong please).  However, I am in a guild which will have trouble fielding this many people (post 50's that is).  I really enjoy the small band of brothers (and sisters) in my guild but it does make things like the epic a bit harder to complete.  Anyone have any suggestions (besides leaving my guild)?   <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Farbzilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You'd be surprised how many people out there are willing to help with this sort of arangment.  Many of the other smaller guilds tend to have a few high lvl players that will assist, just to keep their fellow small guilds progressing.<br />
<br />
Other than that look up your old friends and see if their guilds have some muscle to add to the cause.  Speaking from my experince...the epic guide was written before a lot of the new gear and abilities were put into the game and you can do these battles with less people now that each character is potentionally (much) more powerful.<br />

Find a mentor shaman and get some tips from him, and go get 'em!</div></div><hr />

<br />
most of our epic can be done with only 1 group. Just keep looking on your server boards for fear raids as soon as you can visit fear. This is the one big problem getting the tear.<br />
<br />
For The Hole make a brell halfling rogue, sow and bind him near The Hole and get to know the zone. You might get aggro from some ghosts .. just die and go again .. know the zone . know the way through it. If you know it, it can be done with 1 group (most Lvl 60 though). Important is a Lvl 60 puller to trim down adds and a good enchanter (or team).<br />
<br />
For Neh Ashir you need 1 group that is able to kill reavers and a rogue with lock picking skill of 201 or above, Rak Ashir can be done with 2 mages (fire pet), 1 cleric and the same rogue as above.<br />
<br />
Rest is a cakewalk .. be happy that our epic is so easily done.<br />

So long<br />
