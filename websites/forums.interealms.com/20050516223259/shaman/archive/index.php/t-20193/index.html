<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I realize that this community is currently trying to figure out what is the &quot;most important&quot; issue we have. However, I believe with a sincere heart, that we are going to end up crippling ourselves if we don't step back and take a loot at the big picture.<br />
<br />
We have healing issues.<br />
We have damage dealing issues.<br />
We have utility issues.<br />
We don't appear to have a class defining role in the new content (Main Slower).<br />
<br />
<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the encounters these days are NOT what they used to be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guys, pay attention to the GAME DESIGN. It's not that it's broken...it's that it has progressed and we don't fit the way we used to. We were the &quot;gods&quot; of the long encounter mobs. Slow landing meant something. We had time to mana regen. We could dot and heal and a host of other things, including rebuffing if the encounter continued forever. :) Let's get real here, though. We, as a community, have been saying that stat buffs are useless since people hit the &quot;end game&quot; of Kunark. Stat caps have always been our nemesis. So what?<br />
<br />
Focus on how the game is played NOW...that will help you come to grips with what the REAL issue for the shaman community is. We are build for the &quot;long term&quot; encounter. The new &quot;end game&quot; is about killing stuff asap and keeping people alive to do it.<br />
<br />
We don't quite fit in there. THAT'S the issue. Not just heals. Not just nukes. Not just DoT's. It's the situation that has changed while we have remained very much the same as we have been since Kunark. <br />
<br />
I have noticed that as PoP, LDoN, and GoD has increased the single group content of the game--it's similar to how we used to play back in the origin of the game--Antonica/Faydwer/Odus. It's not all raids. It's not all multigroups. There is variety. We USED to be able to keep up with variety in the first incarnation of the Norrath only content. We are in a Kunark state of being while the game moved on without us. In the Norrath only days, we were able to slow and heal and do a little damage along the way. We need that ability given to us again...just as I stated it. We need to be able to slow AND heal AND do a LITTLE damage along the way.<br />
<br />
That's the shaman's original design. Let's get it back. Then, we will be &quot;fixed&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good post.<br />
<br />
I agree with your high-level view, but the problem isn't that we're not adapting; the problem is that we don't have tools as suitable to the present game as we used to.<br />
<br />
Back 'in those days', we used to group with people that didn't top out their stats in gear alone as well. Now all they really want from us is +140 Attack and +544 HP. And the occasional cure so the Cleric doesn't need to tie up a spell gem.<br />
<br />
Back 'in those days', when you let a mob get to 90% and then cast slow (so as not to steal agro), slow landed before the mob hit 85%. Nowadays, with lower mob HP, you're not getting much return for the 650 mana you dumped (Malos &amp; Turgur's), considering how low the mob health is by the time slow sticks. And DoTs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the problem is that we don't have tools as suitable to the present game as we used to. <br />
<br />
I absolutely agree with you. My point is that if we make healing our only &quot;tool&quot; we ask for...we will pigeonhole ourselves into the spot healer role with NOTHING else to do.<br />
<br />
Debuffing will still be a problem, but hey, we got our healing fixed!<br />
Damage dealing will still be a problem, but hey, we got our healing fixed!<br />
<br />
I don't want to become &quot;a spot healer&quot;. I want to be enabled to spot heal, I just don't want it to become my &quot;class defining&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
That's my point. That should be the point of this dialogue between the Shaman community and SOE. We are essentially a &quot;utility class&quot;. So, give us some tools that makes a group want to utilize us. :)<br />
<br />
If we pick &quot;one thing&quot; to focus our efforts on, expect to be a one trick pony. Shaman weren't supposed to be a &quot;one trick pony&quot;. It was stated in the original design for the Shaman that we were designed to be a jack of all trades...master of none, so to speak. If my godly slow, which I used to master in, is now less godly...I'll survive. My slow is no longer godly, perhaps, but that doesn't mean the enchanter or the beastlord slow got BETTER. We all received a kick to the groin the slow department. Fine, that's fair. But let us do what we were supposed to in ORIGINAL DESIGN since the game has returned to ORIGINAL varietal options in play. Give me a variety of utilities.<br />
<br />
As I was thinking about how stat caps are our enemies...I realized that is only for the high end guild folks. The average joe with the less than &quot;l33t g33r&quot; is going to still need those buffs...and with the stat cap increase, the buff role works for probably 65 - 80% of the shaman community. So, bitching about stat caps is really just stupid on our part and short sighted as a COMMUNITY. But, healing and damage...that's where our need is and that is where we fall very short no matter what level of play we are in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We're not a 'utility class'. What the hell is that anyway? Every class has utility. Druids have snare, ports, damage shields, dots, charms, very nice nukes. Those are all utilities, arent they? I could go on and list every class and their 'utilities', but I dont feel like it.<br />
<br />
We're a priest - a healer. Got it? Always have been. Dont like it? Sorry, that's what you picked. Sorry, if you came into the class more recently than I did (i.e. after Turgur's perverted the game and shamans), but that wasnt our role in the original game. We were healers in the original game. We also had debuffs (including a slow line), dots, and buffs. But every other healer had other 'utilities' as well. <br />
<br />
Should druids have had their healing abilities penalized because they can snare and port? Why should we have ours penalized because we can slow and cannibalize? Why dont enchanters, bards, necros, and beastlords get penalized because they can slow mobs? Why dont necros get penalized because they can lich themselves? Hell, necros can 'cannibalize' their health for mana and give it to another person - we cant do that. We can only cannibalize for ourself. Why dont clerics have their healing ability penalized because they can stun - doesnt that feasibly reduce the amount of damage players receive?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you dont like the idea of being a healer, but that is what shamans are. Think about it every time you see an item with the tag CLR DRU SHM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Steelbear,<br />
<br />
&quot;Untility class&quot; means we're a class that really doesn't need a full-time player behind it to be 100%. I.e, Shaman are a &quot;bot&quot; class.<br />
<br />
And if you want healing, it'll have to at least match druids point for point, exactly. In the current state of the game, with massive HP tanks getting chewed up and spat out in under a minute, we can't be asking for more &quot;last in line&quot; rewards. If this is the new &quot;one thing that will save shaman&quot;, then fer god's sake, make it count.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't want to be a bot class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">We're not a 'utility class'.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, if you aren't sure what the term &quot;utility class&quot; means, then you can't claim whether you are or are not a member of a utility class with any authority. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Every class has utility.<br />
<br />
That isn't what defines a &quot;utility&quot; class. A utility class is one that improves the capabilities of other classes, rounding out a group and balancing it in &quot;less than ideal&quot; conditions.<br />
<br />
<br />
We're a priest - a healer. Got it? Always have been. Dont like it? Sorry, that's what you picked.<br />
<br />
Why all the hate? I didn't say I don't want to heal. Reread my post--you'll see that I want to be enabled to heal better than I can right now. What I said...and have been saying in more than one place on this forum...is that is not the ONLY thing I want to see &quot;retuned&quot; to the new game content. If it is, you will be patch healing only. You like healing only and doing nothing else because your buffs/debuffs are still questionable and your damage dealing is pathetic? You will then learn the burden of the Cleric circa Kunark syndrome. You will probably then be first in line to complain about how your ONLY job is to patch heal cuz you can't do anything else. If that becomes the case, I will hunt you down and remind you that picked a healing class so deal with it. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, if you came into the class more recently than I did (i.e. after Turgur's perverted the game and shamans), but that wasnt our role in the original game.<br />
<br />
Steelbear...I have been a shaman since initial realease of EQ. I'm an old timer. Don't tell me what I do and do not know about the roles of the shaman class. I was a slower pre-Kunark. Any well played shaman learned that they could do more than buff and heal between level 14 and level 29. When the game first came out we had to learn what our spell lines did. Allakhazam's and Caster's Realm didn't know back then what they know now.  :D  We often learned what spells did by casting the spell on ourselves to see what happened.  Drowsy (level 5 slow) didn't SEEM to do anything. No damage appeared and debuffs weren't fully understood to those of us in our first encounter with an MMORPG. So, we didn't cast those kind of spells until a little later on in the game. It was when we began to SEE some kind of effect taking place that we figured out that the mobs were hitting slower than normal. Then the healing role was &quot;improved&quot; even moreso due to less attacks from the mobs.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, I was often the MAIN healer in my groups for so many levels...I can't begin to recall just how long I was an effective healer. I think it wasn't until clerics hit a level where they were able to Resurrect that they seemed more desirable. Until then, myself, a druid, or myself and druid combo were sufficient. I recall very fondly the days when a druid and I were the duo healing uber team in the Avatar of Fear room in Cazic Thule to reach level 30. That was the place to be back in those days. Yes, I've been around a long time. I know what my shaman has and has not been about since the days of Old Norrath. <br />
<br />
<br />
We were healers in the original game. We also had debuffs (including a slow line), dots, and buffs. But every other healer had other 'utilities' as well.<br />
<br />
And I want the SAME balance in my shaman of today, Steelbear. I have been saying this and nothing more. I don't want ONLY my healing improved in the new content. If it is, I will have no viable options but to spot heal, canni, spot heal. I won't be able debuff with much effectiveness and I can't see the reason to inefficiently use my mana on a DoT that won't see much more damage beyond the opening dd smack before the tick damage begins to work. I'll be reduced to saving my mana to spot heal. That doesn't sound fun at all. I enjoy healing...but I don't enjoy it enough to do nothing else BUT heal. That's what will happen if that's the ONLY thing that gets &quot;tweaked&quot; for our class.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for a complete overhaul. We don't need to go back to the drawing board and define shamans differently than they were in the genesis of the game. The genesis of EQ and the game's content today are more similar than dissimilar. Variety encounters, raid and non raid, with mob encounters that don't drag on for a millenia due to insane HP of the mob. The problem is, I'm not the same shaman I was in the genesis of the game. I'm very much a Kunark era shaman in a Gates of Discord world.<br />
<br />
<br />
Should druids have had their healing abilities penalized because they can snare and port? Why should we have ours penalized because we can slow and cannibalize? Why dont enchanters, bards, necros, and beastlords get penalized because they can slow mobs? Why dont necros get penalized because they can lich themselves? Hell, necros can 'cannibalize' their health for mana and give it to another person - we cant do that. We can only cannibalize for ourself. Why dont clerics have their healing ability penalized because they can stun - doesnt that feasibly reduce the amount of damage players receive?<br />
<br />
Why appear to be calling for nerfs to other classes? We should not and do not need for them to be penalized for what they CAN do. We are simply continuing to carry the burden of penalties for past abilities and are asking for our class to get another look. We can't compete in the current design. Yes, it may be early in the GoD gameplay, but the issues are glaring us in the face and have been since PoP. In PoP, we could still slow a majority of the time thereby masking the widening gap in class balance. LDoN and the continuing marches through the instance zones brought the mana regen and debuff issues onto the stage. GoD just kicked things up a notch on all fronts. We are a long encounter class in a short encounter world.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if you dont like the idea of being a healer, but that is what shamans are. Think about it every time you see an item with the tag CLR DRU SHM.<br />
<br />
I'll ask you to do the same if you get your upgrades to healing without ALSO getting debuffs, nukes, and buffs looked at in comparison (key phrase). When you start complaining about having no task other than spot healing in the GoD content, I will remind you to look at your item and it's tag: CLR DRU SHM. Then I will remind you that Clerics get to smack mobs because they aren't constantly poking their cannibalize hotkey and they also get tonuke once in awhile. Druids get to nuke, snare, and evac. They will be the &quot;utility&quot; class of the future and we will be a one trick pony.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman are a &quot;bot&quot; class.<br />
<br />
Well played shaman are far from a bot class. Make us patch healers only and that is what we shall become.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Lorianna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Dear Otoole:<br />
<br />
Eloquently said, perfectly correct.<br />
<br />
I too am an old schooler, earning my levels in the Ct of old.  <br />
<br />
I too am dismayed at what has become of our class, our lack of balance, our lack of utility in the new era.  <br />
<br />
I too have triple digit aa's (actually close to completing), and in a raiding guild with a job function that has become more blurred with the last 2 expansions.<br />
<br />
I have watched my spell slots go from slowing, small healing, buffs, debuffs and some dd's/nukes to big heal, fast heal, Quiessence - repeat repeat. I now have a hot key that hits Tnargs, pause 40, hit Q - that I use more than my slow hot key. <br />
<br />
I do not not mind patch healing (although I doubt one could seriously call 3/4 of a bub healed on a main tank -  real healing).  But I do mind being a main healer.  It rubs me raw.  It isn't why I started the shaman class.  Lately I have taken to declining that role.  I know that is a bit drastic ... but I am beginning to think I had better define how I want to hunt my character, than let others do it.  <br />
<br />
My only question to Steelbear is ... if we are defined as a healing class - (CLR DRU SHM)  where are my heals that at least are comparable to theirs?  If SoE defines us as healers - why haven't we received the same consideration in that spell line up as the others in our class?  If Paladins are not considered healers - what gives with their spell line up?<br />
<br />
I liked playing Lori.  I have 5 years and hundreds of dollars invested in her.  EQ ain't cheap,  neither in time nor money.  Since I like the game and the concept of my virtual kommunity of friends I have made, I would rather fight to make her a viable member of the game, rather than lay down and retire.<br />
<br />
BUT (isn't there always a but) I just can't see a future in the shaman class if it continues to evolve in the vein it has been.  Whatever it takes to wake up SoE, I am behind.  <br />
<br />
I will take an upgrade to the heals, it isn't the end-all, be-all of what I want.  But lord I will take it.<br />
<br />
And for the record, I will still would like Brenlo to answer &quot;What is a shaman?'  <br />
<br />
You, Otoole, gave the definition I used to know and love.  I do not think SoE Dev teams use the same definition.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Otoole, I know exactly what was meant by utility class. I was pointing out that this fixation with calling us a utility class, jack of all trades, is wrong. That isnt what we are, nor ever were...not anymore than any other priest. We have spells for different functions (utilities), but so do druids, and clerics, and every other caster in the game.<br />
<br />
That isn't what defines a &quot;utility&quot; class. A utility class is one that improves the capabilities of other classes, rounding out a group and balancing it in &quot;less than ideal&quot; conditions.<br />
<br />
No, that's called a 'buffer' - which incidentally is what all three priest classes are.<br />
<br />
I was a slower pre-Kunark.<br />
<br />
So was I. From the day I got the Drowsy spell, I started using it every fight. Unlike you, I immediately saw it's usefulness, and so did the people who grouped with me. But we were still healers then, Otoole - remember? That was our primary function in a fight, and we would buff during downtime. <br />
<br />
If it is, you will be patch healing only. You like healing only and doing nothing else because your buffs/debuffs are still questionable and your damage dealing is pathetic? You will then learn the burden of the Cleric circa Kunark syndrome.<br />
<br />
No, as I've posted in other threads, I want to see our healing restored to equal level as druids again - where we should be. That would allow us to be a bit more than patch healers.<br />
<br />
I also have ideas about improving our other lines as well, but that is another topic which wasnt addressed here. If you would like me to address it, I also think Focus is too weak. Focus of Soul/Seventh should be a 1200 hp buff, in my opinion. Are you aware that paladins have a level 65 LDoN purchased buff that is 1100 hps and 54 AC? Kinda makes Focus look kinda lame, doesnt it?<br />
<br />
Had you noticed that we actually have more poison-based DD spells than cold based now? I would like to see us get another rain spell line based off cold resist, so we had a second option for damage if mobs were highly poison resistant. It would be perfectly logical, since we already have cold DD, poison DD, and poison rain. <br />
<br />
You will probably then be first in line to complain about how your ONLY job is to patch heal cuz you can't do anything else. If that becomes the case, I will hunt you down and remind you that picked a healing class so deal with it.<br />
<br />
Hm...I've repeatedly said we should be equal to druids in healing as we once were, and that we are primarily healers. Now, why would you think I would complain if they actually fixed this for us?<br />
<br />
Why appear to be calling for nerfs to other classes? We should not and do not need for them to be penalized for what they CAN do.<br />
<br />
Those were rhetorical questions, Otoole. I was trying to illustrate how ridiculous this prevelant notion is that we dont deserve equal healing as druids because of our other abilities. Apparently it went over your head, so I'll reiterate. We shouldnt be lesser healers than druids because of slow or cannibalize, anymore than any other class should have their primary function limited because of their tertiary abilities.<br />
<br />
I'm not asking for a complete overhaul. We don't need to go back to the drawing board and define shamans differently than they were in the genesis of the game.<br />
<br />
Neither am I. In fact, I'm suggesting we be returned to what we were defined as at the genesis of the game - a healer. That doesnt mean they have to completely redesign us or throw away all our existing spell lines. That only means they put us back on equal footing with the other primitive healer (read druid). Where do you get that I ever suggested overhauling shamans? Are you another of these nuts who thinks we arent healers?<br />
<br />
And neither of my other ideas for improvement (cold rain and improved hp buff) are a divergence from the earliest and most basic spell lines we've ever had either. As far as I'm concerned, they could throw away the new disease dot and give us a cold rain spell that does about 800 per wave or so. That'd be 100% better than another stupid 2 min dot.<br />
<br />
My only question to Steelbear is ... if we are defined as a healing class - (CLR DRU SHM) where are my heals that at least are comparable to theirs? If SoE defines us as healers - why haven't we received the same consideration in that spell line up as the others in our class?<br />
<br />
Why dont you ask SoE. I'd like to know where they are too. If you both are as old school as you claim, why are you arguing with me about whether or not we are supposed to healers? If you are as old school as you say, then you should remember quite plainly that we started out as healers, like I do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I, for one, didn't sign up as a Shaman just to be a healer.  I don't know what you're smoking, but the notion that Shamans are, and always have been, viewed as nothing but healers is nonsense.  When people talk about a group, a Shaman is their 3rd choice as healer, at best.  Shamans are, and have been, viewed as buffers/debuffers, slowers, and healers.  Not just healers.  And the current state of the game has rendered us ineffective as healers.  <br />

<br />
No, Steelbear...it is not wrong. Read the original EQ literature about what a Shaman's design is. It's THEIR term that we are a jack of trades, not my own. You see, I read that when I created Otoole back in 1999 and THAT is what made me think she would be &quot;fun&quot; to play. I might not be the greatest in any area, but at least I could do something from most areas (thus making me useful). I didn't imagine this, Steelbear...I READ IT. Verant wrote it, I made Otoole and found that she could do a little bit of everything...LIKE THEY SAID and I enjoyed it. That's utility, that's &quot;jack of all trades...master of none&quot; and it was a pretty accurate depiction back in the genesis of the game. We &quot;became&quot; the masters of slowing after slowing was discovered to be important and parsers/packet sniffers revealed that our slow was indeed superior to the slow of the enchanter. This was not understood at the onset of the game. Back when newbs were true newbs, no one &quot;knew&quot; what their roles were. We learned them by trial and error. Then, those roles became more defined and concrete by the end of Kunark specifically.<br />
<br />
That isn't what defines a &quot;utility&quot; class. A utility class is one that improves the capabilities of other classes, rounding out a group and balancing it in &quot;less than ideal&quot; conditions.<br />
<br />
No, that's called a 'buffer' - which incidentally is what all three priest classes are.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, since when is slow a buff? Yet it manages to IMPROVE the mana efficency of any healer, the lifespan of any tank, and the likelihood that experience will be more steady due to reduction in frequent deaths.<br />
<br />
Since when is debuffing mobs considered buffing? Debuffing mobs increases the likelihood that other classes spells will land with ease as well as our own. That's not a buff and not all priest classes have debuffs. Clerics can't do this like druids and shaman. This is yet ANOTHER way that a &quot;utility&quot; class improves the overall effectiveness of party members WITHOUT buffing. <br />
<br />
Steelbear, you appear to have tunnel vision where the shaman is concerned.<br />
<br />
So was I. From the day I got the Drowsy spell, I started using it every fight. Unlike you, I immediately saw it's usefulness, and so did the people who grouped with me. But we were still healers then, Otoole - remember? That was our primary function in a fight, and we would buff during downtime.<br />
<br />
I'm glad that your hightened sensitivity to the effectiveness of drowsy was beneficial to you. When the Barbarian Warriors I hunted with by Bandl rock, equipped with their rusty swords and tattered armor were being humiliated by our nemesis &quot;orc shaman01&quot; we didn't really see a big reason for the drowsy spell. It was more important that I heal them. The orc shaman wasn't hitting them as much as it was casting on them from afar as they tried to pull it in. Once we upgraded the tanks to banded armor (a major purchase in those days) then the use of the slow line was plausible. I'm sorry that it took a few more levels for me than you. I bow to your l33t detection skillz. hehe. Maybe we were just poor for too long. We drooled over banded but couldn't afford it nor craft it. lol.<br />
<br />
So, yes my &quot;primary&quot; function was as a healer EVEN OVER SLOWING early on in the game. But that was VERY early on in the game. That function as &quot;primary&quot; healer shifted long before Kunark went live. My &quot;primary&quot; function moved from healing to debuffing as soon as any warrior I grouped with could withstand a minor beating. I was then a dual purpose support member of my group. I debuffed AND healed, with the debuffing taking place before the healing. Group me with another healer and I dropped to replacement healer role in a heartbeat. My dual purpose role shifted to debuffer/damage dealer with healing being an afterthought (circa Cazic Thule). <br />
<br />
By the time I was spending any significant time in Lower Guk, clerics were emerging as the most sought after choice for a healer. I was definately still useful and desired in a group, but healing duties were becoming the clerics job and resurrection became the best reason to keep a cleric with you at all times. My role as &quot;healer&quot; was definately 3rd in the line of tasks I brought to a group. I basically kept the cleric alive if his healing aggro got him noticed by the mob. He kept the rest of the party alive or resurrected us when we died. My role as support healer was evident in the genesis of this game by the &quot;end game&quot; of Norrath only content. This was also a common tactic in Nagafen/Vox encounters. Buff raid, attempt to debuff dragon, then keep clerics alive while they kept the rest of the party alive. Steelbear, I know what a Shaman is and what a Shaman is not. We are NOT primary healers. We are secondary healers. We need to remain in that capacity. As it stands today, we can't even do that very well.<br />
<br />
No, as I've posted in other threads, I want to see our healing restored to equal level as druids again - where we should be. That would allow us to be a bit more than patch healers.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, we would not become PRIMARY healers even with upgrades to our heals. We would be &quot;healers&quot;, that is true, but we would most likely require another healer in the groups make up because *other duties* (read: old habits of attempting to debuff and damage deal--though, to what end these days I do not know) and mana use could not maintain the function as PRIMARY healer. We would support another healer thus making druid/shaman, paladin/shaman or even shaman/shaman combos in a group a viable alternative to a single cleric. If you think that improvements to our healing are going to make us a &quot;primary&quot; healer, thats one big pipe dream to which you are clinging. Although if our healing is improved while our other lines remain in their current condition for our other functions...we might become &quot;healer01&quot; because we are essentially wasting our mana and precious seconds if we do anything else with it.<br />
<br />
In any event, the paladin and the druid would be a preferable choice as &quot;primary&quot; healer with the shaman supporting their mana needs and patching where they need assistance. In the shaman/shaman combo, it would most likely be an even split of duties or one shaman as the &quot;primary&quot; healer reserving ALL mana/time for just that function + cannibalizing while the secondary shaman would be fulfilling all the other shaman duties (read: old habits). That would be fine, Steelbear, if shaman healing could be that effective. However, we would not become a &quot;primary&quot; healer in the true sense of the term. Clerics own that position hands down and druids run second.<br />
<br />
In GoD, though...even CLERICS are having trouble because the damage dealt by mobs is insanely large and fast making the secondary healer a benefit to any party. I have been the &quot;seondary healer&quot; to my GoD group with a cleric in the party. It's HARD to fill that role. I could do not much else than attempt to debuff, hope to live if resists got me noticed and pummeled, and spam Tnarg's til cleric big heals landed on the tank. There was little time for damage spells and even less time to cannibalize. I had a very difficult time keeping my mana where I needed it to be to feel &quot;comfortable&quot; with my duties. I was on edge, although thrilling, it wasn't confidence inducing. I realized that as we progressed through GoD to more intense combat situations, I was gonna be screwed. I can't offer what I once could. I can't keep up. My sucky heals eat through my mana faster than I can regenerate it. <br />
<br />
What's my point? Yes, I need healing improved just so I can SUPPORT in the healing department. However, I will most likely NEVER be able to be &quot;prime&quot; healer in GoD. I don't expect that and I won't ask for it in the way of improvements. If my healing is improved so that I can be a decent support healer, great. Now what? I can *now* support heal but what ELSE can I do in GoD? Hmmmmm. DoT's are not condusive to efficent mana use, nor is debuffing in it's *current* incarnation. There isn't a lot of down time for buffing, but I'll gladly do it if need be. So is that my role? Buff occasionally and toss a heal now and again? Fine, I'll do that. I will get bored like Kunark Cleric did. That was his role. I remember the rants from the cleric community back in those days. History doesn't have to repeat itself if we LEARN from past lessons. So, to avoid the upcoming &quot;new complaint&quot; of the Shaman community once our healing role is solidified, I will present what the next whine fest will include: I now want shiny new weapons that proc insane things so that I can be a battle healer. I'm not a good meleer and I don't have efficient damage dealing spells. I need SOMETHING to do other than buff, heal, cannibalize (same as Clerics in Kunark: Buff, Heal, Med.) I want better damage spells, better mana regen (not ancient spell, please) and a chance to get mixed in the fray.<br />
<br />
C'mon, Steelbear...there is MORE to our &quot;problem&quot; than healing and that is the point I have been making this whole time. Fix healing today and we still will bitch and whine because we will become the same thing that the Kunark Cleric was. Only difference is, we have the cannibalize spell gem to keep us &quot;busy&quot; rather than simply sitting on our azzes meditating. We already complain that constant canni clicking is anti social for us. It's just gonna perpetuate itself. The cycle needs to be broken in a realistic way. The lessons of the past can benefit both SOE and us now.<br />
<br />
I also have ideas about improving our other lines as well, but that is another topic which wasnt addressed here.<br />
<br />
It absolutely was addressed here, Steelbear. I swear, you have tunnel vision. The ENTIRE POINT OF MY POST (the origin of this thread) was that healing ALONE is not enough to &quot;fix&quot; the Shaman class.<br />
<br />
Hm...I've repeatedly said we should be equal to druids in healing as we once were, and that we are primarily healers. Now, why would you think I would complain if they actually fixed this for us?<br />
<br />
Because you won't have anything ELSE to do in GoD, Steelbear. That is the point of my thread taking a look at the BIG PICTURE rather than the detail within the picture that is our healing issues.<br />
<br />
Those were rhetorical questions, Otoole. I was trying to illustrate how ridiculous this prevelant notion is that we dont deserve equal healing as druids because of our other abilities.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, I don't need to equal a druid in healing to be a good healer. I can still be sub-standard in comparison to druid healing as long as the gap isn't as huge as it is right now. What I NEED is to have more to bring to a group than the occasional buff and heal. Druids have that AND MORE to offer. We have very little else to offer with slow immunity, slow mitigation and short duration encounters.<br />
<br />
Apparently it went over your head, so I'll reiterate.<br />
<br />
It didn't go over my head, Steelbear, we simply disagree with what our PRIMARY role is. I can read that I am a member of the healing classes, but I am CLEAR about &quot;where&quot; I fit in that category. I am third in line in active healing *IF* my healing is brought up to the standard it *SHOULD* be. CLR DRU SHM is not only alphabetically correct in it's listing. It just so happens to be the order of *actual* healing effectiveness :)...always has been. (Yes, slow and cannibalize make up for the &quot;difference&quot; thereby bringing us &quot;equal&quot; to druids) I'm fine with being BEHIND druids in active healing. Right now, though, the gap between us is way too large. My slow and my cannibalize do not bring me close to Druid healing effectiveness as it stands today. Short duration encounters, slow immunity/mitigation, and crappy healing spells are an Unholy Trinity for the Shaman class. <br />
<br />
I don't actually want to see any changes to slow immunity or mitigation. In fact, I think it adds a certain flavor to the encounter and makes each situation less &quot;predictable&quot;. I don't MIND that my slows aren't the end all be all of my class anymore. I actually like many of the suggestions being brought to light of OTHER possible &quot;roles&quot; we can fill where mob debuffs are concerned. Spells that effect mob abilities would be different for us. Flurry/enrage reducing (not removal) spells would be interesting. Something that takes a 1.7 quad hitting mob and reduces his &quot;effectiveness&quot; to 1k per hit...or perhaps a spell that checks his quad hit into a double or triple hit with a whiff in between would be something cool in our arsenal. There are likely other avenues that haven't been explored yet, but healing ALONE is not our ONLY issue.<br />
<br />
We shouldnt be lesser healers than druids because of slow or cannibalize, anymore than any other class should have their primary function limited because of their tertiary abilities.<br />
<br />
That's simply comparing apples to oranges, though, and it won't get us anywhere. Slow and cannibalize are an entirely different species than evac and snare.<br />
<br />
Neither am I. In fact, I'm suggesting we be returned to what we were defined as at the genesis of the game - a healer.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, tunnel vision is your enemy. We were not &quot;healers&quot; in the genesis of the game. We were MORE than that. Always have been. Even druids were MORE than healers in the genesis of the game. It's clerics who were HEALERS, per se. That's what makes them &quot;pure&quot; while druids and shaman are &quot;muddy&quot;.<br />
<br />
And neither of my other ideas for improvement (cold rain and improved hp buff) are a divergence from the earliest and most basic spell lines we've ever had either. As far as I'm concerned, they could throw away the new disease dot and give us a cold rain spell that does about 800 per wave or so. That'd be 100% better than another stupid 2 min dot.<br />
<br />
A new HP buff isn't going to improve our class desirability. A cold rain might be nice, but as in all rain spells, they are only to be used under optimal conditions...therefore, they are situational. Good, but situational. They also are not &quot;top notch&quot; in mana efficiency due to resist checks in all rain spells. A &quot;decent&quot; form of nuke is our best hope in bringing us up to DPS assistance in GoD. <br />
<br />
If you are as old school as you say, then you should remember quite plainly that we started out as healers, like I do.<br />
<br />
I am as old school as I claim, Steelbear. 5 years in this game...but old school doesn't necessarily = well played as I am discovering while reading your replies. Shaman as &quot;healer&quot; ended by the time us of the Barbarian variety ventured from the tundra of Everfrost/tunnels of Blackburrow into the Karana plains. We still healed, but by the time we were adventuring in Highpass, The Gorge, or Runnyeye, Clerics and Druids were our sidekicks so that we could do our &quot;other&quot; tasks as our primary role, thereby increasing the efficiency of our groups. That's what UTILITY is about, Steelbear. It's not buffs, per se. It's buffs + debuffs + damage that contribute to group efficiency. That is bard//druid//enchanter//shaman territory most significantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I, for one, didn't sign up as a Shaman just to be a healer.  I don't know what you're smoking, but the notion that Shamans are, and always have been, viewed as nothing but healers is nonsense.  When people talk about a group, a Shaman is their 3rd choice as healer, at best.  Shamans are, and have been, viewed as buffers/debuffers, slowers, and healers.  Not just healers.  And the current state of the game has rendered us ineffective as healers.  <br />
<br />
For every DRU CLR SHM item, I can point out another ROG RNG SHM BER item.  Using lousy itemization in an attempt to prove your point is pretty specious.<br />
<br />
I just have to ask, when did you start playing the game? When I started in Aug 99 we were healers. In fact, I had a regular group (monk, monk, enchanter, bard, shaman) and I was the ONLY healer until around level 55 when I started having difficulty keeping up (this was before stoicism AND chloroblast, and sup heal was a 53 spell). <br />
<br />
WE WERE PRIESTS and I wish we still were.<br />
<br />
Of course shaman are often linked item-wise with the other chain classes, I don't know what that has to do with our role as a healer. Since clerics are listed with warriors and druids are listed with monks, does that mean they aren't healers either?<br />
<br />
Otoole, I disagree with your entire post.</div></div><hr />

Okay, by your own definition of UTILITY. Where does that leave shaman? You listed, buffs/debuffs/damage...okay.<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
<br />
Worst hitpoint buffs, behind paladins. Usless stat buffs. Third place haste behind bards and enchanters.<br />
<br />
Debuffs:<br />
<br />
Slow shared with 3 other classes (who contribute MORE UTILITY in groups than we can). Malosini-line shared with mages, cripple shared with enchanters.<br />
<br />
Damage: <br />
<br />
Worst nukers. Weak pets. Decent dotters but fights are skewing shorter and shorter.<br />

I will concede that a necro could be grouped in with the utility folks...but it would be a stretch. They are often considered DPS in scope. Those particular spell gems you listed are not often memmed, save snare/feign perhaps. If another snarer mezzer is present, necro snare/mez is unused. Even Bard mez is preferable to Necro mez. Feign is self only, merely for the (grouping) purpose of self aggro reduction. Feign has little if anything to do with actual group efficiency. It has everything to do with DPS, which is a category unto its own.<br />
<br />
Wizard<br />
- stun<br />
- snare<br />
- evac<br />
<br />
Sorry, Wizzie stun/snare is not the reason he is invited to any group. DPS is his function, a separate category, although the evac/snare IS a nice feature that he brings to the table.<br />
<br />
Magician<br />
- CoH<br />
- stun (via pet)<br />
- Malosinia<br />
- multitude of summoned items<br />
<br />
CoH? That's all you got? lol. C'mon, that's so situational it's laughable. Stun via pet, nice but unreliable. If a stun is needed no group is going to RELY on Mage pet stun. <br />
<br />
I have to say that I actually &quot;excluded&quot; mages as a utility class due to their DPS, however, I think that was an error on my part. All that summoned stuff they do is what makes them a UTILITY type class and those summoned items *can* effect group efficiency.<br />
<br />
We are actually at the bottom of the heap at what you call utility.<br />
<br />
While some classes may have some &quot;utility features&quot; that doesn't MAKE THEM a utility class. (Cleric, Necromancer, Wizard)<br />
<br />
According to your list, I would put MAGE at the bottom of the &quot;utility&quot; heap, but still ahead of us because of his DPS. They can summon stuff, and THAT is a &quot;utility&quot; feature that they provide. However, they are not invited to group because they can summon bread/water/pet toys/arrows, nor for CoH as the MAIN reason. They are invited because of their DPS, much like the Wizard and the Necro. Mages nearly ride the fence of the utility class category.<br />
<br />

Hello! Now you are beginning to see what our REAL problem is. It's not just our &quot;healing&quot; that is our problem it's our UTILITY, because THAT is what we are. A druid is a healer/utility and we used to be, too. We were never a &quot;healer only&quot; and it pains me to see how so few shaman can see that.</div></div><hr />

On another note balance simply means that everyone should be able to have fun in every aspect of the game. That means being useful in groups, raids and trials. Shamans have always been versatile soloers, and its why I still play the class, but group and raid balance has not progressed through the expansions as well as most the other classes.

<br />
Shaman should not be able to be the primary healer on all content.  Period.<br />
<br />
If shaman could be primary healer for all content then there would be no reason to ever use a cleric.  Get it?  Shaman *can* be the main/only healer in many types of content, just like shaman can fill many other roles or be the glue that holds together and enhances a group.<br />
<br />
EQ has a huge variety of content.  Some classes shine more than others in different types of content.  It's pretty much impossible for all classes to be equally desirable in all types of content.<br />
<br />
Shaman have a wide variety of abilities even if some of them don't stack up to the abilities of some other classes.  Few classes have as many abilities and potential as shaman.  It's hardly fair to constantly make comparisons between shaman and a multitued of other classes at the same time.  If you want to compare shaman one on one vs another class that's fine, but when you have to compare shaman to 6+ other classes to point out our weaknesses all you really do is show our diversity.</div></div><hr />

Hey Pot, it's the kettle, you're black.<br />
Shaman should not be able to be the primary healer on all content. Period.<br />
Why not?  EQ content has evolved in such a way as to make the class less attractive for new content.  Our heals are based off of our slow, but our slow hasn't evolved to adapt to more resistant and mitigating/immune mobs that appear with greater frequency.  The new slow has got a resist mod, but we are being out healed by paladins on unslowable/highly mitigating mobs.  In situations where our class was balanced many expansions ago, we no longer make the cut.  I'm not suggesting that we should out heal druids or clerics.  I am suggesting that for higher end content there is no reason to have a shaman which takes your argument for clerics the other way.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not weak or useless.  Shaman are less efficient and can not contribute as efficiently to groups who are facing more challenging content.  We have to carefully build parties (re: loads of downtime for most) to have any hope of even functioning adequately in some scenarios.  In most cases, it isn't worth the time to have a shaman present in later content because others group compositions function better.</div></div><hr />

Hahaha! I didn't notice that I put that in that category until you brought it to my attention. I apologize. It was simply a mistake. I meant to put it in the enchanter portion because I didn't see it in there initially. Sorry. lol.<br />

<br />
Clerics are not BDAing other people on a regular basis and you know it as well as I do. This is not a group efficiency ability. The refresh time is the key element there. Be reasonable.<br />

Then lets add monks, ok? You are beginning to sound like Steelbear with his &quot;Every class has utility&quot; comment. I can't help you understand the Utility class concept.

Shaman ARE priests. I'm not saying we should be in a CH chain with the clerics, but if there's an exp group, we should be a valid choice to heal. If not, groups are severely handicapped by the availability of only two classes.<br />

I don't see that Otoole and Gloriana are really arguing.  I mean, they appear to think they are, but I think they are really essentially saying the same thing.  We need to heal better as a class and as an aspect of our utility.  It's not the only thing that we should do better, because we also used to do damage.  <br />
<br />
My recollections are like those of Otoole.  They ought to, because we were both running about Everfrost in rags with rusty weapons at the beginning.  We did heal, as part of a bigger picture of utility.  All these aspects have shriveled some.  <br />
<br />
Just prior to Kunark and just after Kunark especially, nobody healed enough - except clerics.  It was a huge problem, and one they fixed through substantial changes.  <br />

They need to do that again.</div></div><hr />

Of course shaman are often linked item-wise with the other chain classes, I don't know what that has to do with our role as a healer. Since clerics are listed with warriors and druids are listed with monks, does that mean they aren't healers either?<br />
<br />
Otoole, I disagree with your entire post.<br />
<br />
When you started having difficulty keeping up, I assume you had to enter groups with a cleric (or druid, but they were kind of in the same boat like shamans then)?  What did you do while not being main healer?  I assume still slowing and landing damage in various ways.  <br />
<br />
Today, we have high impactive quick fights.  Our damage isn't being fully utilized.  DoTs and DD's alike are slow and soft.<br />
<br />
I believe what Otoole is trying to point out is, we can't just recieve a healing upgrade (we should have had them in the first place) and that'd be it for shamans.  We need desperate attention in other areas for when we are not healing (or at least not being a main healer).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If all you want to do is heal, then why did you select Shaman as your class?  Clerics have always  been represented as the best healers.  I didn't choose Shaman as my class just so I could heal.  I'm not arguing against improving our healing abilities, but how exactly do you propose the developers can fix this problem if all you want to do is heal?  Give us the healing ability of clerics?  That certainly wouldn't cause any problems  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Pidgeonholing Shamans as nothing but healers is counter-productive.  We'll get a second-rate heal, and nothing else.  I would rather see a meaningful upgrade to FA, including some of the suggestions made recently regarding duration and enhanced effects like strikethrough.  I would rather see an endurance-regen AA, instead of the crappy health-regen one we have now.  I would rather see improvements to our quick-damage and quick-debuff capability, so we can be of use in the shorter-duration battles that are now the norm in GoD and LDoN.  I'd rather see reduction in our DoT agro, so we can actually use them without getting pulped while wizards and mages crit-nuke for five times the damage without pulling agro.<br />
<br />
Even with vastly improved healing, we'll still be second rate to clerics.  I don't begrudge them that; I have no desire at all to be a cleric.  If all I wanted to do was heal, that's what I'd have selected as a character.<br />

This is just another example of this within this thread.   At this point, none of this helps current Shaman issues.   Many of these problems have been surfacing since Kunark Expansion and well documented on this board.  Not withstanding that opinion should always be welcomed here  but at this point do we really need another Ive walked a Mile in the snow both ways debate  lurker or old time poster aside?<br />
<br />
And just for the record, Druid and Shaman classes had near if not exact healing abilities up to lvl 50 and beyond until post Luclin Expansion.   After that, Devs started this mitigation of slow abilities to balance out our Cann ability.  GoD is just showing what has been there for years  lack of attention and imagination for our class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Now you guys are just being ridiculous and putting words in my mouth. When did I say that healing is the only thing we should do, or the only improvement we need? Never, in fact I told you two suggestions for improvements in other areas as well. And I pointed out that both the other priests (HEALERS) have just as many, or more, 'utilities' as we do. You guys have trouble not thinking in extremes I guess, so you think because I say we should be equal in healing as a druid that means that's all I think we should do. I never said that.<br />
<br />
I also find it hard to believe you're as old school as you say, when you are rooted in this slower/debuffer role. Maybe you've just been doing it so long since Kunark, you have forgotten what it was like before Turgurs. I didnt forget. I remember how the game changed, and how my role changed because of that spell. I saw myself change from a healer to a slower. And everyone who came into the shaman class after that point probably would think that's what shamans always were. Yes, I did slow mobs before Turgur's came to be. But half the people I grouped with didnt even understand the implications of slow. It was just one spell cast at the start of every fight. It's wasnt the be-all-end-all of my class. It was a single tool. Most people grouped with shamans for healing and buffs.<br />
<br />
I was level 50 months before Kunark came out. I spent a lot of that time in Plane of Fear raiding for my rune etched armor. You know what my job was there? I was a healer. The raid leader who I raided with most often always gave me a group of rangers or robes, and my job was to keep them alive. Yes, I would throw out a slow or a malosi, if I could get one to stick, but then I was healing. And the druids did the same thing, because we had exactly the same heals. The clerics healed the plate tanks because they had the big heal. On Cazic Thule, my task was to try to land malosi, and once that was accomplished, I healed. So, you see, even then we still used our 'utilities', but mainly we would heal (and buff during downtime). Honestly, if you are so old school, I think you have just forgotten what is was like back then. It was a long time ago, and it has been a long time that we've been pidgeonholed into the slower role. It took them a long time to figure out how to subvert Turgur's effect on the game - but now they have. So we should be restored to being a full priest again, not some half-assed wanna be 'priest' who can barely outheal a hybrid (and is outbuffed by a couple of them).<br />
<br />
For every DRU CLR SHM item, I can point out another ROG RNG SHM BER item.<br />
<br />
Let's talk about the CLR DRU SHM tag for a minute. If you've been around any length of time, you've probably seen hundreds of items with this tag. Hm, why those three classes? Wisdom? Nope, rangers, paladins, and beastlords use wisdom too. Armor type? Nope, they are a plate class, a leather class, and a chain class. Gee, it must be something else. Of course, I'm playing dumb here, but so are you if you dont realize why these three classes are tagged together on hundreds of items in the game. Just like the above poster was being dumb when he suggested the chain class tag has anything to do with this tag. <br />
<br />
And, no, Otoole, they arent listed in order of who's the first, second, and third best healer. It is alphabetical, just like every other item tag in the game. Check it, you'll see (well, except where they just threw new classes on the end of the tags). Druids and shamans were once identical in healing spell lines - same spells, same level, remember old girl? We should be equal again.<br />
<br />
I do see your point, Otoole. You are saying we need more than just healing upgrades, and I agree. I gave you two of my ideas on where we could use improvement in other areas in my last post. The thing is, the improvements we need in other areas are minor ones. Our healing needs a major improvement. <br />
<br />
The thing I have 'tunnel vision' about is squashing this stupid idea among shamans that we dont deserve to be equal in healing to druids. The stupid notion that our other 'utilities' make us less deserving of being a PRIEST - which is what we are, and always have been. Every time I see these threads about what improvements we need in healing, everybody wants to shortchange themself because of these outdated perceptions about slow and cannibalize making us too powerful. Wake up, folks, neither of those are as powerful today as they were in Kunark and Velious. We share slow with 4 other classes, and it's been mitigated or eliminated more and more with each expansion. Cannibalize is not that much better than other casters mana regen anymore, and they dont have to constanly cast a spell over and over preventing them from doing other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Steelbear...it is not wrong. Read the original EQ literature about what a Shaman's design is. It's THEIR term that we are a jack of trades, not my own.<br />
<br />
The original EQ literature said no such thing. I still have my book that came with the original EQ game. This is all it says about classes:<br />
<br />
Now to choose your occupation. Are you a sword-swinging Warrior, or a spell casting Mage? An evil Shadowknight or a stalwart Paladin? There are 14 Classes to choose from (not all Races can be every Class, however). The classes are: Bard, Cleric, Druid, Enchanter, Magician, Monk, Necromancer, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Shadowknight, Shaman, Warrior, and Wizard.<br />
<br />
That's it. That is the entire section in the original EQ manual about classes. The thing you are probably referring to is from one of Dima's (I think that's the name of the company) Everquest Player's Guides. Those are not written by Verant or Sony. That is a separate company that makes manuals for lots of different computer games, and incidentally that manual was full of innaccurate information and speculation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">You guys have trouble not thinking in extremes I guess, so you think because I say we should be equal in healing as a druid that means that's all I think we should do. I never said that.<br />
<br />
I am not thinking in extremes, Steelbear. I have been saying that the &quot;attention to healing&quot; as our ONLY matter is an extreme I am not comfortable accepting. It is not a well rounded approach to a once well rounded class.<br />
<br />
I also find it hard to believe you're as old school as you say, when you are rooted in this slower/debuffer role. Maybe you've just been doing it so long since Kunark, you have forgotten what it was like before Turgurs. I didnt forget.

It was a single tool. Most people grouped with shamans for healing and buffs.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, if you understood the implications of slow while you were in the &quot;healer&quot; role that you claim you were, then you understood what made your role as healer different than a druid's role as healer: amounts of mana available for healing. This first took on it's appearance before we received the cannibalize spell at level 24. As I already admitted, it was between levels 19 and 24 that I started using slow on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
Also of note, except for Half Elves, all other druid races had a larger base wisdom pool than any shaman race did.<br />
<br />
Shaman base WIS pool<br />
Barbarian: 80<br />
Troll: 70<br />
Ogre: 77<br />
<br />
Druid base WIS pool<br />
Half Elf: 70<br />
Halfling: 90<br />
Human: 85<br />
Wood Elf: 90<br />
<br />
Now, couple that with the newbiesque decisions many of us made when distributing our &quot;other&quot; available stat points and there is a widened gap between the truly old school Shaman and truly old school Druids. In the first &quot;Official Players Guide&quot; for EQ, Druids were encouraged to consider their important attributes to be Stamina for building hitpoints and Wisdom for learning new spells. Shaman were encouraged to consider Stamina to keep hit points up, and Wisdom and Charisma to contribute to their natural magics. Yes, it said Charisma! lol. So, if any Shaman in the early days used the players guide as a tool in setting up their character, Shaman who tossed base points into Charisma, further depleted their base mana pool in comparison to a Druid who already had the upper hand in that department.<br />
<br />
Druids who snared and overnuked in settings that were not wide open spaces died fast due to their weak AC , smaller frames (less HP), and overaggro. A well played Druid had to keep his DPS in check if he wanted to remain alive for any length of time. Such Druids often opted to heal so that their mana would be put to &quot;good use&quot; in a group setting. They could always go on a nuking spree when they opted to solo and had the room to run around. Druids may have been big soloers, but I hung out with many druids who like to group and do dungeons for faster exp gain.<br />
<br />
You know what my job was there? I was a healer. The raid leader who I raided with most often always gave me a group of rangers or robes, and my job was to keep them alive.<br />
<br />
Rangers who could help heal themselves and robes who had only a handful of hit points. Sounds like your raid leader knew your actual healing capabilities and planted you in the correct position.<br />
<br />
Yes, I would throw out a slow or a malosi, if I could get one to stick, but then I was healing. <br />
<br />
Yes, robes and rangers, not warriors.<br />
<br />
And the druids did the same thing, because we had exactly the same heals. <br />
<br />
Steelbear, we had &quot;exactly the same heals&quot; but we didn't have &quot;exactly the same&quot; mana pools or mana efficiency! Therein lies one of THE biggest differences between Druid and Shaman healing back then. I've already described it for you above. I've told you before and I'll tell you again, tunnel vision is your enemy.<br />
<br />
Honestly, if you are so old school, I think you have just forgotten what is was like back then. It was a long time ago, and it has been a long time that we've been pidgeonholed into the slower role.<br />
<br />
I've never been &quot;pigeonholed&quot; into the slower role, Steelbear. I've also never been &quot;pigeonholed&quot; into the healer role. That is what I am lobbying against with all of my might. I do not, AS A SHAMAN, want to be &quot;pigeonholed&quot;. I want my overall utility to remain IN TACT. I slowed because it made the group more efficient. I slowed to keep clerics and enchanters alive when they got healing or mezz breaking aggro. I slowed to help reduce the downtime because a cleric would cry oom if the mob wasn't slowed. I slowed because it was BETTER FOR THE GROUP to do so, not because I was &quot;pigeonholed&quot; into doing it. Enchanters could slow, too, but back then...they couldn't survive the aggro of mezzer AND slower AND tash'r. They were robe wearing pansies who broke like wet toilet paper if a mob so much as sneezed in their direction. Bards were painfully underrated as a class back then, too. I admittedly didn't spend much time with them until later in my Shaman career.<br />
<br />
It took them a long time to figure out how to subvert Turgur's effect on the game - but now they have. So we should be restored to being a full priest again, not some half-assed wanna be 'priest' who can barely outheal a hybrid (and is outbuffed by a couple of them).<br />
<br />
Shaman were never a full priests. Druids were never a full priests. The only priest who was a full priest is a Cleric. That's the truth. We are priests, yes, but a cleric has always been the purest priest of us all. I don't want to see that changed in any way. <br />
<br />
Turgur's Insects made us super powerful when Kunark went live. No one can deny that. Turgur's was so powerful that it was a near ghetto mez. Those days are LONG gone, though and it didn't happen just because of GoD. <br />
<br />
And, no, Otoole, they arent listed in order of who's the first, second, and third best healer. It is alphabetical, just like every other item tag in the game.<br />
<br />
Steelbear, of course it's alphabetical. Don't be so obtuse. However, it ALSO (key word here) happens to be the order in which these 3 particular classes have been seen in healing ability for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Druids and shamans were once identical in healing spell lines - same spells, same level, remember old girl? We should be equal again.<br />
<br />
The surface healing spell names and their mana cost has mezzed you. You didn't pay attention to HOW druids healed in superior manner to shaman even back in the very old content. <br />
<br />
I do see your point, Otoole. You are saying we need more than just healing upgrades, and I agree. I gave you two of my ideas on where we could use improvement in other areas in my last post. The thing is, the improvements we need in other areas are minor ones. Our healing needs a major improvement. <br />
<br />
They'll only seem minor until you can heal better and contribute not much else IN GoD, which is the point of SOE's interaction with this community. They want to know what's &quot;wrong&quot; with Shaman's in GoD content...and the Shaman's are saying we can't heal, we barely debuff, we offer unacceptable DPS, and our buffs don't mean much on the high end of the scale. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't call those issues minor.<br />
<br />
The thing I have 'tunnel vision' about is squashing this stupid idea among shamans that we dont deserve to be equal in healing to druids.<br />
<br />
What is silly is that you can't see the difference between Druids and Shaman that has ALWAYS been in place, Steelbear. You are asking to become something we weren't--equal to Druids in active healing. We were equal to Druids based on damage reduction of the mob + our healing abilities. You are asking SOE to ignore the first half of what balanced us with them. It was more than simply spell line-ups and names that made up each classes healing prowess. That's tunnel vision. Sorry, it's true.<br />
<br />
Every time I see these threads about what improvements we need in healing, everybody wants to shortchange themself because of these outdated perceptions about slow and cannibalize making us too powerful.

<br />
While that might be the case, Steelbear, I don't want to LOSE one aspect of my Shaman in favor for another. I don't want to trade in my debuffing role for the sake of better heals. I would really like to see some &quot;creative&quot; and &quot;different&quot; bebuffing ideas that would keep my Shaman fun, while still improving my very lame, very weak, current healing status. Slow is a debuff that has been effectively reduced in power. That's FINE. Now, lets see what &quot;else&quot; can be done to debuff Mob01 in a way that doesn't have the same uber godlike status of slow...but is BENEFICIAL to actively having ME, a Shaman, in the group. If my healing improves...even equalled to a Druid, the Druid will STILL be chosen over me in a GoD expedition due to snare, evac, and nukes.<br />
<br />
Versatility is key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">So, by your own reasoning, even when we had exactly the same heals as druids, we still werent as good as they were at healing. So by what reasoning do you cling to the idea that we should not have the same heals now?<br />
<br />
By the way, I knew you'd pick out the part about me being primary healer for rangers and robes. Duh, of course I healed light armored/hit point people. The clerics healed the big tanks. The druids were backup healers or primary healers in groups similiar to mine. The part I left out was that I was usually also the raid's slower because the raid leader knew I would do both. Even before Plane of Hate, there were always plenty of druids in Fear, yet he never put a cleric or druid in my group to help heal. Why is that? I mean, clearly why put a third-rate healer (as you claim) as the main healer and give him another raid function, even in a lightweight group?<br />
<br />
There are no 'full priests' and 'half priests'. There are just priests. Clerics happen to be the best healer of those three - a point with which I have no contention, nor have I ever begrudged them of that fact. Dont even try to attribute that notion to me, because it'd just be another misrepresentation of what I've been saying, which you seem quick to do.<br />
<br />
I do have issues with having inferior heals than a druid, when that wasnt the case when I created my shaman. I've been saying it for a long time, and it's only recently that it's become apparent to many of the rest of the shamans as a problem.<br />
<br />
I do have issues with other areas of our class as well, but they are not as major as the shortcomings we have in healing. Which as a priest, is a pretty big area to have a major shortcoming, dont you think? Quit trying to insinuate that I only care about healing issues, because you're wrong.<br />
<br />
Will we get our heals upgraded back to the level we once were - equal to druids? No, of course we wont. Because all the shamans who think like you do that we dont deserve to be as good as druids. The people who post things like 'I wouldnt want to step on the toes of druids'. Even when, by your own argument, we werent as good as druids even when we had exactly the same heals. It's all a load of crap. We are priests every bit as much as a druid. And the very same excuse that was always given to justify druids healing advantage is exactly what's happening to us now, and you cant even see it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">People keep saying our healing sucks.  Then you hear some of the same people say our heals have always been less because the difference slow makes.  I agree with that, shaman do not need to be such strong healers when we can land a 75% slow on a mob.  Because after slow, the mob is just not going to do nearly the same amount of damage.  <br />
<br />
That is why I agree with Otoole, give me a better slow and other tools to kill a mob and I won't have to heal as much.  If a mob dies 5 seconds faster, due to DD or better DoT, and does 20% less damage, due to slow, then I don't need a much better heal.  I didn't sign up to be the main healer in groups.  I was intrigued by being able to debuff, then slow, then send in Dogdog, then DoT, then get in the mix and melee, all while spot healing and root parking some adds.  I know in those situations that I am not the highest DPS, best crowd control, or best healer, but I don't want to be the best at those things.  And I understand that all these things can't ALWAYS be done by me (especially the higher I go), but I don't won't to be relegated to Malo, then slow, then start spamming the hell out of my quick-heal hotkey.  Or sitting there like a cleric medding and waiting to cast the next CH.<br />
<br />
Give us a slow that is say 70% with a -45% resist modifier.  It is a bit worse percentage-wise than Turgur's, but it has built in Malo.  And since we are shaman we should naturally be better slowers than anyone else, so make it where we automatically don't get mitigated as much as other slowers.  If a beastlord gets mitigated 50% by a mob, then an enchanter might only get mitigated 45%, and a SHAMAN (THE MASTERS OF SLOW, DAMNIT!) would only get mitigated 35% or something similar.  Just make our slows unique to the Shaman class once again.  <br />
Once we mitigate a mob's damage by so much, we wouldn't need huge healing upgrades.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Sorry, after reading again, it sounded like these ideas are all I thought were good ideas.  I am not saying to give us these and only these.  Hell, it doesn't have to even be these, but give us something special again the makes us useful and distinct without turning us into a druid or cleric clone.  Could be better slows, and minor heal upgrades.  Minor slow upgrades and better DPS.  Minor heal upgrades, minor slow upgrades, and minor DPS improvements.  It doesn't have to be where all we get is one BIG healing improvement to be better shaman.  Be creative and not just cookie-cutter.</div></div><hr />

Mana pools. That's my reasoning. Druids ONCE had superior mana pools to ours. They no longer do. That difference between our classes has been significantly reduced if not eliminated altogether. If we get their heals and our debuffs and maintain similar mana pools, like we have now, I think that the balance will be lost.<br />
<br />
If I recall correctly, my memory is pretty fuzzy on this, so perhaps this will spark someone to remember if I am accurate or not...druids had more +WIS available loot drops to them than we did in the genesis of EQ. Or, at least, they were not as rare of a drop. I just simply recall Druids having way more mana than I did and the alleged &quot;balance issue&quot; for that very thing was that we got to cannibalize. Well, that issue--mana regeneration, is not as big an issue *across the classes* as it once was for several reasons all of which should be pretty obvious...including the popularity of obtaining a PoK MGB mana regen spell before heading out to adventure.<br />
<br />
Even before Plane of Hate, there were always plenty of druids in Fear, yet he never put a cleric or druid in my group to help heal. Why is that?<br />
<br />
RANGER HEAL, that's why.<br />
<br />
I mean, clearly why put a third-rate healer (as you claim) as the main healer and give him another raid function, even in a lightweight group?<br />
<br />
Because that lightweight group of robes aren't *often* getting hit (if they control aggro and mana use properly) and the rangers who *might* be getting hit because they are right in front of the mob smacking it can help heal themselves until you get it slowed. Then once slow landed, you just saved them some HP each mob swing. That's why. <br />
<br />
I remember being in PoF and being able to play healer in my groups of pansies, too, or at least being assigned a Paladin assistant. I also clearly recall anyone who overaggroed in my group turned off attack for a time or quit casting to REDUCE their aggro so that I could heal them effectively. Now, it wasn't because I was such an *aswesome* healer that I was permitted to heal. It's because I was with a group of folks who understood the strengths and weaknesses I bring as a Shaman and played their role WITHIN those paramaters. We also had people who KNEW how to see who had aggro and could heal across group barriers to effectively keep people *not of their own group* alive. Thinking on your feet in PoF was a must. Same for PoH.<br />
<br />
Now, today, my strengths and my weaknesses as a Shaman do not AFFORD me the opportunity to be in a group of people who play *within those paramaters*...in GoD content. I simply don't have any strengths at my disposal. My debuffs aren't as effective as need be, my healing is for crap, and my DPS doesn't contribute what another classes could. I'm easier to be *passed over* for another class because what is NEEDED in GoD, I can't provide.<br />
<br />
So, for this reason, as I have stated I would like to be ENABLED to heal better. HOWEVER, I will STILL be weak in other areas and as a result could STILL be passed over a for a Druid because they bring not ONLY healing to the group, but snare, evac, and DPS. <br />
<br />
Healing upgrades alone ARE NOT going to make me a &quot;better Shaman&quot; in GoD content. They will help, there is no question...but I will only be able to be considered for the goup IF a cleric or a druid cannot be found. Well, that's an unlikely event on Innoruuk. Druids spawn in abundance there.</div></div><hr />

- divine arbitration (form of heal spell, not buff debuff or damage)<br />
- res<br />

I will concede that a necro could be grouped in with the utility folks...but it would be a stretch. They are often considered DPS in scope. Those particular spell gems you listed are not often memmed, save snare/feign perhaps. If another snarer mezzer is present, necro snare/mez is unused. Even Bard mez is preferable to Necro mez. Feign is self only, merely for the (grouping) purpose of self aggro reduction. Feign has little if anything to do with actual group efficiency. It has everything to do with DPS, which is a category unto its own.<br />
    Blablabla . if a chanter is present ,shaman don't haste...ect Same for snare and mez. His fd can serve to pull and they can kite add really well <br />
<br />
Wizard<br />
- stun<br />
- snare<br />
- evac<br />
- DD <br />
<br />
Sorry, Wizzie stun/snare is not the reason he is invited to any group. DPS is his function, a separate category, although the evac/snare IS a nice feature that he brings to the table.<br />
        And you are invited for your stat buf (yeah you have listed them ) ? <br />
<br />
Magician<br />
- CoH<br />
- stun (via pet)<br />
- Malosinia<br />
- multitude of summoned items<br />

- charm when possible (really rare though)</div></div><hr />

Bickering solves nothing.<br />
If we cant agree what OUR class needs, how will they begin correct it?<br />
<br />
Lets stop the pissing contest of who was here first and try getting along.  I see alot of valid points and agree with most of them.  Theres no needs to jump down throats because you dont see eye to eye and &quot;think&quot; you have been around longer or know more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I didn't add those other classes, someone else did. I used the Druid, Enchanter, Bard, Shaman as the &quot;Utility&quot; group and admitted that a Mage should have been included in that group...while I overlooked them.<br />
<br />
I still disagree that a Necro, a Wizard, and a Cleric are considered &quot;Utility&quot;. They have very specific roles--healer or DPS. A Cleric is in the group for the express purpose of healing. The Wizard and the Necro are in the group for the express purpose of DPS. <br />
<br />
The Necro is the most questionable of the group because he CAN border on the utility end of the scale. However, so many necros are self-centered...having spent way too many hours soloing. ;) There are many well played Necros on Innoruuk who know how to be a group member and assist their teammates in a variety of ways (thus the border utility class), but there are just as many &quot;other&quot; Necros who will not twitch--its too much bother for them, will not pull--they want to stand in the back load up DoT's then FD, and will not transfer HP--they don't have it memmed and aren't going to swap something out, and stand there telling me to keep Regen on them and heal them if they drop too low! <br />
<br />
Sorry, maybe it REALLY is just a matter of meeting a lot of crappy Necros in my time. However, I have met some of the BEST played Necros who revealed that a Necro was so much more than a soloer that I was surprised. I hadn't encountered that brand of necro until much, much later in my Shaman career (long after I learned to appreciate the Bard). It could very well be that I have a grudge against the crappy necro population, but I am a HUGE FAN of the multitasker Necro and would invite them in a heartbeart for ANY encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Otoole Frostypants</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Apothian, that whole &quot;discussion&quot; started not to prove who has been around longer, in all fairness. That discussion came about because, as I have pointed out, the game is designed to be more like it USED to be at it's Genesis than when Kunark altered it's flavor. As a result, Shaman need to be more in tune with how we USED to be than when Kunark altered our &quot;role&quot;.<br />
<br />
We became &quot;the slower&quot; as that's what we were famous for. We were ALWAYS &quot;slowers&quot; but Kunark's brand of slow made it really freaking obvious. lol. Even in my career of &quot;the slower&quot; I could do more than &quot;slow&quot;. I was, in essence a debuffer, healer, with added damage to tack on. Once Kunark came into existance, Shaman looked &quot;godly&quot; due to the fact that we were able to stand up for the fights that went on for long periods of time. In all fairness, even we Shaman didn't realize we could &quot;do&quot; that until Kunark revealed it. In the old days, preKunark, fights didn't last THAT long. I've been saying, and still am saying, fights were shorter...more like they are now. Only NOW, it's intensified.<br />
<br />
In GoD, I am not what I USED to be. I am not much of a debuffer, I can't heal worth a damn, and my damage doesn't add anything to the encounter because the encounter doesn't last as long as my damage dealing spells require in order to &quot;kick in&quot;. That damage factor is more like it was in the PreKunark game phase, but still not quite tuned right. <br />
<br />
There are two problems here. First, we now KNOW as Shaman what kind of power our DoT's offer. We didn't quite &quot;know&quot; it before Kunark because fights didn't last 2 min on average in a group. We knew it was useful for soloing, of course, but grouping the Shaman in Kunark revealed our &quot;long haul&quot; design...and I, for one, didn't complain about it. :) Secondly, while mob encounters are faster than they have been since Kunark, they are shorter than they were PreKunark. 1 min on average PreKunark gave us &quot;time&quot; to do the things that helped our parties...debuff, heal, add some damage. In GoD, mob encounters, on average, are lasting approximately 30 seconds. I can't &quot;do&quot; what I &quot;used to do&quot; (even if I WERE effective at it now, which I'm not) in 30 seconds. I don't have the equipment at my disposal to debuff, to heal, and to add some damage.<br />
<br />
This whole thread originate based on the cry from some members of this community to pick ONE THING that was the &quot;most important&quot; to us that is wrong and go to SOE with it and ask for a fix. Well, that ONE THING (healing) isn't what is &quot;most important&quot; to ME...and apparently to some other people of the Shaman community.<br />
<br />
There is a fraction of the population (I don't know what size fraction) that thinks it's MOST IMPORTANT that a Shaman still be able to provide MULTIPLE services to any group they join. Fix healing--HURRAY--I will be very happy. Leave debuffing and DPS in the toilet and I will be bored with my patch healer role. That's been my point all along and I'm sticking to it.<br />
<br />
If I am the ONLY Shaman who feels this way, so be it (but I don't believe that I am). I should have the same privelages available to me for voicing my opinion as the rest of you do. If anyone is of the opinion that varying opinions make us &quot;look bad&quot; to Sony, too bad, really. Maybe it's GOOD for SOE to see just &quot;how&quot; Shaman play Shaman (a variety of ways) and manage to use THAT information to keep us VARIETAL!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I'm currently passed over when doing Ikki group raids.  Why?  Because of my heals.  Group encounters at set with DPS in mind.  End bosses aren't slowable so the groups stack heavy with DPS classes.  If the group can take out the boss then they don't need a shaman for the rest.  <br />
<br />
You know what me and the four other shaman in my guild get asked to do?  Sit at the zone in's of the various Ikki trials and buff people as needed.  If and when they can sneak us in for a flag they will.<br />
<br />
Ugh, that blows Forty.   I've only done Vexd, but not as main healer, and only as co-healer when I was with a druid.  It was fun when it worked, but it was a chore and people would end up dying at times (or group wipe-out).  <br />
<br />
I know if I had better healing, even if I weren't a main healer, people would feel alot more secure knowing their hit points actually go up when my heal lands.  Also, if I can't be a main healer, I know people would be more secure if I had competitive dps for these encounters, whether it be larger nukes or quicker high impact dots or heck a real pet.</div></div><hr />

And you're making an awful lot of assumptions about mana pools. Who says the average shaman's mana pool is equal to the average druid, even today? I dont have my wisdom maxxed? Do you? Most shamans focus on hps and AC before wisdom. Yes, I try to get wisdom also, but it's a balancing act finding the best hp and AC gear as well.

Whoa!  Calm down there killa!   He didnt say he was talking himself out of heal upgrades. In fact, he stated twice that heals alone would probably not be enough.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hes stating that our DPS is also heavily lacking in quick enounters lasting less than 60 seconds.  I for one, agree with him.  If SoE did give us better heals to hopefully counter the massive amounts of damage the the tanks are receiving is that going to be enough?  So, now we can at least begin to help a group.  Wheres our DPS?  A 675hp nuke?<br />
I concur Otoole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, Steelbear, it's clear that you DON'T understand what I'm saying. You continue to very candidly state that you want the EXACT SAME spells that Druids received because we once had the EXACT SAME spells that they did. I have very clearly indicated that I believe that is a HORRIBLE idea.<br />
<br />
I don't believe I should suck at healing. I've never said that and never will. I have said and will continue to say that I should not heal in the same manner that a Druid does. I NEVER HAVE and still SHOULD NOT.<br />
<br />
My foundation for this argument has been the ever apparent differences between the Druid class and the Shaman class. When we DID have the same spells, we had different base WIS and mana pool sizes. That made up for the fact that we could cannibalize and they could not. THAT kept us &quot;balanced&quot; as healing classes who were to remain below the healing power of the PURE PRIEST, the Cleric. Now, whether you believe it or not, mana pools have evened out and are far more similar when comparing the high end Druid with the high end Shaman. They still can't cannibalize, we still can. We all basically wear the same &quot;crack buffs&quot;. Your giving us the same healing spells as them would give us an edge over them (purely in the healing department) that we haven't had before....nor should we now. <br />
<br />
THEY had the edge in healing before, even though it was &quot;balanced&quot; in a way that appeared to make us equal. They snared...and then they could start healing (or whatever else was necessary/available). We had multiple debuffs to do...then we could heal. If those debuffs weren't applied, our mana was quickly spent on healing and then downtime would ensue while we cannibalized back what was blown away on resisted debuffs and healing.<br />
<br />
I know you had to have experienced this, Steelbear. Have you been memblurred?</div></div><hr />
