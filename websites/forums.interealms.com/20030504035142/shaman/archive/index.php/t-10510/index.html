<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys, I was wondering, if I'm always broke, is it best to save up for Quiescence and never get topor? or do lvl 65's use both at the same time?<br />
<br />
Also if my guild is probably only going to do old world content and probably not much else for a while (everyone is happy with that) then should I get to 60, do AAs and get topor + malo instead of going to lvl 65? <br />
<br />
My feeling is that levels &gt;&gt; All, but then again, spending a year killing things with getting any xp or very little would suck.<br />
<br />
thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Quiescence is torpor with out the side effects. There no recast time on them or anything so i can't see any reason why you'd use both. Don't have Quiescence yet (only spell i'm missing damm it) but i plan to move torpor to the back of my book with all the rest of my old spells.<br />

If you've got the basics for aa, ie cann v, and can get  access to higher tier planes then i'd say go for 65 if your not gonna be able to make it past PoV/PoS if that far I'd probably stay 60 or maybe 62 and grind aa. Since you say your going to be doing mostly old world content I would probably stay 60 or go for 62 at the most.</div></div><hr />
