<p>Depends on what server you are on. From what I've seen on this board and others is that on some servers it goes for up to 20k but on my server(Tarew Marr) 3k tops. Basically it boils down to how much would you take to give up insta-invis I guess.<br />

<p>I picked up mine for 3.5k a day after the patch.  I see them going for 5k now.  Don't recall ever seeing one as high as 20k, which is absurd and I even had a hard time getting myself to pay 3.5, but I enjoy and glad I bought it now.<br />
<br />
btw.. this is on Tholuxe Paells.  also, I saw a Crclet of ShadowS going for 750pp and no-one was buying it <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Heh, on Cazic, the day after the patch one went for 75k in trades.  That's the highest I've heard of.</p>

<p>I was talking to someone in EC awhile back that was selling one.  He was being offered about 20Kpp and wasn't taking it.  I, of course, do not have 20kpp so there was no chance of my acquiring it.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Priceless.<br />
<br />
To get me to part with it would take one of 2 things:<br />
<br />
1. That I somehow obtain advance info that the old circlets will be nerfed or,<br />
2.  Someone offers me an absolutely obscene amount in trades.  I am talking *obscene*.    CoF, escort to a Sword of Pain, BE Breastplate and Legs...a combination of those would do it.  You get the picture.<br />
<br />
Perhaps my point of view will change once I get to the mid to upper 50's, but right now it is priceless.<br />

<br />
I couldn't agree more, Baelor.  I was personally offered out of the blue 52K for it, and turned him down flat.  This thing has opened the world of Norrath to me in a way that nothing else I buy can do, and has increased my game fun immensely.<br />
<br />
Of course, anything has its price, but 52K wasn't even close.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Ditto...<br />
<br />
I got mine about a month before the patch.  It was a short invis run in there and then I got lucky on first pop.  Too me it is priceless.  I use it non stop.  It is easily the most used piece of equipment (non weapon) I own.  It would take a LOT to get it out of my hands.<br />

<p>I don't know what I'd trade mine for... we'd have to be talkin AoW quality loots tho. That ring would be a nice start... It's not a replaceable item though... rings of destruction still drop.<br />

<p>Circlet of Shadow, Jboots, FD.<br />
<br />
Those make SK's uncontested travelling machines.<br />
Esp combined with shrink potions, bobbing corpse at lvl55, undead-invis, gate potions and the OT hammer and it gets better again.<br />
<br />
Getting from A-B is so easy for us - ever seen a couple of KOS warriors suck it in and do the KOS Kael train-dash from EW to WL zone hehehe.<br />

Everytime someone bitches about not having war abilities think of the poor saps relying on casters for safe travel. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Was sitting in EC tonight waiting for a ride and saw someone selling a prenerf circlet and some upper mid level SK gear...did a /who and it was a level 20 SK, definitely a twink judging by the stuff he was selling. I told a SK buddy in the guild to give the guy a tell and ask him what he wants for it. My buddy replied he only had 3k. I said ask anyway. The seller only asked for 2kpp! <img src="images/smilies/eek.gif" border="0" alt="">  I told my buddy he better be quick or I'm gonna buy the darn thing myself and bank it on an alt for safe keeping. In answer to the obvious question - yes, it was a prenerf, I saw the item myself after my buddy brought it.  <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
That's not to say I think circlets are only worth 2kpp. I certainly wouldn't sell mine for pp unless I had another lined up, tho I might trade it for a nice bp.<br />
<br />
Also saw a high level mage tonight selling an ebon mace for 15k OBO  That one was tempting...but I solo a lot so I'm kinda fond of the 15int on my Noc...<br />

<p>Everyone on EMarr is sure its worth 15k +  ....however, nobody has moved any for that much.   I bought mine last night for 4k and 2 diamonds (diamonds being the second hardest thing to move atm on EMarr) =)<br />

<p>the only, and for the hard of hearing, ONLY thing I would even consider trading my CoS for is a multi quested Soul Leech, as its the only thing keeping me from my epic.<br />
<br />
That should give you an idea as to what I value it at.<br />

<p>man you couldnt pay me enough for mine <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
Example....<br />
<br />
last night I decided to try going to cazic thule and collect fine steel weapons since its pretty empty and the HG's shut me out last time (6 kills 68pp)  So I get there and do a sense the dead to see if any crusaders are up (couple sks there hunting) and I get the ritualist pet on my target window.  So I /ooc to see if a shadowknight can get there safely and I'd kill it for them so he could loot.  Well no one was 30+ yet, so getting back would be a problem (would risk losing the caster in the maze)  So I say I'll be in the courtyard in a minute with it.  Target the lizard, whack it, and take off running while right-clicking.  Get him in the courtyard and kill him.  Bam decayed for an sk.  <br />
<br />
Then, some friends in the guild ask me what I'm up to and I tell em FS farm <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="">  so a couple come down and we head to the throne room to see whats up there, no one, so we thought maybe some ravenscale (most of us have rogue twinks <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""> )  And I think that kinda inflated our ego's at one point because we memmed our AoE's and I say "I'll go pull 5 or so".  well, the other guys did too....so I bring 5, the warrior brings 5, and the druid avalanched in the maze bringing god knows how many... heheh but they're all green so despite the warrior fighting at 2 bubs of health (yeah, its a pain in the arse to taunt off a sword of skyfire....) we killed maybe 20 at once.  Then we go to the AoF room for a bp or two.  All was going well, we'd pull the sewers and drop em easy, then the avatar would pop - no problems.  Well at one point we got careless and weren't watching the timer very closely.  So they keep pulling the sewers and I was about to say whens the room pop? when I see the Avatar start to beat on the warrior....All switch targets, AoF's at about half health, and despite my disease cloud, heart flutter, etc I cant keep aggro due to the SoS.  So warrior has like half a bub and starts running, (this is after the druid died...ht and a couple hits was all it took....) so we're doing circles now while the enc works on mezzing.  Warrior dies (I used ht to taunt off the last pop....) and I'm going toe to toe with the avatar.  He's maybe 2/3's health and I'm about there too but with 903 ac and most of my mana I should be fine right?  Well either in the last pull or a pop a judicator spawned and started healing our buddy the Avatar....yeah game over.  I tell the 2 casters left to gate (one made it, the other was stunned too much) and feigned getting ready for cr.  I /quit out to make sure theres no aggro and log back in ready to get off a VERY fast circlet click.  Log in, right click, and I'm safe.  get consent and return the group to the zoneline.  <br />
<br />
A cr made possible by this wonderful item <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt="">  just a shame this is how I feel useful anymore.....<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2" color="#FFFFFF"><br>

<p>Lol I remember about a month ago I would always see in guildchat any nec/SK need a circlet of shadows... and everytime it would go to a twink or mule... I wouldnt give mine up for anything I can tell you how many times I have been only one left to do a CR and FD combined with a circlet has made me untouchable.<br />
<br />
This piece of equipment has saved me from getting 400+ rezzes I cant imagine what it would be like to have invis drop in a KoS area like the middle of Kael and have to sit still and actually cast invis /gasp.<br />

<br />
If any of you know someone selling/trading one on Karana, I'll give an arm and a leg for an good Ol'circlet...<br />
<br />
As I moved from Druzzil to Karana, it was the single item I was really mad to lose.<br />
