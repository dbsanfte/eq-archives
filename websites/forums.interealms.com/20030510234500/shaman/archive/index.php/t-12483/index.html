<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all, decided to renew the old EQ account...been thinking about star wars galaxies sop much i just need to play a good MMORPG. So i renewed my accountbut have no idea where to hunt, Im a lvl 52 barb shammy w/o a jbb or epic(rather ghetto).<br />
Is Karnors still a good place to group?<br />
i have all the expansions up to luclin, just wondering where you all think i would be getting the best exp,i dont care if its soloing or grouping either, thanks for helping me get back into EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">right... whats this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">First go buy Planes of Power right now. <br />
<br />
Second head to hhk and solo to 54 then immediatly head to pop to level. Groups are easy to get there exp is amazing and well most old world zones are empty as can be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asthore McTavish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would invest in PoP and Loy. You should be able to get groups in dulak harbor at 52. Its steady xp and drops enough cash where you can start to get upgrades :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hehe thakns for the info bro, what should i solo in HHK?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zeuce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">lol yeah need to get rid of this totemic...i been roughin it too long</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Dulak Harbor would be great for you at your current level.  The mobs there only have about 2500 hps at most on average, are blue, and don't hit THAT hard anyway . . .plus they drop lewt which you are gonna need.  Also you get your quest piece for Stoicism (Mini Torpor, lvl 44, u need this spell badly) from drunken pirates there.  You must purchase LoY to get this spell, as the spell is obtained only by quest, and the scroll itself is NO DROP. <br />
<br />
That is what I would work on if I were you.  And once you feel up to it, take a partner and go to Crypt of Nadox for more fun and gather your ingredients for Blood of Nadox.  That's your other LoY quest spell, level 52 spell.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think that hunting in LoY is much easier than hunting in lower tier planes in PoP, and much more profitable money wise as well.  The stuff there randomly drops gems.  I have seen blue diamonds drop for instance.  Also iksar blood drops from iksars and I guess that sells well in bazaar to tradeskillers.  The exp per mob is less, but you can kill many mobs in the time it takes to kill one mob in PoP.  I would highly recommend heading to LoY to hunt in your 50's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh yah definilty get LoY for stoicism.<br />
<br />
At the least upgrade your totemic to jaundiced bone items which sell pretty cheap now except for the bp, legs, bracer.<br />
<br />
Other then that you making a magelo profile and posting here would be helpful as we could find some good cheap or easy to get upgrades for you then.</div></div><hr />
