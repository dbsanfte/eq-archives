Torpor with no negatives and all targets<br />
<br />
Druids should get the 75% heal if they REALLY need a upgrade<br />
<br />
for godsakes though, change torpor instead of adding a new spell for Shm that most likely would not get memmed instead of Torpor</div></div><hr />

It'll be a cold day in hell before i agree to something that makes druids better than me in groups and on raids.  <br />
<br />
Also I think you are thinking of just the lvl 60 shamans.  The druids would have  MAJOR advantage over 54-59 shamans.  I think that would really really really be a bad thing.  No thanks, poor idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shayman Quod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">A half version of no Negative Effects Torpor at 51-54<br />

Full version of No Negative Effect Torpor at 60<br />
<br />
<br />
This means that you have 1 heal spell memmed, that is affected by foci for cast speed, and no need to mem a stupid 10sec heal.<br />
<br />
Granted i could see the uses for it.. but they are raid only, any other time it would be of no use, personally i won't bother buying a CH type spell, cos i'd never be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Xp groups, 10 secs is WAY too long to be not doing something.<br />
Raids, yeah right, like i have enough room to mem this POS<br />
Solo, ok, you channel through a 10 sec spell, and then.. umm... recast it for the damge you have taken<br />
<br />
Cost, stop complaining about cost, yes it's an arm and a leg, but you are basically asking for a gimp spell that you &quot;might&quot; use once or twice a month, just because you don't want torpor to become better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Excuse me but I like having spell versatility. The existing drawbacks on torpor balance it nicely. However I would appreciate a spell I could cast outside of groups that actually did some good.  Also if you are 60 please do not forget this is aimed at helping those in the mid50s.<br />
<br />
I respectfully disagree, but try thinking about the class as a whole and not just yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like Torpor as it is coded - it's a good heal spell, with drawbacks.<br />
<br />
The serious problem with it, is the idiotic drop rate.  After all, when they were discussing Ancient spells, didn't VI say that every caster should be able to get every (normal) spell?  So WHY is a spell from the first frigging expansion so rare? :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ryasha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">umm....i am thinking of the shaman community as a whole. I am not 60, nor do I have the ultra rare spell. But giving us some dorky 75% spell is a gimp way out. Give us something different than the druids. I can't stand druids and I don't want to have yet another spell that is just like theirs. The difference in healing power isn't what bothers me. Fine....give the whiney druids their spell. Don't give us ours. Keep the two classes different! The different strats used by shamans and druids is a major reason the two are different. Verant needs to come up with something original. If they want something different, give beastlord spells to the druid and delete that class. Arg. I don't want a 75% heal. It just sounds ignorant. Rant, rant, rant...etc. The inclusion of this spell appears like a lame way to fix the worthless druid problem. Keep the classes different and keep the atmosphere of the game.....ok....i ramble too much and it is late and time to go home. Have a good night all! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes but torpor without side-effects would be TOO powerful, and would get nerfed swiftly.  The possible healing to mana ratio would be insane, and would cause even more chants of nerf from other classes. No thanks. <br />
<br />
A mini-torpor would be nice, but I feel that the new heal will help me more on raids where my guild is lacking in the healing department.  A mini-torpor would not. <br />
<br />
Like it or not we are still healers, and I would love to have anything that lets me fulfill that role better.</div></div><hr />

A 2k heal that takes 10 secs no negative effects, compared with 1.2k heal torpor that takes ~30 secs and drops DPS 80%, hmmm...<br />
<br />
Torpor rocks the house. I love it. But i am VERY HAPPY with getting a new heal.<br />
<br />
Can you drop your crusade please? Don't buy the spell. Don't mem it. Whinge about having to heal folks if you llike. But please don't assume you are thinking for me or the shaman class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you would not want it then do not buy it.  Simply put this is a more balanced alternative than a super torpor.<br />
<br />
Super Torpor in your example above would be insane because the ratio is 9:1.  This is assuming one had all the focus effects applied to it. Without any negative effects this spell would be unbalanced. The current effects on it keep it in check, which is good.</div></div><hr />

you don't know what you're talking about. <br />
The shaman class needs a good  DIRECT  heal just as much as the druid class does.  For the same reasons.  If you still don't know what these reasons are, you haven't experienced enough of the game to give your opinion and call it &quot;educated.&quot;  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">you cant get rid of the neg side effects of torpor with out taking it out of the shaman spell book.  I have the spell, its awesome. but if you made it just like celestial elxir its NOT a shaman spell.  Its more than fine as it is.  did you guys ever thing that its not meant to heal the tanks?   again if you took away the side effects it should not be a shaman spell<br />
<br />
on a side note it would be cool to be out of group in some respects, i can also understand why a spell (even though can be clicked off) that snares the target cant be castabale on anyone.  also as the lazy shaman i know in raid situation as only shaman if i could cast it on everyone i would be chain casting torpor.<br />
<br />
all in all, i think the 75% heal if it even goes live will be very interesting and effect the game in some ways we cant picutre but we can not and should not change the way torpor works.  but the drop rate is another story.  and the idea of a mini torpor i am mixed on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Removing the negatives of torpor would not solve the basic problem of shamans being completely inadequate raid healers.<br />
<br />
Can still only put 1 torpor at a time on someone, so stacking is an issue, and torpor is WAY WAY too slow a heal to keep up with any kind of serious damage output that your MT would be taking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">a modified torpor would be a cel elixir type ratio<br />
and it would be a new spell, not a modification to our normal torpor(at least i'd hope, because that 1 spell along with c5 is keeping me afloat:) <br />
<br />
why would this be so overpowering?<br />
we'd get increased casting cost as well.<br />
<br />
the idea is, we're unable to heal outside grp unless we use sheal/cblast, which has a rather ridiculous ratio and combined casting time if all you wanna do is heal a cleric or some riposte dmg, we're practically unable to heal up a fully buffed warrior outside grp.<br />
<br />
heh, would be amusing if dotheals were made to stack :) so, here we are, 15 clr/shm's chaining our elixirs to keep mt up! :p(assuming mr mt lives 6 secs of course :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Cel elixir is 1550/300 = 5.17 HPs per mana.<br />
Torpor is 1200/200 = 6 HPs per mana.<br />
<br />
You want a better spell efficiency wise than the clerics get combined with our ability to cannibalize and NO side effects? Can't see that ever happening.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way, the new spell as on test would be almost the same ratio as the clerics' cel elixir at 4.8 takes less than half the time to do the job at 10 secs and heals almost 400 HPs more. AND we have better mana regen than clerks by an order of magnitude.<br />
<br />
Are you seriously saying you thought this through before you posted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Please remember:<br />
1) not all of us are 60...<br />
2) not all of us have torpor<br />
<br />
I group with RL friends (a 60 war, a 59 druid and myself 58 shammy) on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
When fighting in HS, due to the harm touches, we do have to slow the pulls as the healing efficiency against HT mobs is slower.. when the druid gets 60 - natures recovery heals more but the mana efficiency of NR is worse than chloroblast.<br />
It's mana efficiency (or mana regen) rather than the amount healed per cast that's the issue - to get the tank from biserk (our queue to start healing) to say 75% health takes a lot of chloroblasts..<br />
<br />
Either way for me, at 58, a larger chloroblast efficency heal or a mini-torpor would be useful in that scenario. The tank would prefer that their be no side effects so that does leave us with a insta CH type heal..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">To Carrieanne:<br />
<br />
Heal the tank earlier ... waiting for him to be down to 2 bubs health is a cleric thing to do (cause they have CH).<br />
CB is crappy to heal good tanks cause you barely see their HP rising. Use SupHeal if time is not an issue. But Regrowth on tank to keep him up on health.<br />
<br />
I cannot see Verant removing the negativ effects on Torpor. And until those new downgraded CHs for druid and shaman hit the other servers I won't argue about those any more. Let them test and find out if those are balanced or not.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Hey Landdragon, I 100% disagree with your assessment.  The Shaman class does NOT need a larger direct heal &quot;just as much&quot; as the Druid Class.<br />
<br />
I have 60 Shaman, and 60 Druid.<br />
<br />
There is not a single doubt in my mind that the druid needs it MORE.<br />
<br />
Why?  2 Real Simple Answers.<br />
<br />
1) Shamans generally heal LESS than Druids.  We have one of the games most powerful spells.  SLOW.  We slow the mob, and then the mob does less damage.  Hence we need to Heal Less.<br />
<br />
2) Mana Regen.  Currently Natures Touch and Chloroblast are the same ratio.  Shaman mana regen is so much more than a Druids (or Clerics) that we can afford to cast multiple smaller spells to heal the same total that Clerics ((or Druids if test changes go live)) do with larger spells.<br />
<br />
Usually, I find that most shamans who think they need to heal as well as a druid, are not playing thier class to its ultimate potential.  ((IE: they usually dont use slow and cann enough))<br />
<br />
Here's a trick to try one time.  Get some friends together.  Play main healer.  Level 55 to 59.  ((Both Druids and Shamans would be using Chloroblast.))  Now try to play for 1 Hour, without SLOWING or CANNING at all.  See how effective your friends are.<br />
Thats the life of a druid.  Then do same group again, same place, and use cann and slow.  Watch how many more times your group goes up in power.<br />
<br />
When my shaman was 59, he duoed Gantru Dralknr with a 60 Monk.  I couldnt even come close to doing that with a 60 druid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i'd like to have the new CH. i don't usually group with sub-60's on my main, but it's about time those people can do harder things without a cleric. i clearly remember xp'ing in my mid 50's in sebilis 1.5 years ago....no way could a shaman do efficient healing in rh(crypt), disco2, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hi corlathist<br />
<br />
Landragoran was probably talking about raid usage of those CHs. I agree totally that a druid needs those heals a lot more when they group (either duo or more), since they lack the shamans most powerful tool eg. Slow.<br />
When it comes to raiding, the lvl 60 Torpor Shaman is reduced to torporing his own group while all other shamans struggle with CB right now. In this situation I don't see why a druid should heal more with the same mana than a shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Nirtox - hm.. if you have the time, wouldn't using the more mana efficient CB be better? My thinking is that although you loose a few mana standing whilst casting, the mana gained by using CB over SH would outwiegh that lost by not sitting..<br />
<br />
I normally have group regrowth running, bear, cabbage and slow all mobs that are pulled..<br />
<br />
The tank does have reasonable AC (full SS, epics).. so I suppose we'll have to be boring and reduce the speed of the pulling :/<br />
<br />
The main reason for mentioning this HS experience is that: it's noticable not having a cleric (their mana efficiency for healing with CH) or just a bard or enchanter (regen).. we can easily chew through mobs at a faster rate that you'd expect (ie more than 25% faster).<br />
<br />
So the question is: is something broken if with 3 players we can kill X mobs/min whilst with four players (an extra cleric/bard/enc) we can kill more than (4/3)X mobs/min ? compared to what you'd expect of just (4/3)X mobs/min? <br />
<br />
Perhaps this is what they are attempting to balance?<br />
<br />
corlathist - I'd be happy to hear your suggestions for improving my group's efficiency.</div></div><hr />

Don't know about you guys, but I never considered myself a &quot;raid healer&quot;, nor do I want to be.  I've got enough other things to deal with, rather than trying to do the cleric's job.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is 60.   Not everyone has Topor.<br />
<br />
Whether Topor is good or not still doesn't eliminate the fact that in the 50s shaman and druids can't even do a secondary job of healing.<br />

<br />
Tal, no flames intended, so please don't take offense.<br />
<br />
What level are you?<br />
<br />
The post 50 game, especially as you get higher, changes drastically.<br />
<br />
I was able to function as main healer for a group, and even easier for duoing with a monk friend, up to 51.  At that time, two things were holding me back - Superior Heal was still a 53rd lvl spell, and Velious had just come out (critters with massive hp).  With Sup Heal, I could have kept on as the healer.<br />
<br />
However - after 55th, it gets even tougher.  Not because of my &quot;limited healing abilities&quot;, but because critters are so dern tough!  Right now, as a 60th Shaman with Torpor, I will not do anything really risky without AT LEAST another Druid or Shaman in the group, preferably a Cleric.<br />
<br />
Why?  Because one bad fight,  too many resisted Turgors, and I'm a dead Shaman.  Even with Torpor, 300hp per 6 seconds doesn't do crap when the unslowed, very pissed mob is ripping me to shreds.   However, add one other healer to the group, even with Chloroblast, and I'm happy - because that other person can keep me alive until that mob is slowed, and the threat is effectively nullified.<br />
<br />
Adding this heal to Shaman won't change that.  And any 55th Shaman or Druid, only with Chloroblast, is an effective secondary healer - why?  Because you only have to keep the person alive until the Cleric can toss a big heal.  Yes, it's possible.  My guilds (current) strategy is for all shaman/druid to spam heal the MT at the start of a fight, while the CH cycle gets rolling.<br />
<br />
And I'll add to what you have to say.  Not every 60th has Torpor.  My guild has killed a lot of mobs that can drop it - Sev, Gore, Tal, Trak, Seb Prot, Jumpy, etc. - and we've only gotten one copy.  The drop rate is a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Cush:<br />
<br />
No worries, no offense taken :)<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 56 and most the tanks in my guild are 55 - 59.  The point I was trying to make and you emphasised is with chloroblast all you can do it keep someone alive until the cleric's CH goes off.<br />
<br />
This is not acceptable.  Currently a group* for me consists of sitting around until we get a cleric, we go kill stuff until the cleric has to camp and then we sit around again single pulling trash until we get a replacement cleric.  We should be able to achieve something similar but not as effective with another form of healing but that is just not possible.  That is a problem that needs to be fixed.<br />
<br />
Currently, any class can be replaced by someone who is almost as effective but not quite.  At lower levels 2 Shaman &amp;/or Druids could heal for one cleric but that isn't currently true, at least in my experience.<br />
<br />
* Group:   4-6 people going deep into a dungeon &amp; fighting their way to a good spawn.  Sitting around at a zone line = waiting for a cleric.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Thanks Tal. :)<br />
<br />
Actually, my point really isn't that we need a cleric in the group.  My point is, that we (Shaman) can't be main healer and debuffer at the same time.  Next group (unless you're in a cheesy easy spot like FG) pay attention to healing needed before you get Turgurs on - can you Maloxx (if needed), Turgurs, and keep you &amp; the tank alive all at the same time?<br />
<br />
Sure, most of the times you get lucky... I usually toss Turgurs on as the critter is inc - and get aggro, but if it sticks, no biggie, it's now a cake fight.<br />
<br />
But if I'm resisted...  I'm getting beat on like the proverbial red-headed stepchild, waiting for Turgurs to refresh (or casting Malo), while the tanks are beating on the mobs back trying to get aggro back, and the cleric/other healers start healing me.  (This is in a group, not raid)  Now - if that Turgurs gets resisted, and I'm having to toss a 10 sec 75H on myself while getting beat on by an unslowed mob?<br />
<br />
And go the other route - don't slow instantly (and yes, I do generally know when I can do that &amp; not, what I should malo first, etc).  You're the healer and debuffer now.  Tank brings a mob back, you wait for him to get good aggro before slowing.  Oops!  He needs a heal!  Ten seconds later, and you've healed him by 1/4 to 1/2 (2k limit, remember), and the mob is still unslowed!  Do you have time to slow before another heal is needed?  If not, are you going to avoid our main strength (slows) to keep the tank alive?  Or do you let him get very close to death before tossing another heal, because you're trying to slow?  Even worse, what if you're resisted now?  Tanks at 40% hp, you're getting beat on from heal &amp; resisted slow aggro...<br />
<br />
This is my main point, really.  We've got other stuff to deal with than being the prime healer.  On the other hand...  grab two shaman - one (pre-60 even) is now an effective enough main healer to get by, and the above problem is gone.  You've still got the problem of rezzes, though.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, how many tanks are going to die while us &amp; the druids figure out timing on the new heals, without a cleric available. ;)</div></div><hr />

Currently, any class can be replaced by someone who is almost as effective but not quite.  At lower levels 2 Shaman &amp;/or Druids could heal for one cleric but that isn't currently true, at least in my experience.<br />

From what I have heard, the heal does NOT heal you up to 75%, rather it heals 75% of the total hps of the player (or 1950).  <br />
<br />
In your example where the 5k tank is at 2750 HPs, you would heal 1950 hps, putting the tank at 4700hps.  Not quite a complete heal, but more than Torpor, which heals 1200ish (depending on AA skills).<br />

I could deal with 1k or 1.5k. We have other things to do on raids anyway. This is a fix for the druid.

Maybe I've just got more suicidal friends who pull like madmen (grin)  Me dropping CBs on the tank as he needs heal quickly drains me down in mana, after several pulls I'm nearly OOM and down towards 50% health as I've canna'ed it all away, maybe the druids I tend to group with really should back off on some nukes &amp; heal a smidge more, too.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">well you found the problem yourself you are doing all the healing (or to much) imo the druid should be doing much more healing.  if he wants to do damage tell him to stick to his right click damage stuff.   and yeah i know what healing a tank who aego is.  tank i like to group with has 5k hp unbuffed so yeah.  in the situations i was talking about druid did much more healing than me and he still did more damage as well.  of course i slowed every mob so that is the real reason it was possible.<br />
<br />
now if i got to seb and theres an enchanter i pull.  even with the druid has the only healer.  and i find rarely have time to cast torpor cause we kill to fast for me to spend the 6 seconds to cast the spell then have to run to the mob.   soooo my point is the druid should be healing more and if they whine smackem good.  we arent healers we arent damage dealers we are buffers and debuffers who can heal when needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Torpor without Negative effects and castable on all targets <br />
200 (160)mana 1200 (1800)healing 6(3) sec cast <br />
<br />
new heal <br />
400 (320?)mana 1950 (??2500?)healing 10 sec cast <br />
<br />
A half version of torpor (51-54)would be <br />
100 (80)mana 600 (900)healing 6(3) sec cast <br />
<br />
(**) signifying fully AA and Focused <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alternatively keep the slow and drop the snare. But let it be cast on ALL targets<br />
<br />
But a 2k heal for 400 mana, that takes &quot;10 UNMODIFIABLE Seconds&quot; to cast is useless to Shaman ... except for 1 or two raid occasions<br />
<br />
<br />
Notice also a new spell at 51-54? really, that ones for the underpowered people without torpor and not 60<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So try to understand.. not asking for NO spell at lower levels, just asking for NOT this Gimp 75H Crap<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As someone else stated, with this new dot stacking thing, I am sure they would be able to recode HoT's to stack aswell, that would then solve Shaman raid healing, without using some Gimped up Crap 75H spell</div></div><hr />

You all are nuts. Land and others have pointed it out as about as concise as it can get. Shayman you have no idea what GAME balance is do you?  We do not need the side effects of torpor removed they are in place for a good reason. Secondly, the shaman class needs a large direct heal for using on raids, not to heal the MT but to heal the other tanks who get pummeled by riposte dmg, AE, and other kinds of nasty stuff.<br />
<br />
The shaman's current direct heal is inadequate, and could use a bump. The existing spell is a decent upgrade which will allow us to do that.  We will not be taking over as main healers but we will be able to patch heal with greater efficiency. Please just drop the torpor issue.  I don't even have the spell, and I know it is close to un-balancing as is.<br />
<br />
Take GAME balance into perspective not character balance ok.<br />

You seem to be pleased the VI is throwing you rotting meat... nevermind that it's rotting (Gimped), the fact that your getting anything seems to be enough for you<br />
<br />
another sort of setup would be to allow multiple HoT's to stack.<br />
<br />
There are many solutions that would provide Shaman more healing power from mid/low 50's up.....75% Heal is NOT one of them<br />
<br />
and as for Game Balance Vs Character Balance<br />
<br />
were there ANY complaints that Shaman could not heal well enough BEFORE these spells were put on test?<br />
<br />
No......this signifies to me that WE ARE BALANCED now<br />
<br />
They &quot;look&quot; like they are adding another Heal, so now it is time to whine, bitch, complain until it is something WE WILL WANT to USE, rather than some gimp spell that is used &quot;in rare occassions&quot; because it is there</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct we are balanced now so anything I get is gravy or maybe pudding? :D<br />
<br />
I am a 60 shaman without torpor but I can see this will have its uses just like torpor has its uses. This is a sufficient heal for what shaman need to accomplish.  Shaman don't need super torpor.  It is fine as is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Shayman Quod, leave me out of the &quot;we&quot;. <br />
<br />
When melee come out of AL platfrom at 40% life beggin for heal, this can take care of it. When the AE of the cursed gets mis timed this can help it. On the burrower parasite ring this can help very well heal the tanks tanking the 6 worm waves. On the HP fight I have no clue since I am on CC team but I guess it's good for spot healing and attrition healing. On the THO run it's useful to heal tanks on multi elder pulls, on AoW fight it's good to heal melee who got riposted from a bad switch, in ToV is a good attrition heal vs AE. Just a few examples from the top of my mind.<br />
<br />
For the Torporless shamans this is godsend. For the XP groups, shamans can do deep CT/Sssra camps. Coupled with slow this heal will be very nice. One group HoT farms can go ahead much easier with less downtime.<br />
<br />
In 8.5 seconds you can cast 2 x Chloroblasts but you will be without spells for the next 2.5 seconds. With this in 10 seconds you heal about 4.5 Chloroblasts. Shamans need badly some efficient big heal. This is it. Primitive spell for a primitive healer.<br />
<br />
I personally like this spell, lot of great uses not just some situational ones, it could use minor tweaks, but finally I am looking forward to actually consider training points in healing adept and critical heal skills.</div></div><hr />

This spell is designed to end the absolute reliance on clerics for sufficient healing in large-scale encounters:<br />
<br />
From Absor:The changes to Druid and Shaman healing are needed to remove a problem in the end game where some things just can't be done if there aren't enough clerics. It's a problem for gameplay when something like that exists.<br />
<br />
The only thing that should be under discussion is whether this new spell will achieve that goal. Torpor is a different issue and personally i think you have no chance at all of getting that spell changed. Ever. It's already on the verge of too good.<br />
<br />
As i've stated before i like the new big heal. I think it ADDS to our class. I am not sure whether it will be large enough to achieve the result that VI is hoping for, but i still think it will be a great spell.<br />
<br />
Edit: fixed formatting<br />
<br />
As for your long list of stuff, so what? Keep doing what you were before and let the level 54 shaman sitting at the back, hoping someone might request a sow or regen or something, get involved in a meaningful way.<br />
<br />
They &quot;look&quot; like they are adding another Heal, so now it is time to whine, bitch, complain until it is something WE WILL WANT to USE, rather than some gimp spell that is used &quot;in rare occassions&quot; because it is there<br />

You are obviously unable to grasp the concept that your demands represent the views of one shaman, and one who seems pretty badly informed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">a new direct heal would be a godsend, as Zorlac pointed out Chloroblast is pitiful.   i would agree that the 10 second cast time on the 75% heal is kinda long, but what do u want a 4 second heal that does something like 1000hp? thats what druids have in natures recovery (400 mana)  i would rather be casting for twice the time and be able to heal alot more.  who knows.<br />
<br />
regarding your spelll slot my set up for raids is:<br />
1) malo<br />
2)malosini<br />
3) slow<br />
4) chloroblast<br />
5) traditinaly root but often a buff/debuff<br />
6) switch out for buffing<br />
7) torpor<br />
8) cann4<br />
<br />
so another spot for healing just means more switchign what i do a ton of anyways.<br />
<br />
regarding torpor changing its not gonna happen, and the quote from absor makes it pretty clear.  you take awaythe side effects at all, put aside the fact its group only, and its WAY overpowering.<br />
<br />
i really trying to understand how you dont see takign away the side effects form torpor as game breaking?  and even if they took away the snare aspect which they wont being able to cast a slow on anyway is pretty damn annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">Actually, I think someone else said it best.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Some of the high end Luclin mobs already take 30+ min to kill, I seriously doubt (aka hope) PoP would not get any &quot;harder&quot;.<br />
<br />
The only heals that are useful for quick, decisive spot healing on raids are direct heals. In this department we are lacking. Therefore, a large direct heal would be useful for us--even if it is only used on raids.<br />
<br />
In EXP groups I wouldn't even be memming it unless I'm the ONLY healer in Ssra or CT (hell, I can solo in Ssra, so I wouldn't mem it unless I go deep with a group, and there's little chance I wouldn't have at least a paladin along). However, on a raid, when a melee is about to drop to low health agro, then I can actually heal enough to save him instead of popping pitiful chloroblast and pray other shamans/druids are healing at the same time.<br />
<br />
Besides, shamans normally don't really heal out of group much on raids unless your raid is seriously lacking paladins, clerics, and druids. Having a OOG torpor with no penalty is unrealistic and honestly would not make your life easier--everybody and their mother would be expecting it on them ALL the time, even though 90% of the time they don't need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">funny, 80% of my heals are out of grp on raids, see it all depends on how your guild does things.<br />

thing is, a piddly 2k heal will mean nothing for healing mt, i might as well continue casting sheal, as that may be the little thing that keeps him alive, a 10 sec 2k heal has too long casting time for that to be realistic.<br />
<br />
i can not be on a ch rotation, 2k is still nothing compared to our 7k+ warriors.<br />
<br />
and i most certainly hope they up the difficulty on pop mobs, luclin ones aside from emp isnt very hard once you figure them out, just boring and takes time. high hp != hard, just boring.<br />
<br />
i'd like to hear a reasoning as to why us getting a worse ratio torpor without drawbacks is gamebreaking? please? it's there for a reason isnt a good one. nor is &quot;absor says so!&quot;<br />
<br />
they are trying to make clerics useful for xp grps again, and also trying to get dru/shm more useful for raids again.<br />
now i can see where the:we're debuffers thingy comes from, but well, you need loads of clerics, and 1-2 shm's. this is a stacking issue as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">Well, if your 80% of healing is on the MT, perhaps you need to think why you are bothering.<br />
<br />
Any direct healing we do on raids *should* be for spot healing on anyone BUT the MT. The CH cycle + CE's more than enough to keep the MT up, else you have issues. I don't know which is more scary--popping a 428 pt heal on the MT, or the fact that you are actually making a difference with that 428 pt of healing.<br />
<br />
A 2k heal's going to be enough spot healing for anyone who's taking reposte/AE/rampage damage, in case of rampage, a cleric should be watching all the rampage tanks anyway. An out of group torpor with current restrictions is useless on any melee, and without current restriction but being less efficient would lessen our mana regen potential. Unless, you want a NEW spell which is an OOG Torpor with no neg effects and is less efficient... but why? Why get a DoT heal spell when you can have a direct healing if the ratio are similar?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">no, 80% of my healing is outside grp. not neccesarily on mt, i heal rampage/ae's/ripostes/rodding/resses etc.<br />

<br />
why a new dotheal? because currently we cant even do backuphealing properly, people who dont have aggro.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I'm kinda bummed that they didn't patch today.  I had hopes of getting to play with this spell tonight.  Anyway, here are my thoughts:<br />
<br />
CH75-shaman heals as follows:<br />
~2000hp in ~10seconds cast means I can counter about 200dps on a tank.  That's not bad.  I'm guessing I could cast this 7 or so times, so I can keep a tank alive against 200dps for just over a minute.<br />
<br />
CH75-druid heals as follows:<br />
~3000hp in ~10seconds cast means I can counter about 300dps on a tank.  That's pretty darn good.  Again, sustainable for about 70 seconds, assuming zero mana regen.  Toss in a canni5 at the end and squeeze out two or three more heals.  Warrior + Shaman won't ever duo the AoW, but if there is a gap in a CH chain and I start casting when the cleric should have, it'll buy a bit of slack.<br />
<br />
Torpor heals as follows:<br />
~1800hp in ~33seconds, with max aa points.  This counters about 54dps, nevermind the side effects.  You can heal faster just chaining Chloroblast...<br />
<br />
I like torpor, I use it a lot when soloing.  It's good when raiding for post combat healing, for modding clerics, for casters that do damage via spells, or for pinch healing a melee if my cleric is locked up tight in a CH rotation.  It won't ever help me heal out of group, or help me do anything to a tank who is dealing with an unslowable mob (hello Mr. Elite snake, much hate for you).<br />
<br />
Where am I going to mem this gem if we ever get it?  Who knows.. I'm not giving up CB for saving enchanters and clerics, maybe use torpor for soloing and CH75 for grouping/raiding... but I'm very fond of precasting torpor and then doing canni5.  Saves the clerics changing their pants sometimes, even with my warning message.<br />
<br />
Just my two bits,<br />
-A</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u68"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p68">i think its agreed we need a new fast casting direct heal? what do you want realistically? something like natures touch? just kinda throwing questions out there.<br />
<br />
With Focus spell haste, sup heal is down to ~3.8 sec cast from 4.5. Modified by Focus and AA it can be upped from 583 HPs to a possible 640-750ish heal, with the occasional crit for a possible 1300 or so. 250 mana also modified by Focus and AA can be down near the 200 mark or so maybe.<br />
<br />
If the 0.8 secs is really an issue, Chloroblast can similarly be boosted to a 500-600 heal with crits for up to 1000.<br />
<br />
To me these spells are good enough to Nature's Touch to not be an issue. Obviously NT benefits from Focus and AA just as much, but we get torpor so i don't begrudge the druids their spell. <br />
<br />
(BTW For AA i've been saying for a while that shamans really get left out of the AA healing skills. We really don't have a large enough heal to get much of a boost. Personally, i think they should boost all the percentages to 5%, 10%, 25% and we would have very little to complain about if anything. That would boost Sup Heal to something like 830+ with Focus/AA and possible crits of up to 1500+ every 4th cast. Yes, fine with me if druids and clerics got that too.)<br />
<br />
Anyway, i will love a 2k heal. Most of the groups and raiding i do is small numbers, patch-up affairs. I usually don't group with clerics and having a large heal will fit that well.<br />
<br />
But, i think if VI is looking at this heal to allow some leeway in raid healing and remove the strangle-hold clerics have on real heals, i'm not sure 2k will cut it. I also think if they really have to give shaman's a different spell to druids because of our greater mana regen abilities, then we should get the same size heal, but with a higher mana cost. Both spells cost 10 secs in casting, and even 3k HPs as people have said only just gets you onto the page of real healing.<br />
<br />
If we see shamans and druids fill-in the mt healing role it's fine with me. I think this is very possible on the lower-end raid encounters which is where the majority of the player base probably is anyway. Kind of ridiculous for raids to require 60 folks, 10 of which are clerics, 2 shamans and maybe 1 druid. The number of players with cleric bots or who quit other classes because their guild needed clerics or decided that the best way into the raiding game was a cleric is frankly ridiculous.<br />
<br />
I hope the change they implement will fix that. Either way, i will still enjoy getting a big heal. And i'll be using it a lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Nirtox, <br />
<br />
you are talking about healing your group typically from AE or Riposote Damage.  Notice my original post had &lt;2&gt; reasons we should have a smaller heal.<br />
<br />
The first is slow and doesn't apply to raids.<br />
<br />
The second is our mana regen, and does apply to the situation at hand.  Simply put, we regen mana so much faster than a druid, that we could cast more of the 2k 400 mana heals, to match the druid and the 3k 400 mana heal.   I can be on my last bulb of mana, and then be full in a couple minutes, far far faster than the druid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Carriane, <br />
Your right, classes aren't balanced.  They aren't balanced in the sense that always adding a player should result in more xp.  It should work that 1 player gets 1X, 2 players 2X, so on and so forth.  However, as a Shaman we are WAY ahead of the druid in terms of adding us.  I moved my shaman to a new account so I can 2 box the druid and shaman.  My normal compainion is a 60 Monk.  The Shaman and the monk get MORE xp per hour then all 3 Classes Grouped.  The druid doesn't increase kill rate enough to make up for pie split.  However, the shaman does.  Druid &amp; Monk duo, doesnt get as much XP as all 3 of us do grouped.<br />
<br />
BTW this situatiuion is not unique to priests.  I find that adding a warrior to our normal 3some is BAD.  Warriors are not very good tanks in XP zones compared to a Monk (who tend to have fungi more often) and they dont do the damage out classes do.<br />
<br />
Cush, I guess it depends on where your fighting.  And most specifically with who.  I group a lot with a Monk with a Tstaff.<br />
I almost NEVER get agro for more than a second or two.  I find that Slow that lands almost never gets me agro.  a Resisted Slow usually does but it doesnt last more than a couple seconds.  With HP and AC as high priority I survive just find.  If I'm worried about Agro I used to always try and land Malo first.  ((Before I was 60 I landed Malosini first)).  Another trick that works well, is to get yourself a Journeymans Walking stick.  Loan it to your tank.  If Mob has a High MR.  Keep casting maloisin off the bat.  it usually sticks right after the Tash Proc.  (usuall y within 2 casts) then slow.   That's how we fight mobs like Mind Worms, we proc the Jstick to make Malosini stick, then slow.<br />
<br />
PS: obvious Jstick sucks for damage, so tank gets in habit of swaping it OUT soon as it procs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, we can play main healer.  Sure there is a risk if there is no other healer in our group.  But we can preform.  Clerics can to.<br />
And thier risk is about equal to ours if they dont have an enchanter.  The only priest class that can't reasonably preform as solo healer is Druid.  <br />
<br />
Note, reasonable doesn't mean risk-free.  doesnt mean optimal.  <br />
It means doable.<br />
<br />
Personally, I always like 2 Healers in a group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
200 mana for 1200 HP is better for Cannibalizing than 300 mana for 1200 HP every time. Period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u71"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p71">Playing some number game here a bit.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: if anyone finds an error in these calculations and numbers, please correct me; I just tossed these out without giving them much more thought.<br />
<br />
Plain vanilla Torpor heals 300hp/tick for 4 ticks, which translates into 50hp/second heal. With AA effects you can extend that to 300hp/tick for 6 ticks, still healing 50hp/second.<br />
<br />
Now let's imagine that somewhere out there is a mob that quads for 320 damage, and has about 20 delay between strikes (i.e. 2 seconds). Let's further postulate that on average the mob does 45% of the maximum possible damage on whoever is tanking the thing, which means that in one tick the mob does 1728 damage. Slowed, the mob does about 432 damage per tick, equaling 72 damage per second. With Torpor counteracting some of that damage the net damage taken is 22hp/second. A 5K hitpoint tank will run out of hitpoints in little less than 4 minutes against a mob like that without additional heals. Torpor for that duration takes about 1000 to 1200 mana if you've the proper AA skills and specialize in Alteration, or about 1800 to 2000 mana if you don't have the AA skills.<br />
<br />
Let's say that the tank is able to keep the DPS up despite Torpor, and the fight lasts for 5 minutes. You're left with about 6600 hitpoints to heal after keeping Torpor up during the whole fight. That's about 9 castings of Superior Heal with AA and focus effects for total of 2250 mana, or 3000 mana without the AA effects. The grand total mana consumption for healing ranges from 3000 mana to 5000 mana. Mana consumption ranges from 10 to 17 mana/second. Then there's slow, debuff, and so forth, increasing mana consumption even more.<br />
<br />
One cast of CanniV will net you 1000 mana with AA enhanced Torpor. It takes a little more than one AA enhanced casting of Torpor to regenerate the lost hitpoints in 36 seconds, so overall with just canniV you'll regen about 15 mana net per tick and might have enough time between canniV blasts to do all your healing and debuffing. Without AA abilities, you'll regen about 10 mana per tick, give or take.<br />
<br />
You might be able to be the healer for the tank, but you'd better hope there aren't any resists with slow, and that you won't get aggro at any point :)<br />
<br />
Would a new 2K hitpoint heal help?  The 10 second casting time is just begging to be interrupted, it seems, and whether the 2K heal for 400 mana will make a significant difference in the above scenario, is to be determined.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">Originally posted by Blacklace <br />
why a new dotheal? because currently we cant even do backuphealing properly, people who dont have aggro. BUT i dont have 10 sec spare casting time for a minich. see i heal in addition to normal duties, slowing rebuffing, not to mention i usually have a mage or two or three in grp who needs heals<br />
<br />
My biggest issue is with the cast time also. However, if you take into consideration that the &quot;new&quot; torpor you are proposing's going to take 6(3) sec to cast, and won't heal to full until 30(27) sec after you begin casting the spell... it's use is really limited to damage prevention, IE, guessing who's going to need it most, and pop it on.<br />
<br />
By comparison, a 10sec 2000 heal's going to take full effect 10 sec after you cast the spell, which gives you a much higher heal/time ratio. The only problem is we lose 3(6) secs of canni time, which shouldn't be an issue on most raids.<br />
<br />
As for already doing many things on raids--that's not going to change with either spell. There's usually a time gap between slowing/buffing, even when you are on the CC teams. Personally I think somebody getting healed 2000pts in one pop is a bit more beneficial than regening 300hp/tick (that's really what HoT spells are) and hope he doesn't drop to low health agro.<br />
<br />
If you like  healing the MT, a 2000pt heal that ALL shamans can land on him it's going to be FAR more effective than 1 HoT that only ONE shaman can land that heals a lot less in the same time given.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but a tank's not going to keep up DPS with Torpor on him :P It suffers a 30% slow, plus having all of his haste stripped. That 5 min fight's going to become a 9 min fight.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the 75h should be used in conjuction with Torpor when doing exp (personally I wouldn't even mem it in exp groups unless I'm the only healer in CT or deep Ssra). Think of it as a huge Chloroblast--you use it on raids for spot healing. In order to use it well you have to think somewhat like a cleric--predict when someone would lose 2000hps, and time your 75h accordingly.</div></div><hr />
