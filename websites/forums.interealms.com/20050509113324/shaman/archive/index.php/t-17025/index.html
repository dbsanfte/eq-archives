<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, when I heard about, and later bought the LDoN expansion I was hoping for great things.  To be honest, I've been pretty happy with the purchase.  The other night I had an adventure that I think is worth sharing.<br />
<br />
Got into a group in Mistmoore with my lvl 30 pally alt.  I was main tank (almost all undead mobs and my toon is pretty well twinked and has the lvl 30 undead weapon proc), monk, necro, magician and a druid.  It is after 11 pm, so we decide to go with just 5.  Start off strong on a rescue mission.  Half way through the mission, at midnight, the necro decides it's getting late and bails.  At this point all is well and we are making good progress towards the hostage.<br />
<br />
Now, after a bit we notice that the monk is a little hyperactive.  He just won't sit still for a sec.  I get the feeling his evening dose of Ritalin has worn off.  Even when the mage and druid are oom after a hard fight, he still insists on scouting around and opening doors arbitrarily.  When we strongly encourage him to sit his butt down, he just mumbles something about being able to FD if he draws any unwanted aggro.<br />
<br />
So we continue on our way with our merry band of 4 and find the room with the hostage, with 25 min to go.  We figure, great, plenty of time, but a tough group protecting the hostage, so lets take our time.<br />
<br />
I let the group know that I will use soothe, which I've done well in the previous large rooms, to help pull small groups in an orderly fashion until we clear the room.  They agree and I get started.  OK, now the fun starts.<br />
<br />
I'm casting soothe on the second mob, and the monk decides he wants to take a look in the room.  Needless to say, he aggros the 4 closest mobs to the door and they come flying at us.  Like a good tank, I decide to help the monk, since he has the aggro.  Well, as we are beating down the first couple of mobs, I get charmed by the enchantress in the group.<br />
<br />
At that point, I turn into one nasty Chanter pet, and proceed to kill the mage and druid in the group.  The mage never even saw it coming (according to him in chat later), the druid ran for it, got cornered by the me and the 4 mobs, and was quickly beaten to a pulp (woody stew anyone?).  I actually felt guilty as I inflicted the fatal blow (btw, I have a Reaver and am doing about 105 hp per hit two-handed, and double attacking fairly often, did not take long).  And, you might be wondering what happened to the monk?  Yeah, you guessed it, he FD'd and lives.  There is no justice.<br />
<br />
OK, now I've wiped my group and am being pulled into the &quot;hostage&quot; room by the Enchantress, who has made me her beatch.  She parks me right next to the dwarf hostage.  I could swear that while I'm standing there, in shiny platemail, big two-hand sword, deer-in-the-headlights look in my eyes, I hear the dwarf say &quot;nice rescue&quot;.<br />
<br />
So I'm chatting with the rest of the group while I stand powerless in the room.  Two are trying to make it back to the zone in point, and the monk is outside the room scouting around again.  He actually brags about the FD working, go figure.  Well, I know that at some point, the charm will break, and I'll be in the room with about 6 mobs, and all are going to aggro on me.  So I am plotting my escape strategy.  I come up with a good one.  Basically, charm breaks, do a 180 turn and run like hell for the zone out point.  Sounds good to me.<br />
<br />
OK, 5-6 minutes (or was it hours) later, the charm breaks and I take off like a bat out of hell.  No SOW, so I have to rely on my headstart to keep me away from the mobs, who are all chasing me.  As I get out of the hostage room and run into the next, who should be there but the monk.  I run by, he gets trained, and this time, no, FD did not work.  I felt oh so bad.  :(<br />
<br />
Well, with that minor speed bump, things are actually looking pretty good.  Until I make a wrong turn.  Should have gone right, went straight, into an area we had not cleared.  I run into a room full of mobs, including, yeah you guessed it, another Enchanter, this time a male.<br />
<br />
I turn around and haul butt, and try to get down the hall I missed.  Too late.  I'm caught between the two groups now chasing me, total of about 12 mobs.  Luckily, if you can call it that, they don't kill me.  Instead, I get charmed, again.<br />
<br />
Funny thing is, both Chanters are now casting charm on me, so first I follow one going east to her room, then I turn around and follow the other going west towards his room.  This happens about 4-5 times, I'm basically being pinged between the two Chanters, until finally, the beatch that charmed me the first time gets me again and leads me back into the hostage room.  I'm parked next to the dwarf again, and can swear he asks, &quot;haven't we met?&quot;  <br />
<br />
So, long story short, the next time the charm breaks (another 5 minutes or so), I repeat my brilliant escape strategy.  But this time I get feared and gang banged.  I make it back to the dungeon with 5 min left, no chance to succeed at the mission.  <br />
<br />
However, as we try to finish the mission during the extended 30 min period, I do single pull the Enchantress and proceed to open a can of whoop ass on her.  Small victory, about all I could hope for.<br />
<br />
Anyway, that is my sad, but oh too true, story.  At the time, as now, all I can do is laugh at the fact that I not only killed my entire group, but was a &quot;second&quot; hostage for over 10 min.  Sure was weird (kind of flattering) having 2 Chanters fighting over little old me.<br />
<br />
Adventures like this make me feel I'm getting my money's worth.<br />
<br />
How about it, any other LDoN &quot;unique&quot; stories out there?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nice Story, hehe I got mezzed by a Froggy in Seblis once, he wandered off and left me, Mezz Cleared and i got revenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My warrior gets mezzed occasionally by those soothsayers, but he only got charmed once. I beat on the cleric while I was charmed, but fortunately it only lasted a few seconds and I didnt hurt her much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yodaopie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had a Charmed Bard Trying to hurt me once.... he was a little distraut when charm broke and I bonked him and was Full hps and told him what happened.  Poor guy still hasnt lived it down.  Good Story I like hearin stufs like this</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Very cool story, I bet that was fun!!<br />
<br />
My only story - myself and 2 friends picked up 3 strangers for a Miragul's crawl the other night.  The pick up necro decided to take it upon himself to be &quot;main looter&quot; and main-looted himself right into a /q after we finished the crawl.  The wonderful guy took about 1k in cash loots plus a neat little shield which would have been a decent upgrade for another group member.  Had fun until the jerk pulled that garbage on us  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fearcazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">See? Group CHA buff does have it's usefulness!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Lol...good story, loved the &quot;nice rescue&quot; :) Can't really think of any similar escapades of my own...most of the runs I've made were pretty cut and dried.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">See? Group CHA buff does have it's usefulness! <br />
HAHAHAHA!<br />
<br />
I like the story.  Getting charmed is fun and leads to all sorts of interesting stories.  I have yet to get charmed since I leveled to 34, but that was blast.  I even killed the mob that charmed while I was charmed as well as about 5 of his friends and 2 PCs.  It was crazy.<br />
<br />
That said, I'll be happy when I stop caring about needing to complete missions, time limits and point totals and I can play for fun.</div></div><hr />
