<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Necros arent better healers then they are. I mean when you get down to it healing is what makes or breaks any group.  Especialy below 65 you see alot of mixed healing combos, like druid and shaman replacing a cleric, or just a druid or just a shaman, or 2 shaman 1 healing the other slowing then swaping when LoM.<br />
<br />
Necros at level 20 they get a nice lil spell call Shadow Compact which is a heal over time which steals life from thema nd give it to a target. I have to wonder why this spell line was not continued to a useable degree. It would compliment a druid or shaman healer nice if it was a stackable HoT. They can always lifetap it back or keep regen on form the main healer.<br />
<br />
Dunno was just a thought.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe because they are practice the black arts and are dealers of death not healers like priests?</div></div><hr />

No thanks. Let them solo till their eyes bleed. Bunch anti social, loot whoring bastards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dude - Necros are scary enough as they are. <br />
<br />
Had me (60 Monk) and a 61 Necro hold Sebilis Bugs. Now yeah, we didn't have 4 MOBs in camp at all times, but criminy, a well played Necro is incredible. <br />
<br />
Then there's that mana regen spell they have. Holy schnikes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I always thought Necro's were pretty good healers, especially considering they are not one of the cleric classes.<br />
<br />
I was in a LDON with 2 necros, a shammy (me), paladin (MT), rogue, and ranger (lvl's between 62-57).  With the heal effects (never played a necro, so i'm not sre what the names of the spells were), on top of my group regen keeping the pally up seemed particularly easy.  I mean really easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">A well played necro is awesome in a group.  I haven't seen many that I think fit that category...most are mediocre considering what they could be doing (haven't really grouped with THAT many necros)...but one I group with regularly mezzes better than many of the *get me to KEI so I can make platz* chanters I experience.  I don't know what spell it is, but he does something that taps critters and gives the group HoT...and does mana steal/group feeds.  Usually if I'm grouped with him I have to canni nonstop, burn mod rods (often with a mage too if with this necro), and still hit 100% often due to all the health coming in.<br />
<br />
So, I think there is a higher version of the group health feed spell...or maybe he uses the low version and it increases in power with level (like SoW or something).  Maybe the spell is rare.  Maybe it's an AA thing.  I dunno...but it's a freaking beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
LOL<br />
<br />
Seriously though if a necro can play their class properly then they are excellent group members.<br />

<br />
Then one has to wonder why they get it to begin with. Mind you, im not talking about one so good that they equal our Q, but just something to add and make them more useful. Besides, i think we are past what classes are supposed it, its more about what keeps the person playing these days.<br />
<br />
Good point though.</div></div><hr />

Necros are absolutely awesome in groups.<br />
<br />
They have group HoT-style lifetaps, group manataps, twitching, and a necro can dish out some insane DPS when the mood hits him.  They can snare, they can pet tank or kite adds, and they can FD split when you need it done.<br />
<br />
Often, you don't SEE what the necro is doing, but trust me.  Have a good necro in your group, and you will NOTICE it when he's gone.<br />
<br />
That's why, IMO, the necro is one of the most versatile and useful classes in the game.  About the only thing they CAN'T do is nuke for mass damage and slow anything not undead...but they CAN nuke and slow undead.  ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I still remember when Verant (yes, Verant) first put in the heal over time for necros. For a week, my necro was the best healer in PoFear (back when mobs maxed for 40), since the self drain part could be clicked off. 400pt of healing for 10 mana was great :P<br />
<br />
It was put in game to give the necro a little bit of group desirability. Shortly after it was put in, enough necros hit 50 and showed Verant that necros certainly didn't need a buff, and that's when all the nerfs began. I suppose that idea died with those nerfs.<br />
<br />
Nowadays necros have far better spells for grouping purposes, so there really isn't a point to continue that line of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">True, that group mana regen is pretty sweet, i guess i was just looking at it from a lower level view, cause yes, necros indeed change near 50-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Was in 2 LDoN Miragul collection quests the other day, with a necro being main puller. He consistantly pulled 2-3 mobs (ie: quite manageable). We had no enchanter or bard, so while we were killing the other mobs, he would aggro kite one or two around for CC. When we got to them, hit pet/DoTs had knocked it down to 2/3rds (or lower) hp. While we kill those, he goes and pulls more.<br />
<br />
Finished both collection quests in under 30 minutes each, and it was never boring. Good necros rock.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">zafeers t. of v. isnt bad, 80 per tick (for 9 ticks) group HoT/lifetap, but  I dont think its necessary or balacing to give them more healing power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Was in a ldon group in guk once with myself, a shadowknight, and 4 necros.  The only time I healed was during one wait period.  A straggler took a wrong turn and died.  I torpored while they liched until she arrived.  First half of the kill xx mobs took 15 minutes.  With a 15 minute wait for the dead to arrive, it took 40 minutes.  I stopped canning halfway through, I just couldn't spend the mana fast enough.<br />
<br />
-edit to clarify-<br />
The point was, all the healing was done by necros, except while we were waiting.  The sk was there to calm the nervous couple of necros who didn't want a 6 nec team.  I was there in case the sk needed healing.  6 necros would have been faster :)   Mobs still died almost before I could slow em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">6 necros would have been faster <br />
<br />
Yeah, one thing about Necros, (from what I have heard), they stack rather nicely.<br />
<br />
There was a guild on Tarew Marr (iirc) called  Necro Death Squad.  They would routinely break and clear Fear. (Pre-Velious iirc)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I concider Necros and Mages one the two best stacking classes.  With necros slightly ahead of the mages due to their Mana regen/Heal over times.  Both classes have stupid DPS with pets, Dots, and DD's.  With one shaman to slow/back up heal and you have a group that can take out mobs faster then almost anything else.  But none have the staying power as a group like that.  Heck for that matter necros can even rez for those really bad days someone dies.  Only seen one thing nicer then a full group of necros with me.  And that is a full group of necros with pets welding maged summoned procing swords.  Five necro pets procing 150 (on average of 2 per pet per fight equals about 3300 more damage) adds up VERY fast from pets alone.  Things just die stupid fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I did a group in LDoN with 4 necros, a magician, and me.  We dropped mobs at an insane rate and I never had to heal more than three or four times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did a group with 4 clerics, me , and a SK.<br />
<br />
We succeded and mobs were dropping fast.<br />
<br />
Ever seen 4 clerics melees mobs to death? I still have nightamres about it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Zugarbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I started a Necro recently on TT. It's only level 19 but last night, at level 18, in the second sub-level of Kurn's, we (had 61 Druid with me) got trained by about 10 mobs. Before u go on about the PLing Druid, the druid had exactly ZERO offensive spells loaded and wouldn't have had time to cast them if she did.<br />
<br />
When it was all over and done with, I had killed four, Druid killed three and the pullers killed three. And my HP's were sitting at 100.  The Druid couldn't believe I was alive much less full health. A few minutes later I was full mana and with a regen full health as well.<br />
<br />
Necros are darn scary and I can't wait to get that sucker up to the higher levels.  Befallen is on my list.  I still owe a few mobs over there for the Corpse Run I made once to help a  n00b and got killed twice.  My Necro Pet ( call him Elvis cuz of the dance he does when I buff him--it's hysterical) will eat those undead for lunch. <br />
<br />
Incidentally, my level 16 spells allow me to do this:<br />
<br />
Dark Pact - swap HP for Mana (nice one cast canny dance :) )<br />
Lifetap - DoT that gives me the HP target is losing.<br />
Engulfing Darkness - DoT Snare and great to pull with.<br />
<br />
plus FD, more DoTs, DDs, pet heal, pet buff...<br />
<br />
I heard that in the endgame, Necros don't even use KEI cuz of the hp/mana swap spells. I know Dark Pact won't stack with C1. But then, with DP/LT who needs C1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I heard that in the endgame, Necros don't even use KEI cuz of the hp/mana swap spells <br />
<br />
True. I have never had a Necro ask me for KEI post a certain level (theirs not mine). I assume when grouped they click it off.<br />
<br />
End game you're probably better off casting Regen on a Necro than KEI.<br />
<br />

<br />
I'm assuming you mean the procs?<br />
<br />
I know I tried PL'ing a Cleric with my Monk. The MOB would regen health faster than the Cleric could beat it down. It was like watching blind people (no offense) play golf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Lich line of spells will automatically overwrite the clarity line. When my 58 nec casts demi lich kei will get overwritten. Mana conversion of lich / demi lich / arch lich and SoS are way better than any c3/4/5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way you PL a Cleric with a Monk is as follows:<br />
<br />
(a) have the Monk beat the mob down to 10-15%;<br />
(b) have the Monk FD;<br />
(c) have the Cleric root the mob;<br />
(d) have the Cleric finish off the mob with a nuke.<br />
<br />
You can skip (c) if the mob doesn't run at low health, but then the Cleric will end up Specializing in Evocation :) Oh, and try to alternate with DS PLing since otherwise your Cleric's Defense will be 0 :(</div></div><hr />
