<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Uhmn, well....from time to time, some bewildered soul comes up with an idea he believes to be earthshattering......until he gets some feedback from the more down to earth people, letting him know just how far out he's been wandering.<br />
 <br />
 “Alright, Enormious. Thinking outside of the box is a good thing. But not that far. Now go straight to your room and don't come out until you've learned how to be a good boy!”<br />
<br />
So, in the good old fashioned “What if...” tradition, here's a concept I thought would be great for a game like EverQuest. Read it if you want, and feel free to print it out and use it for toilet paper afterwards  :) <br />
<br />
Craft Item<br />
An ability any character gets at lvl 20. This ability allows you to craft an item which fits into the slot of your liking. You also get to name the item yourself. The name starts with your character's name, and then you could choose from several options, customizing it into a name you'd love to wear, ie. Enormious' Tiny Ring of Grand Wisdom.<br />
<br />
Now, for sanity's sake, I will be using this ring as an example of how I envision that this ability would work. At lvl 20, I go to my GM and activate the ability. This allows me to to spend some of my experience collecting Craft Points (much like how the AAs work). Now, at lvl 20, I would only be able to craft an item which would give me a maximum boost of +1 to all stats and saves, +5 hp, mana and endurance, +1 attack bonus and 1 augmentation slot. Such an item would cost me a total of 27 points, which would also be the maximum number of points I would be able to accumulate at lvl 20. (stats costs etc. will be further explained later). Also, the rate of which I would accumulate these points would be equal to my level. If 100% xp went to Craft Points, by the time I should have reached lvl 21, I would have accumulated 20 Craft Points insted. With me so far?<br />
<br />
Now, at every EVEN numbered level, the stats on the crafted items would raise. This does not mean that an item crafted at level 20, would increase in power as I level, but that I would be able to accumulate more points as I level, in order to craft more powerful items later on. But the more powerful the item, the more points I would have to spend. Here's the layout:<br />
<br />
Crating an item<br />
+1 WIS = 1 point<br />
+2 WIS = 3 point<br />
+3 WIS = 6 points<br />
etc....this goes for all stats, saves and ATK<br />
<br />
+5HP = 1 point<br />
+10HP  = 3 points<br />
+15HP = 6 points<br />
etc..this goes for mana , AC and endurance as well<br />
<br />
1 Augmentation slot = 10 points<br />
2 Augmentation slots = 30 points<br />
3 Augmentation slots = 60 points<br />
<br />
<br />
Max points accumulated pr. lvl &amp; Rate of points accumulated pr lvl:<br />
(the numbers in brackets show how many point you'd need to accumulate at current level if you had already saved up your max. number of points)<br />
<br />
[LVL]  [MAX]              [SPEED]    [stats/etc]    [Mana/etc]   [Aug]<br />
<br />
20   | max: 27   |        rate: 20  | +1           | +5         |     1<br />
21   | max: 27       |    rate: 21  | +1          |  +5      |      1<br />
22   | max: 61[34]  |   rate: 22  | +2          |  +10       |      1<br />
23   | max: 61        |   rate: 23  | +2         |   +10       |     1<br />
24   | max: 112[51]  |  rate: 24  | +3         |   +15       |     1<br />
26   | max: 180[68] |   rate: 26  | +4          |  +20       |     1<br />
28   | max: 265[85]  |  rate: 28  | +5          |  +25       |     1<br />
<br />
And the list goes on and on.....<br />
Now, what we have here is a major time sink, but one which I believe is balanced and would enhance gameplay. Low level characters would be able to craft low stat items in little time (as leveling is faster in low levels), and high level characters would be able to craft powerful items if they put in a LOT of time (as levelling is slower in high levels). And if one were to invest all the points accumulated from every level, a lvl 60 character would be able to create a tremedously powerful item at the cost of 3987 points and month and months of play (even years):<br />
<br />
Enormious' Gigantic Helmet of Potent Health:<br />
<br />
+21 STR	| +21 Save vs Poison	| 105 AC<br />
+21 STA	| +21 Save vs Magic	| +21 ATK<br />
+21 AGI	| +21 Save vs Disease	| +105 HP<br />
+21 DEX	| +21 Save vs Fire		| +105 ENDR<br />
+21 WIS	| +21 Save vs Cold	| +105 Mana<br />
+21 INT	|			3 Augmentation slots<br />
+21 CHA<br />
<br />
This might look like a gamebreaking item, but a casual player would need years of gameplay to accumulate points for this item, and even someone being PLd would need several months. And once this item has been created, a lvl 60 character is stuck at gaining points at the speed of 60 points pr. level if 100% of his xp went into Item Crafting. That means he'd have to go through lvl 60 almost 67 times in order to craft a second item just as powerful. Add AAs to that timesink, and I believe you have something I for one would love to see in a game like EverQuest.<br />
<br />
As a finishing note, I'd like to add that these items would have to be No Drop, and that it is of course fully possible to create as weak items as one wants, or just concentrate on items boosting one or two categories, like crafting a ring which only gives saves or some boots with just Stamina and HP.<br />
<br />
Yup, that's all, I think. If you hate the idea and think I need to be committed into a mental institution, that's ok. And if you like it, that's ok, too. It's just an idea, and I needed to get it down on paper since it kept me from getting any sleep when I tried to go to bed yesterday :o)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">So basicly you're thinking about items that 'level up' as you do.<br />
<br />
Very interesting, as long as it does not interfere with regular exp and AA.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ermn, well....no  :) <br />
The items don't level up. Once created, their stats are fixed. But as you level up, you are able to craft more powerful items.<br />
<br />
And since it's supposed to be a time sink, it interferes with regular xp  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sounds like Craftizons - er Horizons to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i like what both of you said. It would be cool to sort of have an adventure stone that gets stats when you level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Willl never happen though, it would take a huge database to hold those extra items for every single character above level 20 that decided to make one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Such items, i.e. which &quot;level up&quot; as player does, are in other online games. In Anarchy Online, for example, are armor sets which are quite good for the newbie level once you quest for them, and which also level up as your newbie toon levels up. I forgot the name, but it was later addition. In a way, very useful items. Those sets were good medium quality items for the level, there were always better to be found on missions as a loot or rewards, but also worse items. Basically, good strong medium set. Those were newbie sets, meaning that these sets helped and were upgradeable up to mid-teen levels, after what the char was already skilled enough, strong enough and knew the game enough to get a new set on their own. Very fine idea it was, as such.<br />
<br />
Of course, this is not exactly what you meant, but in general somewhat same utility, i.e. able to 'aquire' or 'create' an item or item set on your own, which upgrades/can be upgraded (or created, in your care) as you level up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Itzkul:<br />
<br />
I agree with you.  But tagging the items No Drop makes it more feasible than it was a few years ago.<br />
<br />
What COULD happen is a generic item for each slot (ie a Gigantic Ring).  <br />
<br />
Then whip up a little code snippet so it always displays the owner's name (easy since it's no drop...every Gigantic Ring would have the same 'variable').<br />
<br />
Top it off with a  tracking system like the AAs (easy enough, we've seen they can add AAs, and LDON points, and Leadership points, etc.)  Lets call it CraftPoints.  <br />
<br />
To finish, make the Gigantic Ring dynamically reflect the CraftPoints, much like the WoodenFigurine reflects your Flags and the Adventure stone reflects your LDON wins.<br />
<br />
Walla!, a fully customizable piece of equipment that you could spend XP on.<br />
<br />
But the real problem - No level 20 is going to ever wear a +5 hp ring.  :)  And very very few people will stop and dump xp into Crafting until they get to lvl 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Snapdragon,<br />
<br />
The reason I think people would start dumping xp into this already at lvl 20, is that if you max out the points every level, it would take you a tiny portion of the time it would take you to assemble those points at lvl 70  :) <br />
<br />
Also, a +5hp ring would cost you 1 point. that's 1/20 of the xp needed to go from lvl 20 to 21. A +1 to all stats, saves and ATK &amp; +5 HP/Mana/Endr/AC ring would certainly have appealed to me while I was lvl 20, even if it would cost me the same as a whole lvl worth of xp (and then some, since it would cost 27 points) (45-60mins in HHK). In fact, I might have crafted myself a whole set of such items back then.....this is from a shaman who was trying to quest for Totemic Helmet in his late 30s, because it was an upgrade  :) <br />
<br />
Anyhow....it's nice to have something to daydream about  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like the idea of just being able to name gear.  I want to have &quot;Phattey's Bashing Shield of Love&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think the idea would work.. IF the end product of &quot;craft item&quot; was more powerful than any looted item, or it was in a game where there are no looted items, but right now in EQ you could just work for what, 2 weeks on LDoNs and get similar armor.. would be useless to work for a year to get something like that, even for the super-casual</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sounds a nice idea but I'm confused what the idea is a solution to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enormious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I guess it is a solution to the same ancient problem EverQuest is a solution to:<br />
<br />
&quot;What, oh what, to do with all that spare time?&quot;  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sounds like a fun idea.  Not everyone plays to see content and get uber gear.  This would really be a fun &quot;side project&quot; for peeps to play with.<br />
