<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just dinged 65 last week, and right now only have 12 AA points spent and 3 saved. (My guild needed me at 65, so I basicly ignored AA getting here).<br />
<br />
Currently I have Run3, Regen3, SCR1, Natural Durability 1, Mental Clarity 1.  I know that I need SCR3, ND3, and MC3, and that I'll also need Spellcasting Mastery3 to cut mana cost on spells.<br />
<br />
My quandary is...what order to raise them?<br />
<br />
I've sorta pondering taking all of them up together AFTER getting SCR3, to maximize buff time, but there are several ways to go...like ND3 for hp and to prepare for Canni V, MC3 to qualify for Canni V, SCM 2 or 3 to cut mana costs of the buffs like mana-eating Fo7 and Ferine Avatar.<br />
<br />
What should be my strategy here?  Concentrate on one at a time, or try to raise them all at the same time?  If I do need to concentrate on one, which should it be or what order should I use to raise them?<br />
<br />
Also, a side question:  Are any of the PoP Class AA abilities worth diverting AA points from needed Archetype categories NOW?  Spirit Call and Virulent Paralysis look like they could be VERY useful, and Radiant Cure certainly would be handy in trap-frenzy LDoN.<br />
<br />
Any advice would be greately appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
definately mc3 followed by canni5, after that it's up to you to decide what you need the most</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Definately get mc3 and canni 5 as soon as you can.  After that if you have too few hps to canni safely often times (I'd say you want at least 2k hps unbuffed so that you can use canni 5 right after a rez, preferably 2200 or more to make it a tad safer) get nd3 next.  Otherwise get scr3 and scrm, the value of these is huge.  RC1 and possibly 2 are worth diverting points for, but I'd recommend getting scrm and nd3 at least first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">MC3 and Canni5 first.  You are insane to do anything else.<br />
<br />
For the most part, I've found that concentrating on one AA line at a time is more rewarding than spreading them out.  I have 302AA at this time, which is basically everything except resists and stat AA, so I like to think I speak from experience.<br />
<br />
My reasoning is this:  You will not see much of a difference with a few 2% bonuses to different things.  Those minor bonuses will not help you.  However, if you do an entire line of AA and get a 10% or even larger bonus, you will notice it and it will help you.<br />
<br />
Which AA's to get first depends on your gear, your playstyle, and your personal preference.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what you do, ND3, SCM3, and SCR3/SCRM are all good investments.  I would say that SCRM, for the 6-7 tick quiescence, is the most powerful archetype AA (its a class AA, but is really just an extension of an arch aa) we have.  Out of the three AA I listed, I got it last, but I wish I had gotten it first.  ND3 should only be your first pick if you absolutely must have more hitpoints.  If you don't have enough HP to hit canni5 after a rezz (1924) then you need to train ND.  If not, you can wait until after the other big two.  ND3 increases your HP by 10%, and SCM3 effectively increases your mana by 10%, by giving you great mana savings.  I rarely get hit unless I intend to, so honestly I would find SCM3 a better buy and would do it first, but I would definately get ND3 after that.<br />
<br />
After that, there's plenty of ways to go.  If you mainly group, consider healing AA's to help keep your group alive.  Also quickbuff 2 or 3 for situations where you find yourself as main or patch healer.  If you raid, QB is practically a necessity for keeping your sanity.  On raids, once a mob is debuffed, I almost solely heal, so I find healing AA useful once again.<br />
<br />
If you like to solo, defensive AA's should be at the top of your list.  If your initial root or slow gets resisted, you're going to need them or else you're going to go splat.  I have channeling focus 3 and its not a dramatic improvement, but I guess it's something else to consider if you're a soloer.<br />
<br />
As for PoP AA's:<br />
<br />
A lot of people will rant and rave about spirit call, but I don't find it that amazing.  Extra free damage is nice when you're soloing, but the truth is that your pets are going to die before they do their full damage.  Higher ranks of spirit call will help this exponentially, though.  The reason being is that mobs don't pick one pet and attack it until it is dead.  They spread out their damage.  Thus, with 5 pets, most of them are likely to live against a pov golem, whereas if you just have SC1, all three of your pets will probably die.  I solo almost exclusively in pofire now, and SC is completely worthless.  The die in one round of attacks, so I usually don't even bother.  For grouping, SC is only ok imho.  It is free damage, but the damage they do is pretty insignificant compared to what a full group does.  In LDoN mobs very rarely last the full minute duration, so oftentimes it gets wasted (just like our dots).  A lot of people also talk about how SC is awesome for crowd control, but I think they are full of **** honestly.  They say stuff like &quot;I just cast SC on a mob and it is under control for the next minute&quot;.  That's a load of bull.  In the 6 seconds it takes you to cast SC, you could have cast turgurs or root.  Also, if the mob is already slowed, your SC pets aren't going to outaggro you.  If it isn't slowed, they're all going to die.  So basically, SC isn't good for CC.  It's ok for sicking them on a mob thats arleady rooted and slowed just for the free damage, but that's it.  SC is useful for pulling however: send your pets in to a room with three mobs, then pull them off and root them one by one.  So basically, SC isn't a terrible AA or anything but it isn't something I'd recommend getting early.<br />
<br />
Virulent Paralysis, on the other hand, is a great AA.  I waited to get this until around 280AA, and I really wish I had gotten it sooner.  If you solo a lot, this is a must.  I would still wait until after SCRM, ND3, and SCM3, but it would be high on my list after that.  Many mobs that have innately low disease resist are completely dominated by VP.  Pofire guardians for example:  If I pull with malicious decay, VP will never, ever, break early.  I've soloed over a hundred of them since I finished VP3, and it has yet to let me down.  I'm sure there are mobs in lower tier planes where this applies, as well.  It definately doesn't work for them all, though.  On top of its uses soloing, it is great for crowd control.  Usually, when an add comes to the group and you root it, you have to spend about 20-30 seconds talking to your groupmates to get them to understand that it is rooted and they should back away from it instead of just standing underneath it.  With VP, the knockback component can, if aimed right, just knock it out of camp so that you don't have to try to make your groupmates understand that they should move.  This is a really really excellent AA for LDoN and has been a great help.  So, get this AA pretty soon, before 100.  Also, if you are going to train VP, train it all the way to rank3.  It isn't nearly as effective before then, and you can't really use the root for soloing at ranks 1 or 2, because it will wear off before you can recast, whereas with VP3 you have about 10 seconds to recast once the button pops.<br />
<br />
I used to love radient cure but I don't like it very much now that LDoN came out.  It doesn't cure **** except AE tash from chanter mobs, and maybe the occasional trap.  I'd say 4 out of 5 times, it doesn't work.  I would train rank1 of this, just for the chance at curing yourself of snares and malos and other counterless effects, but save rank 2 and 3 until later.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions just be more specific and I'll try to answer.<br />
<br />
edit:  Changed my mind about defensive AA.  No matter who you are, you should get them.  When I am in an exp group, I am almost always with a guildie warrior with a blade of war or a beast of an SK, so even if I get a resist on an early slow, I'm still not going to get aggro.  Most people don't have that luxury, though, so you're going to need defensive AA for those resisted slows.  When I was still doing pickup groups in pov and bot, I'd say 80% of my deaths were from resisted slows where defensive AA might have made a diference.  I'd still rate defensive AA as being more important for a soloer, but still important for a grouper (and a higher priority than healing AA).<br />
<br />
On raids, defensive AA aren't that important because if you get aggro on a boss mob, you're going to die.  If you get aggro on a yard trash mob, either you'll get heals and live, or you won't get heals and you'll die.  Defensive AA won't help you there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I did run2 regen3 metabo1 MC3 Cann5 SCR3 SCRM ND3<br />
<br />
I recommend concentrating on them 1 at the time ate generally the first level of each yields marginal benefits.<br />
<br />
Definatley go for cann 5 ASAP ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Khaline</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">the one thing i see people have been forgetting about, expecially if you are a raiding shaman is MGB.  you NEED this AA.  it will save you MUCVH insanity and improve your guilds buff time alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">First, get MC3 to open up Canni V, then get Canni V. -Nothing else will give you the boost that will.  Even if you are the only shaman on the raid, you will not be the reason for the med break ;)<br />
<br />
If you raid, get MGB.  It will save you tons of time and mana.  Even if there are other shaman around to do the MGB buffs get it.  Being able to refresh a MGB on the fly when its needed keeps raids moving.<br />
<br />
Then go for SCR3/SCRM.  Its a lot of AA, but your buffs will last forever.  Since this effects torpor/Q as well, it really helps with recovering health when cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
SCM3.  You wont notice the savings per spell, but it really does stretch your mana pool a lot.  This coupled with the above AAs makes you a mana machine.  You just wont use mana nearly as fast as you regain it.<br />
<br />
By this point you may be burnt out on grinding the big AA numbers, so its a good time to pick up the cheap but usefull PoP AAs... Radiant Cure, Virulent Paralysis, Spirit Call.  They go fast and you can see the effects.<br />
<br />
Now its time to get the survival AAs.  ND3, CA3, LR5.  They will allow you to go toe to toe with mobs that would take you down in a round or two before you got them.  When soloing, or when you get agro on a raid you will be glad you had them... plus its fun to be able to tell your group that you can tank while the meat shield is afk :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There's an AA guide here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=14626).<br />
<br />
Personally, I was swayed by the posts here.<br />
<br />
My AAs, in order:<br />
<br />
Run-1/2/3<br />
&lt; joined a raiding guild &gt;<br />
Metab-1/2/3<br />
MC-1/2/3<br />
&lt; was considering MGB before Can-5; posts on this site changed my mind &gt;<br />
Can-5<br />
RC-1<br />
MGB<br />
VP-1 &lt; handy, but resisted sometimes; after reading posts above, I'm going to finish it up to 3 though &gt;<br />
SCR-1/2<br />
&lt; then figured the SCM mana savings was more important &gt;<br />
SCM-1/2<br />
<br />
The only changes I would make doing it again, so far, would be to put SCM before SCR. Rebuffing is not a problem, generally, for me.<br />
<br />
Next few planned, based in part on Jinheim's post:<br />
<br />
SCM-3<br />
VP-2/3<br />
ND-1/2/3<br />
SCR-3<br />
SCRM<br />
RC-2/3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Then go for SCR3/SCRM.  Its a lot of AA, but your buffs will last forever.  Since this effects torpor/Q as well, it really helps with recovering health when cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
This is why I originally decided to get SCR2 first.<br />
<br />
A Shaman friend told me that EE4 + SCR2 = 1 additional tick on Q.  I wanted to pick up that extra Q tick before doing anything else.  But, given the responses I've received, I think I'll rethink that strategy.  It's a good short-term strategy, but I should be looking more long-term here.<br />
<br />
I got ND1 as precursor to Canni V, because I'm not leetly equipped, and I know I'll need the extra HP that ND gives me to avoid taking low-HP aggro using Canni V.  Self buffed, my HP is only 2885.  I have my eye on some HP items in the bazaar, but I still don't have all my 65 spells yet, so I'm stilll kinda torn as to which way to go with that.  I figure I'll need at least ND2 to make Canni V less dangerous to use, but ND3 is certainly on the list of AAs to get.<br />
<br />
SCR1 was bought in a fit of pique BEFORE I got my EE4 item, when my over 60 buffs were fading way too %$&amp;^ fast.  Even the 5% extension seemed to help...at least in my own mind, anyway.  ;)<br />
<br />
So, given what responses I've seen here, my order will be:<br />
<br />
--MC3, to qualify for Canni V<br />
--Canni V<br />
--SCR3 OR;<br />
--ND3, depending on my HP situation after I get Canni V<br />
--SCM3<br />
<br />
Coolness.  Thanks for the input everyone.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
2, after canni5, get MGB if you in active raid guild<br />
<br />
3, now, get QB2 first !! you will hate 6 seconds Q or 7 second haste<br />
<br />
4, after QB2, I will take ND3 before SCR/SCRM; SCR/SCRM take too long to see it good<br />
<br />
5,  after SCRM, go get SCM for saving mana, with Q + canni5, you don't really worry about mana, but this AA still pretty good after get above aa<br />
<br />
6, RC1,VP, Spiritcall etc, those are nice &amp; fun aa but you can ignore it, you will rarely used it, also crit hit, healing aa etc, you should have 100+aa at this point</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ummm, I use radiant cure and VP a LOT.  both are VERY nice to have when you need them, even if they don't get as much use as canni5</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your shaman friend is wrong.  Extended Enhancement does not effect the duration of heal over time spells (Stoicism, Torpor, Quies).  It only effects spells that have a base duration over 48 seconds.<br />
<br />
http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3504&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
The only focus effects that work on our heal over time spells are Extended Blessing (from LDON augs), focus of mediocrity (vex thal) and Eterninostrum (elemental planes) and Chrononostrum (time, i think).<br />
<br />
As others have said, get Mental Clarity and Cannibalization long before those other AA's you are speaking of.  Then go from there, after those AA's my suggestion is radiant cure 1.</div></div><hr />

Tanking AAs &gt; Instant Healing AAs.<br />
<br />
Shaman instant heals are total crap.  1300 is crappy compared to 1750 for druids, and downright ridiculous compared to a cleric's supernal light, which heals 2750.<br />
<br />
The tanking AAs will save you possibly hundreds of hp, while getting beat by a slow resistant mob, while, with healling aas instead, you'll be able to heal more for the same mana/time, but you're less likely to be able to channel through the hits, and you'll need that extra hp to make up for your less efficient tanking.<br />
<br />
Boo on healing AAs.   :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dare to disagree there, quite often I find myself spending half a raid spamming tnargs on the tanks, unless I got aggro and &quot;watch&quot; from my bindspot.  While I'm currently finishing the LR series I'm rather happy I did HA3 first.</div></div><hr />

CA3/LR5 is good for solo, not really need for group since effect is small and you are pretty safe to tank in group<br />

I notice my CS3 + ID5 is really useless, I don't see any lower on max damage, not sure what it really do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">the CS3/ID5 line has been parced to show that it lowers the average amount you are hit for over large periods of time.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">MC3 -&gt; Canni5 is the MUST for every shaman. Canni5 is our best AA.<br />
<br />
After that point just check what are you doing most:<br />
<br />
- geting blood aggro from canni5 -&gt; ND<br />
- you tend to tank alot -&gt; CA / LR (CS / ID)<br />
- you are the healer often -&gt; SCRM (torpor / quies), (A)HA / (A)HG<br />
- you run out of mana fast -&gt; SCM<br />
- you like playing wiz -&gt; SCF / FOM<br />
- you like fun AA -&gt; rabid bear<br />
- you do dungeon crawling (outside LDoN) -&gt; suspended minion<br />
- you are a buffer in a raiding guild -&gt; MGB / SCRM<br />
<br />
Somewhere in between I would get RC3, VP3. Some guilds require /pet hold.<br />
<br />
I don't like PP / IE. 60HP / 300mana for 25AA arn't much batter then innate cha.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have similar levels of HP to you about 2900Hp selfbuffed, and I have found I get low health agro very rarely.<br />
<br />
If I'm soloing, I tank for the pet, so have agro anyway, and if I'm in a group I'll get a Hp buff from the CLR/DRU/PAL, which will push my Hp up nicely. It's rare that you are in a group where you can't get an extra Hp buff.<br />
<br />
My route was regen3 &gt; RS3 &gt; MC3 (took ages) &gt; Canni V.<br />
<br />
I plan to get SCR/M next, but I maybe distracted by one or more of VP/Spirit Call/RC1. Especially VP, that looks like fun :)<br />
<br />
I would suggest you don't worry about the &quot;Optimal&quot; route, just get Canni V, and then do whatever you fancy.  Mind you, this advice is from the Kitty who got 6 AA's at level 52 whilst trying to kill Naggy/Vox :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did Run3, Regen3, MC3, Canni5, MGB (I am in a high end raiding guild), SCR3, SCRM, PP2 (cheap and was tired of saving, heh), RC1, ND2, VP2. I now plan to finish ND and VP, then move to CA and LR. I may stick QB in front of these though. <br />
<br />
With SCRM and Crown of Ambiv (Focus of Mediocrity) I have stuck my Ceramic Shield in my bag for good. I think it still stacks with these effects, but honestly I don't care. My buffs last a LONG time, my MGB buffs outlast my refresh, my group buffs outlast an LDoN run, and its a pain to swap out my other (and far better) range item for the CSoV. <br />
<br />
I play a mixture of raiding, group XP grind, LDoN, and solo. I am glad I went for VP before finishing ND though. Its proven invaluable in LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Boo on healing AAs.   :p<br />
<br />
You don't get healing AA's so that you can heal yourself better, you get them so that you can heal other people better.  My tnarg's hits for 1800's regularly and I crit for 3400+ quite often.  With blessing of reverence, my cast time on tnarg's is 2.2 seconds I believe, and I have 20% mana pres from my boots, and then even more mana pres from SCM3.  Combine all that with my FT, raid buffs, 5.5k mana, and bard song, and I can chain cast 1700+ pt heals from start to finish of most fights.  On the longer fights I have to take short breaks at the end to canni4 a few times, but for the most part it is nonstop healing.  This does make a significant change in the life expectency of your MT, especially when 2 or 3 other shamans are doing the same thing.<br />
<br />
Don't boo healing AA's, they are really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have to agree with Jinheim, with SCM3, mana pres, casting haste, all the FT, etc .. I can spend almost the whole fight helping heal the tank, and random riposte. Whereas i never spend time tanking the mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For big boss mobs, I do spend some time healing the tanks, healing group members from AE, etc. On such mobs, if I get agro, I'm likely to die anyway, tanking AA or no.<br />
<br />
However, in clearing zone trash to get to those mobs, and in exp groups, I do end up getting hit. I'm choosing to do the LR5 path before healing AAs for that reason, and on the recommendation of other shamans in similar situations to me.<br />
<br />
However, 12 points for CA3 and 15 further for LR5 is quite tedious. I'm at LR2 now, and I think I might put 2 points into Healing Gift for the fun of crit heals as an intermission. :)<br />
<br />
Overall, I don't think there's a perfect AA plan out there, everyone's play style varies.<br />

This question comes round quite a lot, I guess that's why there's a sticky AA guide on it but despite that, there's still some hard decisions to make.<br />
<br />
The one thing that is clear to me is the Run3/Regen3 (or maybe Metab3, especially for kitties) -&gt; MC3 -&gt; Canni V. Anything else you hear, forget it. Low health aggro? Don't worry THAT much about it, its still worth getting canni V asap. Most often you'll have buffs to put you above it anyway. Canni V transforms the shaman's life. <br />
<br />
Beyond that its a lot harder to choose. Me, I got SC1 and VP1. Perhaps not the most uber AA, but after grinding MC3-Canni V I wanted some FUN! Whats more, I do actually find these very useful, particularly VP.<br />
<br />
Then I got serious again - as the main shaman in a (small, HoT/Vindi level) guild, I got MGB. No regrets there, it takes away a lot of hassle and I'm soooo glad I have it now. Now MGB is a pain to get, so once again I went for a little fun and got SCF1 and Healing gift 1 (crit heals). Wouldn't recommend doing that but they are fun to see those crits :D<br />
<br />
Next for me came SCRM, now this is one sweet AA skill but again a big grind to get too. But now, my quiessence heals for 1800 hp minimum, every time. My main buffs last just go on and on and on, just like the batteries in that advert with the bunnies. And best of all perhaps, I now only get calls for ferine avatar and haste half as often as I used to!<br />
<br />
Then I went for QB2. Another great AA skill, I love it best for the quick heals and quiessence, but its also nice for casting the standard buffs much faster. Now I'm working on MC and ND.<br />
<br />
Well, as you can see my path was a little off the norm, but if you want to forget about fun and go for utility here's my suggestion. Everything after Canni V is all fairly situational but I'd say everything up to the line break should come before the stuff after it, unless you're extremely focussed on one thing (e.g 3-4th shaman in raiding guild may focus more on healing AA, soloing shaman may focus more on ND3 and defensive and utility AA etc)<br />
<br />
Run3/Regen3 (or Metab3 instead of regen)<br />
MC3<br />
Canni V<br />
ND (up to whatever level necessary to use Canni V safely but no further)<br />
MGB (for frequent raiding shaman)<br />
SCR3, SCRM (longer torpor/quissence, haste, FA and all other buffs)<br />
SCM3 (saves 10% mana on everything)<br />
ND3 (more hp. May do before MC3 if low mana isn't ever a problem but low hp is)<br />
VP1 (great for utility)<br />
RC1 (great for utility)<br />
QB2 (faster heals can be lifesaving, faster buffs saves your sanity)<br />
MGB (for shaman who only raid casually)<br />
Defensive AA (CA, LR etc)<br />
VP3 (now you can refresh VP before it wears off)<br />
SC1 (fun! but also situationally useful)<br />
RC3<br />
Healing Gift 3 (crit heals)<br />
SCF3 (crit nukes, works on rains too)<br />
Healing Adept 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I have CA3/LR4 and i'm still hited like mad by a poor froglok in old sebilis....i couldn't recommand it. But Radian cure is really great and very cheap(2 aa) ,you should take it after mc3/canni5/scm3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I really rate the healing aa's. I patch heal a lot on raids, and Tnargs is unresistable.<br />
<br />
If I were to do it all again again, I'd always do the standard:<br />
<br />
run3, regen3, mc3, canni5, MGB<br />
<br />
Then i'd buy Radiant cure 1, too damn useful to put off any longer for measly 2aa cost.<br />
<br />
Then I'd grab Quick buff2 (haste of Mith easy to get for even a casual shaman) to put me near max beneficial haste unbuffed. My biggest mistake with aa was not getting Qbuff2 until well after 100aa.<br />
<br />
Then I'd bite down SCR3 and SCRM, if you have this many aa at 65, you porbably have torpor/Q. SCRM is the god of shaman efficiency. best aa I ever got after canni5.<br />
<br />
Then I'd personally go SCM3 over ND3.<br />
<br />
After that it's a toss up for healing or Ca/LR.<br />
I'd probably go AHg3 then ca/lr5 then AHA3 if I did it again, instead of hg3, ha3, ca/lr5, ahg3, aha3.<br />
<br />
Cram some Vp and spirit call in when you have time, I got Vp3 before spiritcall3, but thats just persoanl preference.<br />
<br />
I also did my nuke aa around 100ish for a bit of fun, not sure where I'd fit this in if i went again, probabaly mix it up after I finished SCM for some variety ;)</div></div><hr />
