<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hargurce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone have the bracer for this set?  Playing around with Magelo tonight really ticked me off.... BP effect we all know sucks, legs are just laughable...  BUT freaking casters get FT on bracers and rangers are getting Vengence.... do we really get jipped on the bracer with no effect?<br />
<br />
Did VI start to load ANOTHER bracer with UV and decided to not to cuz the shaman community may go collectively insane should another bracer UV bracer come into play...<br />
<br />
Or did they want us to moan about not getting an effect to lessen the blow when they put Acumen on our bracers?<br />
<br />
Argh...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the ornate molds have pretty weak hp/mana stats on them. Considering the drop rate and availability of ornate molds I would say these will probably get a stat upgrade in the future. We can only hope. The desparity between Ornate and Elemental armor in the stat department is quite considerable but so is the difficulty in obtaining them.  The bracer mentioned deserves a second look and consideration for some adjustment. I would add about 5 points to sta and wisdom and 20-25 more to the hp/mana. <br />
<br />
This is of course just my opinion. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am not too upset about any of that stuff. The ornate stuff is still better than velious quest armor, at least all the pieces I have seen so far. And the elemental is even better. It is going in steps, kinda like it prolly should.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For that matter, has anyone come up with the arms and boots yet?  I keep checking Magelo to hope.  The way I look at this set ... especially as some of the molds are starting to come up for sale on Druzzil.<br />
<br />
Breastplate: Effect is marginal, stats are good ... but I probably STILL wouldn't retire Vindi.  Pass to a ranger or something.<br />
<br />
Legs: Well ... its more HP than Wolf Caller's, and more AC (um, yay?) but a lot less mana, and the effect is downright insulting (here is hoping it gets changed).  I'd probably accept one of these as a drop or anything, but I'm not going to pay the 70-150k they are starting to draw as they come up for sale.<br />
<br />
Gloves: These are, sadly, what I'm really looking for.  I'm an Iksar, so no Mithril, so there's a big jump in gear options.  I'm in Stormrider right now, although you can make a case for Coldain Skin STILL being superior (I changed just to have variety, lol).  With Onyx a looong way off, and likely to go to others before me, these look like the most likely option, and the one I'd be most likely to fork ~70k over for.<br />
<br />
Bracer: Hmm.  Obviously this is better than either Fearsome Skyiron or Wolf Caller's (my 2 options opposite a Bracelet of Fortitude) and the FT 2 is sort of sickly appealing, if not really necessary.  With the other chain classes getting Vengeance here, these are gonna be in high demand for them, though ... and with only 5 sta/35 hp, I'm not sure I have it in me to compete for them.  If this mold came up for sale at something reasonable in the next 2-3 months (like 50k or less) I might bite ... maybe.<br />
<br />
Helm: Don't much care what the helm stats wind up being.  They aren't gonna beat my Circlet of the Falinkan.<br />
<br />
Boots: Well, *my* boots are idling at Barbed Dragonscale.  But given the rest of the set, I rather doubt that Ornate is going to be better than Vindi boots ... so I would probably let the Ornate stay with the rangers and rogues who don't have the option and aim for Vindi.<br />
<br />
Arms: I'd really, really like to see the stats on these.  Good arms are hard to come by, and Hardened Grey Flesh are getting tired (and make me feel too monkish, durn it!).  A quality pair of arms will let me move the Cords to a wrist where they belong, once I get them, which would make me a happier lizard.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Elemental armor, of course, is pretty near superior to everything, across the board.  I'm also not going to see Tier 4 this lifetime, and if anyone ever sells an Elemental mold for a price I can ever afford, I'll eat my hat.  That said, I'll /drool with the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

Elemental Molds are NO DROP.  They can't be sold,  whoever loots them is the only one that can wear them.<br />

<br />
Well, that makes a lot of sense in a way.  Hadn't even thought to check that, to be honest.  Well ... that's what I get for posting something without looking it all up first.  <br />
<br />
Ah, well ... such was a dream.  Now ... about those missing Scaled Avatar pieces...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So what color is the elemental armor anyway? I just saw the pink platemail that SK's get and I laughed my ass off, any details on shammy armor color?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hargurce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thx for the update on the effect for the bracer, just got into Solro tower tonight so it'll be just a bit until the Elemental armor starts dropping for us.<br />

Hey, at least it isn't UV on there!<br />
