<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, here is the situation:<br />
<br />
I have my PoS, PoV, and BoT flags.  I also have my tower key for use inside BoT.<br />
<br />
Where should I be looking at going next?  I have two of the parts for the HoH key quest (never managed to find an agony mephit heart in PoN, though I've found ten million other mephits) but I do not know if HoH is really where I should be trying to get to.  Is there a path of advancement through HoH to other zones, or is it a dead-end?<br />
<br />
Are there any other quests that can be done by an individual or a small group which are worth while?  My guild is not ready for taking out the PoP gods yet, so I'm specifically looking for small-group or individual quests.  (We are planning to try Grummus soon, though, which might account for our Crypt Of Decay access assuming we can do him).<br />
<br />
Any thoughts would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No flag is truely a dead end in PoP as far as advancement goes, you'll need them all in the end.<br />
<br />
As far as xping goes, personally I'm not a fan of HoH although I think thats down to it reminding me too much of SSeru =)<br />
<br />
CoD is by far the most enjoyable PoP xp zone I have access to atm and its nicely itemised, its pretty much a good old fashioned dungeon with lots of tightly packed mobs, the xp isnt amazing, but its great fun.<br />
<br />
Tactics is another one to make a priority really, great drops, good xp, and good fun, its very similar to BoT in a way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes Tactics is fun. And if the alternate key quests DO flag a whole group for Tactics then you should look into it with some friends.<br />
If you are lucky you can keel some Tactics named and get nice stuff like Ornate Chain BP patterns and Runes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The alt tactics flag is pretty easy.  We've gotten 2 groups flagged that way, and mostly finished getting 2 more.  Havent had a chance to actually do anything there yet.  To busy with other stuff.   I will say that the alt quest for Tactics does flag 6 people though, for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Just as a follow-up to my original post, we decided to do CoD keys.  I was able to solo my way through the CoD key placeholders and named mobs (this was actually a fun challenge despite the mobs being mostly light blue).<br />
<br />
After I had the 4 pieces of the key, I turned them in for an entire group (which worked fine, we all got flagged).<br />
<br />
Working on the tactics key now, but that one seems more tricky because there just dont seem to be alot of diaku raiders.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i wouldn't just pass up the hoh key either. it isn't a bad place to farm specs and it is easily soloed.  the more choices you have the better i alwasy say :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yep.  We went down to the mephit caves and cleared it out from one end to the other though and never saw an agony mephit heart.  I'm guessing it is a fairly rare drop, so we'll have to do it again and see how it goes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually no .. it's not a rare drop at all .. it's a common drop off an agony mephit. Just yesterday we found one. You just have to keep clearing away mephits as they are the placeholders for the agony mephits. Also, only one will be up at any time so you might want a tracker along to make sure one's not floating around somewhere.<br />
<br />
You can single group the agony's .. but they'll end up charming one of your group as they're enchanters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lets hope its not me they charm, then, because I'm a bad mofo!  (insert mockng laughter here)<br />
<br />
Should be an interesting fight if they are enchanter mobs.  As long as it is only one group member charmed at a time, though, it should be fine (remembers the good old days where one froglok charmed the entire group and kept it that way for 15 minutes since we were all charmed pets of the same mob and therefore all good friends).</div></div><hr />
