<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I haven't posted to much on here, but I've read the boards for a few years now, and posted occasionally when I had firsthand info on someone's question.  I've been 65 for a little over a month now, and one thing kept evading me -  Torpor.  I'm not in a huge guild, and I'm also the raid leader, and do lots of things with my guildies, so I don't make alot of cash.  No time for farming.  So no Q ;) , and no buying Torpor.  I've killed countless Kunark dragons, and even more GWs for hours on end trying to get Torpor/Malo.<br />
<br />
This morning I woke up to a post on my guild's board.  Apparently a few guildies (one in particular)  really wanted me to finally get this spell, so they went down and farmed emp themselves.  Low and behold it dropped :)  They had a pickup or two in their group (who, ironically, I knew) and when he found out it was for me, he didn't roll either.  So just like that I get Torpor in my sleep :)<br />
<br />
I consider myself a pretty decent shaman, I do far more then just slow mobs for groups ;P  But I always felt like I wasn't all I could be without this spell (you know, tanking rampage when you need, easier to offtank adds, not to mention the mana regen).  I still need malo, but being 65 I don't have to many problems, so Torpor was the huge one.<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm stoked right now, and I figured many on here could appreciate just how hard/worth it this spell is, and also how awesome it was for them to spend 3 hours camping a spell for me while I was asleep.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ignore my sig, I am 65 ;P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Congrats!!<br />
<br />
I got my from my new guild, it dropped in a chardok royals raid. Just after I had left :P<br />
<br />
Anyway I was 57 then, and we had no 60 shaman in the guild, so I was told first shammy to 60 gets it... I had a week off, so I was on EQ for about 17 hours a day getting to 60, and I finially got it, woot! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Grats! That was really cool of your friends. Another great example of &quot;friends &gt;&gt;&gt; gear/spells&quot;. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Great!  Now get to pharming up the cash to buy Quiescence so you can put Torpor in the back of the book!  LOL!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seriously, even with the massive nerf to (what was) the best cash making zone in the game, you will be able to farm up the money for Quiesc a lot faster than you will ever get torpor to drop. The best thing to do, especially considering how you're 65 already, is to farm money, buy Q, and then wait for torpor to drop just to complete your spellbook. There will be no urgency to get it once you have Q.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did PoG once, it was very easy.  The problem was lack of time because I'm constantly doing things with my guild despite the fact that we aren't a large raiding guild.  We are smaller, but very close, and fight together constantly.  Q on Sol Ro is still VERY rare and goes for quite a bit.  Regardless I have Torpor now, and the urgency for Q is much less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When you get the money, it will be for sale. For the guilds that break into the elemental planes, the runes drop like rain. So the spell prices plunge... on my server Quiesce is 20K. Farm money. And my point about PoG is that even though it is NOT a place where you can farm money, it is still the most efficient to farm money instead of praying for a torp drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Heya Vulash, grats on hearing about Topor!  A friend of mine saw it in the bazaar for 20k last weekend &amp; bought it for me, I'm still 3k in the hole to him &amp; gotta go farm up the cash for it.  It really has changed the game for me, sad that one spell is that powerfull &amp; hard to get.<br />
<br />
NE is still on good terms with SH (at least, last I heard) - ever need a wizzy or another shaman you can always give me a shout.<br />
