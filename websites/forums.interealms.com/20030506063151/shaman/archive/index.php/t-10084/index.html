<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...when you're in a non-raiding guild?<br />
<br />
Our guild rarely goes on raids, and basically never goes anywhere where I could see any upgrades dropping.  So short of constant PP farming to buy crap in the bazaar, how else can I upgrade?  <br />
<br />
I've been taking a group to PoG for a while, but we've seen next to nothing drop.  Haven't seen any shaman goodies whatsoever.  <br />
<br />
Any other ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was in a similar situation untill about a month ago.  Was in a guild that was not small (around 100 members, 300+characters) but that had no desire to do any type of raiding.  There were some &quot;Lets take our alts to MM or ToFS&quot; nights, but nothing in the mid to upper 50's to 60's type fun.  My gear wasnt bad, it just wasn't great (still isnt, but Im workin on it)<br />
<br />
I farmed plat to get what I have.  Was boring, excpet for the rare times when I could get exp for what I was farming (I know that damn seafury isle like the back of my hand).<br />
<br />
So I made friends with a few people in a guild tht raided.  Every weekend, I would ask where thier guild was going and if I could tag along.  Having left the other guild, I wasnt doing anything with them anyway.  After a few raids I asked to join and was accepted.  (already gotten 4 gear upgrades....and having a blast)<br />
<br />
So..my advice.  Meet new people.  Go places where people are raiding.  Plan raids for your guild.  Plan more raids for your guild.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What level are you?<br />
What gear are you currently wearing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">54 1/2 and mostly garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get some more levels before worrying a ton about gear.<br />
<br />
Everything but 1 item in my profile was obtained by 1 group (at level 60, mostly before PoP - ignore Nev's Eye).  In a small guild at lower levels you should be able to get most of it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My gear was pretty much crappy until about lv. 54 or so.  I'm also in a small guild.<br />
<br />
But I got some major gear upgrades in a 4-5 week period by going to zones with decent drops:<br />
<br />
<br />
UMBRAL PLAINS:   You may need to bring a group here since PoP came out, tis empty, but you only need one group of lv. 52-60 folks, with a cleric and solid tank for sure.  I looted the following items here:  Bracelet of Fortitude, Bracelet of Sence, and Gantru Charm.<br />
<br />
---also note that some nice gear dops in Maiden's Eye at the ME/UP zoneline.  Nice neck pieces and a SWEET Wis/Ac belt for melee hybrids.  Just go during offpeak time where less trains to zone :).<br />
<br />
FUNGUS GROVE:  There is a under utilised quest in FG called &quot;Summoning Beasties&quot;.  You need a solid lv. 55-60 group, or two groups lv. +50.  You can get lucky and get the rare Fungi Vest ( I have not yet, but only done this once so far).  I looted a Streched Fungus Hide Shield (32 AC +15 Sta +10 Wis +15 Disease) here.  Also, a nice 1HB drops.<br />
<br />
CHARDOCK:  You can solo the entrance at lv. 54 (maybe 55), or duo.  Or get a group and camp the gatehouse.  I won a Stave of Shielding in a pick-up group, sold it for 4K and bought my Ikky BP when I was 52 or so.  I looted Tribal War Boots one night when soloing entrance.  Have seen Chokadai Spaulders and Ivory Imbued Collar also drop at entrance/exit camps.<br />
<br />
TENEBROUS MOUNTAINS:  camping the vampires with some BST in my guild trying to get a rare spell drop there.  The exp. is very so-so, but you get a bunch of great loot to sell and gems.  I made several K (8-10?) here very easily from selling gems, Coterie General capes and boots plus Blood Weave drops.  I also looted a belt I am wearing, Blood Fiend girdle or something similiar.  Used the pp I earned here to buy parts for Earring of Soltice, Crystal Spider Eyes, Leaf Scale Gloves, Decayed Chain Legs, Metal Linked Crown......just basic upgrades.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope this gives you some ideas.<br />
<br />
Not sure if these suggestions are upgrades to you, I have noticed that there is a VERY wide range in what folks call &quot;crap&quot;.  But hope it helps you or someone.<br />
<br />
There are many places that a solid 50-60 group can go, get exp. and have shot at nice drops.  I tend to go to Allakhazam's site to research item drops and see what there is that 1-2 groups of folks can obtain, then I post a guild raid and lead the charge!!!<br />

P.S.  While not great, Kromriff Military Legs are very easy to get, have around 14 AC and 5 wis.  My guild outfitted at +40 level druids/shaman/bst with them a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meener</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I tried Teneb Mtns, but found my poison and disease spells were like 100% resisted, how did you hunt there?  <br />
<br />
Chardok is a good call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, the vampires do resist our DoTs (even if cast Malosini line on them), so I did not DoT.  I was in a guild group everytime I went there with lv. 45-58 folks.  Groups we had varied widely depending on the night, but usually 2 beastlords and myself formed core part of the group.  Sometimes we had 4 people, sometimes up to 8 (raid mode).  Pet's did a LOT of the damage.  Nice Bst katar weapon (sells for 8-10K in bazaar) drops there and a rare Bst spell, so they had incentive to be there.   We hunted only at the main Vampire castle/fort in tenebrous mountains.  After breaking spawns on the first floor, we would set up camp in the corner at the bottom of the staircase going up.  As we got more familiar with the place (and each gained a level or two) we began to set up camp on the second floor.<br />
<br />
Vampires can be invis, so keep a see invisible spell up on yourself and tanks/pullers, if not everyone in party.<br />
<br />
I slowed the mobs, kept our folks buffed with HoS, Stam, Regen (on main tank and me), Magic and Cold resist buffs, and healed.  Also, keep a cold based nuke loaded.  Most of the named vampires (the ones with wings :)  ) will try to gate when they get down to one bubble of health...we nuked them to death to prevent this.  When we got adds or multiple, we put pets all on one and tanks/melee's on the others...root parking others if more than 2.   Some of the nameds will NUKE your puller bad (one has Ice Comet spell) so high resists are a good thing and be ready to heal that puller!!!<br />
<br />
Oh, you can buy some vampire stakes in Katta that only cost a few pp and do bane damage against vampires.  Buy some and give them to pets :)<br />
<br />
I have to say, the loot here was truly fantastic.  Blue Diamonds, Diamonds, and other high end gems.  Tons of General Coterie Boots and Capes (sell for about 200-250 pp each on Torv. Server), Blood Weave pieces (some of which sell for 1-3K), and a few misc. other things.  We had a masterlooter loot all the generals and named vampires and would split up the goods after we finished camping.  Several of my guildmates got some very nice upgrades there (including two of those nice Bst Katar weapons) and we all made nice pp selling dropped equipment in the bazaar.  Good cash cow camp that is fun :)<br />

P.S.  Went to Chardok last night with 2 guildies.  Camped entrance and part of gatehouse.  We saw 2 Sarnak Battleshields drop in 3 hours.  We were the only ones in the zone.<br />
<br />
You might also think about bringing exp. group of guildmates to Old Sebilis.  I been meaning to do that myself lately.  Nice drops there (including ODS, gems, and shaman spells!!!) and the exp. not too bad.<br />
<br />
Everyone seems taken with the PoP zones and the great exp but to get equip. drops and good plat in exp. groups, you much better off in Kunark or Luclin zones.</div></div><hr />
