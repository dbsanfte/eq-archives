HoT = east wing of ToV<br />
First of all, factions.<br />
Stuff in first hallway and the three way is on CoV faction, and is not KOS to you if you are not KOS to CoV.<br />
Killing in HoT for armor doesn't change any factions, but EVERYTHING in HoT is KOS by default.<br />
WToV is entirely on CoV faction. You can walk through it unmolested.<br />
NToV is a bit different. The hatchlings are on CoV faction, but that's all. The rest is on GoV, which everyone is KOS to and there is no way to raise. You get -CoV, -GoV, and some -Yeli hits in NTOV.<br />
3 groups of 55 would be fine in HoT. Leave the other wings alone.<br />
Armor drop rates in HoT are much higher then Kael, as you may have seen. If your guild has not raided Kael Arena, get some practice there first.<br />
<br />
The most potent danger in HoT is gaters. Mana sieves are very important. If they gate, they will star tsummoning people. It's not fun, and it's usually a bad CR if your guild doesn't know how to handle it best, which just takes practice.<br />
Mobs generally hit pretty light. 300ish, sometimes less for max.<br />
Slowing them can be hard. Malo/s, sinia/s, occlusion / harmony of sound, and tash are very important. Get the debuffs in and get the mobs slowed or some of them will eat your tank alive.<br />
You probably need some levels and Skysrhine gear to attempt Dozekar, but you can start killing the other HoT named for Doze quest pieces.<br />
Pulls are pretty easy. I myself have pulled HoT many times, but if you can't handle adds, use a FD puller. Communication is the key to owning HoT.<br />
White wurms, blue drakes, glimmer drakes are gaters.<br />
Glimmer drakes are practically immune to Magic slow. Don't waste mana and aggro trying.<br />
<br />
If you haven't been to Kael before..like I said, hit up the arena for some Thurgadin quest gear and CoV faction gear. For a guild just starting HoT, it makes it a lot less hassle to be non kos to CoV.<br />
After that..you CAN farm Kael armor in WTOV but very few guilds do that and I don't recommend it, personally.<br />
Once you are mostly geared up in SS gear, start farming other mobs -<br />
Vindi, Velk, velious dragons, - kunark dragons can be good too -, doomshade, the other UP mobs, etc. There are plenty of threads on other targets you can take. Eventually you can start trying NTOV. With 65 and new spells it's a lot easier nowadays, most of it can be 1 grouped.<br />
<br />
Pulling guides for HoT can be found on monkly-business.com btw, they are pretty good :)<br />
Good luck :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The question becomes one of group composition and gear. I've done HoT with 11 people and we were hardly uber, so I'm sure it could be done with fewer. <br />
<br />
Do you have enough clerics for a decent CH rotation?<br />
<br />
Do you have a 60+ tank with good gear and a pile of hp?<br />
<br />
Do you have a 60+ slower? <br />
<br />
I'm sure that people will jump in and say that these things are not needed, that it's been done without them and that's probably true. We used to do HoT without a slower (well, I was only slower and I couldn't get anything to stick) but we also had like 30 people. <br />
<br />
There are a large number of threads on this subject that you should be able to find from the search feature. <br />
<br />
The conventional wisdom: <br />
<br />
- People are going to die, no matter what. Epic clerics are a big, big help<br />
- Don't open the door<br />
- Don't drag corpses<br />
<br />
Other tips:<br />
<br />
- Beware gating mobs and be ready to mana drain them<br />
- Beware unslowable mobs<br />
- Beware dispelling mobs<br />
- Make sure you have plenty of FD-capable people. They are needed to move corpses as well as pull. For small or lower-level raids, adds = total wipeout.<br />
<br />
Note:<br />
<br />
All the above is mostly based on the assumption that your three groups are going to be closer to 55 than to 65. If you have 1 lvl 55 and 17 lvl 65, then forget it and just massacre the place. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh yeah, btw. <br />
Most mobs have an AE, not racnars, but wurms and drakes do.<br />
Buff FR and CR and wear your resist gear :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To clear up how to move corpses, the FD person targets the corpse, then FD.  Then they drag it to them with /corpse, stands up and moves, rinse and repeat.  The dragons outside the HoT doors wont assist if you are fighting just inside the doors if the door is shut.  But if you drag a corpse while standing up, they will open the door, come in and eat you.  After Zemm kills you a few times, your love for CoV faction won't be as great as it used to be.<br />
<br />
Also, if for some reason you are just inside the door to HoT, door opens, and Zemm and his gang of dastardly dogooders comes in, stop doing anything.  Don't cast, don't heal.  Turn off attack, and just hope you didn't end up on the list of targets.  Just stand there and do nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok this is how Zemm works. A lot of people think the door is a rumor, a lot swear by it. I've figured out how it works.<br />
Pull a non AE mob. a Racnar. Open the door, fight it OUTSIDE directly BY ZEMM. hug zemm while you slash a racnar. He will not assist.<br />
Pull a mob with an AE. a wurm.<br />
Open the door and have the door open when the AE goes off.<br />
Zemm rushes in and slaughters.<br />
Just to be safe make sure people are in the habit of asking if its safe to open the door though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>malden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The most MR resistant mob you will find are the glimmer drake mobs (look like the dispelling critters in Skyfire). I rarely see a MR based slow land. We typically just Disease slow them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">NToV is a bit different. The hatchlings are on CoV faction, but that's all<br />
<br />
Just as a small correction, there are occasional random drakes in deep North who are CoV aligned. Guardians of Veeshan mobs don't raise Kromzek, but CoV ones do, so it isn't too hard to notice them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">This is about the best guide I've seen for HOT: <br />
<br />
http://www.geocities.com/waldi_waldmeister/<br />
<br />
It's somewhat outdated as to the number of people needed (with todays gear), but still has useful maps, tips, etc.<br />
<br />
Monkly business has a nice pulling guide for your monk/sk (or I guess whomever these days). It can be found here:<br />
<br />
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=168</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>greatmilenko_00</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I will ahve to say that HoT was really the turning point for my guild. We went from taking out mini bosses in UP, to doing Rumblecrush, grieg, and vindi.<br />
<br />
<br />
When going there dont expect to get many bps/legs those always seemed to be the most rare for use. Plate drops the most followed by Silk, chain, and lastly leather. (this is all personal experiance so it could be wrong)<br />
<br />
Once u get confortable with HoT, i highly suggest your crawl through it rather then pull mobs. This helps u in a few ways 1) You will end up getting more kills which=more armor, and 2) You want be screwed over by gaters. I swear we could push a white wurm across the damn room, while it was casting gate and it would still channel it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking of gate, if you dont understand how to push a mob, its very important to learn/teach. That was our primary way of stopping gaters<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm also learn to position casters/healers away from aoe's.<br />
<br />
dont jump in the firepots, not matter how fun it looks. I always got stuck, or somone would shrink me so i couldnt get out :)<br />
<br />
and finally get used to staring at those god forsaken walls, cause i know by the time we were done in ToV i was ready to gouge my eyes out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Dunno if this is true of HoT, because I sort of skipped that (guild did it while I was levelling up), but in WToV it APPEARED that certain types of armor dropped more frequently in certain parts of the zone.  I.E. after the fifteenth Leather Gloves in a row our pullers stopped pulling that hall, and the number of Leather Gloves dropped dramatically.<br />
<br />
This is purely anecdotal, no evidence at all, but we were sure convinced at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The least we've ever done hot before was 6.  Druid, Shaman, Enchanter, Sk, Ranger, and Warrior.  All but the warrior was 65, warrior was 56.  We did have a clicker camped just in case.  Never needed him tho.<br />
<br />
When we first started hot, a long, long time ago.  We'd have 30 or more.  Average level was 55 I think.  HoT has gotten alot easier with levels, and gear (I'm a badly equipped shaman, and even I have better gear that I ever would have dreamed back then).<br />
<br />
And, mana seive (coupled with the changes in mob casting put in place months ago) means we dont even bother pushing stuff in hot now.  We keep him pinned against one of the walls and just have the enchanter mana seive.  Havent had one gate that way ina long, long time.<br />
<br />
It would be very possible for your guild to do it.  It might be ugly the first few tries.  Especially as your pullers learn how to pull it.  But, once you get the hang of it, you guys shouldnt have to much trouble<br />
<br />
Oh, and you can only summon corpse from the zone in.  Might be important as you start out  :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what our guild ended up doing midway through our 2nd HoT raid and it worked wonders -- gone are your gating problems and no more stuck pulls in doorways. With 30 peeps it might be messy but we had only 18 so it wasn't too crowded as we crawled through. I wouldn't recommend though if you can't handle adds as we did get one occasionally. <br />
<br />
I can't wait to go back, wish we raided there more often. Just wish the walls were more intersting to look at, they need some dragon graffiti to read while staring at them :)</div></div><hr />
