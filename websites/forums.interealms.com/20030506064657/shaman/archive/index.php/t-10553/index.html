<br />
1/2/03 --- did Guardian Wurms for 2 hours 30 minutes today, at VP hallway, with a 62 necromancer, any myself a 59 shaman. We cleared the Elder Wyvern's with ease, slowing them (no malosini needed, always stuck), and sicking necro pet on them. Stuck epic dot, and if mana was good then JBB'd them to death. Dead in under 2 minutes each. 62 necro barely saw any exp, but mine moved a bit. We had 2 Guardian Wurms spawn over the course of 2.5 hours. Our tactics were for me to pull with Malosini, then slow, then sick necro pet and run around in circles. Necro established agro, and proceded to get summoned every 15 seconds. I helped keep GW dotted and heal necro as he was summoned. Necro also dotted and lifetapped to heal himself, and snared the GW as well. First GW was a close fight (both our first time). We ended each with about 2 health and 1 mana. Drops were Dru spell: Blizzard, and necro spell: Quivering veil of karn (?). Next GW we killed with 4 health and 2 mana remaining (much cleaner). No spells dropped. both spawned in the first hour, with none spawning the next 90 minutes. Note to self: tracker would make it much more efficient since we were pulling anything that moved cause of significant downtime (28min spawn time in VP hall with ~ 5 static spawns, and a couple wander out). Tracker would have allowed us to catch any wandering GW's. Overall exp for me was 1.5 blues in 59. Will try again tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
