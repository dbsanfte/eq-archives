Not sure why you'd say that.  The factions on Kunark make more sense to me than some of the others you'll find.  I do think the lore in Kunark is some of the best as well.  Velious came very close, maybe even a tad better.</div></div><hr />

I still want to donkey punch the developer who decided that evil races should have to ruin their Outpost Faction to hunt in Kunark.  It'd be like having Sebilis on Fiorna Vie faction.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really liked the legendary mob concept.  I was sort of hoping that they'd continually spawn new mobs in random dungeons from that point forward.  Maybe keeping them active for 2 weeks max before depopping the camp and creating a new one.  <br />
<br />
IMO, that would be a tremendous boon to EQ, to have more changing content.  Something as simple as a unique mob spawning every so often can't be that hard to do can it?  <br />
<br />
I beta tested Horizons early in its cycle, and the undead hordes attacking random towns, and having to fight back &quot;the blight&quot; was such a good concept.  Unfortunately, it didn't get implemented that well (along with a host of other problems).  But really, the idea of a changing world was great.  Now, I doubt eq is setup to handle daily changes all over, but surely they could pop a new mob someplace from time to time, with ultra unique gear.  That'd be great.<br />
<br />
They could even place mobs in the middle of nowhere, and leave clues as to where they were.  Like, you're selling crap at a merchant, and out of the blue, instead of saying, &quot;Hey there Ungkor, how bout a rusty dagger&quot;, the merchant says, &quot;Hey there Ungkor, I heard that a powerful wizard is harvesting swamp supplies in Innothule.  Travelers beware.  He's already killed many unwary adventurers&quot;.  Then, in the middle of Innothule swamp on an Island is a lvl 65 wizard that almost requires a raid force to take down.  <br />
<br />
I don't know, guess I&quot;m just getting a bit bored.  hehe.  But it seems to me, it sure wouldn't take much work to shake things up from time to time.</div></div><hr />

To come out with Lost Dungeons of Kunark would have required that players bought the Ruins of Kunark expansion and SoE can't make that kind of assumption.  <br />
<br />
Neat idea... but extremely doubtful you'd see something like that unless SoE decides to make Kunark free upgradable content.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">If they wanted to do it.. they could just give you Kunark free in the box in case you don't already own it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>temuchintehkhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">all the iksar/trakanon lore was originally intended to be troll lore, until they realized they wouldn't be able to squeeze all that stuff into release.  when brad and smed saw $$$ for an expansion they dusted off the kunark stuff, but since they'd already placed the trolls, they rolled with iksar.<br />
<br />
if you can get your hands on beta/pre-kunark stuff it's an interesting read.  allakazam has some of it but it's an incomplete collection<br />
<br />
you realize how many themes sony's popped and dropped over the years.  combine empire, rise of the ogres (pre-pop release), the troll tribes, velious giants, ring of scale, etc etc every expansion it's like they hire a new head designer who wants to put his own imprint on EQ lore.  would be nice to have some sort of coherence or consistency instead of feeling like you're playing a different game whenever you hit a different continent.<br />
<br />
blizzard has one guy (a senior designer) who is &quot;caretaker&quot; of warcraft lore.  another thing sony could do if they ever got thier heads out of their asses</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Warren Maguson Emarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, Grizlor, I remember the BST epic required Kunark but as I recall their excuse for that was epics were part of the Kunark expansion so therefore they felt it was within their purview to extend the Beastlord epic to Kunark as well.   <br />
<br />
As for other comments, I agree, they simply could give Kunark as free content considering it is an expansion 5 years old now.  But it does assume a number of things since the launch of EQ Classic.  Since we're just speculating and just tossing ideas around anyways, there's no real point belaboring this any longer.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Im going to ask the question: Who doesnt have at LEAST the Kunark expansion?  I started playing just after Kunark release, and my bundle was EQ+Kunark.  Every expasion since Luclin has had a &quot;Gold&quot; edition released that contained all the expansions to date.  I havent seen the $10 single CD Original EQ disc in a LONG time at any store and Im weird in that I always look for it (I dont know why).  I think Faern is right; if there ARE troglodytes left that dont have any expansions at all they are very few and very far between.  And if they have not purchsed an expansion yet then the chances of them picking up Lost Dungeons of Kunark are so slim as to not be statistically significant.<br />
<br />
This is SONY we are talking about here.  As we have already seen ANY chance to squeeze money out of the EQ empire is fair game.  Given the general popularity of the LDoN expansion and the propensity of EQ fans to buy every expansion, a LDoK expasnion would sell. So would a LFoV.   LDoL would start to reach the fall off point of interest, as many people werent that interested in Luclin lore.<br />
<br />
I think Sony is dealing with other things now, probably the expansion after OOW.  Time will tell.</div></div><hr />

Uhm....if these same people who only have classic EQ dont have LDON, then if they add Kunark LDON zones they wont see them either and the world in essence will remain the same in their eyes. I fail to see the problem with this. Adding new LDON themes based on ingame lore would make the game more enjoyable....so what if the people who dont own LDON wont get access to it. Their loss.</div></div><hr />

Yup, Bersererk epic also requires Kunark.  Heck, the main NPC for the entire epic process is located in Lake of Ill Omen.</div></div><hr />

Before more people jump on my back and hit me with dead fish, let me be clear, I'm all for the idea of The Shadowy Legacy of Lost Dungeons Luclin over Kunark.   Fantastic idea, wish SoE would expand previously existing lore and content instead of creating alien and alien spacecraft and unpronounceable names.<br />
<br />
<br />
All I am saying is you're unlikely to see new expansions that expand off anything other than the Classic EQ game and its original zones.   The reason is from a marketing point of view, they want to pander to the lowest common denominator.  What do ALL EQ players have in common, they have a computer with the classic EQ disc set on it?  <br />
<br />
From their point of view, its bad PR and bad business to 'force' someone to buy a pre-existing expansion (ie:  Kunark) set in order to play in a new expansion set.   Every expansion module to date has only required access to the original EQ game.  Basic business sense dictates they want as many people to be able to buy the new expansion as possible.   Not limit it only to those who bought Kunark.<br />
<br />
Yes, they could absolutetly give Kunark as a free download to all customers that don't currently have it.  In addition, I agree, there probably aren't many people out there that do not already have Kunark.   But these are all business decisions SOE would have to make and they have access to figures of which accounts both active and inactive have which expansions enabled.   <br />
<br />
Anyways, I'm not arguing for SoE not to do something, just explaining  the immediate rationale of why they wouldn't.   <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned Veksar but this is an entirely different point that I'm not debating.   Veksar is free content and SoE from a business standpoint, doesn't have to cater to the lowest common denominator.   From their point of view, they are rewarding people for buying Kunark which is well within their bounds as well.  <br />

About what, a month ago or so? Na, longer than that, but pretty recent, SOE put some heavy hitting mobs in old dungeons like Seb and Guk.  The mobs were way higher level than the surrounding content, and were dropping unique items like &quot;Fabled Jboots&quot; and such.  I believe the mobs were only active a week or two and haven't been seen since.<br />
<br />
Most servers seemed to indicate that all the spawns were steadily camped (friends waited 12 hours to get a shot at the jboots camp I think).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure if they fixed it on the last batch, but previously whenever they sent around the free keys they would enable all the expansion included with the keys for those that didn't have. I specifically remember a few friends using the free EQ trilogy key when that came out during Luclin to enable Kunark and Velious on their accounts.</div></div><hr />

Hehe, why do not they add zone / area of mobs named after well known SOE workers (characters they play more specifically). Make it well defended (hard hitting mobs and lots of them) and allow players that are not satisfied of the game as it is to raid it for spells / items. Would be interesting to see if spell designers would get swarmed before item makers or coders...  :p  Or would there just be total mayhem.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm.  I can agree with this, but just to provide a different perspecitve (devils advocate, if you will):<br />
<br />
How many players did they alienate when SOE swapped to DX9?  For weeks the boards here were filled with threads comaplining how players couldnt get on, the lag was terrible if they could, random LD's in certain zones, etc.  Did Sony HAVE to upgrade to DX9?  No.  They chose to upgrade to make their newest content look pretty.  Never mind the fact that a good, healthy percentage of the population affected by the change hadnt been to GoD yet, and possibly still hasnt.  If they were concerned with keeping things at the LCD Sony would have found a way to implement the graphic changes (or gotten new graphics) they wanted without the huge disruption to the playerbase.<br />
<br />
As I said before, if there are players that still have only the original EQ expansion the only money that Sony will ever get out of them is the monthly subscription fee.  If they have not, in 5 years and 8 expansions, upgraded yet they wont.  Sony can write them off as a source of expansion revenue and hope that those players keep paying the monthly subscription fee.  That leaves them free to design content for those that have purchased Kunark at the very least and up to LoY or GoD at the most.  <br />
<br />
The business practicallity of not leaving any source of revenue behind aside I cannot see the logic in limmiting a potential gold mine of capital because of a handfull of standouts.  THAT isnt good business sense.  Sony NEEDS to make money; its a business and thier business is making money.  Sure, they provide us with entertainment as a side track, but producing viable sources of income is goal number one.  Expansions like LDoKunark or LDoVelious could make them serious bank, considering the popularity of LDoN and the Kunark and Velious expansions.</div></div><hr />
