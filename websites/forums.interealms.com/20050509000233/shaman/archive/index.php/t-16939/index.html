<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I purchased an augment that added wis and then noticed that it is type 2 and I apparently have no item that accepts type 2 augments. My weapon has a type 4 slot but that does not work either.<br />
<br />
I need to know moe about this. I thought a type 4 would accept anything up to and including type 4.<br />
<br />
Live and learn.<br />
<br />
Do all pre LDON items have type one slots only (other than weapons)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">all armor has a type 1 slot, and all weapons have a type 4 slot.  I know of nothing that has otherwise unless its from LDON.<br />
<br />
armor is type 1, 2, 3<br />
weapons are 4, 5, 6<br />
<br />
so a type 2 will never fit in a weapon<br />
<br />
If the augment says it will fit in any slot (i think thats what they say) then it can fit in any 1-6 slot, but a type 1 only fits in a type 1 and a type 3 only fits in a type 3 and a type 5 only fits in a type 5 etc.  I believe there arent any type 6 augments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">type 8 wep armour etc aswell, PoTime loot though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yah it's very lame how you must purchase and WEAR LDoN armor to be able to use about 80% of the augments offered at the Adventure Merchants.<br />
<br />
What about those people who have better armor?  Is LDoN not for them?  This is very very poor planning on VI's part imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think this was the intent all along, doubles the amount of time you need to do in LDoN if you want a certain Augment, because you have to buy a piece of LD gear to equip it.  I was all keen to add a haste augment to my SKs gear, only to realise I would need to buy one of the best pieces of LD gear to put it on if wanted anything remotely close to what his Cultural armor is Stat wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Here is a guide<br />
Type 1 single stat only<br />
Type 2 Multiple stats(and ldon items only)<br />
Type 3 Worn Effects(Ldon items only)<br />
Type 4- Weapon procs<br />
Type 5-Single weapon enhancement(ldon items only)<br />
Type 6- Multiple weapon enhancement<br />
Type 8- Time items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually Ruatonim, there are a couple of weapons with slot type 2s on them.  Not many though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All of the weapons with type 2 are LDoN weapons.<br />
<br />
There are pre-LDoN weapons with type 1 slots, and there are a few pre-LDoN items with no augment slot at all. Fungi tunic, talisman of vah kerrath are 2 of those.<br />
<br />
Type 6 slots most definately exist. Higher end LDoN weapons have them. Type 6 is an increase-damage for weapons, but better than type 5. Type 5 is low power elemental increases, type 6 augments increase actual base damage, and sometimes have elemental damage too. +1 disease damage is type 5. +2 damage, +1 fire damage is type 6. These are LDoN exclusives.<br />
<br />
Type 8 is only on Time armor, and there have been (AFAIK) no Type 8 augments found, so the only thing you can put in Time armor are Any-Slot items. There's a fairly decent selection of those kinds of items. The +40 hp solid coal of prowess, or the +20 hp/mana pebble from Guk are both in this category.<br />
<br />
People with nice old armor don't benefit as much from augments as people who upgrade into LDoN armor, but they are hardly left out in the cold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just a rule of thumb on purchasing any single stat augments:<br />
<br />
DON'T!!!<br />
<br />
I have seen augs sporting every stat out there except AC and attack drop in &quot;normal&quot; adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Malek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe I missed it somewhere, but why is there no type 7?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have seen a type 8 augment (linked in-game).  It was a +70 mana aug.  I believe (not sure though) that it dropped from a hard mode raid.  Type 8 augs are only for Time gear; nothing else, and hard mode raids are designed for Time-equipped people.</div></div><hr />
