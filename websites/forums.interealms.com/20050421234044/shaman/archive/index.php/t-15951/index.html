<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">so, was just screwing around the other night on a pally alt.  have been heading up into tofs the past week, have almost all my keys, and been soloing on the floor with the wedding.  have not tried it with my shaman yet, but i would strongly recommend you all to go and try getting all your keys and traveling through the tower.  it is really a lot of fun, and when you do get to the wedding party, killing the golems repeatedly and the wedding party members is pretty decent experience (at least, with my pally it was.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Morel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Howler, what level is your Pally?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">47</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Do the keys stay on your ring?<br />
What level of TOFS is the wedding?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The ToFS keys are ring-able.  A lot of the tower is undead, which makes it ideal for pallies, not so great for a solo shaman.  That being said, I LOVE this place.  Corpse runs are absolute hell (especially once you get past the 4th floor, which is all mixed live and dead) - but completely worth it in my opinion.<br />
<br />
The wedding is the 5th floor, used to be a pretty busy place for the velium that drops off the golems pretty regularly.<br />
<br />
Also, each floor has an exit (great for emergencies) that plops you back in iceclad - in the middle of a couple whirling dervish paths.  Of course, there's absolutely nothing better than clicky sow boots in that case.<br />
<br />
I'll say that it's extremely easy to get keys if you bring a group and just clear the floor until the keyholder pops.  It's possible to get solo, but you have to be pretty patient for some floors...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for the first two keys...<br />
first floor: i camp out in the  room in the back left corner, and kill the dogs until the captain or whoever spawns.<br />
second floor: i camp out near the exit (far back on right, go through invis wall).  keep pulling mobs to you in that cubby area until angry librarian spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You kids ... back in the day there wasn't a key ring and when you died .. you have to beg and pled for people to come get you.  This is the VP of the 30's.  I used to come here a lot myself .. and yes the wedding party is a nice camp spot.  I would recommend TOFS for good players because this will be a nightmare if you not =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">one thing to be aware of...once a key goes on your keyring..destroy it immediately.  When i ran up the towers i got all keys up to 6 and then stupidly destroyed a few of the high level floors and kept 1,2,3 and then next thing i know i was running up the tower and it added TOFS 3 to my keyring and i lost 4,5,6 and had to camp them again.  Eventually i got the master key, but it was a big annoyance to lose the keys.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Key Ring?  Huh?  What?  I missed something in my 8 month hiatus.  Is this something that magically 'flags' you for keys?  Or is it an actual container you put keys into and somehow combine and then you have a sort of skeleton key that has access to everything you've put on it?  If so where can I get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yep.  One of those insanely handy patches... The command to check your keyring is /key.<br />
<br />
It's not actually in your inventory.  When you use a ring that's capable of fitting on your ring, it'll display on this /key list.  E.g. if you zone into ToFS, get your first floor key, run to the mirror, click your key on the mirror, and say /key - it'll say ToFS floor 1.  Now you can destroy that key.<br />
<br />
This works for most every key - with a few notable exceptions, none of which I can list because I don't have them.  *grin*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Vesik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Sweet.  Gonna log my rogue in and use all his keys to free up some bank space, ToFS keys were far too many.  Even if the OS key works on there or the HS key I don't think I'd want to destroy them.  It's only one space :).  Tserrina's master can stay too :P<br />
<br />
Thanks much, now to get my shaman some keys.</div></div><hr />
