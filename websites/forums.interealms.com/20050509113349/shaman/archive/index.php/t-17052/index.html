So, someone explain it to me again.  How is this new &quot;slot 7&quot; augment going to work?  Is it true that all of our pre-LDON gear (not weapons) will now have a slot 7 augment? If I could augment any of my old gear with this BA 4 item I would be so happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guild doesn't do VT anymore and we rarely do Saryn, so I'm really happy to have this opportunity to earn a BA item.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">according to the website, the Burning Affliction augment - Bloodied Ore of Vengeance - is being changed to NOT be a type 7 augment anymore.<br />
<br />
They did not specify what it would be changed to, but I imagine type 3 or type 8.  Either way, it's probably not going to be able to go on a belt of dwarf slaying.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ragathor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I had bought thte 40hp aug and turned it in today at the request of Absor ;p.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that for sale the same place I had bought my hp aug.  So, needless to say I have it joined at the head.  Most of my other slots I will want to upgrade sooner than my helm slot.  I have elem helm and love the Faerune effect too much to give it up.  So I put the aug on the helm to further deter me from wanting to upgrade that slot for a while.  For a moment I thought about putting it on elem pants since effect is Pox and it seemed fitting but didnt in the end.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
Just read the above post.  Wonder what they going to do to me that I have already bound the item to a Slot 7 item.</div></div><hr />

Update Tonight to fix some Augmentation errors - Oct. 9, 2003 <br />
<br />
During the update last night, some augmentations were given the wrong slot type. Obviously we don't want anyone to purchase an item that we will be changing tonight, so we have killed off all of the Adventure Merchants. The items that will be affected are: <br />
<br />
Peerless Shard of Might <br />
Peerless Jewel of Nimbleness <br />
Peerless Gem of Deftness <br />
Peerless Sphere of Fortitude <br />
Peerless Gemstone of Knowledge <br />
Peerless Fragment of Intellect <br />
Peerless Crystal of Enticement <br />
Peerless Pearl of Magical Warding <br />
Peerless Ruby of Fiery Warding <br />
Peerless Diamond of Chilling Protection <br />
Peerless Opal of Illness Warding <br />
Peerless Emerald of Poison Protection <br />
Polished Ore of Power <br />
Obsidian Fragment of Durability <br />
Ruby Sphere of Intellect <br />
Tainted Shard of Ingenuity <br />
Sparkling Quartz of Resistance <br />
Hardened Slate of Protection <br />
Gleaming Prism of Destruction <br />
Bloodied Ore of Vengeance <br />
Gravestone of Aggression <br />
Polished Sandstone of Ire <br />
Cold Slimestone of Fury <br />
Radiant Ore of Combat <br />
Radiant Diamond of Assault <br />
Radiant Orb of Aggression <br />

Radiant Slimestone of Retribution <br />
Radiant Orb of Dark Sight <br />
Radiant Prism of Perception <br />
Radiant Gravestone of Endurance <br />
<br />
<br />
We also changed the slots on some LDoN armor. Some people ended up with armor and augmentations for them that they didn't want. We will be changing it so that the existing copies of those items will be as they were before the update. New ones that the adventure merchants sell will have the post-update changes. Here are the items affected: <br />
<br />
Ring of Cold Precision <br />
Necklace of Hardened Mud <br />
Scion Face Mask <br />
Mantle of Frantic Spirits <br />
Belt of Mottled Troll Hide <br />
Bloodied Tome of the Exorcist <br />
Wickless Sand Candle <br />
Golden Hoop Earring of the Masters <br />
Necklace of Dementia <br />
Trueborn Cloak of Gray Flesh <br />
Shawl of the Deranged <br />
Orb of the Sundered Spirit <br />
Flowkeeper's Gemsetting Toolset <br />

Incorporeal Gauntlets of the Specter <br />
Incorporeal Chain of the Specter <br />
Incorporeal Greaves of the Specter <br />
Incorporeal Boots of the Specter <br />
Mucus-Drenched Headband <br />
Mucus-Drenched Sleeves <br />
Mucus-Drenched Manacle <br />
Mucus-Drenched Gloves <br />
Mucus-Drenched Tunic <br />
Mucus-Drenched Leggings <br />
Mucus-Drenched Sandals <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Skullcap <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Sleeves <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Bracelet <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Gloves <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Robe <br />
Immortal's Bloodied Leggings <br />

<br />
We apologize for the downtime tonight and the disruption these changes may have caused some of you. <br />
-------------------------------------<br />
Expect most, if not all of the &quot;effect&quot; augments that can now fit into type 7 to be changed back to type 3 aka LDON only.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if SOE will make up their mind sometime in the next three weeks. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>ratoan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">So whats the deal on the BA IV item now? still in same spot and what slot is it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Type 3 tends to be where most focus effects get lumped and is really only found on LDoN vendor armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Was this all/all or annother lousy int/wis caster only?  Hybrids got left out in the cold on the ER4 aug at least; haven't had a chance to look at the usable classes on the new batch of augs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">How friggen hard to they have to make it to get a fricken BA4 item? Nukes can pickup basic focii cheap in the bazaar, but they finally put one in worth using for us then change it immediately. Lame</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">The augment was on my cursor when I logged in. It is now type 3. There was no refund option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">lame -- now in addition to buying this, you also need to buy a piece of ldon armour.  Since I would only buy LdoN armour that is an upgrade, that puts me in the position of needing to do 20 more Miraguls adventures so that I can buy the incorporeal legs, THEN do more Rujark so I can buy this burning affliction focus item.  Hooray for timesinks.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Don't worry, its even more fun for people who bought the BAIV focus and have no intention of buying LDON armor/items. 1150 down the hole. I'll have to take out my frustration with getting some clerics killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Daegul Mistweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The augment was on my cursor when I logged in. It is now type 3. There was no refund option.<br />
<br />
Useable classes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">There are other nice items (nice being relative, I am pre-elemental) that have type 3 slots.  I've  seen shoulder, neck, finger, face, ear and waist slots.  If you went to VT, this timesink is not much different compared to the time it takes to get keyed for VT.  Most of this gear is decent and I'm sure it wouldn't kill anyone to cough up a bracer slot for a:<br />
Wristband of the Incorporeal +23 AC +6 Agi +4 Wis +4 Cha +3 vsMg +3 vsFire +5 vsCold +3 vsPos +70 HP +70 Mana +2.50 Wt with 2 type 2 slots and a type 3.<br />
Honestly, with all the timesinks raid guilds go through, I can't see how this would be any worse.  With the right Augs, this isn't that big a hit from a rune of Judgement IMHO from a stat perspective and BA4 is better than FT1.<br />
<br />
Not trying to be rude or anything, I just don't see the difference between the timesinks and I see the reward as about par.</div></div><hr />

Finally got my crownlast night, RAR!<br />
<br />
I will prolly push for the BA4 aug. After all, its not that far away after Bane. Prolly put it in a Guk bracer (760). Good enough, and a 1, 2 and 3 slot.</div></div><hr />
