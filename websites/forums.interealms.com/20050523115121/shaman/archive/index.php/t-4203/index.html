<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im trying to get one of these . i read that they drop in kael randomly. well my guild has been raiding kael quite alot recently and i have yet to see one of these . they arent listed as rare or ultra rare on any site . just uncommon . you would think i woul dhave found one.<br />
<br />
so all you poeple that have/had one . how did you get it ?  i dont wanna know that you bought it , cause i just bought a jbb and simply cant afford it .  so ... what did it drop off of? any other known sighting ?  thnx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sordia Winetrsbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mine dropped in Riffs.<br />
<br />
Edit: about the 10th time we were in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the riffs ?<br />
<br />
is that a place inside kael ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Check the Bazaar on your server. Highest I have seen them go for on Xev was 2k and I got mine for a heck of a lot less than that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">These do NOT drop in KD randomly. They drop of one very specific type of mob in Iceshard keep (where the 9th Coldain ring cycle is). Some servers call this the &quot;plate cycle&quot; some call it the &quot;9th ring cycle&quot; some call it &quot;iceshard keep&quot; some call it the &quot;small throne room&quot;. <br />
<br />
The mob that drops the REIF can spawn in the throne room along the sides or can spawn in the first room opposite the throne and up the stairs. The mob that drops at the spots marked &quot;I&quot; on the map I've linked to below. He seems to rarely spawn with the spear -- you'll be able to see it if he's holding it.<br />
<br />
The good news is that you can do the 9th ring cycle while you're here. It's not very difficult at all, and can be quite rewarding in terms of faction and drops (but only quest plate drops in this area). <br />
<br />
<br />
Read &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mikeshea.net/everquest/iceshard.html&quot;&gt;THIS EXCELLENT GUIDE&lt;/a&gt; for info on how to do the quest and how to get to Iceshard.<br />
<br />
Can be done with a single group of 60s, or two groups of mid to low 50s.</div></div><hr />

So we went to manor - pulled an oracle who was holding a spear and I got it.  Im fairly sure it will only drop off oracles, any oracle will do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In dungeons, you can't use your horse and you usually can't sit down, so you may as well poke :)</div></div><hr />

I can't remember the name of the one I got it off of, but he was not an Oracle.  I think he was a Stormcrafter or something.  Not an Icechanter though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not if you're Iksar !! <br />
<br />
REIF+Fungi/IKKY BP+Haste+Pet, good for Iksar = indoor or outdoor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">actually I think reif and jbb don't go to well together - what use is a fast weapon when you have a 80 delay between hits anyway.  Since the pure caster &quot;one delay after spell&quot; penalty does not apply to the jbb effect, a high damage weapon,  or maybe a BSH with a high damage proc, would be more efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On tunare its called the ice house.  Its easy to find, there are really only 3 places to raid in kael.  The arena, the bank, and the ice house.  So if your raid isnt doin the arena or the bank, then you know your in the right place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Why not just do your epic instead? It can be easily finished within a weeks time by just about any guild thats planes capable.And if youre doing Kael arena a trip to fear and the hole and the final bit in COM shouldnt be too much for your guild to handle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">fyi:  I swapped out my REIF for a Di'zok Sceptre of Authority.  Decent ratio (10/20), okay stats (+5 wis/int, +25 mana, +5 vs mgic), 10 AC (helped me get to 1000 ac self-buffed- yay!), and the ability to say &quot;RESPECT MY AUTHORITA !!&quot; while attacking.  ;)<br />
<br />
Less DPS, but shaman melee bites anyway after the mid 40s.  If I want to do between-JBB swings, I'll use a big two hander.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sumadra, I'd probably go for one of the old standards.  All these are fairly inexpensive (ie, 200p or less on Bristlebane last week or so) and seem prevalant in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
- Slime Coated Harpoon 10/25 +5 Wis +10 Mana<br />
* Bogling Chief Spear 10/26 +5 DR/PR (not an old standby, but all over)<br />
- Howling Harpoon 13/35 +6 Wis +40 Mana, Stun (also range slot)<br />
- Jade Chokidai Prod 11/30 +3 Sta +6 Wis<br />
- Spine Chill Spear 10/28 +3 Sta + 6 Wis +10 CR, Shock of Ice (30+ pts, procs late 30s I think; I used this til epic)<br />
- Darksea Harpoon 20/28 +5 Str +5 Wis +20 Mana +5 DR<br />
<br />
There are tons of others, for a full list try<br />
