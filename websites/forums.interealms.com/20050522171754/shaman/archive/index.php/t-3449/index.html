<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, I saw a similar post on the Champions of Cabilis site, and thought it was hilarious.    Only a couple of these are ripped off from their lists :D<br />
<br />
Everyone knows the REAL last words - &quot;LOADING, PLEASE WAIT&quot;.<br />

<br />
10. You say &quot;I'll take the add&quot;<br />
<br />
9. You wince.  You have died.<br />
<br />
8. You say &quot;Let's go a little farther in&quot;<br />
<br />
7. Your spell fizzled.  Your spell was interrupted.  Your spell fizzled.  Your spell was interrupted.<br />
<br />
6. Taunting attacker, master.<br />
<br />
5. You say &quot;Pull the named&quot;<br />
<br />
4. You say &quot;I'm pretty sure he's slowable&quot;<br />
<br />
3. You become visible.<br />
<br />
2. You say &quot;40 mana, that's good enough, go ahead and pull&quot;<br />
<br />
1. You say &quot;afk for a minute, brb&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
couple more:<br />
<br />
1) You say 'They're just greenies.'<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Setantha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">When I used to play DAoC there was a group of us hunting in Spindelhala. The pulling was non-stop and the experience was great. We had a well-balanced group comprising a Thane (Puller), Skald, 2 Warriors, Berserker,Runemaster, Shaman and a Healer. Meanwhile Thane keeps pulling and after a few pulls I notice the warriors are running low on health. Next pull the Thane brings 2 adds...we are shouting for the Healer to MEZ MEZZ MEZZ. The Runie gets an add on him and the Shaman roots it and the Runie backs off..but backs off too far and bumps into another aggro and brings that as well. The shaman is rooting everything in sight, the warriors are screaming for heals, the Runie meanwhile has legged it, the 2 Thanes are trying to peel adds off the shaman and everything has gone to s***. Miraculously, after about 4 mins of fighting we drop all 4 mobs and we start cheering. No-one can believe it. The only death was the Runemaster who managed to train himself while trying to find the exit. As we sit down to recoup some hps the Healer announces ''Back''. Simultaneously everyone types the same thing...<br />
<br />
''Back ??????????? What do you mean back??''<br />
<br />
The Healer had announced some time before that he was going AFK but no-one had seen the message.</div></div><hr />

Got to see this a few times in NToV. Generally I'd get one-two max, tickeddrake_05 FLURRY messages before I died. Once I even got 3 before it killed me (missed most of the attacks in one flurry)<br />
<br />
Or what was even better, 2 mobs get pulled, a flurry and a regular, and I get the flurry slowed, it fires off around 1500 damage on me, and our MT gets it off of me....great, but then I get summoned by its non-flurry buddy who notices I am low on heath. Think I only lost about 3 blue that weekend. Better than being our MT. Sheesh he lost alot! <br />

No worries. Just a DT. We laughed, we snickered, we never let him forget it. Now, who better to CR the Monk than the Paladin right? We're overpowered (nerf Bards!). We're unstoppable. We need no one. MoBs see us, suicide and give us their loot. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">This happened with my troll warrior several years ago.<br />
<br />
We were in Oasis and were resting on P2 after killing some crocs.<br />
We had a wiz in the group and as we were looking at Cazel he cast a fire ball at him.  You could see the fire ball shoot out and instead of casting it on a croc he targeted Cazel by mistake.<br />
<br />
Same wiz a few months ago we were working on fellow guild member quest.  Instead of casting the port to wherever we should have gone he cast the SF port.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">basically, after Malo, tash and ooc go in we all try twice and one of us lands it, usually first try<br />
<br />
In ToV I always chain malosini after malo.  If malosini don't stick, I normally won't slow unless desperate times call for desperate measures.  2 reasons for this:<br />
1) Malosini causes barely any aggro.<br />
2) By the time it sticks, MT should have sufficient aggro to ignore your first slow attempt, either resisted or landed.<br />
<br />
As for the last lines, my favourite is getting a mob near death and reading the following:<br />
Your Turgurs Insects has worn off<br />
Your Evenomed Bolt has worn off (or Bane)<br />
Your Curse of the Spirits has worn off<br />
<br />
Hasn't it ever happened to you that you're more than comfortable on mana, but that you refuse to slow a mob because it's near dead and that you think you can finish it off before turgurs wears off, except it does wear off and he kills you in 2 seconds with like 100 hp's left? <br />
<br />
And don't get me started on first island PoA, I think I've done it all, AE spells, duels, and the infamous Sirran the Lunatic.  Tell him to go away and watch his reaction :D <br />
<br />
Also, I remember this one Ixiblat encounter.  Cleric was like &quot;Don't worry, I'll keep you healed bro&quot;.  5 minutes later...  Ready for rez?  Mind you, I died after having slowed him and chloroblasting myself once after :mad: <br />
<br />
Others worth mentionning:<br />
- Instead of &quot;One last pull, and then we'll quit for the night.&quot;, I'd often say &quot;let's end this raid in style!&quot;.<br />
- With my monk, &quot;Dude, I read Monkly Business, if I FD 5 times, I'll wipe aggro&quot;<br />
- &quot;Lemme pull, I'm feeling frisky&quot;<br />
- &quot;I'm drunk yo!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup...I can't recall any juicy blunders lately (except mistargetting dogdog in LDoNs when the pac/puller has switched from his most recently pacied target to what he's gonna pull, always a joy to send dogdog solo into hostiles and pull a few extra) but the &quot;just one/a few more has bitten me more times than I can count.&quot;  It also seems that when you use that awful phrase that you're most often way out in the middle of nowhere so that the CR is lengthy or dangerous.<br />
<br />
Early in LDoN someone in my groups would often say:<br />
<br />
&quot;what's that box/barrel/crate/chest for?&quot;<br />
<br />
...and wipe a perfectly good group.<br />
<br />
My first run at EQ (release til just before Kunark) I played a DE wizard...and he had some nice ones.  The best one was during a multi-group mini-raid of lower guk to get some drops (this was way back in ancient times when guk drops were actually awesome gear).  We had worked our way nice and deep and I accidentally hit my evac button.  I was running all over, jumping, bouncing off of walls and the spell still went off (this was before ducking was an auto-cancel).  I was mortified.  &lt;sigh&gt;  back in those days all casters did research and just getting runes to attempt making ice comet was a big deal.  Now you can buy IC in the bazaar for 20p.  &lt;gets all nostalgic&gt;<br />
<br />
Along similar lines, a druid I was doing LDoN with a few weeks ago accidentally succored the group two times in a row wiping out everybody's pets and mana in the process.  The group was not very amused.  The druid had switched up spell slots or something and had hotkey issues.<br />
