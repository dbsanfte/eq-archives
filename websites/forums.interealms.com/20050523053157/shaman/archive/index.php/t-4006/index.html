<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently made a monk to box with my shaman.  got him up to  40 real fast doing SolA  but seems i cant find anyplace that has good exp for him anymore.  I tried DL and other zones i did when i Lvl my shammy.  Maybe im just used to his exp going up fast due to low lvl.   Where did you lvl your alts at ?    I thought about having him fd in FG  while i solo shrooms =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kedge for PL purposes - he will rip through MOBs like no tomorrow. I was duoing Ranger / Cleric - Monk / Shaman should be much better with slows and DS potions.<br />
<br />
If Kedge isn't your cup of tea and you still need Epic pieces, head to CoM and do Stables.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't appeal to you and you want mindless exp, try DL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">City of Mist is great XP for your low to high 40's, I think there is quite a large ZEM (zone experience modifier) there. Personally I hate water zones, so I'd stay away from Kedge myself, but there is a big ZEM there too since it's like the least visited zone in EQ behind maybe Kerra Isle hehe.<br />
<br />
Other places I can think of that aren't too crowded: The Hole is the zone with the highest ZEM in the game at around 40% bonus I believe, XP there is amazing. Karnor basement when you get your monk to high 40's, the XP will be rockin' for your monk and if you want to duo him there instead of PL I think it's still decent XP at lvl 60. Hardly ever camped anymore I think. Yeti caves in Dreadlands are good XP as well for your 40's, and should be lotsa mobs around.<br />
<br />
Fungus grove is also a pretty nice choice, since your monk is level 40 now he'll get XP while group with your level 60 main, so you can either just duo shrooms with him or have him FD while you solo them. It'll be slower for him than straight up powerlevelling, but your shaman will still make decent XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Odinson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">COM is my home with my monkie...leveled him to 51...so far run 3, regen 3, bandage 3 and pooling the rest.<br />
<br />
Get the gazeebos when you are doing 50+, and try to keep them cleared and the 2 sides as well and beat the spawn time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why didn't anyone say SolB? I cut through my levels pretty quickly doing Kobolds there.<br />
<br />
Stay out of DL. It's the worst experience I've yet to have anywhere in the game.<br />
<br />
The Hole would rocket you up provided you're PLing him. The ZEM is really insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">CoM = 17% ZEM<br />
Hole = 22% ZEM<br />
<br />
CoM was v. nice 45 shaman soloing. Hole i have yet to try and solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">if ur pl him then try droga from 40 to 46, ok maybe the mobs are ave lvl of 35 but u should be able to rip thro them fast!  Pls if ur inclined u can start the chadok quests: hard tho if ur an iksar monk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd have to agree with oogha, good xp in nurga and droga, and you get a headstart on the chardok faction needed for those sweet quests :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Dawnshroud Peaks, Tenenbrous Mtns, Echo Caverns Taskmaster camp, Katta. Very easy, very fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Excidium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thanks for all the tips.   reason i never said anything about SolB is that it is always overcamped and not many mobs to fight. will prob head back to Com  or try  lguk and camp raster while he gets exp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>brett_sc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot;camp raster while he gets exp&quot;<br />
<br />
If you're planning to get his epic, or even if you're not sure, do this. Do it while you can get 6+ levels at the same time. If you do it when its all green, you'll probably just buy a 15k MQ, unless you get really lucky and get him quick.<br />
<br />
If you're gonna do a 50+ hour camp, take 6 levels away with you :)</div></div><hr />
