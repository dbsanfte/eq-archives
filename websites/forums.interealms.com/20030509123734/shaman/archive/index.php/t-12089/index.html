<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sorry that i dont have any pretty maps to show you or anything but if you are a little familiar with the zone you should be able to follow my directions.<br />
<br />
After you zone in you head to the wall and start to go towards the hobgoblins. If you dont know the hobgoblin camp maybe your familiar with how to go to the docks camp?<br />
Anyway head towards the hobgoblins and cross the river after crossing the river stay with the wall on your left. Head towards the hedge, pass the hedge (keep wall on the left) be careful of some guards at a door a little ways passed the hedge. Just keep the wall on your left and you will eventually come to the city. Sitting on top of the fences at the city are the gargoyles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grubgrub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know where the docks are so I kinda see where to go thx i'll give it a try</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nurakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have found few Gargs that I can single pull with my 65 warrior.  They seem to come in bunchs, so unless you have good crowd control it's not a pretty sight.</div></div><hr />
