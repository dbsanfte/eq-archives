<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syncmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I see alot of posts about places to solo at 55, but how about some places to group at 55?<br />
<br />
Recently i've been grouping in Sirens Grotto with my guild and the xp is pretty darn good, but the chances of finding a pick up group there is pretty slim. Usually when I want to find a pick up group I end up in PoJ at the exit, but the xp is really starting to get thin now at 55.<br />
<br />
Anyway I guess its kinda hard to tell people where to group since it depends on the server ( play on Prexus ), but some general ideas would be very welcome.<br />
<br />
PS: Dont have LDON</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get LDON :)<br />
Honestly, that's going to be your best bet for grouping at your level.  The first tier planes are a bit emptier than they used to be, and you're not quite ready to tackle the level-restricted tier 2 ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 55 i would say PoJ and PoI are the easiest to group in.  there is almost always a group or 2 in ZI for PoI and 2 groups at ZO in PoJ.  Exp will be ok probably better then solo.  PoN would be good but finding groups is alittle harder, hobo are awesome exp at 55 but might be too high for you to slow.  Since you are 55 tier 2 zone would rock for exp but u will ahve alot of resist.  If you could get in a Outer group in PoV would be awesome exp probably 3% per 2 kills.  My mage at 57 was getting 1% per 2 kills in a aggro group.  People say LDoN but i kinda disagree.  If you can get into a level 55 dungeon u will get good exp but if you get in a level 50 dungeon u will get about 7% an adventure.  7% for 90 mins sucks if you ask me.  At 55 u will have problems getting into a 55 dungeon group because the high 50's guys are trying for a 60 level group.  Just grind them out in POP.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LDoN is good consistant exp but so is any tier plane.  What LDoN gives you is non-competition zones for an hour.  BUT LDoN isnt for everyone .. some people don't like the encouinters .. some people dont have 2 hours that they can sit in a group.  And the biggest peev is that it often takes just as long to setup the encounter as it does to run it.  <br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who has been around a long time ... ya know back before we had a % marker for exp ... Whats good exp?  1% per kill?  1% per 5 kills?  and what lvl of group?  there are so many factors but your missing the biggest one that I believe makes all the difference .. are you having fun?  Some days we get awesome groups and other days we get **** groups .. some days I get awesome exp and other days nada ... I have been duoing in HS the last few days and the entire time I was there there was a group of 5 guildies who were all hammering out exp and loot.  Thats fun in a group.  I dropped my duo to hook up with them .. thats having fun vs getting good exp, which btw has kinda fallen off at 56, in HS anyway.<br />
<br />
Getting back to your original post .. after 55 exp does slow down if your a pick up group type of person.  You need to hammer exp out to 60 and to do this is get a group and hit SG ... people like to be lead so lead them somewhere .. get LDoN and you will get groups quicker .. not exp but groups =)  At 55 HS, SEB, Hole ... PoJ, PoN, PoI ... Outside SSra or even inside .. Kael or SS.  Really at 55 you have so many spots ... you just need to find you crew, try to join a guild.<br />
<br />
If you had LDoN you would get lots of requests ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i got lucky....got an invite to pov outer at 55 !!<br />
<br />
60 something mage debuffed with malos so i could slow; great exp and the scariest grp i ever been in.<br />
<br />
did die couple times, but was soon 56 !<br />
<br />
2 days later i got pick up grp in torment, which was even more scary!!  Soon retreated back to sebilis for a rest LOL<br />
<br />
good times )<br />
<br />
my fav spot is now chadok mines, but u need a STRONG grp of 55 to 60, maybe even a 60+ in there too.  The tormented miners near roland the quest rat *squeak *squeak are heaps of fun, and fairly easy once slowed. However some of them enrage!!<br />
<br />
[the trash mobs here are 47+ but most are lvl55 eg all miners, the named mobs are 55/56 ]  they have big agro range so u need some form CC<br />
<br />
TIP - the 5 mobs around the herby hut can be pulled without agoing the 3 inside.<br />
<br />
DOnt go here if u dont have a non kos guildy/frind for cr. Unless u are going with a necro.  This is one cr u DO NOT wanna do naked!!<br />
<br />
take a bard or rogue-  actually got the mask to drop this week )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I love LDoN but at 55/56 the xp is only really remarkable for me if my group is doing high difficulty adventures.  On normal diff I might get half a yellow...on high diff I'll get more like a full bub.  To me that's decent xp for the time spent.  I happen to belong to a chat channel of LDoN lovers and if we have a group that's all or mostly from the channel we usually do a high diff.  Last night our group beat a normal diff slaughter of 52 in 45 or so minutes...then we barely beat a high diff slaughter because we got cocky and had a slight mishap near finishing.  So, I mostly do normal diff LDoN for fun, adventure points, and minimal xp on the side and prefer high diff if I'm wanting xps.<br />
<br />
I'm still a planes noob and should try for more planes groups.  I've only been to PoN and that was many levels ago.  I did some PoJ with my BL duo friend but it sucked with tons of adds due to our pull spots.<br />
<br />
I duo with a BL in Acrylia Caverns and the xp seems to be pretty good...and the loot is decent too...and you get boatloads of acrylia which can bring in extra cash depending on your server's acrylia economy.  We did a 5 person group there once and xp was flowing nicely.  There are rarely any people in AC so you can just pull away.  I don't watch my xp bar that closely so I can't say with precision, but I seem to get about 1-1.5 yellows and 1-1.5k in plats per 3-4 hour run we do there (and I could be getting more plats for my acrylia but I sell it at a slight discount to my partner who has a smith - more acrylia for him to skill on and fast selling for me without cluttering up my trade mule).  Groups there should see similar returns as you can just pull more and faster.  AC is fun for us to as a duo (and BL/shaman duo seems to rock in general).  We often deal with 2-3 pulls and roamer adds on top of that - it keeps you on your toes.<br />
<br />
So, my advice would be to find a lesser visited dungeon appropriate for your group's level and go to town.  Most xp is gonna be fairly similar except maybe the planes where the difficulty is also gonna be hihger, so I think the key for good group xp is more about being able to pull constantly with little downtime.</div></div><hr />
