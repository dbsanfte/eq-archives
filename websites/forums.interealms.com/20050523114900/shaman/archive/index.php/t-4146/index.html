<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Judlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just noticed this the other night fighting in KC, I know that i have been able to land jbb on pets before, but now all of a sudden it gets resisted every time.  Any one else notice this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed the same thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I noticed the same thing, on a super green pet- put it this way- two hits killed his owner... then three complete resists in a row on the pet.  Finally I just based the thing to death.<br />
<br />
I figured it was the new pet resists... I know they changed something... so it stands to reason that they broke something else.<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loradenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If it was a shaman pet, weren't they made immune to cold with the resist changes on pets? Please correct me if I am wrong. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This happened to me on pets in the crypt  after malosini.  They resisted my jbb every time.  This was a week or so ago, and i didn't pay it any attention until now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i've also noticed cold spells not working on a very green chanter pet...got mad and just fried him with a EB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Xi Vius pets (skeletons) in ME resisted my JBB yesterday, which reminded me of this thread. They didn't resist the Epic DoT though, so it must be a cold resist thing.</div></div><hr />
