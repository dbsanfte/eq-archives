<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Found this Interview with Brad McQuaid (http://www.homelanfed.com/index.php?id=24076)  rather humorous. He seemed to take a few jabs at the current market especially EQ:<br />
<br />
HomeLAN - What gameplay features do you think are unique and important to the game?<br />
<br />
<br />
Brad McQuaid - There are quite a few, some of which we’ve revealed and many of which we’re keeping under wraps for competitive reasons, and so that we can test them, and so that we can maintain anticipation for the game by revealing more and more information over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I’ll go ahead and list several, in no particular order:<br />
<br />
<br />
A truly seamless yet still detailed world; a world that’s fun to explore and where if you can see a place, you can most likely get there.<br />
<br />
<br />
A ‘dual sphere’ system in which you choose both an adventuring and a crafting class for your character, and where adventuring and crafting are intertwined into an interesting and compelling interdependent relationship.<br />
<br />
<br />
A game built on a traditional MUD and MMORPG foundation, where problems seen in the past are addressed primarily by tweaking and adjusting as opposed to throwing out (e.g. no ‘instancing’ but players still doing dungeon crawls, and making travel more fun without having to resort to easy teleportation (just to name a few)).<br />
<br />
<br />
A detailed and in-depth traditional High Fantasy world led by Art Director Keith Parkinson, who not only painted several of the first EverQuest box covers, but also many fantasy and science fiction novels as well as several of the earlier D&amp;D module covers.<br />
<br />
<br />
A development team (programmers, artists, and designers) with an unparalleled degree of experience in making and maintaining massively multiplayer games and expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
An emphasis on traveling and vehicles, in which the player will own horses and ships early on in their play experience and use those vehicles for travel, item storage, and combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
A challenging, tough, but very rewarding game designed to entertain players for years, not days or months. We don’t think challenging and tough mean that a game has to be tedious, and we think there’s been a trend lately to appeal to more gamers by ‘dumbing down’ massively multiplayer game mechanics. This won’t be the case with Vanguard and we will provide content for casual gamers, average gamers, and the ‘hard core’ or ‘power gamer’ too.<br />
 <br />
<br />
Pretty amazing they already have a playable alpha after only 18-20 months and showed it off at E3. Granted they had lots of experience and code already but this game sure looks nice. Can't wait for beta and release let's hope M$ doesnt drop the ball and crush them like they have done in the past to other titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Let's not forget Brad's HISTORY.  <br />
<br />
1) Class and Race exp penalties. <br />
<br />
2) A truly seamless yet still detailed world; a world that’s fun to explore and where if you can see a place, you can most likely get there.<br />
<br />
While the technology apparently didn't exist with EQ1, &quot;fun&quot; does not mean 30 minute boat rides.  As &quot;dumbed down&quot; as EQ is, I'd rather be fighting MOBs than sitting on my keyster.<br />
<br />
3) A ‘dual sphere’ system in which you choose both an adventuring and a crafting class for your character, and where adventuring and crafting are intertwined into an interesting and compelling interdependent relationship.<br />
<br />
* DANGER WILL ROBINSON DANGER *<br />
<br />
&quot;Craftizons&quot; tried to make a TS based game. How's that working out?  Oh and anybody remember the lack of recipes, the click till carpal, and my favorite - the inadvertant combine.<br />
<br />
Wait, almost forgot - &quot;Alchemy is working as intended.&quot;<br />
<br />
4) A game built on a traditional MUD and MMORPG foundation, where problems seen in the past are addressed primarily by tweaking and adjusting as opposed to throwing out (e.g. no ‘instancing’ but players still doing dungeon crawls, and making travel more fun without having to resort to easy teleportation (just to name a few)).<br />
<br />
Hey Brad, you still making out checks to DIKU? &quot;Instancing&quot; is bad? Oh...guess we need to reinstall racing to MOBs, training, content-blocking, et al.  <br />
<br />
&quot;Tweaking and adjusting.&quot;  Uh - huh. That line of thought does not fill me with confidence.<br />
<br />
I could go on, but while we all long for the early days of &quot;Holy Cow - I can't wait to log on and be AMAZED again tonight,&quot; as well as the newness of EQ, I doubt many long for 4 hours of exping wiped out by one bad pull followed by 3 hours of CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As with any promising game, the best attitude to adopt is &quot;cautious optimism&quot;.</div></div><hr />

hush, Faern. This view is currently very unpopular on this board ;). I sometimes have the feeling that either everyone but me is suffering from selective amnesia or my nightmares I still have about some of these CRs are from beginning shizoprenia.<br />
<br />
But as as this game won't likely be out this year, I will just wait and see what becomes of it. There are some tendencies in EQ2 I am not happy with and EQ1 has gotten damn old. Some alternative could be just what is required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Despite what anyone says about Brad and his &quot;history&quot; or &quot;The Vision&quot;, I had far more fun in EQ when he was running things than I've had since he left.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wonder if that could have been tied to the fact that you have burn out from playing so long. I am sorry but when Brad left a bunch of bs changed for the better!<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong I love the game Brad created but hate his ideas on stupid crap like travel and the need for it to take hours. How many of you remember getting to Freeport right as the boat was leaving the docks? Or having to run to KC to get a port to EJ? I am all for having to explore the world once or twice but after that give me the portal stones!<br />
<br />
Untested BS aside the only real stupid thing EQ has done since his departure has been upping exp so high in PoP zones and beyond without upping exp in old world zones. I would go as far as to say that is the primary reason so many old world zones are empty. Why exp in XXX zone when you can go to YYY zone and kill less mobs yet get double the exp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Or having to run to KC to get a port to EJ? <br />
<br />
Why would you run to KC to get a port to EJ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When Kunark first came out the only portals to EJ and Skyfire were evacuation spells, which only worked in dungeons. Therefore the quickest way to get to either location was to port into the dreadlands, run your group to KC, then evac out to your destination. For the record, when Brad left I felt the game got 100% better in terms of playability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why would you run to KC to get a port to EJ?<br />
<br />
When Kunark was released, and for quite a while afterwards, the druid teleport spells Wind of the North and Wind of the South only worked from  dungeons.  They were intended as evac spells to be used to get out of trouble, not to expedite travel.  So, assuming you'd just ported into Kunark with Cicle of the Combines, you then had to run to Karnor's Castle before you could port to Emerald Jungle or Skyfire.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">When Brad Left the game got better short term. And much much worse long term.<br />
<br />
When Brad left we got Half finished Luclin Amazingly Unfinished and Poorly though out PoP. Ykesha The expansion without a soul, LDON Great idea ****ty Followthrough. And GoD. The game designed for noone in the game.<br />
<br />
Also remember this when Brad was leaving he pushed through many of the things right before he left that did make life easier.<br />
<br />
Yes he did make many mistakes. But he was the driving force behing the spirit of the game. And That old game Even with its flaws is so far above what the game is right now. <br />
<br />
If Vanguard sucks I will be one of the first to holler and such. But I for one am waiting with glee to head back to nights that are DARK, Barbarian here) And a long boat ride that gave you time to view the world and incentive to actually move  en masse to another continent. <br />
<br />
I loved the boats. I have ridden them all the time that I have played. I have only had a problem once. When I crashed on it. And ended up riding it over again. The PoK stones make life easier. But take away from the feeling of the world. Everything is a click and a short hop away. So everything feels like it is close. Good for a neighborhood, Bad for a Game World.  <br />
<br />
EQ today is a Massivly multiplayer Stratagy game. Not a Role player almost at all. But oh well. It is still decent to play even if it is a watered down hodgepodge of its former self.<br />

 :eek: - in regards to the game being to hard early on.<br />
<br />
You must be wearing your &quot;I only remember the good time blinders&quot;.<br />
<br />
Travel sucked - hours to get from one side of the world to the next if you didnt have ports (reason I ended up with a druid btw)<br />
<br />
Dying and losing 2.5 bubbles of exp SUCKED - duh<br />
<br />
If you didn't go to a &quot;hotspot&quot; finding groups sucked - / all xclass ylevel zlevel, /tell xclass need a group? (repeat a crapload of times)<br />
<br />
Corpse recovery in some zones was near impossible - / all necro, /tell xnecro if I pay you xxx,xxxplat will you come summon our group from yzone. (reason I ended up with a necro btw)<br />
<br />
Keyed zones without soulbound keys blew farm animals! - no explaniation needed, if you dealt with it you remember, if you never had to count your blessings!<br />
<br />
Now with all that said - I am still playing this game and love parts of it and yes in order for me to keep on playing I wear my &quot;good time blinders&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally I enjoyed the fear of dying in early EQ. Dying and corpse recovery should be a considering factor in your exploration. I dont want to feel like quitting if it happens but I do want it to be a huge factor in gameplay and exploration. Now dying is a minor annoyance or a tactic in some situations. <br />
<br />
I also miss the need to get to know the geography of zones and having to explore to find the next zone. The feeling of accomplishment knowing that I could run to most zones in less time than it would take the &quot;lesser traveled&quot; people to sit and beg for a port. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion but I think there is a big market out there for a game that is less like baldurs gate and more like a MUD. I hope that Vangaurd is going to deliver.<br />

I really don't know why people treat Brad like he's the second coming of Jesus.  People must have forgotten all the things in his &quot;Vision&quot; that held the game back and made somethings down right annoying.<br />
<br />
He was the most adamant person about not changing EQ.  Yes, I think EQ now is in some bad shape.  However, when he finally got out of EQ production a lot of things changed for the better and made the game more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/sarcasm on<br />
<br />
Yeah, I highly doubt Brad and Crew learned anything over the past 5 years, and I am sure we will see a game exactly like the original EQ.<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off<br />
<br />
Whatever anyone wants to do with regard to this game is fine. Try it, don't, whatever. I will be trying it FOR SURE, since I think I am one of the few people who actually feels as though the road is more important than the destination. I am also gonna give Brad and Co. the benefit of the doubt and assume they have learned a TON of whats tedious and whats actual gameplay. <br />
<br />
Regardless of what people think of the tedious parts of EQ, the bottom line is that if the reward is high enough, the tedium is worthwhile. EVERY SINGLE ONLINE GAME is going to have tedious content or its GONNA BE BROKE. I guess folks jsut cannot get that simple concept through their heads. Instant gratification eventually leads to intense boredom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gudin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The thing about Brad's EQ for me was, it was the game i fell in love with.  <br />
<br />
Sure it sucked to wait on a boat for hours but that made travel actually feel like it meant something.  Now all you do is hop a book and you're basically where you want to go.  This takes away from the feeling i had when i first started playing this game, it takes away the sense of immersion that the old EQ had.  The feeling i had the first time i ran from Halas to meet a few friends in Crushbone was a feeling that I have yet to surpass in the non-Brad EQ.  Travel meaning something was a part of Brad's EQ that i fell in love with and its also something that i find lacking in the post Brad era.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep.  Agree.  Death should be something you avoid.<br />
<br />
I think the major annoyance with boat travel early was having to wait for the boat, not the actual ride itself.  I kinda liked the ride thru OOT seeing all the mobs and stuff.  But waiting for the boat was the pits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to disagree, waiting for the boat to show up sucked, but it gave you a chance to mix and mingle with everyone else that was hanging around waiting with you.  It was an excellent opportunity to exchange knowledge and adventure stories- something that I find lost in today's game.  <br />
<br />
I also enjoyed the slow level progression that we saw in the earlier years of EQ for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Once you got over the fact that it was going to take a long time to level you were more inclined to try new places for a &quot;change of scenery&quot;.<br />
<br />
2.  From my point of view, gear/spell progression/class skill was smoother.  You figured that, pre-EBAY, a 50 druid knew what he was doing.  You also didn't see what you see today: alts that are twinked from 1-30, moderately geared from 30-50, and horribly geared until they hit 65 with 50-100 aa's under their belt w/ near 0 spells.  Back then you were taking days to ding the next level and therefore had more time to amass the wealth you would need to gear up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Definitely a higher percentage of high level characters had their collective (*@# together back then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm gonna have to agree with you on that progression being smoother.<br />
<br />
I'm a bard now, just dinged 50 last night.  I am only very minorly twinked... as in Lambant in one spot, Singing Steel in another... and still a piece of cloth in one slot.<br />
<br />
I'm leveling like crazy with no power leveling.     You basically blink and you can be 26 out of Pal Cavs.<br />
<br />
I have about 2k... I could buy an upgrade for that cloth, but I'm just not sure WHAT to get so I'm saving money.<br />
<br />
LDON is there from level 20+, but the xp comes so much faster than the points.... and groups aren't exactly super plentiful.    I dare anyone to try and get a full suit of their LDON 150 point armor before you hit 50...  maybe it can be done before you hit 55.<br />
<br />
So I'm gonna be 65 in awhile... and I'm a bit afraid of what my gear will be like.   I'm sure I'll make due... but but unless you have a ton of money to twink , or given stuff, I fear even more the players who are power leveled.<br />
<br />
Now... I'm a bard... I'll get smacked pulling... but as long as I stay away from the really hard stuff until I'm ready for it... I'll be okay as a bard... but now picture if I was a warrior... or a cleric... lack of reasonable gear hurts.<br />
<br />
I feel for the few (and yes there are a few) truer newbies out there, who will even have less than me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">If you do LDoN from 26 - 46 you'll have decent stuff just from killing named.  When you get to 46 start looking at LoY quests &amp; drops.<br />
<br />
Never fear, if you &quot;play it strait&quot; and don't PL, gear will take care of itself.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree here the travel times were  really bad and I flat hated those darn boats. Many things changed for the better when he left. <br />
<br />
I must say though PoP killed this game for me I truly hated the flags and still do to this day. I never liked the time sinks and still dont.</div></div><hr />

I agree fully.<br />
<br />
Some things I am glad changed, but I do miss the old.<br />
<br />
Yes back then your actions actually had meaning.  If you ventured out past your ability you got slapped with one hell of a don't do that again.  It was the imersion in the whole world of EQ I loved.  It isn't a world with immediate gratification and travel.  Sometimes I just wanted to be where I was going, but that never bothered me because it was a large world.  If you wanted to be somewhere then you had to travel.<br />
<br />
I used to brag that it would actually take 6 real life hours to run from Akanon to Kerra Isle.  It was a selling point to get my friends to play with me.<br />
<br />
But then I was looking for an emmersive experience that would take me near forever to fully grow.  I was playing in a large world.  It wasn't about the quick pp or next level then though.</div></div><hr />

I think there perhaps could be a distinction with Everquest and Vanquard in that Everquest is perhaps more focused on being a game than Vanguard will. With Vanguard being more focused as a world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All of the whiney things people are talking about from old EQ are all design flaws that are HIGHLY likely to be fixed with Vanguard. <br />
<br />
But be warned, Vanguard WILL be grinding. Trust me. If there is one thing I don't think has changed about Brad's &quot;vision&quot; its that leveling should be a long process. His idea is to try to get people to play without looking at the XP bar after every kill. I am going to assume Vanguard will be like that. <br />
<br />
There is also going to be content that not everyone will see, similar to EQ, but probably not as &quot;absolutely defined&quot; as EQ. <br />
<br />
I am looking forward to this game more than any other I see on the horizon. While EQ 1 had its faults, there was a magic in the game that cannot be denied. Whether its possible to re-capture that magic remains to be seen, I have my doubts. But if there is a game coming out that has a chance, this is it for me.</div></div><hr />

Oh yeah things have changed for the better, now we wait a week and maybe get a response to a petition instead of maybe an hour. We didn't need a teams of GMs and guides dedicated to each server who not only knew the people, and guilds on the server but also interacted with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">human desires are rarely rational.  I think Brad McQuaid may have tapped into that.  <br />
<br />
Let's take his comment on instancing being bad.  <br />
<br />
On the rational side, we'd think the exact opposite.  Instancing means no crowding, means no having to &quot;camp&quot;, means no KSing, no ninja looting, no fighting over mobs or camps.  <br />
<br />
On the irrational side, NO instancing means more player interaction, arch foes and hated adversaries in game, close allies for the ensuing fracas, and interplayer strategy for dungeon domination.  Not to mention an opportunity for those with better gear to demonstrate that gear to those less fortunate by feats of prowess as they ninja steal and KS the lowbie's groups.  Now the lowbies are pissed at *******_23 and 24 and vow to level up and get uber gear so they can teach those ********s a lesson!  It all adds to the excitement and interactiveness of the game.  LDoN probably destroyed the game more than any other expansion simply because it took out that interaction and replaced it with simple group dynamics.  It definitely &quot;dumbed down&quot; the game.  It made EQ such that you could avoid having to deal with anyone you didn't like, and still could get the same rewards as everyone else.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes what you wish for isn't what you really want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I ahve always thought instancing done right could be the best thing a MMORPG could ever have. <br />
<br />
My idea for instancing is a simple one. Take Permafrost. Certain rooms and named spawns are normal as they always are. But Moving into the kings private chambers a trap goes off and the door locks behind you. (Start instance) 8- 10 rooms later With king and retanue randomised somewhat (Movement paths depending on zone in time of day (head in at night king might be asleep or with his High elven Bodymistress ) During the day in the crown room or at the balcony looking over his domain. However it is also possible that the king is found outside of the expanses in the dungoen proper (Spawn as normal) Storyline could even be woven in like the king has a golem duplicate. That thinks he is the king. and so forth.<br />
<br />
And Vox is in her lair. as well. But when going through the ice giants cavern there is an instanced beginning Or a normal path to the area. One with spawnable a White dragon With Dps and Hps and such tailored for a raid of a certain size and level. Where another there is the normal Free for all vox. Who while dropping the same table of loot as the A white dragon can also give storyline tidbits or Loot of the same quality but a snazzy Graphix effect on it. And if you visit and kill Vox sucessfully after that you are subject to the Banishment rule for say a month or more. To prevent farming or people Coddling folks through the encounter. <br />
<br />
Instancing itself should not be the primary focus for a game though. And getting to Dungoen based instanced fights should be as chalanging as getting to a camp deep someplace. But with the benifit of not having to fight over said spawn. Named should be a Fun thing. Not a ralling cry for griefbuilding.And performance should nto be soly based upon your ability to be on all hours or feild a accountant of spawn times. <br />
<br />
<br />
Someone who only does LDOn is to be honest probably not all that intresting anyways. Cause you beat a few and they are all the same. Much more intresting people seek challange and at least new experiances.<br />
<br />
My opinion of course. Take it with a grain of salt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Some claim that you must be wearing blinders to see only the nostalgia of the past and overlook the annoying time-consuming endeavors of the game before Brad left. Well, I for one feel that while some simple convienences have been implemented the vast majority of the changes have been instituted either for lack of creative talent or to cater to the insta-gratification of our &quot;ADHD&quot; society.<br />
<br />
Landragoran makes a good point in how instancing has severely damaged the game by taking away the majority of the social aspect. In the past if you were an extreme screwup or ninja then the entire zone heard about it but now unless you send tells there is only 6 people to hear you. We have entered the treadmill to gain LDON pts and xp at max capacity attempting to complete and begin a new adventure in the shortest time possible. Of course you have to find a group to do the adventures and if your not in a guild or have a set group then leveling up can be a challenge, but then again just wait and you'll be able to isolate yourself even more once solo adventures is patched.<br />
<br />
Look at the supposed benefits of travel for finding a group. In the past if you traveled an hour to LOIO or Crushbone you spent time there leveling and thought seriously about staying till the xp dried up due to the travel time. Now good luck finding anyone in a zone that isn't a &quot;Hotspot&quot; according to the patch or maximized for PLing.<br />
<br />
It's my hope that Brad will continue with his &quot;Vision&quot; but just as we have grown and matured over the life of the game hopefully Brad and his vision have also. I think from reading interviews and following the game this has taken place and Brad has admitted to a somewhat limited flexibility in the past. But there is no denying that he has developed the most successful MMORPG to date, excluding MUDs, and has the resources to exceed that past success. Hopefully he will learn from his past mistakes and those of other companies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I agree on the instancing.  Yes, jerks have the ability to screw up your camp a bit too much in EQ, and there's nothing you can do about it... but OTOH you now have some interesting stories about the idiot that tried to steal your camp, or the guild whose leader told you to **** off when you complained about a persistent trainer, or whatever.  It stirs your passion.<br />
<br />
I agree though that there IS a place for instances, especially on quested items/raid encounters.  Why should some idiot camping the pit be able to screw up an entire  72-person raid killing RZtW?  Why should the RZtW pit fight destroy a perfectly good pit grind for a group?<br />
<br />
Guilds racing for a target is not a bad thing.  Once one guild has initiated the event, though, they need their chance to finish it unmolested - no &quot;accidental&quot; trains, nobody killing the trigger mob for part 2 out from under them, nobody killstealing or ninjalooting.  There needs to be a BALANCE between instancing and interaction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Nayenezgani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I didn't like instanced dungeons in &quot;The Realm&quot; and can't say that EQ's have changed that. It's my belief that LDoN was implemented to get people away from the &quot;taking *this* Camp&quot; mentality that had developed and push them into doing dungeons as crawls. People still go to a dungeon and do One Camp though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I believe that both instancing and the traditional zones have their place in any game of this genre.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously, how bad does the Stormfeather or Lodi camp suck?  Ever tried to find Severilous up?<br />
<br />
Gah.<br />
<br />
The more successful future games will find a way to strike a balance between instancing and traditional zones.  That is the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I think the best balance is instanced encounters not zones.<br />
<br />
Example:  hedge mazes in PoN.  You start one, nobody else can get in / you are garunteed (sp?) a shot at the boss mob.  But its still within the same zone as the everyone else camping and chatting and basically making it 'alive'.  Same goes for the Undead city in PoN, or the trials in PoJ.<br />
<br />
Just imagine if each LDON 'zone' was actually 5 or 6 non-overlapping dungeons.  You zone into a common room where everyone can prep / evac spot.  Then you go through 1 of 5 doors that you are 'soulbound' to...so only your grp can get your dungeon, but you have up to 30 people in one zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I see where you are comin from, but I also understand &quot;why&quot; some of the mobs / quests are on a timed basis.<br />
<br />
I mean, seriously, consider, if all you had to do was put a group together and run over to kill Lodi - how many people would have Lodi shield?  All?<br />
<br />
Certain things *need* to be on a timer simply because developers need to control the number of &quot;uber&quot; items.  (Yes, I realize Lodi shield is hardly uber, but it WAS at the time).  However, I think a balance needs to be found between instanced and timed.<br />
<br />
I do like the PoN Hedge encounter.  That's a great little raid.  I too would like more of this kind of thing.</div></div><hr />

In PoN, there are the Hedge, Mujaki, and Deyid events (I've never done Deyid).<br />
<br />
In PoS, there's the Falto event (although that's for a bigger force).<br />

And of course, in PoI there's the Xanamech event.<br />

I could't agree more man, big rep bump from me. I am hopefull that the portions of &quot;The Vision&quot; that were just plain SUCKY have been identified and adjusted accordingly, but honeslty, time-consuming content is a MUST HAVE for any game to be succesful on a month-by-month subscriber basis. Here is a quote from a friend of mine about that subject that sums it up for me:<br />
 As much as I bitch, to myself anyway, about how much I hate XPing and the mindless grinding required to gain xp, aa, and other time-sinks, when I played other games that required less work like daoc, and AO I grew bored very quickly.<br />
That says it all, it really does. I dislike the grind and the tedium as well, but if the reward is adequate, the grind loses its impact &quot;after&quot; you have achieved your objective. During, it BLOWS FROGS for sure. For a specific example, I will once again point at the Aid Grimel &quot;Signet of the Arcane&quot; quest. 18 aa required out of the gate for maxxing Taanin Mastery to 6 (3 per). 220 in seven tradeskills. Numerous  semi-rare drops for failable combines (failed the Tailoring combine portion 3 times, thats 9 Obsidian Saps. A full group at Castle 2 pulling about 1.5 aa an hour worth of mobs is LUCKY to get 1 sap/hour). I spent about 20 hours JUST farming cash loot to fund the tradeskills (PoM mostly, Yaeths 73R for RGC is a good 30K+, and I get moderate XP while farming it). Overall, not counting the tradeskilling I did to get 8th Shawl, it probably took me 100 hours and 500K pp. But you know something? Once I put that baby on, all that bullcrap went away, and the ENORMOUS feeling of accomplishment that flowed in me made it seem worthwhile. How can you get that kind of &quot;High&quot; without the &quot;Low&quot; of certain tedious, PITA time investments? You can't. <br />
<br />
Granted there are portions of the old EQ that just totally sucked for no reason whatsoever. But looking back, a LOT of those things were bugs. Falling off the boat. Wierd &quot;through the wall&quot; aggro. But there is a balance to be achieved between convienence and tedium, and I think that Vanguard will be much closer to that &quot;place&quot; than EQ was, or is now. For example, how about we start by cutting the amount of PoK books in HALF. Now travel isnt instantaneous, but its not MASSIVLY inconveinent either. Right now, you can get almost anywhere with a book and 1 or 2 zone-crosses. Anywhere. In Kunark, I made racial decisions based on certain things, like a DE Cleric twink so I could use the OT Hammer. Now choices like this are meaningless. EQ is basically one big race with different models, thats all. <br />
<br />
I think its safe to say &quot;The Vision&quot; has changed since that fateful day I first saw the words &quot;Welcome to Everquest&quot; on my screen. Nothing will ever be able to replace the magic of those days, and perhaps a big part of our optimism IS the whole &quot;rose colored glasses&quot; concept. But if anything, that just further proves my point, that once you get PAST the tedium, if the rewards are good, there is nothing more satifying than that sense of accomplishment, and the bad parts drift away in our minds. <br />
<br />
I dont want Diablo 2, or MTV, or 10 seconds of &quot;fun&quot; in exchange for short-termed enjoyment. I want a game that provides depth. And like it or not, tedious grinding content is a MUST for this to happen, it really is. WoW is probably going to be a great game, but in the end, I have the feeling it will be a shooting star like many other EQ killers that are FANTASTIC out of the box, then just lose their appeal because overall, there isnt enough &quot;real&quot; depth to make it worth the effort. People are already saying this about CoH.<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong. I am in a place right now in EQ that is more exciting than I can remember since I first hit VT, so perhaps my personal optimism is biased. My guild just got into Time. There is a TON of freshness and fun in this place, and already I am having a ball with Tier 1. Sure, after a few times, Tier 1 will be old, thats true of ANYTHING, but let me tell ya, I have done it 3 times now and NONE of it seems old yet. Thats the way it should be, IMHO. Brad doesnt want people sitting on a boat for half an hour at a stretch for no reason other than to slow down travel. He wants each and every part of his game to be &quot;an adventure&quot;, the type of adventure that doesnt get old too fast, either. Boredom is inevitable, but if the &quot;Road&quot; isnt entertaining, and the &quot;Destination&quot; is too easy or short-lived to achieve, where is the &quot;Game&quot;? Ultimately, Brads goal is to keep people playing and playing because its ENTERTAINING overall. Good and bad. Up and down. These are things that have to exist for a game to truly succeed IMHO. <br />
<br />
Its possible I am an anomally. Perhaps there arent a ton of people who think like me, who see the &quot;point&quot; of a lot of the content that others feel is the worst part of the game. People who would rather play the Road. Thats fine. Games like Diablo 2 have tons and tons of folks playing it hour after hour. I put a buttload of hours into that game myself. But in the end, it was just far too easy to &quot;get&quot; there. I dont want to be able to hit the top levels in a month. I dont want to be able to get the very best gear without working HARD for it. <br />
<br />
I dunno, I have rambled enough. Speaking for myself, since thats really all that matters, I think Vanguard is going to be a far more entertaining, long term game than CoH, WoW, or whatever other EQ-Killer v5.075 you want to name.</div></div><hr />

I share the same perspective, I think Ssra would be great to be instanced but Ldon it does not work for.<br />
<br />
Hmm, as to eq, I dunno, eq seems to be caught between being a World and a game. At the start it used to be more of a World but sucked as a game, now its more of a game it sucks as a world.  I think a game can have both but eq I think has been particuarly limited by its engine.</div></div><hr />
