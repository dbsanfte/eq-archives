<br />
Wouldnt it be good if all disease based slows, were given a dmg counter, then focus affliction items would still be glowing when cast.<br />
And while we are at it either make them unmitgated, :D , like that is going to happen, or increased the value of the slows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How often are you using disease based slows anyway? I only use them on one single encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If they had a dmg component you could not slow mezzed mobs w/o breaking mez.  And leaving pop mobs unslowed while mezzed is just asking for the enchanter to get pounded on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>scoggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">True, but I dont like chanters now anyway, making loads of money, let them die I say.<br />
WTS strength and dex buffs, donations accepted, change given:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only one?  Surely you jest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hehe I don't use them on one enounter, I only use them in one situation though :p</div></div><hr />

Ever tried Rydda Dar?<br />
And i'm sure theres others, but im too lazy to think of them.</div></div><hr />

no</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">damage on disease slow is bad just because slows arent supposed to be damaging.  why does a disease slow need damage? just dont see the need/corraltion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>scoggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Because then it would be classed as a dot, and all focus items would work again, otherwise we do what we usually do, and put up with all the **** thrown at us, and I'm tired of being covered in **** :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but why would it matter?  Disease slow is not something that you cast very often.  Even if focus effects worked for it, it wouldn't be worth it to use grummus instead of turgur's, because a 40% slow is very gimp compared to a 75% slow.<br />
<br />
Were you suggesting that all our slows that added disease counters also deal damage?  And thus be focused?  It'd be nice to have all our slows focused again, but it definately wouldn't be worth it, since we would then be unable to slow mezzed mobs, or mezz slowed mobs.<br />
<br />
What they should do is just have focus effects work the way they were, minus charms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">BoT named are easier to slow with disease based slow, also the glimmering drakes in NToV require that spell and i'm sure there are many more i forgot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its good to know that Disease Slows are not an Affliction........ah Yeah.  They are flowers and candy.  Joy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kaarmekieli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Was taking down Kromzek Captain in WW (for Benevolance quest) and found out that at least on lvl 65 Grummus worked on the giant (Turgurs was still resisted).<br />
<br />
Donno if this is any news but I don't recall slowing it earlier.<br />
<br />
Another observation considering slowing that I have found out lately is that 65 is somehow &quot;magical&quot; level in HoT - I have slowed (turgur's) mobs (wurm type mobs at least) several times only with malo as debuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its definately situational..<br />
<br />
Emp<br />
Rydda Dar<br />
Mithaniel Marr<br />
<br />
Also The Honorable Guardians of Marr cant be  slowed with anything but Grummus (atleast easily)</div></div><hr />
