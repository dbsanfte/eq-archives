<br />
Has anyone done any task system that was introduced into OOW that is worth while for a lvl 70 shaman?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Love the task system ... for my alt rogue. Managed to solo them from 30 to 41 with ghetto gear with tasks. Seems to me that the system gets gives you progressively less return as you level up - not to mention possibly ruining valuable factions and so on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Worthwhile for a 70? sorry can't help ya, I did two of the available three when I was 66, it either came down to Droga or Chardok and I would not recommend either.  I was displeased with the task system with my first expierience. I guess the only thing I liked at 66 was the for sure guarantee of a absolute 2% to regular xp after you finished, not to mention whatever you get for killing hundreds of things.  <br />

    I think they could be on to a slightly good idea ( with modifications of coarse) if they tried to rethink it a bit.  I remember reading somewhere that they were going to be implemented for characters to be able to solo of all levels class and race, somehow I don't think they followed through on that tidbit of information from QandA with the devs on live chat.</div></div><hr />
