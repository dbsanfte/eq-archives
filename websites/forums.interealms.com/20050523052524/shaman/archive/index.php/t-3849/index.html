<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am on the second tough guy in the city of mist for my epic. This is the one a magician fire pet is needed, but I knew that. What I want to know is what a sufficient group would be? Last time we went down to kill ghiosk 55shm (me), 57 rogue, 51 warrior, 51 shm, and 54 monk and we just started fighting reavers when ghiosk spawned on top of us with 30 mana. It was an easy fight... besides for the slow resists. If this fight was so easy would I just need to add a magician with fire pet to the group that i had above? Also is the second guy in the city of mist slowable, should I use Plage of Insects? I know on ghiosk i failed 5 times or so with turgurs, then just saved mana for heals. Is a cleric necessary or chanter for adds?<br />
<br />
I would also like to know how many people it usually takes to kill one of the golems in fear. I am unguilded and the four pick up raids didnt go far enough, and most guilds on the luclin server are against helping people for some reason :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rak is a very easy fight with mage pets.  Basically, for Rak himself, you just need level 49 mage pets and clerics to heal them.  You would need a normal force to take out the reavers that spawn Rak.  As you probably know from killing Ghiosk, they are super MR and cast blind (are reavers slowable with POI? I can't remember!).<br />
<br />
Here are some of my Rak fighting tips:<br />

<br />
When we did my epic, we had one cleric, two mages, and myself as the only healers.  We all had KEI though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Reavers seem to be imune to PoI, even after debuff.  We blew a whole mana bar on on with 2 shaman to no effect.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gallerus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">rak is different now btw, he does his ae more rarely, and casts ice comet, &amp; snare.<br />
<br />
Fire pets are still the way to go however, although a warrior in my guild tanked him a few weeks ago hehe.  Best to get 2 fire pets, 2 clerics &amp; like 3-4 people + a chanter to handle repops.  Also, dont pull him cause he gates &amp; thats not good &amp; also, dont pop in out on the bridge, cause he will get pushed into the water &amp; thats bad too.<br />
<br />
btw, shaman epic is a joke, I did mine in &lt; 4 hours total.  I spent &gt; 40 hours for my mage camping quilmane alone :mad:</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pets use either their innate resists or the resists of their owners, whichever is better.  So, a mage fire pet would still be immune to fire AOE and a shaman pet would benefit from the buffed MR of its owner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got my epic a few weeks ago. For the Rak fight, our group had one mage pet and while we had two clerics available, it only took one casting celestial elixir (i think that's the name -- not complete heal) to keep the pet healthy. If you have enough people to kill the reavers and the normal mobs, all you will need is the mage pet and some healing power. We fought Rak in the room where his reaver spawns. Normally, he's pulled out a bit, but someone had spawned him already, so we fought him where he was. It was an easy fight for the mage pet. It was especially nice that as soon as I got my last piece to get the epic, we went up and killed Neh and she dropped the piece the mage needed for his epic. It was a great day all around. Good luck to you on getting your epic. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/agree donar, that matches with my experience just before the patch exactly.  Could have done it with one cleric + mage.  We used way more than that because we had them, but the extras weren't necessary.  It was an anticlimax, really.  Took more than 15 minutes to bring him down with a single pet, however.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know if Lady Neh can be done for both the mage and shaman epics in the same kill?  i.e. if I turn in my ring and aggro Neh will she ever drop the mage item?  That question came up on my epic when another guild was going after Neh for the mage epic, I couldn't answer positively so they wouldn't let me turn in the ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">We had a weird situation when I got my epic.  We were basically 2 groups holding the hall till the raid force showed up to gank Neh, then Rak (did both the same day).  But Neh's reaver was in a gazebo, we killed it and tooled neh easily.  We did rak and were outta there in no time flat.  We had some severe overkill once the main group showed up, done before caster and pet changes were made.<br />
<br />
2 49 mage fire pets<br />
3 clerics<br />
2 monks<br />
2 rogues<br />
3 chanters<br />
3 shaman<br />
2-3 druids<br />
a couple of warriors and rangers and a pallie in the mix.<br />
<br />
The encounter was trivial, chanters competed to charm adds first and we sent them into Rak's AE to get mulched, druids sent in pets, the shaman sent pets in (I went through 7 pets that fight .. hahahah).  The more mage pets you get, the faster the fight is.  A single mage pet can do it (make sure its the one they cast at lvl 49) with a cleric behind it, but it takes forever.  I've done this fight 3-4 times now, always fun.</div></div><hr />
