	<p>While I don't agree with much of what the original poster had to say, I have been thinking a while on the kind of spells I would like to see in a new expansion or in the interim.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Improved Cannibalize. </b><br />
Our last manaregen upgrade was in VELIOUS.   Every other mana-using class got a luclin and/or pop spell upgrade.   ALL other mana-using classes have PASSIVE manaregen.  That means they can be doing OTHER THINGS while regaining mana.  Shaman cannot, if we are using our sadly outdated Cannibalize 4 to regain mana, we cannot be doing anything else, not moving or casting or sitting.  We most devote a precious spell slot to this spell.<br />
<br />
Let's look at raid buffed figures, assume everyone has Blessing of the 9, VOQ and Spiritual Dominion. (leaving out bard for now)<br />
<br />
Clerics, Yaulp = 57<br />
Druids, Mask of the Forest = 49<br />
Enchanters, none = 45  <--poor guys<br />
Mages, Xegony's Phantasmal Guard = 51<br />
Necromancers (no VOQ), Seduction of Saryrn = 67<br />
Shaman, none = 45<br />
Wizard, Greater Familiar (or better aa) = 49+<br />
<br />
That's assuming raid buffs.  Assuming self-buffed only<br />
Clerics = 20<br />
Druids = 12<br />
Enchanters = 28<br />
Mages = 6<br />
Necros = 50<br />
Shaman = 0<br />
Wizard = 4<br />
<br />
and our class is constantly punished for our "superior manaregen" by making our spells more resisty and cost more mana.  See <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Bane (shaman)</a> vs <a href="http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4098&amp;source=Live" target="_blank">Horror (necromancer)</a> for a plain example.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize 4 - 2.5 second cast time, 3 second recast, for 5.5 seconds to regain 82 mana.  So it is roughly 82 mana per tick.  For this we pay the price of 148 hitpoints (1.8 hp per mana) and 4.5 seconds of being unable to cast anything else AND a spell slot we always have to have canni4 in.  The necromancer lich spell is the only real similar line.  Their trade is basically 63 hp for 50mana or 1.26 hp per mana.  However, I have no issue with the necromancer mana regen.  They pay the piper by not being able to use VOQ/KEI.  Remember the most other classes pay no penalty at all for their manaregen and we are penalized in spell slots, cast time and hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
The point of all this is that I do not have time to chain cast cannibalize.  Give us a cannibalize with a very short cast time (like yaulp) and a longer recast time (20 seconds?) that does significantly bigger chunks.  I feel the lack of passive manaregen most keenly when doing serious healing or debuffing a large number/continous stream of mobs.  In terms of healing, I feel, with our heals being so small that most of the time when we are healing we are blast healing.  Just casting tnargs over and over.  During times like these we cannot devote the 4.5 seconds of casting time for a canni anymore.  <br />
<br />
Right now it is possible for us to get 820 mana back in one minute (10 casts of canni4) doing NOTHING besides casting canni4.  Say we want to get a maximum of 1100 mana back in one minute but with only 5 casts of Canni6... 220 mana for 375 hp, .5 second cast, 20 second recast.  Maybe I am nuts, but that would be much more useable to me than our current canni.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Improved Avatar</b><br />
I already have to cast FA all the time.  I want something that sets it apart again.  The avatar line used to be the ultimate shaman buff.  I remember reading the spell list when I first started playing and thinking WOW!  There was no one else that could buff pure attack, nor buff stats like that.  People did not max their statistics.<br />
<br />
Sadly, there is no more wow factor to the Avatar line.  It was given out on weapons and then other buffs that are similar were introduced for other classes.  If you want WOW factor from me, see the beastlord spell Ferocity... +65 all resists and more atk than our very best avatar.   Because in reality when you are level 65 on raids you cap str, dex, sta... the things that matter on ferocity and avatar are the atk and the resists.   Give our avatar something special again +damage (like those new disciplines) or some of the special melee abilities that you are granting now or endurance regen or something.  Some shaman will cry that they hate buffing.  If we must buff, give us something special... especially for a spell that permanently occupies a spell slot and must be maintained constantly.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Agro reduction</b><br />
I would like some agro reduction abilities.  We do not get spell casting sublety.  Either an aa or spell, short duration, self only agro decreaser or a pure istant agro decrease spell or button.... mostly so I can use dots.  You give me bane and that's great, nice short duration for mobs that don't live long.  Unfortunately if I slow and then Bane, I have to tank the mob as well.  In fact, I don't ever use Bane unless I plan on tanking.  We get new dots every expansion and they become less and less useable overall because of the agro they generate.   Fixing dots and fixing warrior agro might remove the need for any agro reduction for shaman, from my perspective.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Healing</b><br />
I would like the ability to heal an entire group.  Druids can do it with AA, our HYBRID class can with AA (and regen mana /sigh), clerics can since forever, pallies can too.  We are the only priest type that has no ability to heal a group.  Group Quies would probably be overpowering, even with a high mana cost.  Something else would have to be done, even if you lowered the healing per tick (but added some attack or something interesting) it would be a very useable spell.  I'd like to see Quies upgraded a bit in a single target version, if not to include more healing per tick, add some +mitigation or avoidance in it, we've been healing 300hp per tick since ....the turn of the century!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Other</b><br />
I'd like to see a more diverse assortment of focus effects available in ldon.  Like improved healing type stuff and different focuses for specific mana-pres (disease based only or cold based only or whatever).  I'd like to see focuses that increase damage on rains.<br />
<br />
AE malo would be nice, I wouldn't say it is overpowering there has been AE tash forever.  Make it even weaker than Malo, but keep it unresistable.  /shrug<br />
<br />
Heh, improved invis.  Such a simple thing.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see armor textures be able to be purchased in ldon, i miss velious textures! <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt="" title="wink" smilieid="5" /></p>
