<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bronze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My last and final snip for SH.<br />
Legends was Suppose to be a great and wonderful server. It had soo much potential. But in style like VI they over-promised/priced and under-delivered.<br />
<br />
Ill state this here and at the close of this. If your level 60 dont move to SH.<br />
<br />
Broken Promises:<br />
They said no guild would monopolize this server. <br />
<br />
Township rebellion owns the server. Easy to do when you have an 80 person raid for EVERYTHING. ( yea even zland )<br />
<br />
New zones!<br />
Total crap. MM is a exact replica of eruids isle..(ie no new zone just a replicant). The loot is good so thats a plus however Obtaining a key takes longer then it does to clear the zone.<br />
<br />
Promise of New zones.<br />
GM said that they are working on a new script for post sleepers, which will hit legends 1st. <br />
<br />
yay!<br />
<br />
Can we say Cazic thule?<br />
<br />
GM events<br />
Yea they try to do them. Most of them are geared for the lower end game sub (40) those that are 51+ are ruined by Township rebellion OR the GM grows bored. <br />
<br />
Case and point. GM stole a officer in our guild and took her to fear. We rallied up in fear and started to clear the zone. Well GM figured it be cool to pop an extra 30 roamers. So our fight last 30min. Then we had to deal with the normal mobs. (aoe style) Pulled Minis and ended up getting draco and more pops from GM. We wipe out.<br />
We recover only to have those same 15 mobs who gm repop maul us while we are naked. Death number 2. We recover and kill pops and Draco, when the GM says hes taking off to go eat this is taking too long and give us back our officer then poofs.<br />
<br />
Nice job! Great event! Got my 40.00 worth!<br />
<br />
Website <br />
Hasnt worked right since day 1. Its sitll not 110% working. If you notice NO ONE uses the guild message boards cause they SUCK.<br />
<br />
High end game <br />
This is the reason I left. Its non-existant. When you have 4 guilds each with 100+ members NOTHING stays up longer then 10min. GM will only do they typical work it out or leave the zone:<br />
<br />
Case and point<br />
We were in the new zone with another guild. GM comes and says work it out please. No agreement is made so the GM DESPAWNS the zone.<br />
<br />
yay Great customer service!<br />
<br />
However I will point out that since that incident that hasnt happend. The last time we had a conflit for a zone we gave up that zone and GM offered to repop Zland for us which they did.<br />
<br />
Same with AOW the other night. TR came in &quot;claiming&quot; AOW was theirs (bear in mind they are the ONLY guild to kill aow for the past 2 months no other guild EVER had a chance because they could zerg him faster)GMs stepped in and told TR to leave. We try for our first time got him to 30% and died.<br />
We leave GM tells TR oficer he will repop kael for them. <br />
<br />
Sleepers <br />
Mass exodus is happening right now. A LOT of people have left or are leaving. How do I know this? I know 10 from my server that got moved back on Sunday. TR basically pissed off everyone (lvl 60) on the server. They didnt care what the GM asked them. ( GMs asked them NOT to wake him) but in true TR style they did what they wanted to do. Their reasoning<br />
<br />
cinder says &quot; We did it as a service for legends. Be glad we woke him. It forces VI to do something better for us.<br />
<br />
Anyone with 1/2 a brain knows the real answer on why they did it. <br />
<br />
They said that High end loot will not xfer back to servers. That BS as well. I know a warrior who got a SoD and took it back to his home server.<br />
<br />
Something that also stikes me funny. IF you decide to move to legends it takes about 30min to get moved there if you want off it takes 2 weeks or so. <br />
<br />
Go figure.<br />
<br />
If your level 60 dont move to SH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont take this wrong but this surprised you HOW?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bronze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Im a firm beleiver that Everyone and everything deserves a chance. They got theirs. They didnt provide so now I can rant about it =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actually as far as loot goes I think they said that loot specific to SH would not transfer back to another home server.  Normal dropped loot however will.  In the case of a SOD, that is a normal server drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Gotta say nothing in this post surprises me, which is why i'm glad i wasn't stupid enough to pay 40 a month for another verant screw up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sounds like the basic lack of game managing skills are allowing Legends to become the first server dedicated to a single guild.  Sad to hear that $40 a month is not buying a better game.<br />
<br />
I still think VI needs to hire some real Game Masters to run its events and not just let the CS peeps run loose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarita Icestryke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm having quite the opposite experience than what Bronze had.  Now, I am not 60, and since I came from Tallon Zek (AKA guildwar central) where I had not hunted in a lot of the &quot;standard&quot; zones.  I'm finally getting a chance to really experience the game.<br />
<br />
I've had great success with customer support (always getting a response in under 10 minutes) but then again I've never had anything vaguely political in nature.<br />
<br />
The TR problems seem to be recovering a bit as more and more of their people decide to leave.  I think the biggest problem with them is attitude (whether real or just perceived) that really ticks people off.  <br />
<br />
Now, do I still see problems?  sure, but I also have seen a bunch of things that VI has done right with this.  Take Bronze's example of them popping stuff regardless of their ability to handle it and at the request to not do so by the GM.   TR has the right to pop something if they so choose.  They have to deal with the consequences of it (even worse rep, etc).  But would we really want to play the game if we couldn't ever do stupid stuff?  After it was popped, the GMs took the time to get stuff straightened out and did rez several people that were hit by this act of stupidity.  <br />
<br />
I do think that there should be no mobs that are &quot;owned&quot; by a guild or group.  I belong to one of the bigger guilds on the server, and other members have either decided to leave SH or to quit EQ entirely.  That is going to happen.  For some it won't be worth it.  But for the group that I play with, we find it nice and refreshing.  Nothing like going into KC and seeing 2 people.  5 people in Greater Faydark, etc.  If anything just knowing that you can go do just about anything at any time (if you can scrape up the people) makes it really enjoyable.<br />
<br />
But that is just me.  Sometimes I'm just weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, you had to see this coming when we first got on the server Bronze. Remember how our original guildstarted disentigrating after the first 2 weeks because we could not get it together? The thing that happened was that TR got the numbers together, had the tactics and equipment down, and ran with it. Now, if you are lvl 60 and on SH then you need to be in TR or you don't get Jack, cause there are a lot of people who were in the same situation on the other servers try to learn the high end game and not getting the opprotunity to do it because they lack the numbers, knowledge, emergency deployment, and equipment of the Ubers. <br />
<br />
I was hoping however, that people would be cool on SH and not wake the sleeper, to allow others to get equipment as well. But hey such is life, the only thing you can really do about it is cancel your sub, and we all kow how much that will hurt Verant. It can be very frustrating.<br />
<br />
Now it seems like a haven for the PVP servers. Why? Well there are three reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You can level to 60 in relative peace, not having to worry about people ganking you for whatever reason.<br />
<br />
2) You can experience the high end game and explore zones that were never accessible to you because of conflicts.<br />
<br />
3) Gain items and spells that were here to fore unavailable.<br />
<br />
As for loot moving from SH, this is how it is supposed to work. You can take anything from SH to the normal servers. The GMs will check your toons to see if you farmed SH for items to sell on the regular servers. The way they deal with legends only items, is that they mark them NO DROP and send you on your way. THis way you will be unable to sell them on the regular servers. This topic was covered in the FAQs that were released prior to legends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Check the update on my guild homepage. The GMs have essentially promised to revamp the post-wakening sleeper zone to make it much more worthwhile to be in afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree with you 2hawks. This is a haven for those who have burnt bridges on the Zeks,not you though, we lub ya. The post-move-back-to-home-server-you-came-from spindoctoring will be amusing to say the least. It is widely known that alot of peeps left because they either couldnt handle the wars they tried to fight, and wanted to see the zones most guilds owned,or they couldnt do anything in peace because so many people wanted their heads on the platter. Look as Dizzcartez for example, he could'nt hack it on RZ, heck, he didn't even level the guy himself,but he jumped ship,and now after he trys to get all uber suited up,he wants to head back to RZ.(run on sentence i know) Grrrr, to many things I see wrong with it to go into at this time...<br />
More to come from your favorite RZ pvp shammy at another time.</div></div><hr />
