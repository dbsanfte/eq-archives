History is more than the holocaust, despite what your local newspaper tells you. Its time we stop worrying about the atrocities of the past and start worrying about preventing the atrocities of the future. As we speak in Sudan there is widespread murder and hatred of Christians. why do we not speak out against them? What about other 3rd world countries where the same things happen? what about the other atrocities? Jews say &quot;never again&quot; but its already happening, they arent complaining because it isnt them this time around. <br />
<br />
Le Pen will be a breath of fresh air for the French. Maybe he can get France some dignity and class, something the French are sorely lacking. <br />
<br />
I make this a call out to all nations to get their act together. current self-destructive society is a bane to humanity. We must put forth the concepts of personal responsibility and duty. We must bring back loyalty to God, Family, and Country. In France there is none of this. It is a hellhole of liberal self-indulgence. If It doesnt get strong leadership within 15 years, i hope its firebombed and wiped off the face of the earth. We must cut out the sickness festering on OUR world, the world that belongs to those of us with strength, pure hearts, and extreme valor.<br />
<br />
Sorry, forgot that you needed to register.  After this, people go on to say how great a post it is.  It sounds to me like someones quoting the freaking nazi handbook.  The fact that that viewpoint has any support is a *very* scary thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When you pull a quote we need to know the source Kullaas, so we can see the level of authority of the source.  <br />
<br />
The technique he is using is common in political speeches.  <br />
<br />
1) Lay out some common knowledge, i.e., the fact that history is more than just the holocost.  Of course it is, history is huge, the holocost was one major event in it, but its not the sum total of history, ok. <br />
<br />
2) Appeal to people's emotions, Christians are getting hated and murdered in the Sudan.  Since you are already  in agreement with him about history, even if you know none of the facts (I don't for one) pertinent to the Sudan reference, you are much more likely to go either, What! or Yeah! than ask for references. <br />
<br />
3) Tie an accusatory reference into the first passage, like the Jews aren't speaking out about atrocities happening to someone else.<br />
<br />
4) Introduce the ray of hope, in this case the incredibly right wing Le Pen.  Make him the answer to all the problems.<br />
<br />
5) Close it with predictions of doom and despair should your hero not be allowed to lead to the solution to the problem.<br />
<br />
Sometime go to your local community college and look at their courses in Political Science, check out some of the textbooks, especially the ones on speech writing.  That speech/article is too brief to be much more than filler to something else.  It is very mediocre, a bit hackish.  One would almost think it a tongue in cheek pastiche of a serious speech in favor of Le Pen, satire designed to drive intelligent people away from him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's from the Hardforum, in a thread about le pen.  You need registration to access this forum though.  I'm reading up on the fall of Weimar right now, and my god, I swear he copied and pasted from one of hitlers early speechs.  It's positivly sickening that *anyone* is supporting that point of view<br />
<br />
I've tried to reason with these people, but my latest post amounts to &quot;YOU ARE A FACIST&quot;.<br />
<br />
Excellent analysis tho.  Care if I use it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Micheall</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 09:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In addition to your own research?  Be my guest.  Fascism is a cause well worth fighting against.<br />
<br />
Yes, I can believe it was based on one of Hitler's speeches, it has that ring.  Just reading Hitler's speeches, at least the translations, isn't enough to really appreciate his perverse talent.  You have to watch the films.  His fervor is persuasive, in his early political career he was a fantastic speech giver.  He told the German people exactly what they wanted to hear, then added his big lie.  <br />
<br />
Talent is not the exclusive property of good.  Many truly evil people have large amounts of it in some form or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-28-2002, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Triumph of the Will is possibly one of the most frightening movies ever created.  Reifenstal was genius of the same order as Hitler.  <br />
<br />
My quick analysis of Hitlers Speechs.<br />
A. Start with something established as fact and simple<br />
B. Move from there to something semi connected to A and that is highly emotional<br />
C.  Continue with emotional fervor, but move to grounds wholy unrelated to A. and B.  Caught up in the emotion, people don't realize the flaws.<br />
D.  End with a short, powerful slogan or idea.<br />
Afterwards, all people remember is the emotional feeling and the slogan.  Given the feeling they have, the slogan &quot;must&quot; be correct.  Now all hitler has to do is invoke said slogan or idea and people will instantly feel that same feeling of righteousness and lose all semblance of rationality.<br />
<br />
Of course, hitlers genius was his ability to move seamlessly through the stages.</div></div><hr />

Well, this isn't entirely correct....<br />
The end of World War I came as a total surprise to almost all Germans, even most of the military except for the highest rank. After all, the German army was still standing in enemy territory. Since 1914, no allied soldier had set foot on German soil, except as a prisoner. This lead to the &quot;dagger stab legend&quot;, a widespread belief that somehow, the German army was cheated out of their victory by someone. After all, only the highest ranks in the military knew that the war was in fact lost. <br />
<br />
The allies then gave Germany a valid and long lasting reason for complaint. Germany had capitulated based on president Wilson's Fourteen Point Plan. This plan was never mentioned during the signing of the Versailles treaty, and only four of the fourteen points were recognizable within the text of the treaty.<br />
<br />
Hitler used this fact to get the majority of the people to his side. Germans per se certainly didn't hate everything that wasn't German. Don't make us worse than we are... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 08:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hitler was a great leader and strengthened germany, unfortunately there was that holocaust buisness.. tends to tarnish an otherwise great leaders reputation..  <br />
More idiocy from the same person.  Palastine you say?  Interesting idea.....hmmr /ponder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well it really depends on if you think leadership includes morality and good and evil. In the beginning, he tried to change Germany for the better, and was luring support with powerful speeches. Of course, as we now know, it was a means to an end, a way to seize control of the world.<br />
<br />
Was he evil, if such a thing exists? Definitely.<br />
<br />
Was he the spawn of satan? Yup<br />
<br />
Great leader? No, probably not<br />
<br />
Stupid mustache? HELL YES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 09:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I do feel compelled to point out is that this quote is no more a &quot;sign of the times&quot; than is an individual murder or other event - unless the &quot;times&quot; to which you refer are the years of humanity living on earth.<br />
<br />
Look at the way the Jewish leadership were able to turn the people so effectively against Christ 2000 years ago. Look at the speech of Brutus in Shakespear's Julius Caesar.<br />
<br />
Strong, well phrased rhetoric has been used to turn people's viewpoints to the speaker's side for thousands of years.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of a pertinant quote from &quot;Men In Black.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;A person is smart. People are dumb panicky dangerous animals and you know it.&quot;<br />
<br />
A single person is hard to convince. A crowd of people is easily swayed by effective rhetoric.</div></div><hr />

&quot;God people, what the hell are you thinking, look at the mustache! You KNOW he's up to something.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets pick apart this &quot;speech&quot; in application to American society.<br />
<br />
everything is a detail of history. History is more than the holocaust, despite what your local newspaper tells you.<br />
<br />
Would anyone disagree?  Yes the holocaust was horrible and yes we hope it never happens again but lets look at Stalin killing more people than Hitler EVER did and yet that is so overlooked by people.  Or Yugoslavia, or Rwanda or several other places where cleansings have occured.  The Holocaust was horrible yes but it was by no means unique, or even the most recent.<br />
<br />
Its time we stop worrying about the atrocities of the past and start worrying about preventing the atrocities of the future.<br />
<br />
Again would anyone disagree?  Yes we should always remember the past.  But today there has been incessant worrying over pass atrocities.  The Holocaust gets way more attention than similar events that affected other peoples.  Or what about reparations for slavery.  We as American people fret over things long gone and unchangable when we could be spending that effort trying to fix problems affecting us now.<br />
<br />
Remember yes... WORRY (as the passage says) no.<br />
<br />
As we speak in Sudan there is widespread murder and hatred of Christians. why do we not speak out against them? What about other 3rd world countries where the same things happen?<br />
<br />
Well its true.  In many many nations Christians are the ones being attacked and cleansed against yet our media doesn't cover it nor do we do anything about it.  Perhaps cause its ok to mock Christians?  Perhaps because Christians deserve less than others?  From several of the posters on this board and from several of media sources out there that is often the message I get.  Tolerance for anything(gays, muslims, jews, various ethnicities) EXCEPT Christianity.  It affects other countries more deeply cause there they are dying but its happening here too.<br />
<br />
what about the other atrocities? Jews say &quot;never again&quot; but its already happening, they arent complaining because it isnt them this time around.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the reason they are not speaking out against other things is cause they are too worried about their own hide.  With the ENTIRE world against them in Isreal with the exception of the US wouldn't you be a little bit busy to worry about others?  Even so there have been several statements from Isreal and other Jewish leagues on behalf of other ethnicities being attacked.  They however are rarely brought to light in the media.<br />
<br />
Le Pen will be a breath of fresh air for the French. Maybe he can get France some dignity and class, something the French are sorely lacking.<br />
<br />
Well I would agree he would be a breath of NEW air but not sure about fresh.  He speaks a good speech but he doesn't walk a good walk so while I may think some of his ideas are interesting I don't think he is the man to execute them as I think they are very much a facade he is putting up to win votes.<br />
<br />
I make this a call out to all nations to get their act together. current self-destructive society is a bane to humanity.<br />
<br />
Again would anyone disagree?  We are seeing the largest moral and societal breakdown perhaps since the fall of the Roman empire.  We are leaving a &quot;golden age&quot; and entering an age of bread and circuses and political corruption.  The US is already on the road to &quot;Empire&quot;.  We are not full blown yet but too many historians are able to equate steps the US is taking with Roman, Greek, Persian Empirical counterparts in history.<br />
<br />
We must put forth the concepts of personal responsibility and duty.<br />
<br />
Would anyone disagree?  How many threads on frivilous lawsuits are brought here and then either laughed at or  get the &quot;you can't be serious&quot; attitude discussed about them?  Our desire to blame anyone but &quot;me&quot; is causing untold problems with child raising, crime, insurance issues, and even laws and statutes.<br />
<br />
We must bring back loyalty to God, Family, and Country.<br />
<br />
This one might get some more disagreement but I have to ask if your not loyal to at least one of the above things then who are you loyal to?  If its &quot;me, myself, and I&quot; then I would argue that is where many of our problems are stemming from.  50 years ago when the above attitude was prominent we had much fewer problems then we did today.  It wasn't til the rise of the &quot;Me generation&quot; that we drifted.<br />
<br />
In France there is none of this. It is a hellhole of liberal self-indulgence. <br />
<br />
Now depending if your liberal or not you may agree or disagree.  But frankly I think some of the liberal agenda has gone too far.  The removal of responsibility and this incessant forced dualism on the country is too much.<br />
<br />
Tolerance means not to kill or injure someone you disagree with.  It does not mean the liberal BS of I must ACCEPT everyone or everyone's viewpoint.<br />
<br />
i hope its firebombed and wiped off the face of the earth.<br />
<br />
This would be something I disagree with.  While I may get extremely pissed sometimes and to vent some steam say &quot;Nuke em all&quot; I would never wish that upon people who were corrupt and kept it to themselves.  (my view changes once they become aggresive to neighbors and then I treat it like I treat self defense.  You forfeit your rights when you try to deprive another's)  At any rate if a nation wish to live peacfully in a corrupt society thats their business.  If it my society then I sure as hell will fight against it with every ounce of my being.<br />
<br />
Going to analyze this statement going by reviewing the second half first...<br />
<br />
 the world that belongs to those of us with strength, pure hearts, and extreme valor.<br />
<br />
Not that this has to be militarily.  The new arena is the Market place.  The idea is to dominate or show &quot;strength&quot; in  the world market and the US does that very well.  More over don't we believe that American ideals are the superior ideals?  That would be the &quot;pure hearts&quot; but lately there seems to be a lot of dissent against American ideals in favor of other things.  But so far it was the American ideals which have had the most success.  And finally the extreme valor is something we also have traditionally looked favorably on.  We reward our military for being brave.  We reward entrepreneurs with money and success.  We reward philanthorpists with museums and street names.  All involve risking something and all are rewarded in kind.  Yet lately we flambast the capitalists, we degrade our military (Vietnam anyone?), and charitable organizations are often attacked by their government counterparts (Christan Jewish and muslim charities have all had nasty encounters with government funded programs in recent years).<br />
<br />
the first half...<br />
<br />
We must cut out the sickness festering on OUR world,<br />
<br />
The language is a little strong but isn't this the premise we live on in this country?  If something is wrong then we try to remove it like removing a cancer in some cases (corruption for example?).  It is simply a graphic picture of a concept we all take part in.<br />
<br />
So with the exception of the Fire bombs and the choice of Le Pen (cause I think he is a psycho mad man bent on power rather than reform) I think the rest of this speech is fairly close to the mark.  Its a speech about drastic reform going in the opposite direction of the passed couple decades.<br />
<br />
A few decades ago I would've been branded a liberal due to my stance on racial equality and other civil rights issues but I think some of those concepts have been taken too far now which is why some people view me as conservative in those areas.<br />
<br />
There is such a thing as too much of any idealogy and I think several decades ago there might have been too much conservatism, I think today there might be too much liberalism.  The speech above seems to indicate exactly that to me.  We should take what liberal concepts were good and keep them but we have also brougth in liberal concepts which are bad and we should return to the conservative counter ideals in those areas.<br />
<br />
Anyhow I think the speech has been severely colored a certain way due to two bad references to an extremist element from the other side but if you remove the reference to Le Pen and the Firebombs I think you have a fairly moderate speech.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tel, everyone believes the time they live in is going to be the final dissolution of human society.  It's called nostalgia.  Considering the quality of life for all humans is better than it was on the average.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VaderJM4</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 12:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually Kullaas, while what you say is true, that sentiment is more important now than it ever was. We have the capability to destroy life on this planet for good. 50 years ago, we had the A-bomb and everyone thought it was bad, but there's no chance in hell the military DOESN'T have some much, much bigger and badder nowadays. There's just not saying anything about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Myrea</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 01:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well said, Tel.<br />
<br />
The best way to get people to follow an extreme belief is to camoflage the controversial ideas within actual truths, and to bring them into view gradually. When 80% of a speech or essay is undeniably true, or at least reasonable, it's easy to believe the whole thing is true.<br />
<br />
If you just skim what this person wrote, it sounds reasonable. The first time I read it, I read the first paragraph, and glanced at the rest. It sounded like he really had a point. Then I went back and read what he was REALLY saying. <br />
<br />
The same thing happens in this country. In a presidential debate, people remember the sound bites that the press wants you to remember. Even if you watch the whoe thing, you can quite easily miss the real meat of what they are saying. It's couched in rhetoric, by people who have been well educated in how to deliver it in such a way that no matter what they say, it sounds good.<br />
<br />
The author here has some talent in composing his ideas. If reasonable people read this and agree with him, think how easy it was for an oratorical genuis like Hitler to stir up support.</div></div><hr />

Tel, you do know that that is essentially saying, lets kill everyone who doesn't fit our mold of what was it, oh &quot;strength, pure hearts, and extreme valor.&quot;<br />

<br />
What that I think Le Pen is a whacko but that some of his ideals that he is pushing forth actually have merit to them?<br />
<br />
Just because someone is evil doesn't mean ALL their ideas are evil.  In fact I would argue the ideas he is spreading are not even his own rather just rhetoric that he thinks will get him elected.<br />
<br />
As far as the pure hearts go Why does that automatically equate to &quot;pure race&quot;.<br />
<br />
Le Pen may think that but I've already stated what I think about Le Pen.<br />
<br />
Personally I would interpret it coming from another source as meaning having a pure heart in regards to devoting oneself to the good of the country and your fellow man.<br />
<br />
More over I was disecting his speech and stated that 80+% of it was good sounding speech that made good political sense and that he mixed in just enough crap that I think he is a whacko.<br />
<br />
It would be kinda like me saying Hey I've got a cure for cancer.  It will kill off the cancer in total and you will feel no more pain.  It will solve the problem in total.  Just let me chop off your head and all your worries are fixed.<br />
<br />
In otherwords I see Le Pen as the doctor who thinks the cure lays with the death of his patient.  However a FEW of the things he mentions might actually have some merit.<br />
<br />
Don't throw out the baby with the bath water kinda thing.</div></div><hr />
