<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssarahh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetingss found my self a nice little place to hunt that is pretty much hand designed for a shaman to Solo /grin<br />
<br />
in Tim Deep there is an island that looks like a huge Iceburg now on this island there are Gorlas (look like Brutes only white) the hardest i have been hit was for 61 (sat down too close to a spawn place) and they only resist spells occasionally they dont hit very fast to begin with so with Slow they practically just stand there and let you hit them usually takes 1EB and Scourge +melee to get them to run there is a place there with 4 near by static spawns (one in a broken boat, one on top of the igloo and 2 in the open) right by where we have to go to get the &quot;Crushed Dread Diamond&quot; for the CannII quest. They gave approx 1/3 blue bub of Xp /kill at 30 for an Iksar and if ya get a good tactic you can clear all for before the re-pops start. I had and am still having a great time there!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for the Good spot. I was having a difficult time getting out of 32 till I read your post. I made it to 34 in just one night there. Just wanted to say thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Great spot, Thanks! :p<br />
<br />
I did find my slows being resisted quite a bit. Tried different flavors of it with similar results. Instead I am pullin with Listless and EB while incoming, melee then reapply EB once it wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Politetraethyl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I hunt these guys with any lvl 30-34 character I have. If you can snare, fear and or darken then this spot is for you. Also for shammies there is an item dropped here for Canni 2 quest - the diamond crystals or some such. You will see a small bag sitting on the shore along the north edge.<br />
<br />
Heck my lvl 31 bard could tank them down. I am going to take a monk out there soon and see how he does.<br />
<br />
BTW: the ice chuncks that drop from Golras are for making thurgadin rootbeer. Sounds gross - dwarven rootbeer, but I think the recipie is insanely hard and peopel will buy those just to make that part easier. The bigger apes also drop item for SK armor quest. <br />
<br />
At lvl 32 I was getting 1-2% of level per kill.<br />
<br />
----EDIT----<br />
<br />
I didn't read the first post - sorry - that one made more sense and said the same thing anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I just found out about this spot a few weeks ago *nudge to these boards* and went from 27-31 with extreme ease.  I did'nt have resist problems on slow or any dots that are really worth metioning.  <br />
<br />
(You can also bind on the island now btw, the hunting guide posted in the 20-30 section says you cannot)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Question is, how does this place compare to the Zelniaks in Dawnshroud? Thoough there is zero loot, those cattle are abslolutely insane exp if you are twinked out decently on weapon and AC. At lvl 31 I get 1/2 a bubble for most blue kills. Unless the loot is really nice or the exp is around 3/4 blue bub per kill, I just don't see the trip being worth the travel since Dawnshroud is 2 minutes away from the Nexus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tehh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have'nt tried the Zelinaks but the loot in TD is soso, the average drop is 1-2pp and 3-20gp gold per mob and words / research components.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gludorp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried this zone yesterday and for me at least this iceburg area is bugged to hell. I needed to stand practically nose-to-nose with these gorlas to hit them, or otherwise I would get the &quot;You cannot see your target&quot; or &quot;You are too far away from your target&quot; messages. And because they constantly moved around, I would keep getting those messages no matter what I did.<br />
<br />
This was on Fennin Ro. It sucked and I left.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Xenah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What route did you take to get there?</div></div><hr />
