<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im 65 with only 23 AAs, those required to get Canni V.  <br />
<br />
I was wondering the best way to get AAs seeing as im on the verge of Sol Ro flagging...  And what would be the best order to get them in, Im thinking about getting Crit Affliction but im not sure this is the best one to get next.  I have all spells minus malos and Velium strike.  Solo perfered on places to get AAs<br />
<br />
This post probably is a bit confusing...<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>mojoejojo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 65, an easy spot to solo is in HoH in the grave yard.  Get KEI, and pull the 2 at the ent, rooting 1.  root the second, malos, then lay on all the non-root breaking dots you have to the second, while re-rooting the second every couple of minutes.  Slow if you feel nervous, then just basic root rot.  I get 6% aa per kill.<br />
<br />
Easier yet, is to duo with a ranger, druid, or necro, and agro kiteing, and the exp flows faster.<br />
<br />
If you have time, getting into a good BoT group can really make the AA's flow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll be hard pushed to beat Sol Ro's tower for AAs with an xp group or just duo with a melee partner. I've found a monk works well as they can split the pairs and have some decent dps.<br />
<br />
Solo, then I'd suggest PoTactics pit area, root rotting mobs as described in numerous posts.<br />
<br />
As for order of AAs, well it sounds like you raid a fair bit so I'd get MGB first of all. Then SCRM to get extra time on quiessence and all your other buffs. VP3 to greatly improve root-rotting ability when you're out soloing. Then SM3 to save mana, ND3,  CA3 and LR5 to hjelp you survive whilst slowing stuff or soloing. RC1 is useful for curing miscellaneous dots and debuffs. There's no &quot;right order&quot; but that is one point of view. Again, search the forums for numerous posts on the matter. Look at your playing style. Do you get hit a lot? Then CA3+LR5 will be very useful. Under 2500 hp unbuffed? ND3 should be a priority. Root rot a lot? Then VP3 and crit affliction. Mana an issue? Get SM3. Its all up to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks those where both awesome ideas i have tried HoH and kills are faster than I imagined they would be.  As far as the AA order goes thanks those are a few things to consider!</div></div><hr />
