<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fokkilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Could someone help me understanding strafing.<br />
<br />
I think it is to circle a mob, using our agility to get in some shots while they are turning.<br />
<br />
However, when I do this the mob seems to turn just as quickly as I do.<br />
<br />
Is there a technique I am missing or am I slowing down in my old age?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kedawen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strafing is stepping sideways, using the CTRL+arrow keys. This is especially useful for fear kiting a mob that turns 180 degrees frequently. It is easier to get to the side of the mob and strafe than chasing behind it, where when he turns around, you have to turn as well to keep it in sight.<br />
<br />
I don't think you can maneuver around a mob fast enough to avoid being hit, though it is an effective tactic in PVP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have noticed strafing helps a lot as well when running for zone away from a mob... Its probably an exploit since mobs dont have the ability to straif but it has saved my butt a time or two...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Probably goes without saying, but it's also the best way to stay behind a mob if he's doing the panic boogie mentioned earlier, or if he's switching between different party members.  If you stay behind him, he can't do riposte damage to you.  By strafing instead of turning and moving, you can avoid the whole &quot;you can't see your target&quot; thing while repositioning.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">....strafing is a good skill to have.  It allows you to quickly position yourself anywhere around the mob without losing any damage, because you can always keep your front to the mob.<br />
<br />
Nice when that stinky big ogre is crowding you, or you need to move to get a few more degrees peripheral vision to watch for adds.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>TheOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">unless Tanking I always strafe to stay behind the mob,  if for nothing else then to avoid it's riposte</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">And don't forget the most important use of strafing -- repositioning yourself when someone goes into bazaar mode right on top of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kelliani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a strafing nut.  I use it constantly.  Since the PC detonated on me, I'm having a rough life using the laptop with the CTRL key all the way across the keyboard from the arrow keys.    :p<br />
<br />
The aboslute most important use I have found for it is to keep position on a critter to stop shoving it all over the place.  Perfect example of a good use for it is in Halls of Testing.  I see way too many people end up on the back end of the mob due to shoving.  This is bad because it shoves the critter right over the MT.  Eventually, the MT will run out of room against a wall.  At that point, the rogues lose the back because the MT needs to spin it out of that position to continue holding aggro.<br />
<br />
Personally, I do not see what is so hard about just strafing left or right to keep position on the critter.  Instead, people let it slide past them and turn to face it when they get the message that they can't see the target.  This has the result of shoving it over the MT even faster.  Yes, some shoving occurs.  It's going to happen.  However it can be minimized if you maintain postition by strafing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">strafing saved my butt so many times ... sow faded and had to zone with less than a buble of HP :) thanks QII hehehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mephs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Something that seems to have been missed here is the benefit of using mouselook combined with strafing..... of minimal use against mobs that can instantly turn but great to use in PvP I should think.  If you use the mouse to turn as you strafe you can circle-strafe (or skiff as it's known in the FPS communities) and always keep facing a target while they turn to meet you.... if done correctly you can keep an enemy in your sights constantly while always remaining out of line of sight.  I know it's a completely different kettle of fish but try playing somehting like Unreal tournament or Quake 3 strafing using the alternate key..... then learn to do it properly with mouselook and you will soon find that the ability to skiff hugely increases your maneuverability. using purely keys can make do... and some people swear by it... but if you learn this method I swear you'll never look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">circle strafing using mouselook rocks, I've been using it forever and don't see how people live without it ;) works for a ton of things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lolz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah awsd and mouse is the only way to go.</div></div><hr />
