<br />
as far as i know, the mob placement is too close and the assist range too large to solo anything effectively.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">After some experimentation I have found the mobs in Qvic are eaily solo'd.  ATM the only place to solo is at zone in from KT, because of the highrate of see invis.<br />
<br />
There are 3 types of mobs to choose from at zone in.  The kyv are soloable, the mastruq warrior types are soloable, and the mastruq shaman types which I have found to be too much too handle.  The shaman types are of course buffed like mofos and have a very hard hitting pet.  There is way too little room for error on the shaman types to make them worth while.<br />
<br />
Pulling is not a concern.  You are only going to be able to solo the first 4 mobs which are all single pulls.  The respawn is fast and furios so most people will only be able to clear 3 before this first mob respawns.<br />
<br />
My pull tactic is simple.  I load up my debuff line of spells.... malos, malosnia, dr debuff.  Cast breath of trushar on myself then pull with the DR debuff and emmidiatly follow it up with a cast of Virulent Paralysis.  Cross your fingers it lands, if it does not just zone the mob and try again, or go the malos slow route.  If one part of the pull gets resisted just zone the mob... tanking is not much of an option there.  You can tank the mob to a certain extent but the lack of rez makes a death twice as bad as a normal death.<br />
<br />
Once rooted the mob is owned... they have low hps and a not a threat once debuffed.  The mastruq warrior types are by far the easiest... once rooted they go down fast.  The kyv are pretty nasty, once they get around 40 - 30 ish health they start to hit you with a group of ranged spells.  Snares and slows and dots... nasty stuff.  Its easily handled though, once the mob gets to that point just refresh your root at double maybe triple the rate at which you normally reapply.  The mob must stay rooted... running is not much of an option at this point.<br />
<br />
When you zone in.... the right mob is your first pull.  Then the mob to your sharp left is next.  After that the pulls are obvious.  Just reember to use that zone line.... don't be too proud to zone.  <br />
<br />
Have fun guys... this place is a serious challenge and some really fun random augs drop off trash mobs there.  If your guild raids there... just head there an hour or 2 before raid time and have some fun.  If you die its no big deal, you know you'll have clerics enroute soon enough.<br />
<br />
12 percent aa per kill... not the best in the world, but the mobs have low hps so its worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">12% aa a kill isn't to bad solo...reds in fire are 14ish% aa per kill.<br />
btw, nice little write up ebonfang =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can also solo for the same amount of exp per kill in the primal caves in Yxtta. You just need to do the riddles to open the door. The only things that see invis are the Primals themselves and the trusik models. Invis in to one of the primals rooms and have fun. The crag beetles can be VP rotted, the cragbeasts require magic root, and I only killed one spider, but it didn't break VP. Also, if you do the BiC quest you need pages off of the cave mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The primal caves are really super easy to solo in.... IF the Primals are down.  If they are down you have almost an unlimited amount of mobs to pull from.  If they aren't though, it's a bit tougher as you will have to pull around them.  The only problem about this place that i've found is that when you are pulling from the pits that the primals are sitting in, mobs tend to warp on top of you.  I've seen a wizard and a druid try to do this before and had a lot of difficulty for it.  For me, I've soloed here for hours and hours and the only real problem that I have is that if you make a mistake.. it might be helpful to have a cleric camped there to go and get you easily.<br />
<br />
BTW.. there it's better to pull with MD and stick VP.  The mobs have a low chance of breaking it before VP refreshes.  In KT and Qvic, I would use reg root.  VP seems to get resisted a lot and they break it very quickly.  <br />
<br />
I've had mixed results soloing in Qvic.  Some of it is my fault... some of it isn't.  I usually run into problems only when killing the Kyvs.  Mostly because of their huge tendency to hit me with snare, then break root immediately.  Like it was said, there is almost no room to maneuver here so you are just going to have to take it easy and zone if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">please remind me why you should ultor yourself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Any drops to speak of in either camps?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ebonfang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">please remind me why you should ultor yourself <br />
<br />
I belive you may have your spells confused.  Breath of Trushar is a heal over time that I use to help mitigate any damage taken on the pull.  Its almost a gaurantee that you are going to have to channel your root through the mobs melee damage on the first pull, because of limited room for the pull.  If the pull goes bad... you'll need every HP of healing you can spare to get your snared butt across the zoneline  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The first pull is always the hardest in primals caves because you're gonna get hit and they do flurry. Once you kill him you buy yourself room to work with. Once you go here you'll find a kill cycle you prefer, just repeat that. Don't forget to loot Xounii pages if you ever wanna do BiC. For a reference, BiC makes my qvic bracer 335 hp 350 mana with 24+ to ALL resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm a bit afraid to do primal caves if I don't have a rezzer camped there.. mainly cause if not, then I have to beg a few people to summon me then drag me later on.  It's a hell of a lot easier with Primals down though.  If they are dead, then you have all kinds of room to fight in the caves.  Another thing though, is that if the named roamer is up in the caves, then you might not want to fight near the entrance, or near the opening areas heading into each primal area.  The named roams and if he gets near you he will likely mezz you (happened to me twice.. thankfully both times he lost agro after mezzing me).<br />
<br />
I figured out that Qvic is a lot of fun to solo in.  Seriously, if you are able to fight near the garden.. that gives you some solid ground to fight in.  I did it today for about 2 hours (without any form of mana regen unfortunetly) and gained three total AAs.  There is alot of ground there to move around in, and easy mobs to pull without adds.  This is true especially if garden hoe is down and the roaming Msha is dead.  Was giving me probably close to an AA every 40 min solo (would have been less but I was void of any buffs).<br />
<br />
Keep watching out though for the mobs there.  The kyvs run fast and you won't have much time to hit them and run if you want to pull to another area.  The Anueks and Ikaavs both cast pets, and I think that the pets are unrootable, although if you slow them and cast BoT they aren't much for dmg on you.  Watch both of them though.  They like to cast that reflection on you and gate.  A red Ikaav today wasted my whole mana bar by continuiously annulling malos and breaking root all the time, and I kept getting reflected on my spells.. making for a very annoying fight.  Eventually after fighting for about 10 min I opted to root and camp out when i was down to low mana.<br />
<br />
Kyvs are pretty much resistant to disease stuff.  You can land it on them, but VP isn't normally going to last long, so I don't use it to pull with now.  Got tired of seeing them resisting it or breaking it so quickly that I didn't have time to maneuver.<br />
<br />
Oh, the mobs up by the Txevu entrance.. are on the 5 - 6 hour respawn timer.  So, this makes it extremely easy for you to go up there and solo around there, especially if you have access to Txevu.<br />
<br />
Now, the best part about Qvic.  Each trash mob has a very extremely rare chance of dropping:  Broken Shard of Chaos (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=68831) .  I haven't seen it yet, but it's the main driving force behind me actually coming here and doing the risk of soloing.</div></div><hr />
