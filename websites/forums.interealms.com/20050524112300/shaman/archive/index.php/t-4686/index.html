<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Weighing in on the 75H on Test.  <br />
<br />
First off, I must say that I was happy to see most Shamans weighing in as saying 'Woooaa  let's not step on Clerics here.'  You guys are after what make sense for us as a class and I'm glad to see it.<br />
<br />
That said, I think we are wayy past due for a heal upgrade.  I mean, it is just plain embarassing when I have to heal someone these days.  If I chain heal a buffed warrior, it looks about like fungal regrowth =) .  I wince every time I have to do it.<br />
<br />
My opinion, give clerics some upgrades if you can think of anything UNIQUE (when was the last time that happened?). Give the other priests a spell which can heal 25-50% of total hitpoints (not *to* 25-50% hitpoints) with a cap of somewhere around 2k.<br />
<br />
Even something in that range would mean a lot to me and would mean that I could really cover in a pinch, for a while at least.<br />
<br />
As far whether druids need more or not...if druids are in such a rough situation, why are there so damn many of them?   Give them something comparable to us, but for gods sake somehow make them unique and in line with the classes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with you :) <br />
<br />
I'd just rather have druids be equal to us in some way in healing power though if anything. I don't think it would make sense to get them 1k more heal than shamans, when shamans are suppose to be the next best healer next to clerics(Correct me if I'm wrong ;) ,  I have a good idea of what a shaman is, but not a druid hehe) Shamans are supposed to be tribal healers or something right? Doesn't really make sense to give druids a better heal than us in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Just looked up the definition of &quot;druid&quot; and &quot;shaman&quot;. Here's what I got.<br />
<br />
sha·man - n. <br />
<br />
A member of certain tribal societies who acts as a medium between the visible world and an invisible spirit world and who practices magic or sorcery for purposes of healing, divination, and control over natural events.<br />
<br />
<br />
dru·id - n. <br />
<br />
1. One of an order of priests which in ancient times existed among certain branches of the Celtic race, especially among the Gauls and Britons. <br />
<br />
Note: The Druids superintended the affairs of religion and morality, and exercised judicial functions. They practiced divination and magic, and sacrificed human victims as a part of their worship. They consisted of three classes; the bards, the vates or prophets, and the Druids proper, or priests. Their most sacred rites were performed in the depths of oak forests or of caves. <br />
<br />
2. A member of a social and benevolent order, founded in London in 1781, and professedly based on the traditions of the ancient Druids. Lodges or groves of the society are established in other countries. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm, what would I give clerics (off the top of my head)?<br />
<br />
-- Invis (really, is this such a game breaker VI)<br />
<br />
-- Undead HT<br />
<br />
-- An AE heal would be fun and unique<br />
<br />
-- AA skill: Divine Resurrection (innate).  This skill has a 2%, 5%, 10% chance of wiping rez effects on a player after a rez.  Spell casters would be rezzed at full mana.  Cost is 3 AA per level of DR.<br />
<br />
-- Here is something along the lines of a targetable DB:<br />
<br />
Protection of the Gods<br />
Mana: 1000<br />
Cast time: 3 seconds<br />
Recast: 10 minutes<br />
Reagent: Peridot<br />
Duration: 1 minute<br />
Targetable GROUP ONLY<br />
Effect: <br />
  Immunity to melee damage<br />
  Increase Hate by 300 (the mob will be pretty pissed after this)<br />
<br />
This is can be used on the MT trying to keep/establish aggro.  Expensive spell,  but has situational uses and is unique.  Does not affect spell damage, but would help in rampage, flurry mobs. The group only restriction helps to prevent a chain casting on the MT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have seen some pretty good arguments as to why druids should have a better heal, mainly due our slow and mana regen capabilities.<br />
<br />
Not sure whether I am convinced yet, though.  There are a lot of other advantages to druids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torelorm,<br />

Really nice ideas for the Clerics.  I like those, esp the Divine Res and Undead HT.   Invis, I'm not so sure.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dementhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">&quot;I have always felt that giving the Celestial healing line of spells to Clerics was a big mistake. Give Clerics improved efficiency direct heals of various sizes and let Druids and Shaman be the masters of Heal over Time spells. This gives a clear separation in utility between the two types of healers but allows druids and shamans the ability to function as main healers.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Hijacked this from Graal's post on our guild board.  I couldnt agree more.  In the current situation, an upgraded heal is needed prior to 60, but I would love to see something in line with Graal's idea, rather than a direct heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thought you can't cast while DA is on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Toshizo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I remeber reading that shamans are the clerics for lesser races, that are more primal or less developed compared to the high elves or something. Clerics will always be the best at healing. Now they are buffing up druids to give them a leg up on the end game. Why do they need buffing up? Because they take up the majority of the population. Also the some of the druid people are complaining (no offense to druid players) and VI hears them and makes a change. What I think is that if its made in the test server my reaction is &quot;wicked, this has no use to me whatsoever and I will probably be too high of a level to care if it is releasted on the normal servers.<br />
My two CP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You can't cast while DA is up. You can't hold agro while DA is up. You can successfully evade evac's while DA is up. Being a DA'd cleric and watching the rest of the party evac must be extremely depressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Christabel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">DAoC had some interesting things clerics might like.<br />
<br />
1) Point blank, insta cast mez for short duration. Refresh time 15 minutes. Mana cost - 0<br />
<br />
So for instance... every 10 minutes, a cleric could hit a button, and mez everything within 5 paces of him for 10-15 seconds. It would have the same resistance check as any normal magic based spell. But it would have no cast time.<br />
<br />
Because of the long refresh time, it would never step on chanter or bard toes for primary CC. But he could use it in emergencies to freeze pursuing mobs if he was making a dash to the zone (and DA was down). Or he could use it to freeze a couple of mobs who ganged up on a robe caster so he could cast a quick remedy.<br />
<br />
YOu could say that it &quot;blurred class lines.&quot; But it's just an idea. And since clerics get so much aggro, it's not a bad idea to let them have an extremely limited emergency mez.<br />
<br />
2) Insta cast single target and group heals for X% of target hit points (ex. 50%). Refresh time 15 or 20 minutes. Mana cost - 0<br />
<br />
This is just like the paladin's lay on hands. The draw of it is that it would have no cast time, and be uninterruptable (like the mez idea above). So if your enchanter gets 2 or 3 mobs on him and his health bar starts plummiting faster than you could possible get a remedy to him, you can just target him with the f key, and hit your insta heal macro to squeeze in a fast +600. The 15 minute refresh time would make this an emergency tool to keep in your back pocket (rather than a new 'bread and butter' heal spell). <br />
<br />
Those are two &quot;unique&quot; things I'd consider giving to clerics. They might not fit with EQ as it is currently (I don't really know). But in DAoC, those exact spells were what made the pure healing classes a clear cut above the hybrid healers. The small insta heal with a semi-fast repop time would make clerics specialists in keeping robe casters alive (instead of being on the same level as shamans and druids).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Our heals are pathetic at higher levels and could stand upgrading.  The main reason the &quot;inComplete Heal&quot; makes no sense (aside from the obvious problem that it steps on cleric turf too much) is that it has nothing at all to do our existing spell lines.  Give us mini-Torpor in the early 50's (precedent: FoS &gt; HoS) and an ugraded Chloroblast at 59 or 60.  Makes much more sense.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and fix the drop rate on Torpor, as long as we're beating dead horses. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>etheria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Slow &gt; ports et al.<br />
<br />
Don't hide it.<br />
<br />
Druids have little-to-no way to offset damage as shamans do with slow. And no, Fixation of Ro doesn't quite cut it nor does Disjunction with its resist rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far whether druids need more or not...if druids are in such a rough situation, why are there so damn many of them? Give them something comparable to us, but for gods sake somehow make them unique and in line with the classes.<br />
First of all, they're only talking about the endgame. Stop confusing all druids with raid-guild druids. <br />
<br />
And if you look around and see how many are port slaves, alts, or just used as farmers by some dubious players, you'd realize there's wheat and there's chaff. Would you agree there's a difference between someone who has played since release and someone who made a druid for convenience?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, had to edit to add a funny story.   In the first month of the game's release, I played a paladin (cause I liked it in beta).   I was running through EC and saw some &quot;low level&quot; guy (I was 18th level) only equipped with a sword.   He had a skeleton on him was about to die, so I cast Fear Undead on it.  It flies off.  He walks up to me and thanks me.   After exchanging a few pleasentries, the skeleton runs back after fear wore off and smacked him down before I could react.   It was sad, but I fell out of my chair laughing.   I disposed of the skeleton.   He came back and even he was amused.</div></div><hr />

I agree... I'd not considered hate when I posted earlier.  Don't play a cleric, didn't know about DA = no casting or evac evasion.  I figured that the no casting was a spell refresh timer like our Rage line is.<br />

<br />
Snare+SoW means not saying &quot;ow.&quot;<br />

I can see your point, though.  Upper-end druids are certainly starting to pull ahead of shaman in some damage and healing aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We don't need the same healing capacity as a druid does, due to our ability to reduce damage taken by 75% (slow).  If a shaman healing ability equal to a druid, yet vastly superior damage mitigation and better buffs, then a druid doesn't have much to offer a group, which sucks for druids :-\<br />

Personally, I think both shaman and druids are very balanced now.  We solo well at upper levels and stack moderately well on raids.  They solo extremely well throughout all levels and complain about their raid usefullness.  Seems balanced to me.  Clerics can't solo at all, but are an absolute must for any high end raid.  So why do druids think they need a better heal than us?<br />

<br />
If a druid's healing ability equals (surpasses, really) a shaman, yet has vastly superior nukes and damage shields (plus an evac when things go bad), then a shaman doesn't have much to offer a group, which sucks for shamans. <br />
<br />
<br />
Shandy and Harvest make a good point.  Druids are MUCH more offensively powerful than we are.  Damage shields, Nukes, AoEs, DoTs, etc.  We were usually more defensive in nature - Torpor, Slows, debuffs.  <br />
<br />
I doubt druids will receive a larger psuedo CH than shamans will.  I suspect it was a quick way to test both values, and generate a TON of discussion.  But if anything, WE should get a better heal.  Kinda wierd to look at it that way, isn't it.  Make us even more defensive oriented. :)<br />
<br />
Better heals, better nukes, damage shields, and ports - who needs a shaman?  <br />

Of course, I'm conveniently forgetting about slow. :)  And torpor for the ones that have it.  I'm just playing devils advocate.<br />

<br />
If we get that spell to help on &quot;raid-healing&quot; it should cost less mana compared to the amount healed, and cast faster.<br />
<br />
A shaman on a raid is soo busy, 10 seconds of time is way too long.  This needs to be drop to about 6 seconds casting time, and the mana reduced lower than the cost for druids.<br />
<br />
As I've said, I'd rather get a 950 disease based DD and a stronger DoT than another heal.<br />

<br />
Lets see thats easy.<br />
<br />
1) SLOW.  We can already reduce damage 75%.  <br />
<br />
You ever watch groups with 1 Priest?<br />
<br />
Cleric can do it because they can CH super efficiently unslowed mobs.<br />
Shaman can do it because they remove 75% of damage and then can handle the rest with chloro and regen ((or esp torpor)<br />
Druids cant do it.  Not without group stopping<br />
<br />
2) Mana Regen.  We have so much more mana to spend than a druid that we could just cast our 2k heal 3 times, and let them cast 3k heal 2 times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason the heals have different amounts of HP healed now is so Verant gets to test out two versions of the spell at once.  That's also why it's at level 54.  Since Test has such a low population, that makes it accessible to a larger number of players, so its affects will be easier to perceive.  You can bet that when it goes live it will almost certainly be 60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this would be pointless<br />
<br />
The lack of ability for druids/shaman to heal a MT is not seen at level 60(well it still is for druids).<br />
<br />
its from 40-59 where a shaman has a hard time healing, even if the mob is slowed.  Super Heal and chloro will keep a tank alive, but it involves a decent amount of chain casting.  At 60, just wait until the MT has 1k damage on him, and torpor.  Pretty simple stuff.<br />
<br />
54-56 or so is the best levels to put this kinda spell in IMO(or better yet, move SH to level 44, and chloro to 50something, then have this at like 55 or so)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">OK the discussion of:<br />
&quot;Is it fair and right that druids get a larger mini-CH?&quot;<br />
<br />
First of all druids have many other abilities they bring.  But realistically, I can't see anyone in a regular exp group getting healed for more than a shaman-CH anyway.  Or at least not MUCH more.  So there should be no effect on exp grouping based on this difference.<br />
<br />
Where I AM expecting to see a difference is on raids.  Sure, shamans have other duties, but extra shamans who aren't slowing can be healing or doing CH rotations.  Is it fair to shove them out of these duties?  And it will happen . . 1k is a pretty big difference as far as heals are concerned on raids.  <br />
<br />
I'm mostly concerned about how things will go on raids with these spells as they are.  Will shamans be considered &quot;third-tier&quot; healers who are below druids in that respect?  I think so.  So . . . we are above them in nukes . . right?  nope.  DoTs?  Nope, ours rarely land and cause too much aggro when they do.   Ports in/out?  Hah, anyone wanna buy a gate potion?  Only 200pp!   Erm . . . what are we better at then?  Slowing?  Well duh, it's kind of a class thing.  <br />
<br />
I'm just concerned here . . . not sure how raids are gonna work if this goes live.  It's hard to predict this kinda thing.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think they nerfed shaman-CH to cut down on canni-mana-regen.  But then again, most 54-59 shamans dont have even the hps to use the shaman-CH to full effect.  And we all know the ratio at 60 with Torpor which is pretty dam phat.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Hey Ramhorn,<br />
<br />
I am a Druid.  Level 60.<br />
I am also a Shaman, Level 60 as of Last Thursday. <br />
<br />
Does this give me a little more insight in the abilities of BOTH classes and how they compare.  Damn Straight it does.  <br />
Same is true of anyone whose PLAYED a class when talking about it, compared to someone whose basing thier info on &quot;seen&quot; &quot;heard&quot; or &quot;second hand&quot; stuff.<br />
<br />
I'm not alone here either.  There are others who have played a Druid to 60 in this community then rolled up a shaman because they recognized the power shamans have.<br />
<br />
I dont know of a single person on this community or on Druid grove community, that ever played a Shaman to 60, then reversed and decided it would be better to play a Druid up to 60.<br />
<br />
That alone speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
Play both classes to 60, and you will see a huge difference in what each needs.   <br />
<br />
Im very happy with my Shaman,  When I can solo a mob like Dralknr,  Get a Group,  Make a Raid (was only 60 shaman today) happen, Solo for Good XP, Group for Good XP,  Play only healer in group of melees and pure casters, I personally think Shaman is one of the over all BEST, if not the VERY best class in EQ.<br />
<br />
The druid in comparision sucks in most of the above.<br />
<br />
Ah well, Im an Oracle Now :&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont mind the druids getting a 'CHeal' that heals 150% of what ours does, but why do we have to pay the same mana cost with the exact same cast time? Make our 'CHeal' cost 100 mana less than the druid version...or something. <br />
<br />
Yeah, but ask yourself this:  who will most likely be able to regain that lost 400 mana the fastest?  If we still maintained the same healing/mana ratio as druids, we would outrank them so easily as healers just simply because we have cannibalize.  <br />
<br />
Sometimes we cannot afford to heal because debuffs are necessary and quite ironically you sometimes have to rely on other people to heal you in case of resist.  There's no major taunt spell I think that a druid has to cast post-haste, and thus, if he's clever enough, can avoid aggro at all times.  <br />
<br />
That's my take on why druids should be more effective healers than shamans.  If Verant put us on status quo as far heal:mana ratio is concerned, we'd still continue to dominate them in heals.  I think what Verant is trying to do is taking cannibalization into consideration and re-adjusting the scales so that ultimately a druid spends just as much mana (or a little less) than a shaman on heals, in the long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>mystreez</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I don't think it will be that bad if druids healed a bit more than us.  After all, they would have to deal with any aggro resulting from it.  Besides once you do factor in mana regen, shaman will come out ahead still.<br />
<br />
If we were given the amount listed for druids, it would make are mana regen capabilities a bit too powerful.</div></div><hr />

let the little druids have their heal.<br />
even though the shaman in almost EVERY aspect of life was the &quot;medicine man&quot;, i dont wanna be healing like a cleric whore thats just really tall ( or really short depending on shrink :)    )<br />
Druids and Shamans are close, but different enough for them to be the two rival classes of their kind.<br />
<br />
Druids and Shamans are both shapeshifts.<br />
both can heal.<br />
both can slow.<br />
both can nuke.<br />
both can dot.<br />
both can buff.<br />
both can melee.<br />
on and on and on<br />
<br />
but each class does each one differently. one better than the other.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Show me an Iksar Cleric and i'll kiss your bear feet! Show me an Iksar Druid and well lets just say i'll laugh until i cant breathe anymore. <br />
<br />
Growing up Way back when i was a baby iksar shaman i did all the healing, heck slow wasnt even an option.  Now as i dont agree with getting the new heal, I would like to see drop rates upped on Malo and Torpor. I dont raid much never have never will. <br />
<br />
Nothing makes me want to quit the game more than seeing someone selling malo and torpor at 55k + .  It just makes me wanna cancel my account everytime. I'm Not going to cancel my account any time soon, Hell i have so much time invested im looking forward to some changes being made, i want to be able to see Razco (60 Oracle) beside my name in game. <br />
<br />
Just ask yourself this. How many other spell casting classes have more than 1 spell if any that costs on average around 20k.  Ive seen khuras, tigirs, avatar, malo, torpor, and pox all above 20k ... whats wrong with this picture.<br />
<br />
BTW spells drops are working as intended. <br />
<br />
Love me, Hate me..... it doesnt matter, im just another iksar in the no jaundice bone crutch club.</div></div><hr />
