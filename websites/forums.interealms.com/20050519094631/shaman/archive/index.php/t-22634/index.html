<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I had posted part of this on the gucomics forums a few weeks ago, but wanted to get some ideas here too. I'm talking about general game issues mostely, not shaman specific. Theres three main areas I think need to be address, but how do you feel?<br />
<br />
Here are my thoughts on what OoW will need to make it worth it personally:<br />
<br />
1) Leveling to 70 should be no more difficult than leveling from 60 to 65 was. What worries me here is the AA costs in GoD. If they balance leveling exp off the same exp they balanced GoD aa's (elemental experience) off of then they are going to be screwing a large chunk of the player base. Levels should not require the same exp as 30AA's. I remember their being a quote from one of the dev's right before PoP came out assuring everyone that leveling was going to be fairly quick and painless because people didn't have fun leveling from 51-60. I hope that holds true for this level increase. <br />
<br />
2) Spell availability should be the same as PoP. GoD spells are a serious PITA to get. Personally I loved the PoP system because everyone can get their spells eventually. At first they were rather high priced, but now most of the 61-64 spells are really cheap. Any group that is appropriate level for the spells has access to places to get them (BoT being the easiest for specs and runes) and the drops are fairly common. GoD drops are rare and the results are non tradeable thus making them inaccessible to most people. Bringing back ancient spells was an even worse idea. Worse yet I have a feeling that they will be balancing a lot of content in OoW via access to GoD spells. Since in the previous major expansions the non quested spells were always tradeable it was fairly safe to assume a good percentage had them. Based on the poll on the website a little while ago I think its not the case with GoD spells. They should make a version of the GoD slow one of our 66 or 67 spells just like the new style canni. <br />
<br />
3) Make tradeskills available to everyone again. In Luclin and earlier anyone with enough time/paitence/plat could make pretty much all the tradeskill items in the game. The high end cultural stuff was on par with quested armor from the previous expansion. In PoP they made a serious shift in tradeskill dynamics. All of the best gear required elemental access to obtain parts for and even then they could be insanely rare. There needs to be a whole new set of tradeskill items that are as much of an improvement today as the pottery, smithing, and other items introduced in the famous blue diamond tradeskill patch introduced. The components for these have to be available to everyone just like the cultural components were. There also hasn't been a worthwhile tradeskill quest for non raiders since the 8th shawl. This should be addressed as well.<br />
<br />
The first two are of the most importance to me in considering buying the expansion, but the last one is something that needs just as much attention.<br />
<br />
Sadly, I really don't expect any serious changes before OoW goes live. Their track record is almost 100% to push the same or weaker crap live that initialy shows up on lucy for the spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm concerned with spell availability, but also about where I'll be able to XP on mobs that are worthwhile at the higher levels. I can't get any place more restricted than Tactics right now, and while I hear XP is emmensely better in Sol Ro and the Elementals... if I can't get flagged for them, I'll never see it.<br />
<br />
I hope grinding XP at 70 in Tactics won't be like trying to grind XP at 65 in Disease... will the zones I can get to all go light blue on me by the time I hit 70? Even though I'm just a few kills from the ding, I think I'll hold off a bit and keep piping it to AAXP after OoW until the reports start coming in from the less casual players.<br />
<br />
Of course, I say that now, but will I?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't mind if levelling from 66 to 70 is hard, that's fine, but I do mind if I level and have little hope of getting my spells any time soon. I can see maybe making a rare spell here or there, but most of our spells should be accessible upon levelling or it takes away much of the incentive to level at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spell availability and racial penalty! Grrrrr, don't get me started.  That will be the nail in the coffin for EQ if Omens doesn't deliver.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh joy ....<br />
<br />
I look forward to not being able to rebuff a Raid with MGB F7 cause a few have the new buffs on ....<br />
<br />
I look forward to having the highest Level Shaman in the guild doing the buffing because the others won't be able to overwrite his spells ....<br />
<br />
I look forward to not being able to overwrite a slow because I am level 67 and the person that landed it was 68 .....<br />
<br />
Yeah, I hated all the stacking issues and buffing issues that came about from the last level increase .... this time, I think I might take 2 days off work sick and grind out level 70 over a weekend or something .....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The one change i would like to see is the release date of OOW pushed back until <br />
- all the bugs of GoD are fixed <br />
and <br />
- the Shaman class is balanced <br />
<br />
Being L 70 wont help me being useful in GoD. Neither will the current crap of OOW-Shaman spells which are visible on Lucy.</div></div><hr />
