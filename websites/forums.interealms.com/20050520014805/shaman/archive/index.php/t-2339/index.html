<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For example, and I didn’t even know this happened, Enchanter NPCs used to get an automatic chance to hit with their spells, regardless of the resistances of their target. We took that ability away from them. Now if they want to have a better chance to land spells they are going to have to cast a Tash spell. <br />

<br />
Just thought it was interesting since several people mentioned that enchanter npcs sure seemed to be able to slow tanks pretty easily when the discusion came up of the difference between how enchanter and shaman pc's where resisted on slows.<br />
<br />
This could definitely account for the feeling that enchanter npcs could easily land slows since they where actually getting a free chance regardless of our resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I noticed this the other night with an Enchanter NPC named Rephas, in Qeynos hills near where Hadden spawns (the little pond).  I decided I would deck him, just for the fun of it.  He landed a charm on me, twice...both on the first cast.  This wouldn't be strange, other than the fact that he was green.  Personally, Im really glad they changed this.  Being charmed (and afterwards hit with enchanter nukes) by a green con was pretty scary.<br />

That SOB charmed my level 60 Monk on more than one occasion. Suffice to say there were a lot of people high tailing it for the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gargoyles in Sleeper's Tomb are regulary using Ice Spear of Solist (1200 damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got charmed by a greenie Siren in CS the other day.  Turned around and cast EB on my poor enchanter friend.  Heh.<br />
Luckily it wore off quickly and I was able to heal him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Would go in and PL my friends in there and at lvl 20 or what ever they'd hold down the front of the zone to the bridge..... bastard enchanter gnoll could charm me at 55.  The number of resists I had was WAY out numbered by the number of times I'd turn on the people I was PL.  <br />
<br />
Good thing is only once every great while would I make the mistake of having a weapon... but when I did :)<br />
<br />
Another one was in Mistmoore back in the day when I was in my 30s and had to run to zone with my chanter budy.  We were trying to break up part of the castle train when I noticed my Gator Maul was swinging CRAZY fast!  Unfortunately when you are charmed you don't get to pick which PC you go for, I alternated hitting my chanter bud and then going for the random warriors in the area.  After I got the chanter down to 1 bub for the 4th time in a row he got me mezzed off him :)<br />
<br />
I agree I've been saying this for years that they screwed up chanters and that I'd fight any mob other than a chanter.</div></div><hr />
