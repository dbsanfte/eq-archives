<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok..i'm stuck at the essence part. I found the essence once on the ground..have the loc but does anyone know if it's a static spawn or can it spawn in multiple areas? Anyone now the respawn time on it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nothenon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think the spawns of the Innothule Mushrooms and Swamp Vegetables are random.<br />
<br />
Found this link - http://pub126.ezboard.com/feqtraderscornerpottery.showMessage?topicID=704.topic - at eqtraders.  If it's not random, there's a few more loc's for you to check out.<br />

Your best bet may be to auction to buy them from newbies while you're looking around.  I don't think the merchants pay anything for them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dang, that's cheap! They're 10k on Drinal, except for one potter who sells for 7k but isn't online very much.  Potters are really pushing hard to make money on these, and making extremely good money on drinal with it.<br />

The inny ones I can see going for more though.  I have spent many hours foraging inny shrooms and swamp vegetables, and got only 5 shrooms and 3 veggies.  They are by far the hardest ones to make because of that.  And there are rarely any newbies in that zone.  Nobody sells them in the marketplace cuz they give them to guildies usually in trade for help on the earring of solstice quest.</div></div><hr />
