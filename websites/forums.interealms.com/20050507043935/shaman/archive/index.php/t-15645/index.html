<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i spent AA points to give my shaman the ability to do criticals w/ direct damage, i have cast it many times on many mobs over the past few weeks and it seems that i can/will only get a critical on a no-exp mob....is this right? bugged? i am not sure...can anyone offer some info on this to help me out? thanks.</div></div><hr />

I think only for spells not clicky's, but i have casted it enough that i would have seen atleast one Critical hit on an exp-mob as compared to the 30+ times i have seen a Critical on the non exp-mob. so the 2% is a small amount, but i have had more than 30 criticals and they have been all on green cons only, so it shows that for some reason its not applying my 2% critical chance to exp-mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It only works with spells and melee procs.  A REIF proc could crit, but a JBB will not.  It used to work with clickies, but no longer.<br />
<br />
As for only seeing crits on green-con mobs, that is just bad luck on your part.  With only SCF1 trained, you will see crits very very rarely.  I have FOM1 and I still rarely get crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">does it work on soulstripper? i know the healing ones do would they stack? double crit? hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes it works on Soulstripper and yes it stacks with the healing crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so does it give u twice they crit or just a higher pct chance to crit?</div></div><hr />
