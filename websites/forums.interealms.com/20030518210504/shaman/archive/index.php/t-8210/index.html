<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just gotten myself a Gantru Charm. I am confused as to which slot to equip it:<br />
a) Range Slot, to replace Ceremonial Smudging Stick<br />
b) Neck Slot, to replace Ivory Imbued Collar<br />
<br />
What do you think?<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Edarb Everbuzz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I wear mine in the range slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">range slot here also. there are much &quot;better&quot; necks out there that are not too hard to find. nothing really like a gantru charm that is as common for range!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Range slot it is then. I have sold my trusty Ceremonial Smudging Stick (wipes tear from eye, recalling the myriad hours spent camping that Tribunal be damned Grimling Chief).<br />
<br />
I am interested to hear what are the &quot;better&quot; neck slots Kiteless? I am currently using the common-as-muck Ivory Imbued Collar...any thoughts on a reasonable upgrade?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnhild</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">a talisman from WW is a good upgrade.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yup I was about to say, I have a +6 dragon talisman in my neck slot and a Gantru charm in range.<br />
<br />
Recently upgraded fom ivory collar and goranga idol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for me, my 'better' is an amulet of insight, but theres alot. i just mean &quot;better&quot; because getting a neck with some wis and some mana or hp or ac isnt that hard but finding a nice range slot that has good stats is challenging at best imho =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm actually curious as to what a better neck item would be myself.<br />
<br />
I just got my coldain prayer shawl #8, so I now have Zephyr of Brell - IE, EE 4. So I no longer need my amulet of insight.<br />
<br />
I can't kill dragons in WW because I'm on dragon faction, and I hate Kael, so each dragon I kill must be atoned in Kael, which ends up that I go &quot;nah, I won't bother&quot;.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of the 5th Queynos Badge of Nobility myself, 6 wis 40 hp 40 mana with perma see invis. Or the Sheetmetal Torque, which is IIRC, 5 wis 25 hp 25 mana. <br />
<br />
I haven't seen many slime covered necklaces for sale, or necklaces of superiority. Ok, I haven't seen any. <br />
<br />
Crystaline Torque - which has crap for stats, has mana preservation III, but since I am now casting level 61 spells (replenishment, true spirit, agility of the wrulan), I wonder if it is worth the hefty price tag - 18k on Rodcet Nife.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sell the Gantru an option?  I am guessing you are pulling a gain of 7AC and 2 Wis at a loss of 20 points of resists by slapping it in range.  If you were trading for more hp it would make sense to me, but a minimal AC/Wis bump does not seem like that good of a deal.<br />
<br />
Most tradeable neck slot items that will beat a Ivory Imbued out there tend to be hard to find and pricy in my experience.  I ditched my Ivory for a Sabertooth necklace before picking up a Slime covered because I was not hurting for Wis and wanted more hp/MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">how about a chancellor's medal? <br />
+6 AC +4 Str +4 Sta +4 Agi +4 Dex +4 Wis +4 Int +4 Cha +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +0.10 Wt <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
a large smooth metal torque<br />
+6 AC +5 Wis +5 vsFire +5 vsCold +25 HP +45 Mana +0.20 Wt<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
ribbon choker<br />
+7 AC +8 Agi +15 vsMg +45 HP +45 Mana +0.60 Wt<br />
<br />
they are all pretty easy to come by. imho, once you get to a certain point, the lack of stats on the crystalline torque doesn't really matter. if i ever get a replacement for my amulet of insight i'm going to velks to get one. <br />
<br />
anyone know if this drops anymore? drool..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jora_Delossian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tracking wolf collar: 10ac 5int/wis 40hp/mana and some cold resist.<br />

Obtained from the 8th coldain shawl walk or the bazaar.<br />
<br />
*edit*  Also, for your range, you may be able to do the quest for the Talisman of Benevolence:  7ac 15wis 38hp 55mana 12magic/cold.  Although with the Skyshrine revamp, I'm not sure if this is available anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally love my neck slot, I have turned down several nice neck slots simply due to the focus effect it has:<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10233<br />
Sure I could snag better hit point/mana items, but Affliction Eff 3 is just too cool.<br />
Drops in Ssra from Rhag Mozdezh, was probably one of the harder fights I had been in at that time. He procs a nasty poison that the only thing we could find that cured it was Disenfecting Aura.<br />
If I had to choose a neck slot now over my trusty talismen, I would probably look at the Tracking Wolf COllar, Clattering Bone Necklace, maybe the Qeynos Badges (if I hadnt managed to become KOS to the int caster guild in S. Qeynos...don't ask).<br />
Some of the new PoP drops look nice (I dont have it yet) but I cant comment on them personally.</div></div><hr />
