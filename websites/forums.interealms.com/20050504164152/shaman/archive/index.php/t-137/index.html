<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">you need the newbie cudgel  you get for turning in the note to do the 2nd cudgel.  <br />
<br />
My problem is I have no clue how to get a newbie note (or the cudgel) for my troll.<br />
<br />
My faction is ally with the shaman, so that should not be an issue.<br />
<br />
anyone have any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm I didnt know this, I would be interested in an answer for this question as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Krodah,<br />
<br />
I would also be interested to know what you exactly had to do to become an ally as I am also a Troll worshipping Innoruuk.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Start a level 1 Iksar Shaman and use it to MQ the quest.  The level 1 Iksar hands in his note and gets a cudgel.  He then hands in the cudgel and your other shaman then hands in the other quest components to receive the next cudgel.</div></div><hr />

crap, I think its as simple as talking to one of the main squeez's in the shaman guild. &quot;I have lost my cudgle&quot; or something along those lines..<br />
<br />
The correct NPC says something like &quot;what is it dear shaman, you have a strange look in your eye, like you have [lost] something&quot;<br />
<br />
Dont remember specifically...mebbe that helps a little.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are 2 ways to do this.<br />
<br />
The cudgel quests require some item (ie a box that combines the right ingredients) and the cudgel.  What you need is to say the words, get the box, get the items, and do the combine.  Then have a friend create a new shaman, hand in the new shaman's cudgel, and you immediately thereafter hand in the other item.  You will receive the next cudgel back.<br />
<br />
Alternately, I'm pretty sure that there is a now way to get a new cudgel from the Heirophants.  Something like, &quot;I lost my cudgel&quot; or something.  They put that in for iksar that lost their cudgels.  I'm not sure of the trigger words though.  Allakhazam.com may have something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Drexzil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, you can also start a mule lvl 1 shammy and MQ it as well.</div></div><hr />

Well I did the 8000 bone chip turn in which improves cabilis faction with everyone but necro's.  I've also been doing quests to improve my necro faction and I may have gotten shammy hits for it.<br />
<br />
The big thing is to do the 8000 bone chip thing, thats probably your best bet.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have an old post explaining cabilis faction at home, I'll dig it up tonight and repost it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">btw thanks for all the help, I'm probably gonna do the twink coopt because i'm still KOS to necro's and I doubt I can do the quest to get my own newbie club.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks Krodah!<br />
<br />
Jesus, 8k of bone chips, god help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">best ways for bonechips:<br />
<br />
1) paineel  <br />
<br />
2) buy em, I offered 8pp per 20 and would also buff people up.  You can get tons in Kirn and if you just auction in there a lot and pop out to FOB and auction there.  Once people get to know you they'll save em for you and they'll come looking for you.<br />
<br />
another good thing is if your like me and hate trading in EC, I would just take the less than stellar gear I would get (stuff like the 2hb from sebilis that drops in the necro jail) and trade to newbie iksar for bonechips. <br />
<br />
I prefer option 2 as farming bonechips bored me to tears.  I spend my time auctioning and buffing and got my bonechips over the course of a month by spending non raid time there.  I also made a lot of iksar friends who I still see (most of em are 50+ now hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">is this quest even possible for barb shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xeryus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It is but you need alot of time and patience ;) <br />
<br />
go iksars</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">an update, I am working on the quest for a new cudgel and the activation phrase is &quot;Yes I lost my cudgel&quot;<br />
<br />
took me about 30 minutes to figure out I needed the Yes in there :P<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
<br />
ok that quest is WAY too long hehe<br />
<br />
best way to do it is get the 3 skull for quest #2 (took me about 2 hours) and then make a newb and do the coopt.<br />
<br />
I have cudgel #2 now and will work on the quest more later.<br />
<br />
p.s. my faction is warmly not ally, it was ally at one point but now I'm warmly with everyone but necro's so I guess there was an adjustment at some point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You can buy unlimited supply of Bone Chips somewhere in SoL... God I just wish I'd remember where... Think it was Shar Vahl. Maybe Necro boards would know? They at least have some good tips about gettign bonechips, that's pretty sure.<br />
  Anyway, if you happen to still want to kill skeles, do it in Kurns.</div></div><hr />
