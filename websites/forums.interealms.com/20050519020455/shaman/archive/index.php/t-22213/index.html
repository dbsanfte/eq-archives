<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm on a non-wireless router with my roomie.  I play EQ, he doesn't.  We're using a DSL connection. Now while periodically I'll lock up (whereas I didn't on my old dial-up), that's not the point or observation of this thread.<br />
<br />
Last night (Sunday) I was in the OT whacking MOBs for ribbon drops. (Tailoring is the devil).  Well my Ranger with SOW was moving at Selos speed. He moved as if he had been shot out of a cannon.  FAST. Even weirder, sometimes the 'forage' key would pop up, I would hit it, but get a message:<br />
<br />
&quot;You must wait longer to forage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Same movement observations on my Enchanter. (OT and PoK). Without SOW - was running quick. The graphics were sped up as well.  Also, when casting, the delay between the spell button getting pushed, the spell actually starting to be cast and the spell landing was quite noticeable. (Spell casting time was the same iirc)<br />
<br />
Just really, really odd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sounds like you were having a time sync problem with the server.  Its happened to me before.  It seems to work in 2 ways; either everything moves really really fast or really really slow.<br />
<br />
Ive zoned into dungoen adventures and gotten the really really fast thing before.  Moving at Selos speed, insta cast spells with zero refresh, meleeing like a wacko on speed...it was fun.  It went away on zoning out, but for 45 minutes I was a shaman god....<br />
<br />
Ive aslo had the slow happen...5 minute recast on spells, moving like Im crouched.  THats much more annoying.<br />
<br />
Anyway, zoning usually solves the problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yesterday in an LDoN had a strange thing happen.  2 incoming on pull and I go to slow and BAM its insta cast.  So is everyone else's spell along with Paragon from the bst .. but after that no one could cast anything.  All aa's worked and clickies worked but no one could cast any spell.  We zoned out and it fixed the problem, but for a mintue there it was confusing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Since I've returned I've noticed all sorts of odd EQ client/server hijinks.<br />
<br />
The Netstat monitor shows everything's OK, but fights stop, spells don't cast, and I can do nothing but move until BAM everything starts back up again.  Used to be that the monitor would show lag spikes like that.  Evidently, the server is sending the EQclient data... it's just not usable (or believable?) data.<br />
<br />
- Spells insta-casting ONCE, then never refreshing.<br />
<br />
- Disciplines having all sorts of odd refresh times.  We once believed this was due to the client PC being radically off in date or time from the server, but my PCs sync up with the national time server, and Brenlo's stated that the EQ servers do as well.<br />
<br />
It's not limited to certain zones, although there are some zones that are notably worse (such as Sanctus Seru).</div></div><hr />

Funny was in LDoN yesterday and same thing happened. The spell would 20% cast and then stop as if I was stuck in bad terrain. Ported out and back in and fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Server sync is a big problem. Its why some people die when they zone into places like PoFire and only have a tiny 2 foot drop. The server doesnt sync up, and it THINKS they are in the air for longer. Damage upon impact isnt measured in distance, its measured in hang time.</div></div><hr />
