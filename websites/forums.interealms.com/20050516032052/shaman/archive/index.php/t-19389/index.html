<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Easy question, yes or no.<br />
<br />
Personally I think theres a better chance of Jesus Christ knocking on my front door Sunday to watch the Super Bowl with me then SoE making any changes of value, and I'm an atheist.<br />
<br />
I've seen too many expansions come and go where everyone said wait it'll get better and they always think it will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm willing to bet we will see several new spells and abilities added before GoD ever comes out.  Remember consumption, spirit speed, and spirit shield?  I can only hope :)<br />
<br />
Also, remember that there is more to an expansion than just new AA's and new spells.  For all we know, the content might be such that shamans are once again very important for any encounter.  I'll admit that my hopes of this are not very high given the trends that EQ has taken during PoP and LDoN, but it is not out of the question.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way:  You're getting spells and AA that you didn't have before.  There is no way for this to be bad.  If they aren't exactly what you wanted, they are at the very least something new.  I don't keep up with new GoD abilities as much as I did a few weeks ago, but I remember that last time I checked, most classes weren't getting amazing improvements either.<br />
<br />
If the new slow and canni go live in their current form, I'll consider it a good expansion.  I think those spells look excellent.  I'm also looking forward to secondary forte and critical dots.  If consumption goes live and is an improvement to canni5, I'd be willing to call GoD a great expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure of what question you are asking.  Are you asking if they will fix some of the problems that are in beta right now before launch.  If that is your question, then I say yes.  Lag is getting better every day, and so is the little bugs that are making it a challenge right now.  If the question is will GoD give YOU everything that you want, probably not.  The new lure slow is nice, the new canni will be nice, the new dot will be good (only for soloing purposes of course), some of the new AAs are really nice (SCS, SF, dot crit, FoMM are my favs).  There will be places where the single group of people can go to (instanced zones) where they can go just for exp.  There will be places where the uber guilds can go to raid and improve themselves (think of Time++ fights).  There are many zones including the instanced ones where soloers can go and gain exp.  So, what sir, is your question that you are hoping that they improve?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wheres the &quot;No ****ing way in hell option!&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There is none, it's assumed you would have tact.<br />
<br />
I think it will be better, but unless the content is worthwhile or we get some spell improvements, this expansion is not for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rokktor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you think your AAs are bad, play an SK.  SKs are getting several pet AAs.. for a green pet that can't even proc on anything that gives XP at 65.<br />
<br />
Worst expansion ever?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think anyone plays a shaman that does any development work at SOE.  Whether or not this sounds negative or pessimistic, I don't care, but I do know that we aren't going to get anything useful this expansion.  ALthough I think the new canni spell will be nice, too bad its an ancient spell which won't be accessable to people like me that don't have time for raiding.  Why can't the worthless slow or DoT be the ancient spell?<br />
<br />
For all the optimistic people:  &quot;Wait and see&quot; only tells the devs that you LIKE what you are seeing and have no problems with it.  I find it amusing that people advocate things will improve if we simply sit back patiently and say nothing.  Of course, WoW will be coming out soon...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tell me again why you think that the new slow with be worthless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tell me again why you think that the new slow with be worthless?<br />
<br />
Situation: you are in a group with a 65 beastlord with a full spell book.<br />
<br />
What happens?: Your (worthless slow spell) will not take hold.<br />
<br />
I rest my case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes, correct that is one situation where the new slow might not be most effective.  However, this game isn't designed for every spell to be most effective for every mob.  how long have we been wanting a lure based slow, one that has a better chance of landing on hard to resist mobs????<br />
<br />
I have TA and I'll chain cast slow till it lands on a mob.  However, I've been messing around with the new slow, seeing how often it lands compared to reg. slow.  I just did an instanced zone where I landed turgors about 60% of the time first cast without malos.  I landed lure slow every first cast but once without malos, and I did it in a convincingly quick fassion (think.. all you whining about how beastlords spell is faster casting than ours, now will be able to land this one as fast almost.)<br />
<br />
I'm assuming there is going to be some highly resistant mobs that will require this and only this spell to slow.</div></div><hr />

Sounds awesome, thanks for sharing that info :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">i still cant agree that a slow worst then the beastlord slow is an improvement, although i like the idea of a lure slow, 60% wont make me want to buy/ap it or use it. (speicailly in raids) also, though i not 100% sure, but cant you get turgur down to about 2 sec cast, but with a 1.5 sec cast you cant change the new slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Personally I think theres a better chance of Jesus Christ knocking on my front door Sunday to watch the Super Bowl with me...<br />
Jesus is a Green Bay fan.  He won't be showing up at anyone's house to watch the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A slow that does not replace turgurs just won't fit in my spell lineup very often.  Need to pick up one of those TA thingies somewhere :).  60% + bad duration outweighs the resist mod benefit.  To me, an upgrade to a debuff means you never mem the old one again.<br />
<br />
Oh, on topic, I voted no.  Past experience shows that any changes made will likely happen after the expansion goes live.  They are probably too worried about keeping the zones from crashing etc during testing phase.  Balance is always an afterthought at SoE imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The new lure slow is nice, <br />
Wizard lure spells have a -300 resist mod.<br />
The new shaman slow has a -40 resist mod.<br />
I don't think I would call it a &quot;lure slow.&quot;</div></div><hr />
