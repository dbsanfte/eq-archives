Has anyone done any number crunching or drawn some general conclusion as to wich of the 4 shaman weapon buffs is best?<br />
<br />
Im using Windfury (mostly because its cool) as standard with Rockbiter for easier hits on higher level mobs.<br />
<br />
Anyone else got another strategy?</div></div><hr />

From some of the parses I have seen shows that Windfurry has a very slight advantage in raw DPS so I primarily use windfurry. When I am tanking and need to maintain aggro I will use Rockbiter.<br />
<br />
Flametongue and Frostbrand are situation weapon buffs. Against very High level/AC mobs I will use Flametongue because its based on weapon speed and not AC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Cool, exactly what I needed to know. Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I also use Rockbiter for tanking.  My fellow shaman (2 of us in the group all the time) uses Windfury with a nice dagger.<br />
<br />
PS - for PvPing most people swear by Windfury - unpredictable burst damage is hard for the other person to deal with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Windfury + Flurry Axe = OMG look at all the numbers   :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I also read something about not using windfury on low delay weapons because there is a 3 second hidden delay before windfury can proc again.<br />
<br />
It also seems that people tend to use Rockbiter on low ac mobs since AC effects the damage while using flametounge on high AC mobs since the fire effect is always certain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Honestly I never use flametongue on anything.  While it seems like the better choice against high AC mobs, it gets resisted somewhat commonly too, negating its advantage.  The only use I see is to slow the casting time of a spellcaster.  The flametongue damage is seperate from the weapon damage so its like getting two hits in one on someone casting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow (pun not really intended), is that really true? I am such a newb. I could certainly see the advantage of an (almost) guarranteed extra &quot;hit&quot; on casters if it would help slow their casting down like my own is when I get hit while casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hate to disagree, but windfury, while nice...is not the highest DPS on average...<br />
<br />
Best weapon buff is rockbiter, hands down for an average increase in DPS<br />
<br />
Second Best is Windfury.  It has slightly lower average DPS but has a higher peak DPS capability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Flametongue is situational, but can end up doing more damage against high AC mobs in some cases, since AC has nothing to do with resists.<br />
<br />
I have parsed fairly extensively on this, but to give a relatively simplified example, consider the following<br />
<br />
Lets take a weapon, where unbuffed you are averaging a hit of 90 damage<br />
<br />
Buffed with Rockbiter, you may be averaging about 160 damage per hit<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the same weapon buffed with Windfury, will hit as hard, maybe slightly harder than rockbiter for two hits on proc (20 percent), and the same as unbuffed the rest of the time, so taking the raw numbers...<br />
90 + (2*160)/1.2 = 154...<br />
<br />
As you can see, DPS is close, but a bit lower...<br />
<br />
My parse logs bear this out extensively...<br />
<br />
I think too many people get attracted to Windfury from the occassional burst damage, and just assume that it's the most dps<br />
<br />
Rockbiter downside is really aggro...if your using rockbiter, you generally will get/keep aggro...windfury causes aggro too, but not as much<br />
<br />
Flametongue does have one other use.  It allows you to use a weapon buff in group, that doesnt generate as much aggro, thus making it easier for the tank to hold the mobs.<br />
