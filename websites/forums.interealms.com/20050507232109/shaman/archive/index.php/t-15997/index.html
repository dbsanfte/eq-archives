<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Our guild just got RZ, and we've just begun to filter into the elemental planes.  My impressions of the shaman's role in experience groups in these planes is not encouraging.<br />
<br />
I've grouped in Water and Earth so far with guild mates and here's what I've seen.  First, everything is mitigated, period.  Unless its immune.  Second, resists are very high.  I've found that I sometimes cast slow 3 or 4 times after Malos before it lands, only to be mitigated.  For many mobs, by the time its slowed, its 3/4 dead.  I end up expending so much mana on slowing, that I have little left for other things. Third, there's really only one &quot;other thing&quot; that I do with what little mana is left, and that's spot heal if there is no enchanter for CC. Finally, I get the impression that my ONLY contribution to the group is the buffs (I've started trying to keep FA on the melees because that seems to make some difference).<br />
<br />
My impression is that the optimal elemental exp group is 1 cleric, 1 enchanter (for mana regen, CC, and if there's time, a slow or two), and 4 dps.  Slowing just isn't worth the mana.  Since shamans can't generate much DPS with DoTs, I end up feeling I'm not contributing much to the group.  I should just sit down, keep my mana high, and chain cast FA.<br />
<br />
Basically, even though the exp is very nice in the elemental planes I've visited, I feel my role in exp groups has greatly diminished.  Most groups would be better served by someone two-boxing their shaman twink for buffs outside the group.<br />
<br />
I haven't raided in the elemental planes yet, and I'm assuming that the shaman's role in elemental raids isn't too different from before.  Maybe I'll feel better when we get to raiding and I begin to roll in the phat elemental planes lewtz.  But I'll feel a bit guilty about taking that loot since I'm taking stuff from other classes whose roles are much more meaningful.<br />
<br />
Someone please tell me it gets better than being a one-dimensional buffer in the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In my experience in EP, slow isn't necessary, but it is damn nice to have.  1 warrior + 1 cleric with no slow can manage, but if the cleric screws up or there is an add or something, chances are pretty good that there are going to be deaths.  On top of that, the cleric will probably start having mana problems, since they have to CH and blast a LOT vs. unslowed mobs.<br />
<br />
Slow isn't required, but it makes things much safer.  On top of that, it is very good to have a backup healer in EP groups.  I am usually kept on my toes healing people.  A chanter can slow, but they cannot heal.  This makes shamans good to have.  In addition, almost every mob in PoE has some kind of nasty proc that you can only get rid of with radient cure.  Our ability to RC also makes us valuable here.<br />
<br />
The mobs in PoE are very resistant.  PoWater and Air they are pretty resistant, but no as bad.  PoFire mobs, though, have much lower resists.  I almost always land slow on my first try, there, and PoFire will be your exp spot as soon as you have access, which shouldn't be too long.  Solro is a gimp compared to RZTW.<br />
<br />
Basically, a shaman in pre-EP planes groups can make or break the group.  A good shaman can pretty much insure that a group will succeed anywhere prior to EPs.  In EPs, though, you are going to need a full group of competent people in order to do well.  A shaman is still a valuable addition, but we aren't the deciding factor of whether or not a group will succeed.  This, imho, is not really a bad thing.  I think we're balanced just fine, now.  That is just my opinion though, lots will disagree.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I&quot;ve grouped for exp in Earth, fire and water .. <br />
<br />
earth exp is my favorite .. (except for the mount bugs) .. best exp i've gotten was in a group with 2 warriors, 2 rogues, a ranger and I.<br />
<br />
Malos and Slow were able to stick almost every time .. Q and some spot heals and everyone was healed up. and mobs were dyin' very quickly.<br />
<br />
Enchanters are a must have in water, monks are nice too .. you can get a kite group going in fire .. wizards and druid are good here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My train of thought is radically different from most :) so you're been warned.. first my lineup is malos malosinia turgurs (in poearth) most things malos/slow, crocs malos chain malosinia turgurs, and if you go to certain areas then malosinia is needed there too.. <br />
<br />
2nd most mitigation is only 50-75% range, it's not like they are slightly mitigated, and that is a big difference in mob dps.. and just because it says mitigated, doesn't mean it is.. I'm pretty sure it's not mitigated at all because i can notice a difference in tank hps rate dropping after slow.. <br />
<br />
as for buffs, fos adds 600 hps to a tank and nothing else.. so why even bother with that if you want to be all doom and gloomy? <br />
<br />
In raids most shaman in this board think 1-2 shaman if that is all that is needed, my guild otoh has 7 active shaman on most of the time, and we are awesome.. the chanters die too fast and are needed for other things like cc, and when it comes to gods / bosses our heals are awesome.. and nothing can compare to our debuffing skills..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AE rains are your friend for DPS.  I usually crank those after slowing and just keep FA on the important people.  <br />
<br />
PoW and PoE are the only zones where you may run into trouble slowing mobs and want to keep sinia memmed.  PoF mobs are usually pretty easy to slow with just Malos.  I really doubt you will be exping in PoA, but everyone needs to at least see a spider to complete their EQ experience.<br />
<br />
Play around a bit and experiment with different group combos.  Monks and Knights are prolly my favorite classes to group with in the mentals and you can get away without having a cleric in many situations.  Make some necro friends and you can find that exp yer momma always told you about in PoF, or you can get a standard group and bang out a third of the exp in thrice the time. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I've gotten the most resists in Air myself.  Water being the 2nd worst, followed by Earth then Fire.  And I don't use Malosinia at all.  Just Malos and Tugur's.  If I get two resists on Tugur's, I don't even try for a third time.  Just toss a heal or two on whoever needs it and get ready for the next mob simply because by the time you get a third Tugur's cast, the mob is usually at 50% or less and it's not worth it.<br />
<br />
And Naagruz, there is not one single shaman on this board that would be missing anything by not seeing any of those stupid ass spiders in Air.  If they deleted the model from the file, the world would be a much more enjoyable place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm never exped in water, don't think its worth it. Only raided there. Exped in poe and pof, and its not very challenging stuff. Most mitigate, the crocs in earth about only things that mostly slow, I usually don't have too much trouble slowing. And then just do some chain raining or chain nuking with velium strike depending. Kinda boring exp but fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My train of thought is radically different from most :) so you're been warned.. first my lineup is malos malosinia turgurs (in poearth) most things malos/slow, crocs malos chain malosinia turgurs, and if you go to certain areas then malosinia is needed there too.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Malosinia landed = turgurs would have landed.<br />
Slow in PoE normally sticks after 1-2 casts with malos.<br />
<br />
Shaman roll in Elemental planes is simple, pull with slow and keep a nice and steady amount of mobs streaming in. We are ok there and have some usefull dps to add by running a dot on the mob while we pull the next.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm going to have to agree partly with Stygiana.  Really, i almost never have any problems landing slow in any of the zones.  Hell, i can chain cast it and not even be worried about it (this obviously isn't for someone new to the zones and it's more equipment based).  I can also duo in Earth with a warrior although chaining kraggs isn't exactly fun.  <br />
<br />
Really, there is only 1 mob in earth that I can't stand.. and that's the armadillos.  Sometimes I can get up to 5 resists on slow after malos.  Sometimes if I have a chance before they are pulled I can get sinia up, but I don't make it a habit of keeping it up.  Air, I don't have too many problems (oh, and yes, I **** those piece-of-shizzit spiders).  Water and fire I have almost no problems.  Sometimes I get an unlucky streak (like the other day in Timeb where I spent 30 min without getting a first time slow on anything but the named) and sometimes I don't even have to cast malos (do the first ring in Eartha and you will find that when you face those 15 mobs you prob won't even have to malos them).<br />
<br />
Anyways, my guild has up to 7 shaman sometimes on raids.. and I can tell that at the end of it, every 7 of them feels like they contributed as much as anyone else.  There is of course a few specific fights where we shine a bit moreso than others (like the Warlord fight in PoEb).  But really, we constantly have someone on malos, slow, sinia detail.  Combine this with the pulling of more than one mob at a time and our hands are full.  This makes for alot of fun, and keeps everyone on their toes.<br />
<br />
Last, I don't think that I've almost ever seen a group that didn't want a shaman in their group (elemental).  Some don't necessarily have a shaman in it, but I can tell you that most of them would rather have us for one reason or another.  I still can't spend more than a few min in an elemental zone and not be invited into a group somewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My xp'ing in PoE is somewhat limited, but the 2 or so days I've actually xp'ed in zone there, I found the resist rates to be quite noticable after Malos.<br />
<br />
I haven't xp'ed in PoW.  I've only gone with single or 2 groups to go and kill named mobs that are up after patches or whatever.  The resist rates in PoW I've found aren't that bad.  I'd say it's about tied with PoE.<br />
<br />
PoA is totally crap for resist rates.  It's not an xp zone.  It's a raid zone.  Kind of too bad IMO.<br />
<br />
PoF is really really low resist rates.  There's some special resist rates I've seen, but not much (like spiders are immune? to poison, and I've found the golem mobs to be fairly resistant to everything).  If you go after the humanoid mobs in zone for xp, just cast 1 Malos, and the mobs will not resist more than about 5% of all of your spells.  Poison and magic land very very easily on them.  Also, the xp you can get in the right spots in PoF blow away anything else I've seen so far.  You can get 5% per kill in a full group in the 2nd castle.  The only thing that's any better is killing crab dudes in PoW but I haven't seen it personally.  I've heard something about up to 18% per kill on certain special mobs, but I'd like to see it for myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Talking exp groups, not raiding: Admittedly I've only grouped in the elemental planes for experience a couple of times, but I wouldn't say we're reduced to buff bunnies by any means!<br />
<br />
Take for example a group I was in, in earth yesterday. There, most things mitigate slow, though few are totally immune. Even so, though, I think I was a valuable member of that group. Slows, resist debuffs, buffs, backup heals, damage.... I was even off-tanking occasionally.<br />
<br />
Even if a mob is only slightly slowed, the tank is still taking less damage, and even if a mob mitigates, shamans are still the best slowers.<br />
<br />
I malos (at least) everything, it helps the nukers get more value for their mana.<br />
<br />
My buffs help the whole group - HP, haste, atk. I don't see anyone complain there.<br />
<br />
Backup heals save lives, save clerics mana. Depending on the cleric, I often find that helping out with a Quiescence here and there makes the difference between clerics going low mana or not. It's silly if I'm at 80% mana when the cleric is 20%.<br />
<br />
I see damage as the least of all the things I do, but it's another way I can contribute. It all adds up.<br />
<br />
Off-tanking when we're low on melee or someone's gone LD. It's not ideal, and soaks up healing mana, but it's doable in a pinch. Even I could do this, with only around 5000 hp buffed and decidedly non-uber gear. Once a mob was slowed, I could keep Quiescence on myself, Tnargs as necessary, and hold my own for long enough for the group to kill the first mob and help me out. Did I like it? No, not really, but I could do it!<br />
<br />
Slow is our big thing, the one thing we're better than any other class at. But even if mobs routinely mitigate most of our slows, there's still so many other ways we can contribute.<br />
<br />
I've only recently joined an elemental guild and got flagged, but none of my time there, raiding or grouping, has been boring or one dimensional!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like to do fire with a druids, rangers, or other shaman.  Root, Snare, Dots, and Arrows= fast, safe exp.<br />
<br />
In earth my normal groups are Me, druid, 2 rangers, Rogue and any tank class.  I slow the mob on inc and its pure cake.  Fast exp, not as safe as say fire but with  me slowing no need to have a cleric to group.<br />
<br />
I find the slows that land to be partial to be BS but you adapt.</div></div><hr />
