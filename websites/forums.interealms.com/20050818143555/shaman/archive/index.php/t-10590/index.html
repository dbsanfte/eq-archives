<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm still very upset about this.  Last night I was in a small guild raid in HoH to farm runes and PoP molds (no chain of course).  I found myself as the only healer in a group with 2 melees and 2 casters.  So I dusted off and memmed Kragg's Mending to increase healing efficiency a bit (Tnarg's wasn't keeping up).  During one messy fight, the paladin in the group is dropping to very low health so I hit him with Kragg twice.  Immediately, two mobs forget everything else they're doing and pound me into the dust.<br />
<br />
Here's what made me so mad.  My &quot;CH&quot; spell has all of the negatives of the cleric and druid analogs: slow cast time, high aggro.  BUT, the effect greatly reduced.  The effect is so much reduced that I need to cast the spell twice, using up twice the mana and generating twice the aggro as a cleric or druid.  Did my ability to slow or generate mana compensate for this in any way?  Not at all.<br />
<br />
One way to solve this is to simply put this spell in the same place I put all my other useless spells from Velious, Luclin, and PoP: where the sun don't shine.  As it is, I refuse to be considered a healer in any group or raid situation.<br />
<br />
But something in me is really annoyed at the injustice of this situation.  Are priests balanced?  Not by a long shot.  Will SOE fix this?  Who knows, I ain't holding my breath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Were those 2 mobs being actively tanked or kept agro on someone else?  Mobs which have little done to them will always go right after a healer once a big heal lands.  I never get agro on 1 mob with KM, and rarely with 2.  If a cleric had done the same thing, they would have gotten the same agro with mobs just standing around.  You probably would have gottten the same agro if you'd used chloroblast as well (well, after they finished laughing at you).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do this all the time.  The paladin should have no trouble keeping the mobs off you.  Im not sure if you get a lot more agro if the player is low health.  I start healing tanks at 50% health because our heals suck.  but I can keep up and lets the cleric get fm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>hillaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the point is our heal gets the same argo as the druid and cleric spells. It heals half as much or less so we must cast it alot more often and because of this we  get twice the argo. That boys and girls really stinks. I know alot of you think we are overpowered but you are just wrong. We are being left more behind with each expaintion and its starting to piss me off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I believe this is true.  Druids were raising a big stink over the equivalence of the agro from a 7500 landing cleric CH to their 3000 landing TR.  I bet the same applies to the puny 2k shm CH (puny = nature's infusion with IH focus casts in 3 seconds and heals more)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">never noticed it , i lay Q on everyone im healing and hit up with kraggs adn tnargs and never get aggro  /shrug<br />
<br />
we shouldnt be in the position to have to heal that much anyway =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">While I understand why the CH spells draw aggro, it is somewhat annoying. It's one thing for the cleric CH to draw aggro.. After all, what ELSE is the cleric doing to get aggro? Throw in slowing and dotting on top of that (or vice versa).. Well, I guess that's why we have root. :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe that this is wrong.  I'm pretty sure chlorobast doesn't generate the same aggro as CH.<br />
<br />
A cleric would not have had the same aggro in this situation because they would have cast CH once, generating half the aggro.  A druid in the same situation would not have had to cast back to back CH's, and could have spread the aggro out over a longer period of time.<br />
<br />
So why should we have the same negatives for our &quot;CH&quot; when the effect is so much smaller?  I reiterate that there is no &quot;advantage&quot; a shaman has over a druid or cleric in such situations that would &quot;balance&quot; this healing inequity.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Funny thing is when this came up.<br />
<br />
Druids complained about the Nerf on Healing agro for that reason.<br />
This community LAUGHED at them.  Look back at the threads on it.<br />
<br />
Problem is most shamans dont play healer as often as a druid<br />
so the general attitude was &quot;So what&quot;.  Well &quot;So What&quot; is simple... when you do have to play Healer, you get your Ass handed to you.<br />
<br />
1) ICHs heal less than CH requiring more to be cast so should be less agro.<br />
CH (7.5) &gt; KR (4.75 Druid 64) &gt; TR (3) &gt; KM (2)<br />
is not exactly rocket science on healing agro.<br />
<br />
2) Druids &amp; Shamans agro list should also take into account the inherent agro the class generates on &quot;Average.&quot;<br />
What good is a ICH if you can't cast it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason druids were laughed at is because shamans have basically become jaded about anything having to do with priest balancing.<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, most shamans will do what I do and refuse to accept any healing role that cannot be met by Tnarg's Mending. <br />
<br />
Most shamans believe that SOE really doesn't care about balancing shamans with the other priest classes.  Until SOE shows that they really do care about being equitable to all priest classes, not just clerics and druids, this feeling will continue to be expressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tappion Zek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This is silly, I've read over all the threads at DG, and have played a cleric and druid as well. Unless yer tank blows this shouldnt be a big deal, even if you are casting twice as much.<br />
<br />
It's funny a druid in DG went so far as to say he casted once (yes once) and got agro, but (and here's the kicker) after that one cast a SK couldn't agro off him no matter what he did. Hilarious stuff. Anyway even if they lower the agro to 75% or 50% of where it is odds are you will still be grabbing agro more due to slows and such then the heal.<br />
<br />
And yes, if a mob isn't being tanked and you heal, it will come to attack you. (Thought we'd get this one out of the way)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>corlathist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Tapion, <br />
<br />
No one on DG/here expected ICHs to be near agroless as they were pre-nerf.<br />
<br />
However,  as a big &quot;surprise&quot; the agro increase missed the magic &quot;balance&quot; line.<br />
<br />
Should druids/shamans have to give up some of thier other high agro spells to play main healer.  Sure thats reasonable, but question is how much.  Currently they have to give up too much.<br />
<br />
In order to play healer with anything close to efficiency<br />
a shaman/druid needs to be able to debuff the mob, to compensate for crappier heals.  This doesnt work right now.<br />
The debuffs + heals are too much agro for an xp group.<br />
<br />
Theres also the side about switching based on amount healed.  Sure KM might still be 25% to 50% the agro of CH.   sure it will agro an unengaged mob.  But it wont agro the mob/add being hit by say ranger, monks, 10th Assist, who's generating some small amount of agro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't want to make this another druid vs shaman thread, but druids and shamans are NOT balanced with respect to ICH aggro.  <br />
<br />
Supposedly shaman ICH is &quot;balanced&quot; against the reduced damage output due to slow.  Druid spells that would generate equivalent aggro (e.g., nukes) presumably were not used to balance the effect of the ICH like slow was.<br />
<br />
So, to get the same net &quot;effect&quot; of the ICH in terms of damage mitigation, a shaman MUST cast slow + ICH, and often Malo as well to get the slow to stick.  Druids only cast the ICH itself.  So the shaman uses much more mana, while generating much more aggro.  Resists, which are frequent, unbalance the aggro even more.<br />
<br />
ICH aggro may be an issue for druids, but it is much more unbalanced for shamans.  Shamans just don't complain about it as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's a load of crap, go reread the threads on DG.<br />
<br />
Edit: Wanted to add...<br />
<br />
If you aren't grabbing agro from yer tank with a slow, you should under no circumstances be getting it from your heals.<br />
<br />
This isn't an issue with paladins and SKs. Once again it goes back to warriors having taunt issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Isazo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I pulled a giant off of an SK in BoT by casting two ICH's back to back after Malo/slow.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a real big deal, but Gardletron has a point.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
  No, actually it's because of about a half dozen complete *******s who contribute nothing but flame and retardation and should be banned.  The Crucible used to be a good forum.  Now a few ****heads have pretty much ruined it for the majority.<br />
 <br />
No one on DG/here expected ICHs to be near agroless as they were pre-nerf.<br />
 <br />
2k healing in 10 seconds costing 400 mana and coming 19 levels after clerics get their 7.5k, 10 second 400 mana spell.  Again, why does this spell even exist?  The only good thing this spell had going for it was low agro.  The same is true of the druid versions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Heal aggro is not a big deal .. if you don't know how to manage your aggro by level 58 you shouldn't be playing a shaman in the first place.  Seriously, with the right tank this is a non-issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It's a BIG aggro for just 2k heal. when i duo with a ranger i often get aggro when i use kragg.<br />
<br />
           Everything in this heal is pathetic : hp/mana ,total HP healed,  casting time and aggro</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Serious , i NEVER have heal aggro problems ...  i cant think back and remember 1 time that something peeled off and attacked me from kraggs , from tnargs yes , kragg no. If your using tnarg that much then something is simply wrong heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">bah litgruv, or you raid everytime or you NEVER use kragg ,but it's ridiculous to said that kragg  don't have a big aggro.<br />
<br />
not that aggro is really a problem,but it's a noticiable aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've noticed the agro from Kragg's mending, but I don't think it's too much. After Malo, slow, cripple, heal, you should expect some agro. But when I have got it, even a warrior has been able to taunt back off me in a few seconds.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but I think this is a non issue.</div></div><hr />
