<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>zephreus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone spent some time in HS since they implemented the 7th and 8th cudgels?  Where do the dusty skull &amp; glowing skulls drop in HS for the 7th.. only in certain wings, or could I get them just from fighting at the zone-in?<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't remember seeing them drop in the basement or at the zone in, but I have encountered them in both the East and West wings personally.  I think I saw them drop in North wing and as we were working our way to the South wing and encountering them on the way I would suspect to find them there as well.<br />
<br />
I expect any place other than basement and zone in should work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">last time i was in HS the glowing skulls seemed to dropping like candy in the south wing...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Picked up 1 glowing skull in West wing in about 2 hours - picked up 6 glowing and 1 dusty skull in South wing in about 1 hour last Saturday.</div></div><hr />
