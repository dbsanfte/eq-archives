Greetings Norrathians,<br />
<br />
I would like to add this quick clarification to the update message, clarifying the charm effect change.<br />
If the NPC was in the middle of casting a spell when charm is broken, it will interrupt the spell. After all, the creature is no longer interested in following the orders of a former master. <br />
<br />

Thank goodness- the pit in tactics was becoming a mess during peak hours on Karana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">um....  just a thought....  What if the enemy was casting on my pet and charm breaks.  They will still nuke my former pet ticking them off, and starting a war.  Of course the nuke has to exceed the hate of the charm, but you just have the chanter gate out and have someone else keep the pile going till the chanters get back (so they can jump in and share in the exploit).   I could be way off here, but it seems like the eploit just takes one more step to get rolling, then it's the same dang exploit.</div></div><hr />

Its working as of tonight, black prophecy/hate exploiting it since patch server came up 24/7.</div></div><hr />

Cerezo still in the pits eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It still works.  It has gone on for so long and been abused by so many people that I'm considering just joining in on the fun.  There comes a time when I'm no longer willing to play by the rules just because it's the right thing to do.  They have made zero attempt at policing this and obviously very little effort towards fixing the bug itself.  It's like setting the speed limit on the highway to 30 and firing all the traffic cops.  What do you expect people to do? =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">it's not the fact that there are exploits out there. heck, There's a pop machine at work that will give you $1.00 in change for a 55 cent can of pop. it's the fact that people are SO Amoral that rather than doing a /bug. they would rather get as Much XP as possible off of it before the bug is closed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I know Necros that were using this and getting an AA every 5 Minutes or so.  I know one in paticular that did this every day for weeks and he now has over 350 AA's</div></div><hr />

<br />
so you trick a npc into casting on a friend of his and they get in a fight and you turn their fight into a full out gang war. It would be fun to see how big you could get the war heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well actually the reason it works is cause the mobs aren't friends they are on opposing factions nad once they start fighting any more mobs you pull into the area will join the fray and as long as you damage each mob you get exp for some reason. I have heard that you can even loot all the corpses and that you can make a pile of cast and get al lthe SP's you could ever want by keeping the dogpile going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Wtb tactics flag on torv lol. SOunds like a nice way to get some levels and aa's asap to me. I personally don't see alot wrong with people using the game the way the designers created it, they made it wrong or not the way they wanted then its thier job to fix it, not our job to not take advantage of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's how I see it:<br />
<br />
If I discovered something like this, I'd /bug it and petition to make sure a GM was aware of it.  I can understand that there are a few unintentional flaws in the game that are really hard to find.  Hell, this didn't get discovered for a year (AFAIK).  I don't fault SOE for having a few bugs in their game, and I won't abuse those bugs.<br />
<br />
However, at this point, it is no longer a bug.  It is part of the game.  They know about it, and although they have had ample time to do so, they have not fixed it.  They are only making a minimal effort to police it.  I see no reason why their own neglect and incompetence should not be abused.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We were killing in Potactics when a necro did this, he killed ALL of the mobs in there leaving nothing for us.<br />
...thats a lot of mobs....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,<br />
<br />
Necro on my server has been warned twice that I'm aware of by GM's, and still to my knowledge uses this exploit as his main AA exp &amp; cash camp.<br />
<br />
It wasn't fixed in the patch, and there simply aren't enough GM's to police the zone.  :( <br />
<br />
An AA every 5 minutes.  /sigh.  Compared to how hard I have worked to get over 300, and any idiot Necro (using an exploit found on a public board) can possibly get a dozen an hour...<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">/agree Koridar<br />
<br />
Some of the reasoning in favor of using this or any exploit is really stupid. If your neighbor accidentally left his door open, I imagine you'd take that as a justification to go in and steal anything you wanted, right? Maybe you folks that think it's perfectly fine to do it should read the EULA once, instead of just clicking 'I accept'. Stuff like this gets out of hand and destroys the game - Diablo, platinum dupes, et al. I guess you'd rather we just cut to the chase and **** up EQ so bad we can just go play EQ2 now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">A few people got suspended for a week today on solro,<br />
<br />
<br />
Geeze... a week?<br />
<br />
You get 10+ AA an hour and only penalized a week.  Sounds like a good deal to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">No crap. Cheaters like this should be permenantly banned. And they really need to fix this properly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fenril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Permanent ban or, better, character deleting IS the good way to stop this.<br />
<br />
I don't like grinding exp but I really prefer this than playing a Diablo clone full of cheaters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You know the worst part of this whole thing is when you are grinding out AA's the &quot;right&quot; way and people you know are, at that very moment, getting those same AA's at ten times the rate with more loot and less effort. Makes you feel kind of stupid. When this goes on for days, and then weeks, all the while you are still grinding AA's the &quot;right&quot; way and people you know (lots of people) are still getting those 5 minute AA's at the very same time-it changes your perspective on the game. I've not done it, but you know what?, if someone invited me to take part I might not turn them down.<br />
<br />
Oh and I'm speaking from my own perspective here. The worst part for everyone concerned would be that the zone can not be used for anything else when this is going on. People trying to XP where repeatedly trained over and killed. At the height of this, I had to turn down several groups inviting me into Tactics because it just wasn't safe. And yes, the people who would have been training me where people I know. Something about all that easy XP causes people to care much less for the needs the people around them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Not sure how this is going on, I tried it with my necro when it was first announced and like a half hour later got a warning and so did anyone else who tried it.   <br />
<br />
An AA every 5 mins is a little exaggerated, it can take awhile to find a mob to charm as a necro and it's not easy to keep the fights going.  <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't want to get suspended so I haven't gone back since.  Even though I got a warning it was worth it to see that huge pile of mobs fighting each other!</div></div><hr />
