<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey guys<br />
<br />
I wish there was an equipment forum to post this question in; as it is, I'll need to bug the shammies here with it. I hope you don't mind.<br />
<br />
Totemic Helm: 12ac, +5wis, 3.5wt<br />
Crown of the Froglok Kings: 12ac, +20svc/svf, 0.5wt<br />
<br />
My young shammie is wearing the totemic helm atm, but I just noticed that the froggy crown, rotting away in my cleric's resist bag, has the same ac. Cleric's been retired for some 6 months now, so it's not like he'd miss it.<br />
<br />
Do you think that +20svc/svf outweighs the +5wis? I really like the no helm look of the crown, though the helm isn't too bad. Is it a good idea to replace the totemic helm for a mid-20s shaman?<br />
<br />
Also... if I do replace it, what do totemic helms sell for now?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for the help ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anomalos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In my opinion, 5 wis isn't all that much.  If you want, resists are a good thing to have, so feel free to swap.  However, I would personally keep totemic, and bag the froggy crown as resist gear.  Normal exp'n doesn't yield the need for resists, though mana is always important =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hail,<br />
<br />
You have them both already, save the Froggy crown for resist gear. :D<br />
<br />
You can sell the Totemic for a few hundred platinum and maybe buy a JB helm instead for 6 more raw ac for almost the same price, or just a little more.  Or keep it for the wisdom if you do any tradeskills and buy a JB helm for 300-400pp.<br />
<br />
In the 20's, Totemic helm is still a nice item.  You aren't in need of an upgrade really imo.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found myself lately wearing my froggy crown all the time.  I lose 6 raw AC over the JB helm, but gain +20 fire and +20 cold - it's a nice tradeoff since I'm not near a 100 AC marker.  The recent caster mob changes (and the getting my ass handed to me that accompanied them) made me rethink the importance of resists.  :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and the froggy crown puts out a ton of light.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Deian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thanks for the replies. Froggy over Totemic is more of a cosmetic thing than any other (bare head rocks!), and the JB helm might be a good idea as well.<br />
<br />
The community here is very helpful... as always. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Totemic is too rare, as that bear's too lazy to show up for work.  JB helms drop all the time and the shammy's don't need them, as they ususally have better at that level.  Therefore, it gets sold for cheap in bazaar.  That froggy crown will do yoeman's work once you get to HoT and the AoE dragons, so keep it somewhere, don't sell it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Interesting fact about JB helm - merchants will pay 330 pp for them, so if you see any cheaper in the bazaar, make a quick profit! :)</div></div><hr />
