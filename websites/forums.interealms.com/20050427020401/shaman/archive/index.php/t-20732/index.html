<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i solo'd a kriger in BoT, the west wig one where the bee spwans.<br />
also solo'd the bee. get Virtue and BSS. i didn't have kei for this but it would help too, i did have SD and a mod rod (don't ask lol)<br />
<br />
what i did was, waited for the roamer to path out, rushed the mob in the left hand corner, malo/slow root, back oof dot him, Q myself, summon horse, Q tank him till hes dead. med up, summon my pet, buff him, haste him, roamer comes back, kill him same as the left hand side pop, then i kill the ride side pop same strat.<br />
<br />
<br />
now.. for the kriger, i mem malicious decay, i pop him with it, VP him in the left hand corner by the bed.<br />
malos, malosinia, slow.<br />
then ... i mem all my dot's from 65-44. Q myself, refresh VP send in pet tas pet is going in start casting ultor,pox,scrouge yada yada BoS,BoN,Ebolt summons me, i tank, (have horse up,  attack off, because it will not regen your mana if you attack) refresh Q, hit tnargs as needed<br />
usually when i hit 30% pop can 5 when your at 70% + hps<br />
<br />
when you hit 29% of your total hitpoints you might notice something very amazing, this has helped me solo the kriger more than you can imagine, your pet will do the warrior /shield abilty.<br />
my pet usually shields me and soaks up some hits. once the kriger gets too 20% i hit my pet swarm, and load up Spear. finsih him off.<br />
i sit in the left hand corner by the bed and med up.<br />
<br />
i do this to avoid aggro from hreider if he pops. i haven't tried to solo him yet, and i doubt i ever will.<br />
<br />
the bee is almost the same as the kriger, except ... your going to load cripple.<br />
getting it to land on him means you have a greater chance for your pet to hit, and him to miss you and or do less damage.<br />
i use cripple on the krigers but with the proc they have it barely makes any difference.<br />
bee boy starts to heal at 30% mem SoT, and keep 3 dots on him, ulto, BoS,BoN, rotate as needed, he will eventually go OOM and try to melee you again, by now you should be 50-65% mana with about one to one and a half mintes for mass can to pop (make sure you pop it only when safe and only when you fall below 40% mana)<br />
don't worry, you can out last him, just keep him in the left corner.<br />
because if hreidar pops .. you will be visitng your bind in style :D<br />
<br />
grats, you just solo'd ornate chain gloves, and or runes, or Earring of the thunder ! have fun kiddies, its long and risky</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">forgot one thing, Damage shields do at least 20% of the mobs hitpoints in damage.<br />
so my rings + my alchemy DS is a big help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice right up. Seen this guy tear up a group before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i've seen mages solo him, so i thought to myself .... hmmmm, lemme try.<br />
wasn't as hard as i thought.<br />
just hard to get desease dots to land on the kriger in west. poision lands though :D</div></div><hr />
