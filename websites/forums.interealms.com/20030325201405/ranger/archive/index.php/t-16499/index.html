<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Damacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How can someone have Swiftwind and not have earthcaller or any parts of the earthcaller quest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They may not have been clear about it... but to have swiftwind in the &quot;first half&quot; Ranger epics.  <br />
<br />
I would think the person means that they do not have the SeoC since having that and swiftwind gets you Earthcaller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Damacles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SeoC?<br />
<br />
So is what your saying that it is possible to do only the Swiftwind or only the Earthcaller quest? Im confused</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No you can get both weapons at the same time.  What i think he meant was if you have obtained swiftwind you should have the refined mithril blade.  And if you have that all you need is the Shattered Emerald of Corruption.  (Although i said only, tis is the hardest part of the epic to do, unless you have 150k or more to buy a mq)<br />
In the swiftwind quest, when you turn in your swirling sphere of color and the hammer you get both of the semi-epic swords.   You get swiftwindby handing one to 2 rangers in Burning Wood and Earthcaller by handing the SEoC and the other sword to a ranger in EK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bad info there Rashgaal.<br />
<br />
Earthcaller is given by Xannuuss (sp) the named Treant in North Karana. Not some ranger in East Karana.<br />
<br />
Normal progression of the quest gets you Swiftwind first and then instructions on how to complete Earthcaller. <br />
They can be done in either order depending on which stone you get first and if you're willing to redo a little work for Swiftwind if you do Earthcaller first. These days, the Shattered Emerald of Corruption from Hate is a much bigger stumbling block than the Pulsing Green Stone from Venril Sathir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>nohky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Take a look at Crydee's walkthrough. I completed my quest using it, it's very complete.</div></div><hr />
