<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK.... we have a GREAT Slowability Chart by zone and mob, so we shaman know which slow to use or if to bother with slowing at all if Immune.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know of a similar Chart of Cures that would list the zones and mobs, what spell the mob casts, and what cures it (ie:  RGC, RC1 or 2 or 3, DA or Nadox, #casts needed, or uncurable)??<br />
<br />
Or....maybe add just one little tiny column (hehehe) to the slowability chart for Cures if the mob casts come crud??  I don't know who owns the Slowablility Chart content, but it already has zones and mobs listed.<br />
<br />
If anyone knows of a good resource for mob cures, please link it.<br />
<br />
Thanks. ;)</div></div><hr />

Looks like you posted right as I did, nice start :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nice one Griz, but there are a BUTTLOAD more in Time that I just cannot find an answer too. TZ''s and TT's mostly. Clerics and Druids version of the LoY spell seems better than ours in these situaitons, since ours is &quot;your own group only, not targetable outside the group&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: OK 2 isnt exactly a butload. LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">D'oh!<br />
<br />
Okay, collect the data and I'll collate and present it at http://morelight.org/samanna/healing.html - or maybe I'll make curing.html. <br />
<br />
btw, I'm moving all of this to samanna.net, hopefully soon. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've got a spreadsheet (excel) with a list of named mobs, spells they cast, AE radius, recast time, resist check, effects and counters etc. If its of use I can post it up. It only covers 3 of the EPs at present though.<br />
<br />
I figure most people either know or can lookup what spells they need to cure what. The choice is fairly limited - RGC (9x5 curse), Blood of Nadox (group, 9x2pr 9x2dr); Disinfecting Aura (single, 10x2pr, 10x2dr), Radiant Cure (group, depends on level) and Abolish Disease (single, 36dr) covers it for shaman. Adding all permutations including other classes to the list seems a little excessive.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's coz we already have disenfecting aura (single target, works on anyone) - blood of nadox is a big bonus for us as it cures the whole group, but peraonlly I would compare disenfecting aura with the druid/cleric LoY cures and then see blood of nadox as an extra spell we get and they don't. We are, hands down, the best class for curing in the game imo.</div></div><hr />

That would be quite useful!<br />
<br />

<br />
Never underestimate the power of willful ignorance! :)<br />
<br />
Actually, even a simple spreadsheet of the most common maladies and what cures them would be very useful. RC1 is one of the AAs that I am considering getting next, so I would love to know which afflictions it will cure and which ones will require RC2 or RC3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>JaeredMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually Griz's list for Time is pretty much all you need to know.  None of the AE's from TZ, VZ, TT, Innoruuk, and CT can be cured.  <br />
<br />
Radiant cure will have a chance to remove some of them, but this is far from reliable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ggrowler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Some very nice responses, and especially thanks Grizlor for starting us out with your collected list of mobs and cures!  <br />
<br />
Lots of posters are focused on Time, but don't forget the pre-Time mobs that sometimes drop crud on the raid.  Hopefully the Cure Chart would be a resource for all levels of shaman, not just Time Shaman.<br />
<br />
As for looking up the information on the internet... sure you can look a mob up, but I know its great when the next raid target is announced and everyone is running to the zone to just grab my Slowability Chart printout and open it to the zone and know what is needed for slowing.<br />
<br />
Hopefully we might end up with a similar resource for curing someday (and yes, it would be great if Samanna would be kind enough to compile it and add it to her reference desk).<br />
<br />
If you have a spreadsheet or any other information to add, please do so.  I have already printed out Grizlor's infor (thanks again!) so lets use this thread to capture what the Shaman community knows about cures, and maybe Samanna will surprise us!!   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">RC1 is one of the AAs that I am considering getting next, so I would love to know which afflictions it will cure and which ones will require RC2 or RC3.<br />
<br />
Personally I've found that rc 3 doesn't really cure much, pregod, that radiant cure 1 wouldn't cure. Radiant cure 1 cures 9 poison/disease/curse counters and has 1 chance to remove a detrimental spell with out any counters. RC push it up to 16 counters and 6 chances to remove a detrimental spell.<br />
<br />
The biggest thing seems to be that remove curse, counteract disease/poison etc cure 8 counters. So anything that would be curable by them is already covered by RC 1. Remove greater curse on the other hand is 54 counters. Abolish poison/disease etc cure 36 counters. So cure significantly more than rc 3 will cure. So any spell with counters set with these spells in mind is either going to be curable by rc1 or well above rc3.<br />
<br />
GoD did seem to add a number of things that RC3 gets but RC1 doesn't. The increased chances to remove a detirmental spell is more useful on RC3 than the increase in the counters. from 1 chance to 6 is alot better improvement than 9 to 16 counters. Once again the resplendant cure aa ups the counters cured to 25  yet coming up to 15 chances to remove detirmental.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I wanted to know - thanks muchly! :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Looks pretty good so far! Besides, I would say that just having information available is more important than getting the format 100% right the first time around - you can always massage the presentation layer later :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's good, I'm ready for more targets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sayoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Great table! Just have a couple of nitpicky things though.<br />
<br />
You're missing Disinfecting Aura (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=2526&quot;) from the list of cures.<br />
<br />
Blood of Nadox (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3842&quot;) removes 9x Poison, 9x Poison, 9x Disease, 9x Disease. (Currently the table has it removing 8/8/8/8.) This also changes the number of cures required for some of the effects on the chart. <br />
<br />
And maybe include the target type of the effects? For example, from the table, Stone Thunder, Torrent of Agony, and Decay of the Plaguebringer are all single-targetted, while everything else are AEs.<br />
<br />
Edit: Greater Remove Curse is also avaliable as a clicky in Plane of Fire (Blackflame Sphere (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=20507&quot;))<br />
<br />
Just a thought<br />
Sayoz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For your quarm AEs you're saying RC1 + 2x BoN... all you need is 2x BoN for the 3 non curses, or 1x abolish disease for Time Warp/Plagued Earth<br />
<br />
Also you have non time bert's AE wrong. it's &quot;Rot of the Plaguebringer&quot; not &quot;Stench of Decay&quot; (which is one of Grummus's AEs)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Thanks, all those corrections/additions done.<br />
<br />
Anyone have the counter count on Resplendent Cure yet?<br />
<br />
Any other targets? I haven't raided anything on the list except Arch Lich and up to Tier 2 PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In PoEb, there are the 3 War Cheiftans (War Chieftan Awisano, Briak, &amp; Galronar). They cast Deathfog IV http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=1081 which is a short poison dot. I'm pretty sure 1 cast of DA will remove it, could use confirmation on that one. I also wanted to bring up the War Cheiftians because they also cast Gravel Rain (the same one Warlord casts). Allkhazam doesn't say that they do, but they do. Gravel Rain has 72 curse counters to it, takes 2 RGC's. <br />
<br />
In PoAir, for the Xegony event, it may be good to add that some of the waves (I don't remember which ones, sorry - I do remember that the Air Elemental mobs casted it, but not sure if they were the only ones) cast Diseased Cloud http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=836 which has 9 disease counters to it. 1 DA, or 1 BoN/RC should remedy it. <br />
<br />
Sam, the chart looks fab-o-lous! Thanks for working on it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Disinfecting Aura is 10 counters each :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks, fixed DA. I must be an idiot or something.<br />
<br />
Added the War Chieftans. I didn't list Deathfog IV because it doesn't seem curable, it's listed as a PBAE, but no counters to remove. Perhaps RC's &quot;remove detrimental&quot; works on it... anyone confirm or deny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">For all the quarm ae's RC1 + Blood of nadox wont cure them.<br />
<br />
9 counters + 18 counters = 27 counters cured need 36. It's just 2 costs of BoN for group cures really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Might wanna add resplendant cures too for aa's<br />
first level is 19/19/19/9<br />
Second is 22/22/22/12<br />
Third is 25/25/25/15<br />
<br />

Not live yet but should be soon enough</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Griz's list is pretty complete. Almost everything he didn't list is uncureable, pointless to try and cure (too many casts required), or can only be taken off with dispell.<br />
<br />
there are a BUTTLOAD more in Time that I just cannot find an answer too. TZ''s and TT's mostly<br />
<br />
For those two, it's more about resisting them than curing them.  Both of those require MR, and for TT is also helpful to have PR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Here's the excel spreadsheet I've been using for myself... its far from complete but if you can get any use out of it Samanna I'd be delighted.<br />
<br />
http://eqscarab.com/MobSpells.xls<br />
<br />
I made it from a slightly different perspective, as I wanted to also know what resist buffs I needed for which mobs, so I needed to know the resist checks. I also wanted to know the effects to a) know what was worth trying to resist and b) what was worth curing and on who. Lastly, it lists AE range so you know if you can stay out of range or not.<br />
<br />
Still, I think its relevant and hope its of use. I will add the PoFire mobs when I'm home (at work atm and don't have latest version here), and will also add links to those that are missing. I'll try to have a new upload in place by the weekend at least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wow, cool. If you're going to keep it hosted there, it's probably easier to just link to it for that info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Yep, will keep it there and update it as and when I have time.</div></div><hr />

to the effects for Undead Renux in steamfont Rogue Epic 1.5 ..<br />
It is a 30 sec AE dot which turns to a Deathtouch http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5755&amp;source=Live <br />
if Not cured by then .. best way to cure it would be 3 casts of Blood of Nadox .. <br />
oh yeah .. she seems to cast it about every 35-45 sec too .. <br />
thanks for the very nice table you have drawn up</div></div><hr />
