<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>skott340</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Link is incomplete, but I heard years ago about a few guilds being banned for exploiting a bug. It enabled them to do dmg to the sleeper with out it going aggro on them. I heard they got that thing down to 25% and a few GMs came along and did their thing. I am a little hazy on the details. If its a screen shot of it dead i would like to see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did they lose in the end? I couldnt tell from that, sorta looked like they got adds....but that doesnt make any sence either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They certainly gave it a good try.  Nice choice of music too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">They wiped.  The warders respawned after an hour and killed them all.  I thought the warders had a longer repawn time of an hour.  If so then someone poped them on them to stop them from killing him.<br />
<br />
I guess we will never find out how much copper that fool had on him :b</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes they wiped at 12%. Now supposedly the dragons that added on the end were the warders being summoned by Kerafyrm, which was also the reason why they lost the encounter. I have no idea what the guild is that made the attempt however.<br />
<br />
But even if it spawns all 4 warders again, all but 1 are magic slowable, and could be offtanked easily. This video doesn't show Kerafyrm's death but it DOES show that it is possible, with enough people to offtank the 4 respawned warders, enough tanks to keep up with the deathtouch cycle, and a few clerics doing battlerezzes, Kerafyrm could be slain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Someone said they did this on the recent patch day where mobs had negative regen.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I read on another forum about the actual time elapsed.  It was something to the amount of an hour and a half to get him down as far as they did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't see anything that looked like an exploit to me, I could be wrong just watching the video, but it looks like just sheer determination to me ... now THAT'S a fight.<br />
<br />
I was thoroughly impressed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;the NPC regen rates were messed up -- hence reports of people killing Mith Marr with like 12 people, etc..<br />
<br />
Kerafyrm normally regens so fast you can't visibly hurt him, but since the regen was broken it allowed them to get him down..<br />
<br />
Kerafyrm is NOT killable, will never be.&quot;<br />
<br />
Taken from my guild board but I would say exactly the same.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW Ceno, love the target indicators!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yeah but it was with an exploit, kerafrym couldn't touch him, of course they could kill him.<br />

It's basically just a a targettable item with lots of HP and regen.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that's pretty much it.  Still interesting, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">that is &quot;fake&quot; sleeper, it is unawaked sleeper -- you awake it after killed all 4 warder, it shouldn't targetable untill 4 wader die, they must use some exploit to make it targetable<br />
<br />
anyway, the real sleeper,the one after 4 warder death will hit for 7k damage, and Death Touch for 32k, that is real invincible sleeper, <br />
<br />
the one they try kill have abvious joke melee damage output(a NtoV guild tank it for nearly 1 hour !!), I hope it isn't same as the real sleeper. I remember in a fan fair during Velious time, a GM try kill sleeper with 10k instant clicky death touch ring and still can't make it below 90%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just because you werent able to kill Kerafyrm when you had the chance does that mean that it wont have been changed by now?<br />
<br />
We all know how &quot;brilliant&quot; a design the original sleeper was - maybe even SoE realized they could change it for something better?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not when the sleeper is awake on 90% of the servers if not more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The NCsoft servers are rather special as far as I understand. Velious being the highest expansion is apparently one of the specialities. I dont see why NCsoft or SoE wouldnt change the script on those servers so players there have something to work towards when they dont have VT or PoP to keep them bogged down :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">/sigh this always happens.<br />
<br />
&quot;The sleeper hits for 7k&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;The sleeper regens 1 million hp per tick&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;the sleeper isn't targettable&quot;<br />
<br />
Did I ask for speculation? No. None of you faught the sleeper. Ever. And you probably never will. Look on Alla, there are so many posts, all theoretical crap, about how hard he hits or how invincible he is - nobody knows. <br />
<br />
&quot;well duh it was during that goof up where every mob was soloable because it had negative regen!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh yeah I remember that patch, it was just the other... wait a minute, it never existed, I almost forgot. /rolleyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Nobody here knows the facts, nobody here knows anything, this video is an expose of what it really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Berik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually what happened, if you can read the cantonse sp.<br />
<br />
What happenend was they killed the 4 warders, pulled sleeper.  Got him down to 15 percent, at this time for some reason (Go go SoE imo) all 4 warders respawned and attacked them thus wiping them.<br />
<br />
Translation<br />
<br />
The text that appears superimposed over the video right as the waders spawn says : <br />
Stories always have unexpected endings... <br />
<br />
The white text on the black background that is faded in as the video fades out says : <br />
At this time the 4 guards suddenly respawned. After this, everything was back to the way it started. The sleeper is forever a mystery.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Rukulik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree 100% with Penny. Well said.<br />
<br />
Just because YOU couldn't get close to killing him doesn't mean you crap on the guild that got him down to 12%.<br />
<br />
Speculation? Nah. Ego is more like it.<br />
<br />
They achieved what you couldn't and now you have to come up with bogus excuses for how it can't be done, they used an exploit, or what-have-you.<br />
<br />
In any case, I don't wanna start a flamewar. Whether they succeeded or not, they went in with a plan. They knew what to expect and it looks like they even got a DT rotation going. Big cong to them. ;)<br />
<br />
That really was an awesome video, though. Many thanks to Penny for posting it. :)<br />
<br />
<br />
They may have lost. But damn. They put up one HELL of a fight. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Didn't Fires of Heaven take him out (with an exploit)?<br />
Shouldn't that encounter detail how hard he hits<br />
for and how many hit points he has?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">no, no one did<br />
<br />
he is unkillable always will be .. you kill him you screw the story line for eq2, eq3 etc ..<br />
<br />
penny your a moron, dont ever forget that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">So The Sleeper hits for 7k now, huh?<br />
<br />
Back when we awakened The Sleeper he was hitting for 1900ish(1920 or something) max and he would DT every 45 seconds. <br />
Of course back then no one really tried to fight him as we didn't really know what would happen and everyone was running around like a headless chicken, but from the reports of other guilds killing him in the years to come, it seemed pretty much impossible to kill him.<br />
<br />
If The Sleeper now really hits for 7k it probably was changed to adjust to the power of the current players. He definitely wasn't hitting for that much mid-Velious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">When sleeper was woke up on Quell, I was one of the stupid ones to run straight to Skyshrine, to see him.... He showed up at the zone about 60 seconds from zoning in, and killed all there  :D   He hit me personally, for about 2100? 2085? just a hair over 2k.  So, that's what his melee was like, back in.. uhh... November 2001? if my times are right.   My fiancee has a screenshot of it killing me, will have to dig it out.<br />
<br />
And Penny... I know for a FACT for one night, after last patch, that boss mobs were killing themselves, at least in Elemental Planes.  I dont know if it was negative regen, dots, or what, but we did the earth rings, and were on the way to Mystical Arbit, when a rogue SOS'ed down, to find he too was killing himself (all the ring bosses were).. so we trained ourselves, to get down to kill him before he did it himself.   We engaged at 20 percent, with over half the raid dead from the train we created.<br />
<br />
NOW, im not saying that the same problem exsisted with the Sleeper, but just pointing out that YES, for one night, raid mobs were *killing* themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Ah ceno thank you for your opinion about me. I would love to take a time machine back to Velious expansion to ask Sony if they would ever let warriors reach 11khp, clerics have mana over 8k and wizards nuke just under 7k. They would have said never. Just like they said Rogues would never get a backstabber that had greater than 15 damage, and that rangers would never be able to use archery as viable damage.<br />
<br />
My point? Yes, the sleeper was designed to be invincible. I agree, he most likely has no loot table. But PC power has increased exponentially since the sleeper was created. Kerafyrm has gained nothing.<br />
<br />
Come back when you've faught the sleeper, Ceno, please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I heard years ago about a few guilds being banned for exploiting a bug. It enabled them to do dmg to the sleeper with out it going aggro on them. I heard they got that thing down to 25% and a few GMs came along and did their thing. I am a little hazy on the details.<br />
You are probably thinking of Conquest on Lanys T'Vyl, long ago, and it was not the sleeper or Kerafyrm they were fighting, it was Ventani.<br />
<br />
They placed their clerics in a &quot;good spot&quot; ;) and used the lvl 55 mage spell &quot;Call of the Hero&quot; to negate CH aggro (because the MT couldn't build a sufficient amount of aggro over them). Ventani couldn't path to them, could still summon them though, but the use of CotH sort of negated that.<br />
<br />
When the watching GMs saw what happened, someone blew a fuse and /kill'ed Ventani, thus popping the Kerafyrm script.<br />
A huge portion of the guild got banned. There was a lot of talking on their boards, it might even still be there from years ago.<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, Conquest returned when PoP was launched, and have beaten Quarm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">im just curious to why people have this fascination with the sleeper .....<br />
<br />
is it bragging rights ????  ... his phat lewtz he drops ?   <br />
<br />
the mob is scripted he was never intended to be killed hence his insane regen and cazic touch every 45 sec 2k hitters are ***** now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">A hair over 2k...that could be too. It was right around 2k anyways and i might have had a rune on me so didn't get hit for full. <br />
Anyways, Penny, you do know some people used to run and still run 3rd party programs to obtain stats of a mob, correct?<br />
<br />
Now do some math with the DPS of a Time enabled guild and do the math how long it would take to kill a mob with 2 billion HPs approximately. Let's say a full raid had a DPS of 7k?<br />
<br />
Is The Sleeper killable, Penny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Have to agree with Gangaskan, he is unkillable. End of story.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I seem to remember a guild on one of the newer servers engaging post-luclin. After soimething like an hour they'd gotten him to 96% and gave up.<br />

My money is on the negative regen... either that or they really were engaged long enough for the Warders to repop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Hmm, to be engaged long enough to get warders to repop would be to engage him for a week, I dont think anyone actually could do that :p<br />
Atleast I vaguely remember Warders respawn was a week back then but I can be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">yea its a week</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sancha Delnocha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Jendain is correct it was Conquest on Lanys. Their guild was disbanded and some people were banned I believe, and yes they had used some &quot;exploit&quot; with their clerics staying under a bridge.  <br />
  I personally thought it was just good tactics not exploits but...... Supposedly the Sleeper script was incomplete so SOE was pissed off that they had gone in and woken him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well this patch has to be Amusing when the Spawn KILL THEMSELVES...gotta love that one. <br />
<br />
SoE screwed something up on mob regen and currently if you do ONE damage to certain spawns (mith marr for one The Rathe, several others) he will....kill himself by negatively regenning hp... <br />
<br />
I expect there to be a patch tonite to fix this... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
most mobs weren't effected but a few of the bigger named mobs where.</div></div><hr />
