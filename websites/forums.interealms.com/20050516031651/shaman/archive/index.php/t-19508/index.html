Live Gates of Discord chat with the EQ devs!<br />
<br />
Tune in tomorrow, on Tuesday, February 3 at 6:00 PM PST to join a live chat with EQ devs on the soon-to-be-released expansion, Gates of Discord. A login link will be posted tomorrow. You won't want to miss it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">unfortunately too late for me , but i hope some shaman get to put a question to them.<br />
<br />
for me? i finally cancelled my pre-order, and for those not happy as i am with the new expansion , i would suggest you do to, or dont order at all:)<br />
<br />
i might just wait till it becomes cheap in the shops , which should be about 2 weeks after it comes out:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hope they give better answers than these from an interview on Casters Realm:<br />
<br />
&quot;Do the abilities stack? Does having group health regen and raid health <br />
regen abilities add to create a even stronger regen for your group?<br />
<br />
Yes<br />
<br />
If I have the raid level ability find path to pc would there be any reason <br />
to get the group version?<br />
<br />
Your raid leadership abilities do not work in groups. They are independent of each other.&quot;<br />
<br />
So raid-regen works in groups but raid-pathfinding does not? Or what?<br />
<br />
Sounds to me like they are trying to make a system that is far too complex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think it just means that you have to be in a raid for raid abilities to work.  They won't work if you are just doing an exp group, you'll need to make a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Someone please ask them what Shaman spells and<br />
AA's they think are going to make this expantion<br />
worth purchasing for a level 65 Shaman. <br />
<br />
I don't care about the content, not even close to<br />
being flagged for Time yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Someone please ask them what Shaman spells and<br />

<br />

being flagged for Time yet.<br />
<br />
Because gear drops are superior to that from older expansions (I know of at least one single group progressive ring type event where this is defininitely the case)? Because if it does have xp on a par with elementals you are not going to find too many groups outside of the new zones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've been to 3 of these chats now for various Sony games or exansions, and it's always the same crap<br />
<br />
It's a marketing buzz, nothing more.  If you're lucky, in the 30 minutes, or 1 hour, you'll get 1 meaty question answered.<br />
<br />
The rest are all questions of little importance to the actual content, just answering questions like &quot;Do we have to pay extra per month for GoD?&quot;, &quot;How many CDs will GoD take if we buy in the store&quot;, etc...<br />
<br />
The questions are all moderated, and if you were to say , for example, &quot;Are shamans getting a group Qui spell?&quot; ... I doubt very much the question would even get put into play, let alone actually answered with a definative yes or no.<br />
<br />
I would love to be proven wrong, and read a transcript full of information about GoD in general, plus class specifics... but I'm not going to go and waste my time on anymore of these.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, Dev chats are always worthless. You will have a dozen nerds screeching &quot;Nee!&quot; and asking Drizzt related questions. The paladins and sk's will complain about not being able to get gruops with the warrior incite line, and ask about their compensation. Odds are they will have some kind of lame celeb guest, be it Monte Cook or Jenna Jameson to distract people from the lack of real answers. They'll answer stuff any moron with an 80 IQ can find from going to their website. My prediction: we will learn berzerkers will craft and throw axes that do effects, as well as hear that there will be new vague, undescribed AA's for every class!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lol, they just mentioned a &quot;special guest&quot;. How sad. Well if anyone is still interested in checking it out here is the link they posted for it today:<br />
<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/chat.jsp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Because gear drops are superior to that from older expansions (I know of at least one single group progressive ring type event where this is defininitely the case)?

<br />
Still not flagged for Time. Is the gear gonna be better then time with<br />
out time spent flagging? I'll find plenty of groups to do elemental <br />
planes with, in my own guild. <br />
<br />
I repeat: What Shaman spells and AA's are going to make this <br />
expantion worth purchasing for a level 65 Shaman? I haven't seen<br />
even one worthwhile Shaman spell or AA yet. <br />
<br />
That's the bottem line for me, your mileage may vary.</div></div><hr />
