<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ivierre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently started to play a shaman and he is now lvl 28. Because of my play time, I am mostly limited to soloing... like 70-80% of the time. I heard a friend told me that shaman will be getting better and better at soloing after they reach 34 and get the first pet. <br />
<br />
Is that true that i am under the impression that shaman can solo bigger mob but necro can solo with more efficiency and drop mob fasters? (I heard that shaman soloing is slow)<br />
<br />
I have a fungi tunic on my shaman currently and I can get him a fungi staff if he reaches 35. I am just wondering how much the staff and the tunic will help if the the effects will stack. Will they help out with the efficiency soloing as a shaman? <br />
<br />
I am trying to play a class which I can solo most of the time...If shaman is not the right choice, maybe i should start a necro?<br />
<br />
thanks...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The time to solo mobs will go up the higher you get...  It takes me few minutes to solo a mob at my level...<br />
<br />
The fungi will help you a s***load especially after you get your canni line (hp to mana spells)...  dog dog will be there to help you also...  Not much of a pet, everything except the druids bear is better, think of puppy as a dot that you heal...<br />
<br />
In your lower levels tank the mobs with puppy chewing on their rear...   Later on in levels you might get a horse and root rot...<br />
<br />
As for stacking fungi tunic with the staff, that I have no idea on...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if you solo most of the time, head to the golra island in timorous deep.  you can stay there till 36 or so i think<br />
<br />
after that, just kill yeti's in dreadlands till mid 40's</div></div><hr />
