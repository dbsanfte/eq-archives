<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Why are there not any Good Classes that can Summon Corpses ?<br />
<br />
I think giving us that Ability would fit our style. Necros can Rez afterall so what wrong with us (or Paladins come to that) being able to summon ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hendler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Gnome/Erudite/Human Necros can summons corpses, and SKs can summon corpses as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">He said good classes. Icebain, like me, is on FV. Under the old rule set you got a group xp penality if you had evils and goods grouped together so guilds pretty much were either good or evil. This really hampered the good guilds. The rule set has changed so not a big deal except for role players anymore. But they have also talked about this on the zek server that is alligned by good/evil/neutrel. The idea was to give it to mages.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Losing corpse summon is about the only thing the good side does lose. It's a pain (far less so with PoP of course), but it is only 1 thing.<br />
<br />
Evil loses bards, rangers, paladins, druids...that's a pretty large collection of class abilities to be without.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">On Sullon Zek we get an &quot;greater insignia of &lt;insert evil deity here&gt;&quot; when we kill someone on the evil team if they are level 51 or higher and you yourself are plus or minus 5 levels from them.   There's an NPC in each beginner city that you can turn one of these into to get a summon corpse potion with 5 charges on it.    At the lower levels you get minor and regular insignias that you can upgrade t one level higher by giving 10 of them to the NPC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As I recall, the evil's dont get any trackers.. so it sorta balances out maybe?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Evils on SZ can have bards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, bards can worship just about any diety.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are there no Evil races that can track?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Why are there no Evil races that can track?<br />
<br />
I think its far past time that the gnomes came up with a &quot;Anizok's Tracking Device.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">:-\ on team pvp its not balanced for darks.. like said above no bards rangers druids bards... while all light teams have someone that can atleast summon being a good race but evil class. <br />
<br />
^^ if u dont think this is fair plz help petition for VZ and TZ to get hardcoded</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">there are evil bards on sullon zek...last time i checked, evil bards had the same skills as good aligned bards, so hence, team evil has trackers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">if you want to make a bigger complaint, it should be from goods and neuts not having necros to mana dump clerics on raids.</div></div><hr />
