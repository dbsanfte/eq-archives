After I get that, I plan to spend almost everything else in elemental combat because, well, I like doing some damage too.</div></div><hr />

I have a mostly healing specced shaman. a few points in elemental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Detton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Solely Enhancement at the moment.<br />
<br />
Enhancement, at low levels, offers more bang for the buck, so to speak.  <br />
<br />
Restoration and Elemental have some good things in them, but they are generally deeper down.  Improved Ghost Wolf is a godsend.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of template ideas.  I think mainly i'm going to go primarily enhancement, some in elemental.<br />
<br />
I was also thinking of a elemental-restoration build and go high intelligence, for more of a pure caster shaman, who can wear mail armor. :)  It's possible to get TWO talants that improves critical hit chances on nature spells.  You can get +6% from Elemental, Call of Thunder, and another 5% in Restoration, can't remember the talant name.  High int adds to critical chance, as well, so you would be a vERY solid nuker and healer.  <br />
<br />
Mid-way into Enhancement and rest into Restoration is a popular one, too, for a more hybrid fighter-healer type.  You can get the majority of the good heal spell helping abilities fairly easily in restoration, and be able to whoop butt with a two-handed axe or mace at the same time with Flurry. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My advice would be to place your first 5 points into Improved Healing Wave. This will take .5 off of the cast time of your Healing Wave spell. At first all you get is healing wave and each new LV of it adds .5 to cast time. At about lv22 your get Lesser Healing Wave which is your blast heal. You will then have LHW 1.5 cast and HW 3.0 (2.5).<br />
<br />
For PvE I have found that a hibred build of Restore/Enhancment works well for me. What I have head for the PvP is to go more into the Elemental and to get Natures Swift.<br />
<br />
Natures Swift is a really usefull one to have. It allows you to once every 3 minits turn a spell into an insta cast. It can be a real butt saver when used with a heal. Or you can use it with a Lighting Bolt combo to turn out some quick damage. How I use it is lets say I am about to kill a caster mob. My cast order would be Lighting bolt, Earth Shock, Natures Swift, Lighting Bolt, Mele. What would happen is that the first lighting bolt hits the mob would start to cast. Then Earth shock hits and interupts and stuns the casting so the mob will come after me. Right befor it gets to me the second lighting bolt will hit. At this point  most caster mobs will be down to half HP's or lower. Very usefull when you have a pair or more of mobs together and need to drop one quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok, I need a newbie lesson here.<br />
<br />
Are you guys talking about &quot;builds&quot; in order to prioritize what talents you get first?  Because after asking in-game last night, I was under the impression that the number of talents you can have is limited only by the amount of money you have (and of course the proper level to unlock the talent).  I didn't think it was like DAoC or SWG or anything where you had a finite number of &quot;skill points&quot; to apply each level, and couldn't fully spec in every area.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, why would one not eventually get all the talents/spells available to the class?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

I think you're thinking of spells. Talents are totally different I guess.<br />
<br />
http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Talents.View&amp;category_select_id=9</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Talents look cool, sorta like AA's.  The only problem you had in DAOC was that when &quot;speccing&quot; your character you could FUBAR yourself.  It looks like talents are similar to AA's in that they are the icing to the cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">At each lv from 11 and up you get 1 talent point that you can spend in a talent. Talents are a lot like AA's but unlike AA's you cant continue to get them you only get 50. Each class has 3 trees to thire talents. When people are talking about builds they are refuring to how the points will be spent. I think that each tree takes 50 points to max. I havent added them up so I am not sure off hand. For shaman the trees are....<br />
Restore = Healing, Faster cast,less mana, more crits, yada yada yada<br />
Enhancement = Better Defences and better mele out put, Crits, better mele buffs, added AC and or defences, ect <br />
Elemental = Nukes, Faster cast, more crits, faster reuse, on and on<br />
<br />
Most will spend thire points in more then one tree. This way you become better in more areas VS strong in just one. The down side is that your not has strong in any one area. To me in seems to break down something like this, keep in mind this is just my oppion...<br />
Solo - Enhancement or Enhancement/Restore<br />
Group - Restore/Enhancement<br />
Raid - Restore or Restore/Elemental<br />
<br />
Personly I use Restore/Enhancement and it seems to work well for all things. I do solo a lot and it is good in a group. Sometimes at raids I wish I had Restore/Elemental for sneaking in insta cast nukes while assist healing. But other then that I like this build well enugh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually you get your first Talent Point at level 10 and you get a total of 51 points as of level 60.<br />
<br />
While as EQ players we might like to think of them as being like AAs it's really important to remember that you are capped and want to choose wisely for what build suits you best.<br />
<br />
You can retrain your talent points in the live game.  In beta it was free for testing purposes but basically there is a scaling coin cost to retrain talents in WoW retail.  And it will get expensive fast.<br />
<br />
To help you decide wowvault.ign.com has an AWESOME tool that is great for justs checking out class talents or playing with what you can achieve with various builds:<br />
http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Talents.View&amp;category_select_id=9<br />
<br />
A large number of Beta Shaman seem to heavily favor a Restoration based build making a goal of getting the Mana Tide Totem.  I personally am really torn.  I like the idea of cranking melee based skills.  But the question is, what do you want to excell at, nuking, melee, heals (or to a varying degree totems).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm upset.<br />
Toying with things, I found you are 1 point shy from being able to buy Elemental Fury, Elemental Mastery, and Nature's Swiftness.<br />
<br />
Archtype builds I'm thinking of:<br />
-Raiding healer.  Shaman can wear mail at level 40.  Priests can't.  You can be the beefy combat healer that's capable of taking a punch.  Max out on all restoration abilities, almost.  You are 4 points shy of maxing everything.  Probably would skip the self res and only put totemic focus to level 3.<br />
-Power nuker.  Instant nukes are good.  Refresh sucks on them, but oh well.  Concentrate on the lightning and shock spells for fast range damage.  Since you can wear mail, you can take hits when mobs get to you, or players for PvP.  The faster enemies die, the less damage they are doing to you.  Screw healing, and just do dps.  100% chance to crit for 100% extra damage looks kinda sick as a finishing blow, especially since you can do it on an shock?<br />
-ae damage?  I'm not sure on this.  I don't know what chain lightning does for sure, but I assume it's a nuke that jumps from target to target (to target...?).  Fire nova + chain lightning could be a good combo for mass pvp death.  Maybe good for grouping and pulling lots of mobs at once to clear them all fast.<br />
-&quot;battlemage&quot;.  max out defensive stuff.  make your totems make you hard to kill.  be good at melee too.  get up in the other side's face and beat their heads in.  option to use 2h axes for more dps, or shield block.  add extra shock damage from elemental for extra dps, or stick them into the healing ability and AC bonus from heal crit?<br />
-some mixing and matching?<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what path I want yet.  I'm thinking power nuker or raid healer.  I want to raid in WoW.  I like the EQ shaman as a healer, but I don't know how applicable it is to WoW.  So far there's not a lot of healing necessity.  Doing damage is always useful though.  I think actually what I'll probably do is go the power nuker to start, and since you can respec for whatever cost it is, if I find I'm raiding a lot, I'll swap over to the raid healer.  If I'm PvPing, power nuker it is too I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Healing pets seems to cause pretty big aggro compared to doing damage to targets even with a hunter that cant heal very well. So maybe that will influence your decision. I have no idea since my shaman is only level 6 but my hunter is 46 and healing is one of the few ways to pull aggro from my pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm going with a PvP build.  21 in Restoration to get NS.  Rest into elemental.<br />
<br />
Although I am thinking of getting full elemental so I can get 1.5 second chain lightnings for group PvP.  That would own.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lvl 29 shaman on a PvP server, I mostly solo, but sometimes I get together with my higher level guildies when we raid alliance outposts, or when they slum with me trying to help me catch up on the occaisional elite dungeon.<br />
<br />
I like this build (although it is heavily based on another shaman's work).<br />
PvP generalist build (http://wowvault.ign.com/View.php?view=Templates.Detail&amp;id=18663) <br />
<br />
So far, done with the Elemental Combat stuff and my shocks are noticeably better, plus it's harder for mobs and players to total my nova totem because it goes off faster, I can't stress how usefull that's been for fast stackable AoE damage.  I need to level faster to get the 2 seconds off of wolf form.  Would have saved my bacon at least half a dozen times already.  I really like this build, but I question if I need so many restoration points.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Here is what I did...<br />
<br />
We don't have many healers in our guild so I went restoration first.<br />
<br />
Restoration Talents<br />
•  Tidal Focus - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the Mana cost of your healing spells by 5%.<br />
•  Totemic Focus - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the Mana cost of your totems by 10%.<br />
•  Improved Lesser Healing Wave - 5/5 points<br />
Gives you a 75% chance to avoid interruption caused by damage while casting Lesser Healing Wave.<br />
•  Tidal Mastery - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the critical effect chance of your healing and Nature damage spells by 5%.<br />
•  Nature's Swiftness - 1/1 point<br />
When activated, your next Nature spell with a casting time less than 10 seconds becomes an instant cast spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me say that Lesser Healing wave and Natures Swiftness are HUGE!. They have saved me so many times in PvP and instances.<br />
<br />
Then I went Enhancement.<br />
•  Improved Shield Block 5/5 points<br />
•  Improved Ghost Wolf - 2/2 points<br />
<br />
Improved Ghost wolf is nice for escaping or running someone down who is trying to escape. Drink a free action potion and ghost wolf to get away. If they chase you on a mount then run across some rivers, that dispels the mount.<br />
<br />
I am currently working up the Elemental tree but this is what I plan to take.<br />
<br />
•  Concussion - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the damage done by your Shock spells by 5%.<br />
•  Convection - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the Mana cost of your Shock spells by 10%.<br />
•  Elemental Focus - 1/1 point<br />
Gives you a 10% chance to enter a Clearcasting state after casting any Fire, Frost, or Nature damage spell. The Clearcasting state reduces the mana cost of your next damage spell by 100%.<br />
•  Reverberation - 5/5 points<br />
Reduces the cooldown of your Shock spells by 1 second.<br />
•  Call of Thunder - 5/5 points<br />
Increases the critical strike chance of your Lightning spells by 6%.<br />
•  Elemental Fury - 1/1 point<br />
Increases the critical strike damage done by your Fire, Frost, and Nature spells by 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am torn between improved lightning shield or combat endurance for my last talent point. Any input from those that have these would be appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We got alot of shaman, I have one up and coming, impreved LS is a must, you do so much damage over time with the shield.<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I just respecialized the other night to get NS.  I thought I'd miss not having IGW, but really after 40, I can barely notice the difference.  Instead of using IGW to run from NPC's if I'm overwhelmed, I just run and insta cast a heal on myself with NS if I get too low.  Works just as good and NS is so powerful in PvP that its a must for any shaman on a red server.  <br />
<br />
My build is all about frontload damage.  Start off the fight with a couple quick 2 sec. lightning bolts/chain lightnings.  Shock.  Get in melee range, drop a fire nova totem, war stomp, nova totem goes off right after my opponent becomes unstunned.  If I get the jump on someone, fight over.  <br />
<br />
The restoration talents also help my surviveability when I'm jumped.  75% uninteruptable lesser healing waves + NS combo with healing wave is pretty damn clutch.<br />

Sounds like you on pve server though so prolly not a big deal, IGW has saved our shammies so many times it is unreal.<br />

Nice to see at least one shaman speccing some resoration hehe. I am getting two handers, then rest into elemental.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Alright I'm looking for some talent advice, could use the experts here.<br />
<br />
Situation:<br />
a) I play 1 night a week on a PvP server (Ner'zhul) with the same group of friends.  Always in a group.<br />
<br />
b) The five of us:  Shaman Shaman Priest Rogue Mage.<br />
<br />
c) lvl 22 atm, we just cleared Wailing Caverns (including waking the sleeper) this week.  <br />
<br />
d) After talking with the other shaman, I'm going to focus on high threat, insta-cast shocks and melee to hold aggro.  Basically be the tank while he focuses on being the off tank / adds / secondary healer.<br />
<br />
Here is the build I'm looking at:<br />
<br />
   Enhancement Mastery<br />
Shield Specialization Rank 5<br />
Thundering Strikes Rank 5<br />
Improved Ghost Wolf Rank 2 <br />
Two-Handed Axes and Maces Rank 1<br />
Anticipation Rank 5<br />
Flurry Rank 4<br />
Improved Rockbiter Weapon Rank 2<br />
Parry Rank 1<br />
Improved Windfury Weapon Rank 2<br />
Toughness Rank 5 <br />
Improved Grounding Totem Rank 2<br />
Stormstrike Rank 1<br />
Enhancement Total: 35<br />
<br />
   Elemental Mastery<br />
Concussion Rank 5<br />
Convection Rank 5<br />
Elemental Focus Rank 1<br />
Reverberation Rank 5<br />
Elemental Total: 16<br />
<br />
Total<br />
Total Points Spent: 51<br />
Level Required: 60<br />
<br />
So questions:<br />
<br />
1) Any suggestions on the talent build?  I don't have any experience with shaman powers/talents.<br />
<br />
2) Will this group be viable as we level?  Looking for a good mix of PvP and doing instances.  We still don't know how a mail-wearing shaman will tank in the higher level instances.</div></div><hr />

1) this goes against the norm, but I'd drop the improved windfury weapon talent.  The logic here is you plan to be primary tanking and since it's been parsed that winfury and rockbiter do pretty much the same damage, just distribute it different, and that rockbiter builds some significant aggro, that winfury weapon might be counter productive to holding aggro.  I'd put the 2 points into the 2 second fire nova totem for burst AoE, stackable damage.  I use mine all the time and it's great for ganking casters who can't move out of melee range fast enough (when a) they are dumb, b) I use snare totem, c) I open with frostshock).  Plus the extra damage will help build aggro.<br />
<br />
2) Can't really say, only 7-8 levels higher than you, but in an almost exactly composed group (shm, shm, rog, priest) I tanked in BFD through to the locked hydra.  I don't see a problem tanking even in leather through to lvl 35 unless something drastic happens to NPCs over the next couple of levels.  Solo I can tank 2 yellow cons (using the EQ con system as I just played that game too long to get used to WoW yet) in teh face, although I'd be smarter if I kited them.  I think your group will need to pick up a warrior, although I have heard of shamans tanking upper level content.  You might have to fill the group out though to make up for using a softer tank.<br />
<br />
I also have a question, can someone comment on stormstrike and it's effectiveness?  I see a mana cost and duration, clearly I don't understand how it works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm not really sure if I will keep my current build. it suits me fine when soloing, pvp, and in duels, but I find myself more and more in raid/group situations where my healing is more important than my dps. for me that really sucks, as I was always perfectly happy to never be a main healer in EQ, and that mind set sort of carried over to WoW. I think WoW shaman have better capabilities to be main healer for the situations we will come across, but to me it's just not my idea of fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have never seen a restoration specced shammy hehe.  If you got good groups, sounds like a plan. I just like the carnage that my little guy can do. Not as quick killing as rogue, but deadly and survivable.<br />
<br />
My roomate is 53 now, and if he isnt totally jumped like crazy, he can really put a hurting on almost any class, kiting and LS is key.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Most shamans I meet (even my RL brothers) forget that they have heal spells.

After all that screaming in EQ about healing too heheheheeh.<br />

I think some pallies have the same syndrome too, based on what Izmalis has said before :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually I'm on a pretty big PvP server.  And no my frontloaded damage doesnt work on pallies.  I just switch tactics.  I try to become as much of a paly as possible when fighting one.  <br />
<br />
Start fight off with two lightning bolts, fairly mana efficient damage, especially with their higher crit rate.<br />
Then I get in melee range and we both melee from there.  I usually try to circle him so he misses his swings.  When he puts up his shield, I heal myself.  Rinse and repeat.  Their melee dps isnt that great honestly.  Use low level earth shocks to interupt his spells out of shield and purge early and often.  Also, if you lay down a bunch of cheap totems, the paladin is usually compelled to take em out, wasting valuable swings.  I don't waste mana on expensive fire nova's or frost shocks.  Usually it takes about 2-5 minutes to take out a same level paladin.  Usually my mana holds up, sometimes it doesnt.<br />
<br />
Kiting works sometimes, but frost shock is a lot of mana.  Maybe once I get 2 second lightning bolts, I can kite with level 1 frost shocks and do damage with lightning.<br />
<br />
Im sure an enhancement shaman would be more effective at fighting paladins, but then i'd be sacrificing my effectiveness against all other classes, including rogues, which are by far the most common alliance characters.</div></div><hr />

So far it's been a pretty powerful build, only things that I really want that I can't get are Combat Endurance, Mana Tide Totem and Nature's Swiftness from the Restoration line (and I don't think giving up the elemental damage is worth it).  Lightning Mastery will be missed, since Call of Thunder is almost worthless without it (except for pulling and the lucky crit on ranged PvP), I wouldn't get it if it wasn't a prereq for  Elemental Fury.<br />
<br />
The beauty of building talents is you can always re-spec if you feel the need  :D <br />
<br />
Thottbot (http://www.thottbot.com/index.cgi?ti=Shaman) has a great talent calulator as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The more I look at all of the talents and the way I play this game (pvp, liking the ability to off-tank a little, but mostly I want to do sudden burst DPS), I'm considering a minor respec.  Let me know what you think of the following spec.  I don't know if anyone thought this combo up before, but it's based on my old build which was origionally posted by another shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Yar its a pretty good build.  One thing you might want to consider is only 4 points in reverberation so you can get two points in improved fire nova.  From a value standpoint, you sacrifice a .2 second improvement on shocks for a 1 second improvement on fire nova.  Grated you use shocks a lot more, but 2 second nova is awesome for PvP and almost always hits my target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Im kinda sticking to what i think a shaman should be, a balance of all.<br />
<br />
I have gone to NS in the restoration tree and 2h axe in the enhancement tree. I just got NS so i think im going to head back to the enhancement tree and get furry and so on. After that i dont know, i might dump a lil in elemtenal to help my shocks, but im not so sure any of the top of the trees are apealing enough to make me change my mind otherwise.<br />
<br />
Balance is the key i feel.</div></div><hr />

You're right.  I had thought about it too, but I'm a shock jock and the thought of only being able to cast 5 shocks when I could cast 6 in the same time guided my selection.  I'm still struggling with respeccing and also with your suggestion, in the end though I will likely follow it.  The 2 second nova totem features in my AoE combo (CL, WS, Nova, shock, CL (using NS when I get it)) and I don't want to lose it when I respec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats odd. It was EQ that taught me that we are the glue that holds everything together and the reason why i think im a good shaman in WoW. <br />
<br />
Im primarily a damage dealer in WoW, i like to tank when needed, i wear chain and have pretty solid HP compared to my guildies of equal or higher level. If asked for a group to be the main healer i will 95% of the time decline and opt to wait for a better group or to solo.  When im in a group however i watch health constantly while im dealing damge, if i see the priest getting low, about 1/4 or lower and i see other HP going up ( meaning he is paying attention to other people and healing ) ill toss him a heal then will stop and top off other health if its needed. He is the foundation of the group and if he dies it makes things much harder to survive as well as longer to recover. So i support him then get back to my damage/offtanking. This is why NS is so valuable to me cause i can have a instant cast heal loaded in times of trouble and save people if needed.<br />
<br />
Now if i DO end up being the main healer in a group, i honestly will just tank as well unless its a really tough area, in which case a shaman shouldnt be your healer. Between healing aggro and damage aggro its just easier with NS to heal myself. Man i wish i had Torpor in WoW, that was the best tanking spell ever. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">getting tough with only shammy healers in the higher level instances. Priests are where it's at. Sucks, cause was hoping no holy trinity crap needed in WoW.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Priests are where it's at.<br />
<br />
There's also an undergrumbling where people are looking for non-Shadow-specced Priests at 50+ in groups / instances.  I wasn't aware the healing was THAT much better for the Holy / X (forgot) priests. (My 18 Priest is Shadow Spec atm)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">It isn't, people are just stupid and min/maxers. All a good priesty needs is shield and heals and good aggro management, all of which a shadow priest has, they just dont use shadowform in groups like that, big whoop.<br />
