<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just simple question I'm wanting to increase my regeneration ablitiy.  I know the Fungi Tunic is the most wanted item.  And I know about the Iksar Breastplate and Rubicit Breastplate.  What I was wondering is are there any other perminate regen type items out there a shammy could wear?  Most notable an Iksar Shaman.   I've looked around but have not found any other then those noted with a permanat regen effect.  I'm guessing that thats it but just wanted to see if I had missed any thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There are a few items with the &quot;Aura of Battle&quot; effect.  Aura of Battle gives 2 points of regen and they all stack.  Aura of Battle items include: vindi bp, spirit wracked chord (sp? Chardok quest) and the Belt of Dwarf Slaying.  There are probably more items that are shaman wearable, but that's all I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I believe the 10th Coldain ring has a regen effect on it.<br />
<br />
The fungi staff also has a regen effect on it.<br />
<br />
The old rubicite BP has a 3 hp/tick regen effect.<br />
<br />
One of the dragon hearts (Zlandicar?) has a regen component, I believe.<br />
<br />
Those are all that come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Zlandicar's Heart isn't shaman usable.<br />
<br />
Heart of Fungus isn't shaman usable, sadly..that'd be nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Iksar bp and fungi staff (post nerf) are the two cheapest hp regen upgrades, excluding quest-related items.  Both have my whole hearted endorsement : )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">10TH coldain ring from my understanding, is 10hps ds and 10hps regen per tick, but does not stack with regrowth sadly.<br />
<br />
<br />
There probably is a way to &quot;expoloit&quot; and stack these like you can with a post nerf fungi staff, my guess it would involve a shaman ds potion (which also doesn't stack with 10th ring) and then regrowth, maybe 10th ring would overwrite potion effect?  Kinda lame since potion and regrowth are both better than the effect of the 10th ring.<br />
<br />
I dont have a 10th ring to play around with,  anyone able to test this?<br />
