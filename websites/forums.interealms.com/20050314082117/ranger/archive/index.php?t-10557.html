ie<br />
lvl26-Mammoths in Everfrost, Grouping in Splitpaw....<br />
lvl27-......<br />

A lot of work but could be worth it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
he is easier than the seafuries there.  not sure what level he is soloable by a ranger with today's equipment.  probably 45?  maybe lower.<br />
<br />
with a healer can def do around 40 i'd say in a duo.</div></div><hr />

Just fight your way from the entrance down to the gnomes andsell the pile of FS weaponry you get.<br />
<br />
After that, fight your way back to the entrance, zone out, and sell all of the FS weapons to the gypsies or Tisiana (sp.) outside.<br />
<br />
Rinse and repeat until you have the desired effect.<br />
<br />
I made 2-300pp an hour plus you can get a lot of cheap twink items from rares.<br />
<br />
Of course back when I used to do this, most of the stuff I got could be sold very easily in EC. I uesd to leave the place with a backpack full of Kobold Hide Boots, which sold for about 1-150pp each at the time. I still see em selling for 40-50pp in the bazaar once in a while.</div></div><hr />

Would kill the female monk looking ones, the brigands, and lowbie monk looking male ones (stay away from the casters unless you want to just free up a spawn).<br />
<br />
They drop Bronze weapons and sashes, and give good faction. The sashes are then turned in in  SOuth Qeynos for more bronze weapons, faction and a little exp.<br />
<br />
I used to make good money like a few hundred plat an evening doing this. Would sell all the dropped stuff to the local merchants in WK and when full of sashes make the Qeynos run. Bought my first Wurmy this way and saved enough to later purchase an FBSS and some other stuff.<br />

<br />
They drop low, mid, high cash, up to 4pp or so, mostly low, but also drop plenty of bronze weapons, ringmail armor and words and runes. The named drop a few decent items as well, one being wt redux bag. I was there the other night tryin to get a bag, the zone was empty, and although I didn't get the bag, had 4 idols drop, kept one other rotted, I came out with a few hundred plat to boot.<br />
<br />
Avocets in SK are decent cash as well, sometimes dropping black pearls. Decent solo exp at 30ish I think. <br />
<br />
Perma is okay too, if you can handle the mobs of gobs hehe. The casters can be nasty at times, but they drop decent cash and items. Same as Sol A I think.</div></div><hr />

Foremen drop swords that sell to merchants for about 40pp, and there is always crystalline belts on orc inspectors that I heard can sell for 100pp (haven't tried to sell yet, and it is also LORE). After spending time fear kiting in WL and DSP for no cash, it was good to see about 300pp drop into my bank account in two hours, not to mention the velium I came for in the first place....<br />
<br />
First day there, I was invited to team with a 40 monk on the geonids. I was expecting ka-ching! but gems dropped pretty slowly. Made more money on the orcs. Hmmm.<br />

Besides the velium weapons and nice coin, the orc miners drop various sized pieces of Velium.  The small bricks and blocks are used in the thurgadin gate potion.  These sell in the bazaar for 20-50p on Fennin.  So a pack full of those puppies is a coupla hundred platinum right there.<br />
<br />
Also, the spiders drop Crystalline Silk.  Sells for 10-25p a piece.  Tasty.<br />

Everything on the lower level can drop up to 4pp + BA armor which sells for 3-5pp with max cha.  Plus you get the chance for BA Coif (100 to vendor) BA Swords (5pp or so to venor)  the grotesque alloy mask (100 or so in bazaar) and the coud de' tat, the BA Medallion.  Best thing about medallion and the mask is they are not lore.  I have never kept track to determine PP per hour but this morning I went down with a bank accout of around 1600PP, 2 hours later I had 2100 pp in the bank and 1 mask and 2 MA Medallions to sell at the bazaar, all in all not a bad AMs work...:D I typically grab a KEI and a port back and forth, bout 70-100pp cost and the first coif I get pays for my expenses, the rest is just pure profit.  Plus you have the luxury of a banker (who you dont have to sneak to deal with) and vendors (who you do) down there..quite a treat!<br />
<br />
Oh, and keep an eye out on track for the moldmaster, drops the haste gloves.  Not much haste but I would imagine they would fetch some PP in the bazaar.  He dropped a Mithril Amulet for me once that sold for 75PP<br />
<br />
I am 47 now and mow thru there like no ones business, only real danger is if you get multiples on ya while the battle wizard is nuking ya.<br />
<br />
Very rarely any folks down there and if there are I just take a run over to SolB and look for a group.  Really quite convenient...<br />
<br />
Now, if you are on Prexus and happen to be down there due to this info, politely step aside when I arrive, hehe.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Ahem, by the way.  There is a door that is locked and unable to be opened down there, you will find it as you move around.  SHOULD something aggro you from the other side of the door, and subsequently open that door, do not go in there for fear of being locked in, hehe.  I was in there for about an hour or so last night until I finally got something to aggro me from outside to open it.  Many thanks to Faelaeny (my favorite Warder on Prexus..=)) who did her best to come rescue me...</div></div><hr />

Drops grave mold, Zombie skins (sell to aspiring rogues for 1pp each, or to a vendor for 5pp) and Amanita Phalloide (sp?) for 9gp each to a vendor.<br />
<br />
27-32 or so, mammoths in EF. Just find a mage or shammy who will summon you those wr pouches and go nuts. Tusks sell for approx 10pp each to vendors in Halas.<br />
<br />
At level 45-47 I would also suggest camping the mino hero. Getting the faction to do the hero bracer quest is a pain in the arse, but once you do it you can land about 700-800pp in a few hours.<br />
<br />
At level 50, you could probably solo the upper areas in Droga/Nurga. In addition to getting your chardok faction up early, and dropping lots of fs junk, they drop faction quest items that many high level players are willing to pay good money for.</div></div><hr />

I've made probably 300pp an hour there EASILY, killing tribals for their Acrylia.  Go there at 30 and stay till you are 40.  It's fun, it's great experience and the money is AWESOME.  You can throw some rockhoppers in there at the later levels too for some flawless and excellent hides, and you are looking at another 100-200pp each.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pfoe</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've also found that farming items for players isn't that bad either.  At 39, I went to WL and started hunting Raptors for their hides and foraging Yew Leaves.  Those items are used to make velious armor (tailored) and players go berzerk for them.  I make 20p for each raptor hide and 25p for each yew leaf.  It has made me a rich little level 44 ranger.  Give it a shot, you'll reap from the exp and money all the way to 44.<br />
<br />
A Raptor Hide Stack = 400p<br />
A Yew Leaf Stack = 600p<br />
<br />
1000p for about 1.5 levels (me, from 39 to 40.5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Astroshak</div><div class="date">10-15-2002, 02:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stridure, actualy the geonids are one of the worst mobs to camp for cash in CC at all, simply because there are only eight spawn points, and the ones that drop the worthwhile gems are rare.  The only mobs worse than the geos for CC cash are the spiders.  <br />
<br />
The miners, with the tons of velium they can drop, are the best cash in CC, especially with their numbers.  You can run through and kill, over and over, and they're easier than the geonids by far as well.<br />
<br />
When getting cash, the secret isn't really finding some huge plat dropping mob, or some mob that drops something worth a ton of cash; those work but aren't very efficient overall (because the mob might go very stingy with cash, such as the HG's, or might not drop the item/the item might stop being worth the camping).  This is why places such as SolA, and the Paineel skellies are popular; they drop consistant amounts of coin or other vendorized loot.</div></div><hr />

The guards in the keep drop about 5pp each and their weapons sell for about 5pp each.... I made about 500pp in an hour constantly pulling. There is a vendor right in the courtyard that you can sell to, although you will have to start using sneak after he becomes dubious.... which is as low as he'll go. Did I mention I did 35-37in about 2 hours here? I was of course duoing with a level 29 cleric. I can't imagine the exp she got... :D</div></div><hr />

Not much there that can't be handled by a ranger and a shaman, and also places there where things are soloable.  Never really noticed how much pp per kill, but always quest gems to be had, and a bunch of jewlery and gems, some of which sell to vendors for close to 200pp. Have never gone there that I didnt come away with several hundred pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MadWarper</div><div class="date">11-03-2002, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im supprised that no ones mentioned the MT Deputies!<br />
<br />
Each deputy drops a spear (+10p) and shield (+1p), plus what ever else they might be carrying.<br />
<br />
The deputies at the 'Wall' can be solo'ed with a Harmony pull from 30 on (maybe lower, i started at 30).<br />
<br />
Blixkin is an annoyance to any one killing deputies, but he stops agro'ing when he turns green.<br />
<br />
Ella Foodcrafter runs by all the time when i kill the deputies, never agro's. <br />
Worried about faction for epic? When i first got there she conned indiff, nomatter how many deputies i killed or band-aids turned in, still indiff.<br />
<br />
Why kill halflings?<br />
Halflings have built their homes at the expense of Misty Thicket, they destroy the trees (you can see the tree stumps from the 'Wall'), the Deputies openly kill bears and wolves (where in SFG we go out of our way to protect them) and more over the Deputies KS newbies all the time (just go here (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=7) , look for 'I hate the Deputies ')<br />
Everytime a halfling dies an angel get their wings :D <br />

Now with the new PoK book in MT, you dont even have to bother to fix your faction in RV!<br />

They drop four things that sell for 3-4 plat each, if I remember correctly.  Think I went there when I was 8-9th level, maybe even younger.  Made 30 or 40 plat in a few hours - more than I'd ever seen with a previous character at similar levels. <br />
<br />
I'm killing Mammoths in EF right now at 22 - even /cons aren't that common, unfortunately. I usually do a Mammoth or two to pick up some tusks, then head to Perma for some Goblin killing. I've been pulling in about 15 plat or so an hour this way, I'd say.<br />
<br />
Edit:  Well, this have been nerfed.  I've heard that the Goblin Heads and Goblin Blood still sell for a few plat, but it's no longer really worth it to go there.  If you're of an appropriate level, of course, it's not bad at all.</div></div><hr />

I didn't expect it to be so lucrative. Here's what I'm getting at level 45...<br />
<br />
 - Hill Giants drop up to 30+ plat, FS weapons, toes and lambent stones, and exp.<br />
 - Griffons drop up to 5 plat, griffon feather (for Fleeting Quiver) and blood, and exp.<br />
 - Highland Lions drop all manner of cat and lion pelts, including the HQ Lion skin (for FQ).<br />
 - Wandering Lions and Bears drop pelts to sell in the bazaar. I'm getting 1pp for ruined, 2pp for LQ, 5pp for MQ, and 10pp for HQ (but not the hq lion skin, that goes for 100s)<br />
 - EK is close and you can harvest silk fast.<br />
 - Bandits drop a plat and sometimes a sash that can be turned in for a couple more pp and exp.<br />
 - Foraging gets you plains pebbles which sometimes sell.<br />
<br />
With tracking, you can expand your search for griffons and giants to East and West Karana by just zoning over and hitting track. <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, as wonderful as this all sounds, the whole Karana hunting area can only support one, maybe two rangers/druids.</div></div><hr />

I sugest that you start at lvl 30, for SoW reasons (even better at 39, for max track abilities).<br />
EK is where you can spend a ton of time... Carrion and Crag spiders, matrical (many HQ drops) and normal lions. (You might run into some competition for Crags by other classes, but with Track, are they truely fit to be called competition? :p )<br />
Also in the commonlands pumas also have frequent MQ and/or HQ pelts.<br />
The REAL money is in the Bear pelt trade (atleast pre-Bazzar), but since I'm a Ranger from Surefall Glade, I'll have no part in the poaching of bears or wolves.<br />
<br />
With this said, pelt/silk farming can be quite profitable, that is if you can find a market...<br />
The silk price on E.Mar has been steady declining (started at 20p per swatch, now about 9p). Not sure bout the pelt trade, but I wouldnt be supprised if it was declining too.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that you find a fence befor you start farming, this will save you from endless hours in the Bazaar (where just about every one has one more of what you are selling for 1cp less :mad: ).<br />

I suggest Sol A, CC, and Paineel as the best areas depending on your level and gear.<br />
I don't mention Everfrost for mammie and I the aqua goblin camps simply because I prefer to leave greenies that are used for exp by Level 30 or lower players to those that can exp grind on them....nothing bugs me like a level 60 farming the aqua goblin camps in BB...for gods sake get some dignity.<br />
Gorn is also a excellent choice as are the Seafuries..they are pretty tough solo but doable with the right gear and right attitude (root plink or use swarmcaller/earthcaller to slow).<br />
I also advise against trade skill supplies....these days you can spend countless hours farming silks and end up selling them for far less than you can get by just simply going to CC and wacking orcs for coin, velium and weapons to sell.</div></div><hr />

Honestly guys, even at 51 these things are just not worth doing, the amount of time it takes to take one down makes it not worthwhile.<br />
I have tried many ways of farming, here are my best, bear in mind these are for farming purposes so most things are green to me at 51:<br />
** best pp per hour is HHK guards<br />
** Next best pp per hour (but can make much more than HHK if items drop) is ToFS wedding party.<br />
** Paineel Guards (from what I hear, never done these, no need to)<br />
** misty guards (if you switch between guards and Runnyeye) but the faction issues seriously affects the pp per hour figure<br />
** everfrost mammoths (there can be noone else in zone killing mammoths for this to be good)<br />
** foraging.<br />
<br />
With my druid partner the best for us both at 51 are:<br />
** ToFS wedding party<br />
** Ice Giants<br />
** Hill Giants</div></div><hr />

Grimling Runner in Tenebrous Mountains spawns in the entrance tunnel, is on a 90 minute timer, and is about level 40. Perfect owlbear pelts take some time to collect, but when the end product can be sold for 1K it really does pay off. I made about 7K doing this and as long as someone wants a pack it's well worth doing. If you don't want to make the pack and then /ooc or /auction until someone buys it, you can farm perfect owlbear pelts and just sell those (300pp each, last I checked).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got mucho denairo (sp? lol) early on from hunting in a few good places.<br />
<br />
1) Kurns at lvl 9-16 was amazing exp since we were in Kunark and killing skellies. I found a Solist's Icy Wand which sells for 1.5k on my server<br />
<br />
2) Lake of Ill Omen at 19 or so hunting on the ledge. I found the Bracer of the Hidden, a see invis bracer all/all, which sold for 700<br />
<br />
So my shm is decked out, but i need more money to fund this lil hairy halfling.<br />
<br />
I plan on waiting til 35 or 40, so that I will have my 34 or 39 pet spell. Can i hunt mammoths without being killed on site? Or do they roam? Lil advice would be nice on whether those guys are an option.<br />
<br />
Also, im at HHK right now, at lvl 27, and i kill blue guards while waiting to get into an orc group. They seem like pretty good exp and the one i killed dropped a fine steel short sword, which i can sell to the venders right beside me.<br />
<br />
So what are the best things for a 35 shm? HHK guards? CC? Mammoths in PF? give me some advice and keep in mind my faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timberbee</div><div class="date">04-13-2003, 10:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The Bandits of WK really should not be overlooked in the guide.<br />
<br />
There are four camps in the series.<br />
The first starts at the easternmost bandit farm, which is fairly much due east as you come out of the tunnel from Qeynos Hills.<br />
<br />
From there proceed westward, and slightly north, there are two more bandits stationed by some Birch trees at the base of the hill,<br />
<br />
occasionaly you will get 4, if you happen to hit a change of guard.<br />
<br />
At the top of the hill is a Bandit encampment. Numbers are fairly random as they will occasionaly break off and Run to man certain spots in the wilderness or Run to the other bandit groups.<br />
<br />
The third band is to the north, and westward, at the northern base of the hill, amidst some rather large trees.<br />
<br />
There is no permanent encampment here, and, again, numbers can vary.  It is on the Westward, downsloping side of the hill (gentle slope).<br />
<br />
From there follow the bases of the hills south and west. <br />
Where the bases of the east hill meets the base of the west hill follow that west ridge up,<br />
over the crest and south westward will be a spot overlooking the Ogre shrine with a number of bandits upon it.<br />
<br />
<br />
AT lvl 30 I no longer pick up aggro from the entire camp when attacking, except for the Brigands.<br />
Those will aggro if you attack any of the bandits in their immediate vicinity.<br />
<br />
This really increases the efficiency of the hunt.<br />
<br />
with SoW, dcent faction (which you get from killing the bandits), and 6 10 slot, 1 8 slot and 1 6 slot bag I make about 190-210 pp per 2 hour session.<br />
<br />
For me a session has ended when I get 54 sashes.<br />
As there are three merchants just north east of the bandit farm, selling Bronze weapons, shields, etc is a breeze.<br />
<br />
<br />
The spawns are fairly quick,<br />
four camps in a row<br />
a vendor close by<br />
not a lot of people hunting<br />
<br />
just comes down to an easy 90-100 pp per hour.<br />
Best plat I've made at 30, by far...</div></div><hr />

I used to duo in  PoG with my bot cleric all the time and yes you cna walk away with 20k ina  trip. Was even betetr money a few months ago when you coudl sell BDs for 1k, market is way down now though and lucky to get 400. Even with BDs so cheap now its still easy to average 2000p a hour and just sellign BDs to merchant. SO if you dotn care about faction and have a bot of a cleric friend head to pog and get pure cash, beats putting crap on a  vendor just to have some jerk undercut you by 10p</div></div><hr />

When i hit 41 I ventured into JPF and have been fearkiting griffawns. Drop gp-4pp each, ocassional 1-2pp vendor drops (runes, words, earrings) and best you can forage plant shoots, and get griffon meat, blood, and wings. Meat and shoots I've been dropping into the bazaar at 25pp each. There are enough griffs up occasionally to keep you going for awhile, exp is good, and I pulled about 1kpp in meat today (2 stacks).

<br />
For non-bazaar selling this is what i do:<br />
<br />
     Hunt the AC in Sro to MQ jboots for 5k. I have no idea how to make the AC pop, i have tried several &quot;surefire&quot; methods that i have been told, none seem reliable. Usually I play an alt during the day periods. <br />
    I then go to SK to get the shadow rapier in the hopes that Quillmane pops on track an 8k MQ on my server. Just be careful of the giant skele Sir Nadur, he hates it if he catches u killing shadowmen. <br />
    Head to rathe mtns. While going through lk rathe check if Lord Bergule is up for cleric epic a 1-2k MQ. Then kill HGs while you /auction once Hasten pops.<br />
<br />
P.S.   Kill the AC, expect to have others in zone react like you punched their mother! Personally i have no qualms over camping him, a lil' payback for the times i had to roll against a caster on stuff like an FBSS in my pre velious days. Rangers are well suited to hunt his fella.<br />
    Also for those who don't know, with the help of someone to keep Hasten hailed you can actually MQ the boots for alts on the same account as your Ranger.</div></div><hr />

At 65 I can destroy HGs in RM and easily bring in 800-1k an hour with non stop solo killing.  I dont even bother looting FS weapons.<br />

I don't do this much cause its boring, I get sick of arguing with KS druids, and at 65 I can camp stuff that brings in much better cash. (Tae Ew Blood Vials sell fast for 2.5 - 3k a piece on my server and are easy to get if you work the zone-in)  However, it is a viable option if you want some easy plat at 65.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that a Ranger in their 50s could mow down enough HGs to net 300-500 an hour if they went non stop with KEI.  Be warned tho that at peak hours this area is crawling with greedy quad kiters.  Work a circular patter around the top of the  hill with the tower and two guards and keep killing anything that moves.  HGs will pop frequently.

You need to double check but I think they re-enabled the zone-wide aggro on the Protectors of Growth in POG. This may well make it far harder or even impossible to do with small forces now.</div></div><hr />

At 50+ start going after the anaconda also...plat drop in the range of 1-6pp/per (don't ask me where the hell they keep it!!) ;) ...only annoying thing about these snakes is that they have close to twice as many as the griffons; ie - takes more time to kill.  The snake meat sell like the grif meat...excellent pp returns in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
On top of all this, you are getting exp while you are getting loot.</div></div><hr />

Most obvious is the Spiders. Crag Spiders drop up to 8 Spider Silks but commonly about 3. Carrions drop 2 regularly and up to 4. Place holders for both are the Casm Crawler snakes which are easy to kill to keep the spawns running fast. I sell these for 4-5pp in the Baz and they are snapped up fast. Can rack up 100 silks in 4 hours if you push hard, netting you 1k in cold hard Plat for the effort<br />
Hill Giants spawn here sometimes and not much need be said about them  :) <br />
Griffs of varying levels can be ok for cash and sometimes drop Gems.<br />
A nice little NPC that i noticed recently is Theoris Bladespur. Spawns every 30mins or less (not exactly sure) Drops up to 6pp in cash and ALWAYS drops a FS Dagger and either a FS Sword or Rapier. Total Cash form him is upto 15pp. Cons LB to a 50 Ranger and is an easy kill. Cant be rooted or Snared though. BTW he is a Rogue so dont show him your back or you WILL know all about it. 221BS everytime he has snuck up on me  :(  He has a sister in South Karana, same class, same level, same loot.<br />
<br />
Forages for here are Plains Pebbles which are slow sellers to Tradeskillers and Tea Leaves. These are used for Qeynos Afternoon Tea so they sell for a tidy profit. <br />
Even better is if you can get Brewing to 200 (not hard or expensive to do) and make the Tea yourself. 1 Leaf makes 6 Teas and the going Rate on Karana is 15pp per Tea. I sell at 12pp and they go like Hot Cakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argent</div><div class="date">06-14-2003, 04:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone, I am new to the Glade and new to EQ in general, so please forgive me if this message seems presumptuous. <br />
<br />
I thought I&#8217;d share what seems to me to be a fairly decent spot for us low-level types to make 25-40 plat an hour. The Grikbar Kobold camps in Steamfont are quick and easy for a 7-10 level Ranger to clear. <br />
<br />
The drops you are looking for are Grikbar Kobold Fur and Kobold Teeth. Both stack and are worth around .85 and .5 of a PP each. In addition the Kobolds also drop various cloth armors and Spring Water worth around 1-2 gp each. These prices are from the druid ring merchant beside the camps.<br />
<br />
A quick 10 minute cycle of the camp consistently produces 5-10 plat worth of fur and teeth and they appear to be on a fairly quick spawn cycle. Only the Shamans cause downtime. <br />
<br />
I realize that 25 plat an hour is nothing to you exalted folks but for us newbies, a few hours there makes the difference between having leather armor and something quite nice from the Bazaar (and I&#8217;m enjoying the Swiftblade I bought with my ill-gotten loot as well).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone else my level.</div></div><hr />

By the way, Norik, I forgot to thank you for making this guide in the first place. Nice to have a few generations of Rangers ahead of me to scout out that kind of information. Er... no pun intended. Ok, mostly unintended.</div></div><hr />

Had the name wrong, it's Steam Dye. How well it sells would depend on how many gnomes are trying to skill up tailoring but should sell for more than the vendors pay for it. :)<br />
Might want to check out the other LoY cultural robe dyes since most of the dye components are foraged.</div></div><hr />

Went in with a 56 shammy, 52 Ranger, 54 Ranger, and 53 Cleric.  After one hour we walked away with 300pp each.  Could have made more if we would have sold the acrylia in the bazaar.  AC is a nice spot for a low 50's group.  If you are lvl 50 then the mines in Grimling Forest that lead you to AC can be hunted for real nice exp and about 100 plat an hour solo.  I like to take a lot of our younger guildies in to the GF mines because I can single pull for them.  Good loot and still some good exp at lvl 54.  My wife, 54 cleric, and me, 54 ranger, can still make about 200 plat each an hour in the GF mines and about two blue bubs killing DB and LB mobs.  It is still part of the GF zone and thus outdoors, so all our ranger spells work just fine.  If you want to solo and are lvl 50, you can single pull, root, dot with Swarm of Pain, and Stinging Swarm and if you have KEI rinse and repeat.  Slower but still safe.</div></div><hr />

Usually empty on here on MT. It's not great plat, but my guess is it can be done as early as the mid 30s (I didn't try it till the 40s myself and they were cake then). Can pull about 100pp or so an hour in gem drops not to mention the every so often Polished Bone Bracelet drop.</div></div><hr />

Solo, I can keep one of the taverns (or whatever) cleared, and the pirates drop sapphires and similar gems, as well as racial meat (gnome, dark elf, ogre and troll mostly) which sells in the bazaar.  Foraged bits such as morning dew, acrylia bits for smithing / fletching, and the furs from Western Wastes (velium hounds and mastodons, an easy kite for a L65 on Claws of Veeshan faction) also sell well.<br />

The easiest money makers for me, though, are foraged dragon eggs.  The going rate on my server (in the Bazaar) is 100pp an egg :-)</div></div><hr />

On the ideas from this post, I went to CC.  For a 53 ranger with KEI, it was ridiculously easy.  Bring a few weight reducing packs if you're going for velium, or just lots of bags for other things.  So far, I've been mixing it up.  I'll do a little velium hunting, then go kill spiders for their silks (I sell em for 5pp each in baz) then kill geos for a while.  For those that do not like the bazaar, geos are great, as the gems they drop are vendor sells for really good plat.  Just gotta keep killing em, about 1 in 8 (a named geo, like gem collector or something) will drop a ncie gem.  The only problem I have with this zone though is that it is often camped, and people get REALLY fussy about it.  This is additionally frustrating to me as those campinga are usually my level or higher, so they get no exp from anything there, and they steal the camps ftom the appropriate levels, who would be gaining exp and good loot, which we all dream of/ask about/whine for.<br />
My solution was this.  I ran into a lvl 35 ranger soloing stalag terrors.  As a lvl 53, he could still group wiht me and get exp.  So I let him tag along while I chewed stuff up (he helped a little, I let him snare everything) and he got exp like he was soloing, as everything was green to me.   I kept all the loot, he soaked up all the exp I would have otherwise had been wasting, and everyone was happy.  Just a suggestion to keep everything hamonius while we greedily blaze through younger zones in search of a quick way to our new bazaar toy.  :)<br />

I do the same thing myself while im farming at the IG's in everfrost. i'll set up my camp in the back or front which ever is open and send a tell to a lvl 35 in the zone and ask him if he wants to leech exp as long as he plays banker for me. i let them keep the FS weapons for vendor loot since i hate carryin those things to the vendor myself. we both walk away with something we're after and everyones happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RaechoElderwood</div><div class="date">08-07-2003, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I guess being in a guild that pushes you to level I dont find that I have the time to run around a green zone and make money.. so I go for the xp spots with decent drops and my favorite at my level (55-58 so far) has been fear-kiting Velium Hounds in Western Wastes. The run through Sirens Grotto is really easy once someone shows you how(and there is a really good post here somewhere dedicated to that). Velium Hounds are rather scary if your going face to face with them but I found they are little more than puppies when feared. I read somewhere here to start with Brontos and Mammoths and move up to Hounds but they were too slow xp for me and had too many hps. Velium hounds are easier but beware them breaking fear and turning on you. They drop their furs which pull in 300-600pp each in the bazaar for people doing the shawl quest or raising smithing. The drop rate is something nice like 50%. The biggest hazards in the zone (to a CoV+ facton person... i stress that you should not be kos to CoV) is Ice Burrowers that I've only had one run in with (damn guild chat!).. they are red and if you gain aggro will chase you from across the zone.. although i have gotten pretty close to them without getting aggro.... and just a handful lof non-cov faction mobs. Namely the dragon hunters to the left of the zone in (easy peasy.. just run away from them), Guardian somethingorother (a air ely for the fusible quest.. no biggy) and the named Wyvern in the wyvern caves.. starts with a V i think and will kill you quick. Anyway the zone is huge and plenty of room to fearkite without interferience. I have gotten up to 12 furs in a night (3 hours).. thats about 2k an hour plus about a percent of xp every three kills at 58.</div></div><hr />

Orc Miners are okay but velium has no value anymore really, and the miners on Tribunal are scungy, can go 5 to 10 kills without a single piece, spent an hour recently just trying to get enough for a few Thurg Gates.  Also greater majority carry 2 to 5 silver and a pick and thats it.

<br />
Some Extra stuff I've found, not sure on levels/feasibility  on lower people though.  <br />
<br />
Hollowshade Moor: Grimlings will carry acrylia sometimes, also nearly every one has a acrylia etched rune, often 2 as many as 4, that sell from 2gp to 1pp. roughly<br />
<br />
Tenebrous Mountains:  Grimling Caves, at 62 if no ones there and i can nearly clear both caves  with kei.  Spent a fair bit of time here for change of pace, and my tactic is to throw on all your buffs and ds (62 i have 39ds) and with regen your laughing.  Then I kill them in groups of 4 to 6, killing casters first, foreman, then orefinders, letting the rest take dps all over, most are 1/2 to 1/3 dead by the time i get to last couple.  These drop a few more runes more regularly, selling about 5gp to 2pp.  They also drop Shiny stone weapons that sell 5pp.  Also tend to drop a lot of luclin variety gems that sell from 1pp to 20pp with one type in the 50 pp area I think.  <br />
<br />
Grimling Forest: Same as above but more often 4 runes but they tend to be about 1pp to 5pp selling and less gems.  <br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns, in a group that wasn't worried about loot i was collecting a few nice runes in 4's that sell for 5pp.  Also filth covered weapons sell around 100pp.  Lots of acrylia too.<br />
<br />
Twilight Sea, good for farming swirling shadows, but have to be careful getting too many on you, one on one is most efficient, and nameds can be nasty (many have been run off island to root dot  while i regen/heal)  but tend to drop named items that sell 10 to 20pp ( I usually look at price on vendor and round it to nearest pp and auction it in PoK, a low person can use it better than a vendor) .  Get drops of 1 or 2 off the shadows that sell for 35 to 50pp  to smiths.  In 2 hours i had 45 and they sold quick as.<br />
<br />
East Karana seems to have been nerfed too, Went hunting spider silk after selling a stack of silk for 100pp when i doubted people would buy it from a guy for 7pp lol.  Crag spiders where dropping 2 most of the time a few 4 or 5 and regularly none.  2 was good for the lesser spiders.  Throw in the huge distances between targets and it  just wasn't worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Anyway hope this brings it back to attention and helps anyone out.[</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hate to be the one to say this, but the truly great methods of getting plat are the ones that will get nerfed if someone speaks about them, such as the use of tinkered cams for making rough darkwood compounds, for skill and profit.  <br />
<br />
There are ways of getting lots of plat (such as over 40k per RL day) but even though those may be very specific as to what classes can do them you won't find people mentioning how to do them because they don't want their plat farms nerfed.</div></div><hr />

You can walk out after 4 passes with 600pp or more plus the acrylia you can sell in bazaar.

<br />
they have 10k hp give or take and are easily tankable if you have decent gear.<br />
<br />
But root / dot / bow is better over all.</div></div><hr />

Kill everything top to bottom and back. Have as many weight reducing slots as possible. If you are 50-55 this is easy...I mean boringly easy, but if your solo its also safe. If your lower grab a friend. Its fun and rarely crowded.<br />
<br />
When you get to the bottom, sell everything but Herbalists bag and VELIUM ORE. Keep that ore and put the herbalist in your shared slot. Pull the herbalist out with an alt to sell in PoK.<br />
<br />
Start over. Go up and down till your eyes bleed.<br />
<br />
Once you can stand it no longer head to shadowhaven. If you dont have basic...I mean BASIC smithing skills, grab a quick guide at EQTraders.com.  I think 31 is all you have to get to.<br />
<br />
Get a chisel. Sit down and SPLIT all of the ORE into stackable SMALL PIECE OF VELIUM. This stuff if always in short supply and is needed for all kinds of quests and combines. People pay a LOT for the convienence of buying a few pieces rather than going and getting it, when all they need it 2 pieces.<br />
<br />
Put it on a mule and make out like a bandit. Also its fun slaughtering orcs willy nilly, they scamper and squeal so!<br />

PS~ In personal notes i've just bought a house, in an area that will hopefully be getting broadband in the next 6 months, but I may be busy doing DIY (:(), but i'm sure i'll be able to fit some EQ time in in the mornings. I plan 9am till noon (GMT), then i'll get the drill out.</div></div><hr />

Grimlings in Acrylia Caverns. Drop decent plate, some named near the zonein drop BPs worth a few kp, and the junk weapons they drop are worth almost 150p to a vendor.. and they drop tons of acrylia.<br />
<br />
Rath Mtn Hill Giants. Always a nice money maker if they arent permacamped.<br />
<br />
Due to the new recepie to get to 222 smithing with small peices of velium, any form of usable velium is high value nowadays.<br />
<br />
But you know what the iggest money maker is and has been for me for the longest time?<br />
<br />
Dumpster diving.<br />
<br />
Scanning all the vendors pretty much everywhere you can go, buying up usable/sellable items that people unknowingly or lazily sold to them.<br />
<br />
It is kinda gambly tho. some days you dont find squat. Somedays you find all sorts of stuff you sell very nicely... and every now and then you hit the jackpot...<br />

Also, look out for spell components.  For instance, Enchanters *need* pages of Tasarin's Grimoire pg 26, becuase it's for their AoE mez.  Something for rangers around level 16 to look out for.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Garioch</div><div class="date">03-15-2004, 02:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, allow me to shed some light on what Astroshank was alluding to ......... he is speaking of errors in game mechanics that are called EXPLOITS. They are random and are a perfectly lazy way to make lots and lots of plat. They are also a perfect way to get you account deleted without notice if you are caught/reported as abusing said exploit.<br />
<br />
Having said that, to add to the level chart above, and this is contingent upon your being able to mule yourself or a char in the bazz over night:<br />
<br />
levels 1-10 hunt the Lesser Shades in Shadeweavers for the Swirling Shadows. They are for 200+ Smithing and are a very inexpensive way to skill up. However they are horridly tedious for someone high level enought to skill up on them to farm this stuff.<br />
My Ogre SK on Brell is level 14 with 1500pp in the bank now from these.<br />
<br />
Gornit in OOT, still DB (sometimes LB) at level 50. Drops all sorts of Toes. Only one other mob in game drop Fire Giant Toes and you wont tangle with those until level 60 (to solo that is). These toes make a 94% Haste Potion, so your local Shammys are looking for them since the potion trivs at 170.<br />
<br />
Acrylia Caverns are still DB to me at levle 58. I average about 300 to 400 plat per KEI duration. I bottleneck the hall way leading to the camp fire where the Primalist spawns and if he drops the Grimling Skin Mask then you are going to dance on the spot!<br />
<br />
Well, off the top of my head, those have been some of my best plat making ventures, other than the Greater Lightstones, and Mammoth Tusks. PS: Dont sell the Greater Lightstones, turn them into the gypsy gals in North Karana and Oasis of Marr for the book, then sell the book back to her for 10pp each.<br />
<br />
I wish you well, and Halcyon all!<br />

But, when you can zone in, foraged items (and possibly fish) there can yield up to several plat per. Not to mention there are tons of animal mobs.</div></div><hr />

 <br />
hopefully this helps some of you out ...if you wanna waste time flaming the value i stated HQ lion pelts could be sold for...atleast log on torvo and see for yourself<br />

I practically never ran into anyone doing this, it's actually good xp up to a point too, i'd used to group there, other than beggars wanting you to give them gear (drops shields and swords - swords sell for about 9p, shields 2 or 3, then you get what the mob drops, 15pp or so a kill average).  there is one tougher one to look out for.<br />

 Err I went to check this out, but decided it was a bit confusing, do you mean neriak commons? or forieng quater?, or the zone with the library?.  Cause from what I am reading, and what i put in bold, you zone in, then you go and find another zone in, the 'right' one? &quot;Zone in, and take the right zone in.&quot;</div></div><hr />
