-NPCs can now hold a total of 30 effects (buffs and Debuffs) before things stop taking hold<br />
<br />
nice, but you may still hit the cap with enough 'dotters' on a long fight....and when the heck will they allow more than 15 buffs on players? there has been multiple, stackable new buffs added to the game since release....and with many mobs having ae's that take a buff slot, this is extremely annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doesnt really matter.  Until they take the DD components out or give us some kind of lure based dot, their still useless on most big mobs.<br />
<br />
Would be nice to have in ToV though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is big time neat for shamans stacking in xp groups</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">would be nice for PC's as well, then can stack potg/c and marzins and have all the buffs you want really and not worry about having some stupid AE overwrite them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Doesn't mean too much for us.<br />
Last time I used bane of nife in HoT (after mob was slowed) I was being maintank for the rest of the fight. They have to decrease the agro (and probably the resists) on our poison dots before Shamans can use them on raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i think the 15 slot limit on PCs is very intentional and unlikely to change.<br />
<br />
it actually means you have to *gasp* make some choices about what you want, and plan ahead by leaving some room so mob-cast debuffs/dots don't overwrite Aego (this happened to an RL ranger friend of mine the first time he took me to Sebilis and some jin shaman cast sicken on him... boy was he annoyed that i'd given him all 5 resists :\)<br />
<br />
an extra 3 song-only slots would be very nice though, so the slots we save don't get eaten by a bard AE.</div></div><hr />

You must have had a warrior as your MT :P<br />
<br />
I use bane + pox + EBolt whenever I have mana, I get a couple of love taps sometimes (sometimes mind you) but the *SK* (Note, not a crappy can't get aggro to save their life warrior) pulls it right off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a moss snake has resisted your Bane of Nife spell!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sadly there are places where an SK tank just doesn't cut it. Especially when you need a defensive war, where the taunt value of the warrior is decreased even more.</div></div><hr />
