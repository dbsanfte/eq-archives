<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Redeemed Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello ...long time reader only posted a couple. Thought I would ask what is happening with posts on class message boards. My main is a Rogue so I spend alot of time venting and reading the posts of fellow rogues at the Safehouse. I don't know if I am just seeing an Infusion of morons or what but it seems that we have gotten a ton of people WANTING to be banned or just totally ripping on us. So .... I am also a Shaman (54th epic) on my server (Rathe) I thought I would ask if we have set off some other classes or something. Could this be just a ton of peeps trying to start some static ? So since I am in the posting mood I would drop by my home away from home and get your guys imput. I don't see that many locked posts here. And I don't get the impresssion you guys are like that judging from the threads I have read thru so Lemme know what you think ....Thanks.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The more popular classes has always had a higher flame rate, as more people play, more people play less common classes, like rogues and shaman, and therefore the number of people coming to those classes message boards goes up.<br />
<br />
Kinda sucks, but I'll blame it on the dr00ds ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think there are lots of jackasses in every class, as you can see above (If you've not already put Redspeed on ignore) Most people want instant rewards and aren't willing to put the effort in to get though the early stages of the Shaman's career when it's tough to solo and the spells are weak.<br />
<br />
The people that usually post here genrealy want to play a shaman for what the shaman class has to offer, and don't want to change the class out of all recognition. There are some people who want Resses and ports etc, but they don't hammer the board saying that shaman are broke and need these things.<br />
<br />
Granted we do get worked up once in a while as the recent posts about affliction foci items nerf and the petition to remove spells from our class but, generally it's quite peaceful.<br />
<br />
That's not to say we don't get people who bash heads with opposite points of view, but that is what makes a board interesting to follow.</div></div><hr />

LOL i get it</div></div><hr />

There are always going to be people that act like 5 year olds when it comes to MBs.  There is no accountability or reprocussions for thier actions on those boards.  More people playing the game = more of those types of people.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Selkie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently quit reading the Safehouse.  I decided for the amount of information I was getting, it wasn't worth wading through all the crap.  Anonymity brings out the worst in a lot of people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL the honda civic forums. Man its been a while since I trolled over there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Could be pre-expansion tensions.<br />
Could be growing pains from PoP.<br />
Could be all these retired people still lurking.<br />
Could just be the general strife and uncertainty in the world today.<br />
<br />
Or people just need to get laid more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Or people just need to get laid more.<br />
See the EQwidows thread.  We're a bunch of divorced, no life, EQ addicted ppl - we don't get laid.  Cyber just doesn't release enough...uh...tension :)</div></div><hr />

:P<br />
<br />
speak for yourself... but im eq retired now so... whatever :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I really don't appreciate Redspeed's or Enkidu's posts. If you are going to joke about it, at least use a smiley. I don't put up with any kind of name-calling around here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have noticed a mood shift over the past year or so where the negative posts are tending to dominate over the posts which talk about enthusiasm and enjoyment of the game.  That may just reflect the state of mind of the high-end player base, unfortunately.  Personally, I am still excited and enthusiastic about the game but I am not as burned out as some seem to be.<br />
<br />
It is easy enough to ignore flamer posts.  What does get depressing are the many really thoughtful posts from experienced players who are angry with the game.</div></div><hr />

Kinda funny, because i distinctly remember Red bragging about how he was an SA goon, and how he lived like a mile away from Lowtax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Frequently this board reminds me of an archaeology project:  You have to dig through piles and piles of garbage, but every now and then you find something that makes up for all of it.<br />
<br />
It used to be so much more interesting, but many of the newer folks just don't actually read the boards.  They show, they post, they read their answer, and leave.  Repeat as needed.  Witness the frequent reposting of the same question on the main page -- when there are 2 other threads directly below it already going on the EXACT same topic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Redeemed Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">50/50 is the garbage and useful info and opinion amount we get at the Safehouse. Thanks you all for being mostly really cool about your statements. <br />
                                        thanks again</div></div><hr />
