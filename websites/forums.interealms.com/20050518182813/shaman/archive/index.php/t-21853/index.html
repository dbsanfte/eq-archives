<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, I'm starting a new thread about spells. There is no &quot;shaman vs. Rytan&quot; or &quot;get Rytan fired&quot; allowed. He's asked us why we think he's wrong, we will now politely  tell him why we think he's wrong.<br />
<br />
What I want is hard evidence. Like Barm's proposed parse on stat buffs.<br />
<br />
I want well thought out, coherent posts about why the things we want are good for the shaman class.<br />
<br />
If you insult anyone, I'll delete your post. If you flame SOE, I'll delete your post. If you froth about and make no sense, I'll delete your post. If you don't have a suggestion about spell improvements, I'll delete your post.<br />
<br />
Make sense or stay out. Tizzies and hissy fits, not allowed.<br />
<br />
I will go first!<br />
<br />
Avatar - why is the duration so short and the recast so long?  <br />
<br />
Avatar is not the powerful buff you seem to think it is. In fact, our guild main tank yelled at a shaman a couple of weeks ago for buffing him with FA, it got in the way of buffs he really needed. Avatar is desired only for the attack component. As other posters will demonstrate, the str/dex component of avatar is pretty useless.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't think avatar is more powerful than haste or more powerful than KEI, yet those buffs can last hours! <br />
<br />
I think a spell duration closer to 30 minutes rather than 6 minutes would be much more acceptable. If you are overly worried about the effect of SCRM allowing POK-style buff selling, than I would relunctantly accept a 20 minute duration.<br />
<br />
At the very minimum, I would respectfully ask that the recast time on avatar (and future iterations) be eliminated. This would allow me to quickly mem the spell, buff a whole group and then demem the spell, allowing me more available spell gems and increasing my fun in groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Rytan's original post for consideration:<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was. I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future. <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time. Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen. I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing. (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition. I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap. This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed. I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS. The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed. Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations. Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted. Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob. <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC. In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc. I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect. Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments. This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just thought I'd let you know what I thought directly in hopes that it would quell some of the frustrations that you all have voiced. We as a team, and I personally, are very committed to EverQuest being the best game it can be, and I think with continued involvement and communication with the community we can keep EverQuest a great game for years to come.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dreamx2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hi there ryan let me first off introduce myself to you. Im Dreamx a Harmonium Shaman On Xev. Im time flagged weve almost finished up the GoD expansion as well. I Feel its my time to post on what uve been saying ive tryed to restrain for reasons being Soe obviously dosent care. Ive read ur post on what soe plans to do to improve shamans.<br />
1.) Better stat buffs First off You have to know im in a guild with everyone in it has max stats stat buffs might be fine and dandy for some but there absolutely useless for the high end player or raider. They dont increase my dps they dont do anythign for me but take up room in my spell book.<br />
2.) Cannis- Im glad people want more cannis i dont I have canni5 acient canni and with omen im supposed  to get 2 more? THanks but no thanks its a miracle if u can run me oom as is.<br />
3.) Slows- Are worthless for a raiding shaman if u like u can personally come on some of my guilds raids and watch how fast mobs die they die in less then 8.0 seconds so fast i cant even cast velium strike on them now u tell me the value slow has in that then sir or malos or dots cuz id love to know or the value of giving me a ton of mana regen.<br />
4.) If action needs to be taken to persquade ur mind that shamans are broken im more then willing to go on strike cancle my account delete my shaman whatever it takes because sony obviously dosent care abotu peoples concerns unless it effects or annoys them in some way or another what better way to hurt a company then to make them lose money.<br />
5.) My view on my class- Im a shaman with all the resources available in the world to me I have top of the line egar 6500+ hp unbuffed i have a full spell book im also a proud owner of acient canni and u know what all that amounts to on raids nothing. Mobs die so fast i cant slow or malos so there usless spells no bosses in god are slowable so its a mute point on high hp mobs as well. You ever try dotting a mob that dies faster then u can cast velium strike, Not effective just fyi. Ever try to bufff someoen with max stats, Not effective fyi. All you have left a high end raiding shaman with ryan is nothign more then a medicore spot healer youve negated 80% of my ability to do anything on a raid gratz YAHOOO for you giving me more mana i cant use YAHOO! yahoo for you giving me dots i cant use or slows i cant use Im exstatic about all the new improvments comeing about absolutely exastatic as u can tell. i dought ull even reply to this but anyways thats my 2 cents as a high end raiding shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The core issue as I see it is that you do not seem to fully understand that EQ has fundamentally changed in PoP/GoD, and that change has had an enormous negative impact on our class. EQ used to be about efficiency.  The Shaman class is all about efficiency.  We prevent damage, especially on long fights.  We do damage efficiently but slowly.  We heal efficiently but slowly. <br />
<br />
Now EQ is about speed.  All that matters in EQ as it exists today 99% of the time is fast healing, fast damage dealing, and tanking.  That's all there is to the game.  Shamans are very weak at all 3 of these, therefore we are weak at EQ. <br />
<br />
You just do not seem to appreciate that EQ is radically different today than it was from release through SoL, and that the abilities that made us powerful (sometimes overly so) during that era are largely worthless now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Regen/Canni<br />
<br />
That sounds like a nice convenience. The real mana regeneration issue is a relative one, not an absolute one though. Mana regeneration used to be a huge strength of the shaman class, even though we were penalized for it by mana-intensive spells. Now it is often almost entirely irrelevant because (a) every class has vastly better mana regeneration than before and (b) you guys have changed EQ fights from long, &quot;how efficiently can you use your mana&quot; fights to fast &quot;how fast can you dump your mana bar&quot; fights.&quot;<br />
<br />
:<br />
Stat Buffs<br />
I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Years ago it was demonstrated that STR has only a marginal effect on DPS. I believe it was demonstrated that STR only increases damage on max hits, not modal ones. Unless you have changed the damage calculations since then, that should still be the case. We can do parses for you yet again on this though. Then again, we may just be disagreeing on what &quot;noticeable&quot; means. Yes, you &quot;notice&quot; higher max hits. DEX/AGI are in even worse shape.<br />
<br />
In any event, it does not really matter since buffs are someting a bot can do, and do not a constitute worthwhile core gameplay mechanic for your players. Frankly, you could remove every buff from the game and I wouldn't blink  As an aside, please God don't give us any more tiny duration, long recast buffs like Avatar, especially when those buffs have only a marginal bonus compared to long lasting, no recast buffs (compare effect/convenience ratio of Avatar line to Haste line).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations. Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
<br />
<br />
Minor point, but why would you tie a fix like this to AAs? It's annoying as all get out, because we know that a couple years ago you would give fixes like this without attaching them to a grind (root and snare stacking, for example).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted.<br />
<br />
(a) The cleric:druid:shaman heal ratio is something like 100:64:47. The shaman:enchanter:beastlord:bard slow ratio is something like 75:70:65:50. That is *before* accounting for pervasive mitigation. What gives?<br />
<br />
(b) You have a stream of mobs that die in 30 seconds. It won't get slowed for 12 seconds. You need to have enough healing to keep the tank alive for the unslowed period anyway, and you can't count on the shaman to heal when she is trying to slow. Why would you bring a shaman to slow over an enchanter, beastlord, or bard in such a situation, each of whom can slow *and* do something worthwhile the rest of the fight.  Why wouldn't you bring another cleric or wizard and eschew slows completely?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course not, everyone knows that 75% slows were way too powerful, just like CH was, and everyone knows that these abilities are what made Luclin so dull (no offense, you guys have said that yourselves).  <br />
<br />
The problem is that you can't take a class' central ability, give them nothing in return, and expect them to be balanced. If you decided that evasive/defensive hamstrung your ability to make interesting content and decided to de facto remove it from the game by introducing massive &quot;defensive mitigation&quot; everywhere, I would expect you to compensate the warriors in some way.<br />
<br />
Our central ability was Turgurs. It made the game boring, so you took it away. Then you gave us...nothing.<br />
<br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments. This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
<br />
Heals over time are irrelevant. EQ is all about spamming fast direct heals.<br />
<br />
Now, what is relevant you ask?<br />
<br />
Damage and Direct Heals<br />
<br />
I notice that you just didn't mention the two most important issues. As I said at the beginning, the game you guys have made has three important roles in it:<br />
<br />
1-Tanking<br />
2-Fast damage dealing<br />
3-Fast healing.<br />
<br />
To make us viable in this new game you have made, you must make us much better at 2, 3 or both.  The game that the shaman class was designed for is gone, and it isn't ever coming back.  Make us worthwhile in the new game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Making our group haste (talisman of alacrity) buff as much haste as our single target haste (swift like the wind) would not add any power at all to shaman, but would drastically decrease my annoyance factor in groups.<br />
<br />
After I spend time casting malos, then turgurs until it sticks, the fight is half way over.  Under what conditions would I ever actually cast cripple?  And how much damage is it supposed to mitigate, because it sure doesn't seem to do much of anything other than get me agro when I use it in xp groups?<br />
<br />
Why doesn't our &quot;wolf spirit&quot; pet come with innate spirit of the wolf?  Or at least come pre-buffed with it as if we'd cast it?<br />
<br />
Would it really be so overpowering to eliminate the recast times on malos, bane, ferine avatar, and some other spells so we could swap them in and out more easily?  <br />
<br />
Why are our poison nukes so small in magnitude?  Why are our cold nukes so darned slow to cast?<br />
<br />
Why aren't you immediately upping the regen on blessing of replenishment to something like 100/tick and perhaps limiting it to level 60+ targets?  Same question for damage shields, though that's more of an issue to my druid than my shaman.<br />
<br />
Why do rains have such a crazy high resist rate given how situational they often are?<br />
<br />
I have a bunch of other spell related questions I could type in, but I'll wait to see if these get any answers before I waste my time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My only suggestion here is a simple one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Disease DOTs <br />
<br />
Long-lasting, low-damage death-over-time spells are obsolete in their current state with the nature of the game shaman face today.  With fights getting shorter, especially once Omens of War and the new level cap are released, a straight damage spell of the disease DOT nature is obsolete.<br />
<br />
I don't propose removing them altogether.  Instead, on the level 60+ disease-based DOTs, add a debuffing component that is active for the entire duration of the spell, no matter how long.  Please, only use one debuff slot for this.  Mobs can do this already, players (especially shaman and necros) should be able to as well.  <br />
<br />
Here's a simple example:<br />
<br />
Pustules of Noqufiel<br />
<br />
Class:  Damage over Time<br />
Duration: 2min, 12 seconds<br />
Damage: 185<br />
Effect:  [Decrease max hit 10%] [Decrease to-hit 10%] [Decrease AC 15%]<br />
Resist:  Disease<br />
Resist Adjust: -75<br />
<br />
Give us some real creativity with these spells.   Our heyokam (my imagined plurality of heyokah) have seen the increase in variety and capability of mob spells and surely would have learned something by now.  <br />
<br />
About stat buffs, if we can over-cap stats like STR and STA, and the stats are indeed useful like Ryan says, then fine.  Make a single-target and Group/MGBable buff to replace all stat buffs of all levels from all classes that buffs +110 to all stats (STA/STR/DEX/AGI), to include going over the cap.  <br />
<br />
Advantage of the Nihil<br />
Class:  Beneficial buff<br />
Duration:  1h 48m<br />
Effect:  +110 AGI<br />
           +110 DEX<br />
           +110 STR<br />
           +110 STA<br />
           +110 CHA<br />
Stacking:  Occupies same slot as regular stat buffs; stacks with Focus like Diaku<br />
Notes:  Buffs +110 regardless of stat cap.<br />
<br />
Don't make any funky stacking issues either.  That would be unnecessary punishment for having what is otherwise a logical spell.  Keep this buff seperate from the Talisman of Obkin-type spells.  Remove the stat buff from that variety past 65 and replace them with damage mitigation, increased to-hit, and maybe some very minor strikethrough/cleave action.<br />
<br />
If you're going to simultaneously increase the number of buff slots by five (through expensive AA) and make stat buffs useful again, keeping all stat buffs seperate spells would come to a big zero on the change meter.  In other words, if we have four or five new stat buff spells that we wouldn't have casted on tanks before (STA/STR/DEX/AGI/CHA), those buffs will take up their five new buff slots.  What's the point?  We get the same effectiveness out of the current situation in that case.<br />
<br />
Yes, STR and STA still have an impact on character performance (and DEX and AGI of course), but the return on buff real estate for these buffs is minimal, at best.  The game is mudflated beyond any reasonable expectations; with that in mind, marginal improvements on performance (anything less than, say 15% increase in DPS or mitigation) are not worth the slot players would rather keep open for DOTs and whatnot to land during raids/LDONs/sewer crawls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rytan,<br />
<br />
This is what the spells used to be And a shamans role in useing those spells.  Please Note this post is From Gloriana On 4 15 2002 And is in her words. Old Post about Shaman and such (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=820&amp;mode=linear&amp;perpage=40&amp;pagenumber=1) <br />
<br />
Hey Israi, you ever seen what a mage with Mod Rod 2 and a shaman with torpor can do? Non-stop mana making machine.<br />
<br />
I hear what you are saying about the stacking issues, but it's pretty obvious to me you don't have a lot of first hand experience with the high end raiding game.<br />
<br />
Yes, one shaman to malo, but no, not one shaman to slow. If you're fighting a big mob, all that matters is getting it slowed (if applicable), in my guild, all the shaman attempt slow until one lands. What if the &quot;slowing&quot; shaman dies? What happens then in your scenario? <br />
<br />
Lemme describe my most recent big fight, Lady N in NTOV (shush you uber people that don't think this fight is a big deal).<br />
<br />
Lady N. is an enchanter she is rooted to the floor and the casters are able to use a wall to escape her AOE, which is a stun/spin dealie. She also slows melees (since she is a chanter) and casts AOE tash! Weeeee! She has buckets of hitpoints, but can be slowed.<br />
<br />
We had four shaman present during this fight. Okay, in our nifty guildshaman:shaman channel, we decided what we our roles were. One shaman to malo, the rest of us would slow (being careful to note the time since a reslow would be necessary). Pre-fight, the bards/chanters seived her as much as possible.<br />
<br />
Fight starts!<br />
<br />
Main tank runs out, clerics begin their CH rotation safely behind their wall. Two casters spam annul to remove her damage shield and wonderous rapidity, malo hits, tash hits, bard song hits, mob slowed!!!!!<br />
<br />
Wait, I just got a tell from the main tank! He is slowed (curable by whom? SHAMAN! He also has been tashed (curable by lots of people, even pallies!) I run back behind my wall and begin a combination of spam curing the main tank and torporing the mage in my group for the manufacturer of tons of mod rods which the clerics will need desperately to maintain mana for the 10+ minute fight.<br />
<br />
Wait a sec, the clerics are concentrating on CHing the main tank, what about all those other melee out there getting pummelled? When they get around half health, they run back around the wall to the casters and ask for heals. My job is to torpor my melees since it's an incredibly efficient heal. Other shaman are doing the same, and druids are doing their part as well. And yes, we have a small rebuff station for anyone that happens to die and need it.<br />
<br />
A shaman notices that 4 minutes has passed, time for a reslow! Out we go to make it happen and BAM mob is reslowed, the guild actually CHEERS the shaman! <br />
<br />
Uh oh, we get an AOE wurm repop! You'd think this is bad news, but not for my guild who have plenty of back up healers, we kill that add as quickly as we can.<br />
<br />
Lady N is nearly dead! The clerics are pleading for mana, but luckily there are tons of mod rods and shaman to heal them as they mod rod down. I'm also throwing some chloros on the casters who are also mod rodding down for just that last little oomph to finish the dragon.<br />
<br />
Dragon dies, and this is what one of the our warriors posted on our guild board about the fight, &quot;Hat off to the healers and esp Glori who torpored me god knows how many times as i was offtanking that Wurm&quot;<br />
<br />
So, was I useless during that fight, were the other shaman useless, hell no! I love that fight, every person did their part, every person was important and it was 10 minutes of edge-of-your-seat excitement (yes, I'm a geek).<br />
<br />
So, what did I do during that raid?<br />
<br />
* Slowed dragon once<br />
* Cast torpor a bazillion times - kept clerics, mages and tanks alive<br />
* Cast chloro a bazillion times - on main tank whenever I could, on casters, on people that came up and needed heals<br />
* Cast disenfecting aura on the main tank to make sure he was untashed and unslowed<br />
* Cast at least 3 focuses on newly rezzed people<br />
* Malo/slow on add, kept offtank melee alive (WITH torpor)<br />
* NO ONE IN MY GROUP DIED<br />
<br />
I'm sure some of the other shaman here could post even better stories where they felt valued and important on raids, why else would we keep playing?<br />
<br />

<br />
Look at her spell useage and what she did with them. She kept entire groups alive with Torpor and chloroblast. With our heals now this is not possible in current encounters. She slowed Effectivly In part because Figth times were so long in duration. Cleared Debuffs. All while moving and dodgeing AE and had an obvious ball doing it. In a raid no less.<br />
<br />
Now look at what a shaman does in a group. <br />
<br />
Casts focus. (Which in the upper level game can easily be replaced by a beastlord.) Or a Right clickable item spell of Sheild of Mailin.<br />
<br />
Casts Avatar. While people are stat capped. 140 strength does Zero. Dex and agility too. And if the new spells come to pass and people get Over the cap will we have your promise that when we parse it there will be a drastic and meaningful increase. Or will we need a parse program and a degree in comparative methodology to determine the result. <br />
<br />
Maybe cures a curse Maybe not. But dont paladins do this better now?<br />
Or Bard in a group who is providing Overhaste spell focus and lord knows what else. <br />
<br />
We want buffs that make the meeles Drool. That make them want to click off other buffs to get them. <br />
<br />
We want to keep our groups alive. Cleric or no cleric. <br />
We want to be able to have an impact on the fight as a whole. In a group in a raid  Or hell standing in PoK hawking spells for a little cash. <br />
We want people to be glad to have a shaman. Because we bring alot of useful skills to the table. <br />
<br />
Spells are our tools to accomplish this. And at this moment Before OoW is out We want these things to be fixed so that they are possible again. The above things are not possible in the harder PoP areas. And the hard LDON for Non raiders. We want them possible again. Then if our spells are fixed and working properly and Everyone else gets a 20% increase. then we will only be midly disappointed in a rote 20% increase on the fixed Spells!<br />
<br />
The major way to accomplish this. Is by things already rehashed. <br />
<br />
Noticable combat effects on our buffs. Strikethrough. Direct mitagation. Additions to the Main hand damage bonus. Meaningful effects. That when someone sees the info on it they go WoAH! I do not want to click this off. <br />
<br />
It is by making a heal with the ability to keep someone alive when slow has been resisted. Because slow is resisted. And once into the Tnarq's Chain we dont get to slow again. (Again Gates and upper level PoP/ LDON content AS in 65th level content not just raiders can do hard missions don't you know)<br />
<br />
It is by making us do appreciable damage while knowing our primary focus is keeping people alive through the useage of debuffs and buffs and heals.<br />
<br />
(Please read the above line again. Pretty please.) We have to do three things to try and keep people alive. Lots of time all at once. Or people die. And when they die. We can't res them. So we dont go many non trivial places as a main healer unless there is a necro (Fat chance they will spend money to res unless it is a friend) A paladin. or a cleric. in the group with us. And if there is a cleric then we don't ahve to heal. So we are then lacking in the damage department and feelign less than useful.<br />

Since we can't cast two spells at once. I highly reccomend cutting the cast time of some of our spells or Making Dots much more able to be used in a fight or Letting us meele much better or Giving Mutt some duel weild abilty and large nasty teeth and enough of an attatude to be considered a wolf and not a toy poodle. Give us two of those. And we will be intrested. give us three and we will be estatic. <br />
<br />
The reason for this is if a cleric isnt there we should be able to keep everyone alive. and if The cleric is there then we should be able to fill in for a Damage role of some sort. Through layering of effects. ( Short term buffs on meele that drasticly improve damage output, Damage of our own and damage of our Mutt.) If a cleric is in the group then a beastlord covers all three better than us. <br />
<br />
As for an argument on why we should have non stat buffs. Log into the game please. And ask any Level 65 meele. Would you like Focus of soul, Ferine Avatar (544 hps 75 str and 70 dex) and a 50% haste (Explaining that The focus will drop in an hour and 20 minutes Ferine in 9 minutes, and the haste in what 40 minutes?) Or Chanters 65 group spell Speed of Vallon. (68 % haste 41 attack Agil +52 Dex +33 That lasts for an hour and 4 minutes. Nights dark terror  (Adds a lifetap strike 45 attack and 120 Dex for 18 minutes) For a total of 86 attck 52 agility and 155 dex. Plus the enchanter can c3 your group for what almost 4 hours with 14 points  tick mana regen. <br />
<br />
I bet the awnser will be 4 out of 5 Give me the chanter buffs. For a meele to awnser this is just wrong. Considering we are supposed to be the king of buffs. <br />
<br />
Please reconsider your awnser that stat buffs are significant. Because at the end of the day for the level 65 crowd while nice. They really dont do much.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fix DoT aggro, especially with poison, especially with crits. Yes, DoT crits DO generate more aggro, a lot more. Give us more DoT along the lines of Bane but for more damage, heck I don't even care about the mana cost, we just need to do more damage faster with less aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would say this .. Im not a &quot;Parcer&quot; guy ... I guess i dont have hard facts or anything ... but here are my feelings . Im trying too kep with the positive nature of this thred .<br />
I want my heals too actualy be noticeable again ... I used too be able too HoT the tank in a group while a mob was beating on him and I could SEE a diffrence in how fast his life bar was droping .. now I cant . I used too have enough direct healing power that if the cleric went LD mid fight .. I could spam my bigest heal and keep the tank alive .. sure I couldnt keep up the job over but just one mob maybe BUT in a crunch I could Main heal for a short stint .<br />
I want too be noteable as the &quot;Best&quot; slower again ... I want a tank too be able too say .. &quot;Beastlord , let the shaman slow please .. I can tell a diffrence in his slow over yours .&quot; <br />
I want my buffs too be WANTED again .. I want the melee guys too drool for my buffs like the casters drool for KEI ..<br />
<br />
In short I want too be as usefull as we used too be ... back when we were balanced .<br />
<br />
Thank you for listening ... sorry there arent any numbers or hard data . im not much of a number cruncher .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>woonie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rytan,<br />
<br />
Everyone above me has posted very important concerns.  I would like to add something.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to reduce the amount of aggro that our DoT's cause?  I know that, currently, it is most dangerous for me to try to stack DoT's.  I will pull aggro. I understand that it is a balance issue that we get aggro, so I am not asking that aggro be removed, but I do find it somewhat frustrating that I have issues with DoT stacking and pulling aggro while I know other classes (ie necros) do so without as much of a chance of pulling aggro.  Necros can fake dead and wipe their aggro.  We as shamans can't.  Between casting malos/slow/cripple and trying to use DoTs on raid mobs, the aggro generated is enormous.  If we then attempt to spot heal, the aggro is even larger.  The reduced aggro would greatly help to improve our DPS and would help us to become more of an asset on raids and in groups.<br />
<br />
My guild is not into GoD yet or Time yet, so I have not experienced the issues that are expressed all over this board regarding short fights, slows, heals, and our pathetic nukes.  I do know that I do not use velium strike at all.  It takes too long to cast, takes too much mana, and I can cast Spear of Torment around twice as fast and do more damage. I see shaman as the jack of all trades and masters of none.  I don't need to nuke a mob for 3k every 3 seconds.  I would however like to see shamans get a more efficient direct damage spell for those times and encounters where the fight will be too short for DoT's.<br />
<br />
I also wanted to thank you for being willing to listen to what we have to say and to our suggestions.  Although, it may be irritating, I would like to encourage you to read though the posts on this board, even though many are extremely negative.  There is frustration there, but there are also many many good suggestions and by reading the threads, you may get a sense of what exactly we are looking for and why so many are so frustrated.  The majority of people who post here are people who play or have played and obviously care enough to take the time to look into their class.  They have good ideas and speak from experience.<br />
<br />
Thank you again!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As far as I'm concerned, you can fix us by giving us only three new spells:<br />
<br />
A lure slow...a REAL one.  At least -60, but a -100 lure component would be ideal.  Give it a duration of 30 seconds, a recast of 30 seconds, and an effectiveness of 50% if you want, it's only there to slow a mob that's going to die in the next 20 seconds anyway.  This gives shaman a &quot;Beastlord slow,&quot; fast casting and moderate effect, which gives us time to move on to the next spell.<br />
<br />
A direct &quot;blast heal&quot; with a base of at least 2100.  With focus effects and AAs, this gives us a decent burst heal and allows us to do our jobs as backup healers.<br />
<br />
A DoT that does a PERCENTAGE of the mob's current HP in damage.  Not a base amount, like 500 or 600, but a DoT that deals out a scaled amount of damage based on the mob's current HP per tick, lasts 3 ticks, but decays each tick until it ends:  20% tick 1, 10% tick 2, 5% tick 3.  If a mob has 10000 hp, then the DoT's first tick does 2000.  If it has 100hp, it does 20.  Obviously this spell will scale in effectiveness based on the mob's current HP total...the less it has, the less it does.  Most fights will end before the spell does 3 ticks anyway.  This allows the shaman to dish out some respectable DPS with a single spell, because a shaman can't chain cast damage spells if he wants to canni mana back.  It allows the shaman to continue using DoT spells as they were meant to, but use one that can hit HARD and hit FAST against mobs that die in 20 seconds, especially if the shaman can get it off when the mob has as close to full HP as possible.<br />
<br />
To prevent this particular spell from overwhelming raid mobs and mobs that are supposed to be tough, set this spell so any mob that mitigates slow mitigates the percentage of hp damage the spell does by the same amount, EXCEPT mobs who mitigate &quot;slightly.&quot;  Also set it so it does not stack with another shaman who casts the same spell, and the debuff icon it places on the mob lasts for TEN ticks, not 3, to prevent chain casting the spell on a mob.<br />
<br />
Also, to be fair, give this spell the same aggro as our other DoT spells generate, like Bane and Blood of Saryrn, and make it cost some mana.<br />
<br />
Give us those three spells, and in my opinion, shamans will be perfectly balanced in the new fast-paced world which is EverQuest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everyone in this board posted many suggestions and new idea on how to improve and fix Shaman class. I think its not easy for Ryan to pick and decide which one works and which one is the most wanted.<br />
<br />
I think its time for him to really study and learn the class himself.<br />
<br />
I suggest Ryan make a level 65 shaman and do the following:<br />
<br />
Join guild raids as the third shaman.<br />
<br />
Join raid/grind groups in GoD. <br />
<br />
And tell us what he found.<br />
<br />
And if he really work hard on this, then he should study and compare the different of the shaman role in the old content and the new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mixelplux</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I am going to address individual spells that I hope will highlight certain issues one post at a time as my time permits.<br />
<br />
I am going to start out with Direct Damage spells, why I feel shamans are getting the short end of the stick both with personal reasoning and numbers. I am going to use 3 sets of numbers, level 50 cap, level 65 cap and level 70 cap (past, present, future). I left out level 60 cap because it would just add more numbers without any real benefit.<br />
<br />
I sincerely hope I didn't mess up my numbers :P<br />

&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Shamans have gotten the least increases in both efficiency and damage of their nukes with the exception of the potential OoW spell for druids, which is slightly worse damage increase compared to their lower level spell than ours.<br />
<br />
This little chart shows so much, it's hard to address everything. All I can say is that except for very comparisons, shamans by far have been getting less than other classes in the nuking department. Considering that Direct Damage spells aren't the forte of any of the priest classes (all bring other things to the table), increases and efficiency should have stayed relatively similar, but they haven't. <br />
With the recent posts by Ryan about keeping relative % of power in spell lines from one class to another (100/65/47 or whatever it was), it makes me wonder if that applies to all spell lines.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is:<br />
<br />
Velium Strike - Damage 1205 mana 392 - keep casting time<br />
Ice Age - Damage 1570 mana 490 - keep casting time<br />
<br />
This would bring is very close to what clerics have while leaving druids relatively far ahead still. Also, this is more in line to how things used to be before the trend of giving shamans less started. It addresses 1 problem of very weak dps (worst out of all casting classes and almost in line with hybrids) which would give us a leg up in current fast paced environments. It's ONE change in the right direction of helping us be productive in groups again.<br />

I also agree with him playing a shaman but I wouldn't start at 65, but 50. Most of our larger problems are at 65+ but our healing in the 50's wasn't very indicative of us being a priest class. And if he starts out as a  65 Shaman what is to seperate him from any other E-Bayed type character.</div></div><hr />

Might be a hell of a nice guy but I'm guessing he can't see the forest from the trees or something because his post was fairly clueless. That's not a flame on him as a person or a flame at all, I just think he probably is overworked, underpaid, and might be too deep in the code to take 2 hours out of his schedule to take a time-geared shammy to the &quot;nerfed&quot; Ikkinz single-group content.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs are useless, I don't care that 75 STR gives a noticable increase in DPS.  Everyone and their grandmother on my server has all their stats capped from GEAR.  It's been that way for over 12 months, play the game lately? I haven't been asked for a STA even for about 8 months.  <br />
<br />
FA is useless.  Single-target that moves a rangers ATTK from 2300 to 2400 won't do jack.<br />
<br />
Slow is useless.  Trash mobs on raids die basically instantly, and most of the &quot;real bosses&quot; in EQ are unslowable anyhow.  Beastlords and chanters both offer insane dps and great mana regen to the group, making their &quot;real&quot; priests even more powerful.   Let me charm a pooka and give me SD please, you can take 10% off my slow in trade kkthxu. <br />
<br />
Shammy DoT's of every kind are useless.  No lures so they usually don't even land.  When do they land, they last 3 ticks before the mob is dead.  Oh and usually I'll get summoned and blasted on the 2nd tick. <br />
<br />
Shammy heals are nearly useless.   When one of only 3 priest classes' BIGGEST crits can only heal 30% of the tanks hp something is out of whack, no?   When one of only 3 priest classes cannot be good enough as a 2ndary healer in single-group content in GoD, something is out of whack, no?   <br />
<br />
More shammies are quitting everyday, perhaps you can get a parse of that.  If we don't get an upgrade within the month I guarantee you I'll be one of them.  I'm WAY to jaded to think a threat would even be paid attention to by the developers of this eroding game, that is just a fact old friends.<br />
<br />
The only thing we're good for these days is group cures. I'd imagine clerics will get those soon, they are in dire need of an upgrade!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ryan,<br />
<br />
If you're really open to suggestions, then please read what we're saying here.<br />
<br />
Stats MAY have an effect on effectiveness. But in studies of everything from max hits, to mitigation, all the way down to tradeskill increases, the Random Number Generator seems to be the defining thing. Any effect you get out of buffs is truely diminishing returns - As you pass a certain point in stats, they do increasingly less, and as you get higher in level, what they DO do is increasingly marginal. Persumably this is a vestige of &quot;The Vision&quot; days when noticable bonuses from stat buffs WOULD have been overpowering, especially since back then, only one class really got any.<br />
<br />
Some of us posting have been playing since release (I'm not one of 'em, I'm a Kunark baby). Every shaman from them onward has commented on the lack of impact that stat buffs give. No offense to you, but I don't believe the whole group of us would be claiming that stats are useless this whole time, if they were actually useful. It's like the old arguments of whether low charisma helps Fear.<br />
<br />
Now, since revising the stats system would be such a monumental task that it's completely out of scope for EQ Live, we would need an alternative. The OoW percentage system is good, and with a little tweaking could be applied to lower level buffs as well, via skill mods for combat and casting skills.<br />
<br />
Regarding mana regeneration<br />
<br />
I truely cannot understand why you're hard against a passive mana regeneration spell for Shaman. I hate to compare us to other classes, but the only other casting classes without at least a self-only mana regen spell are both high-voltage nukers, who would present problems with a steady mana stream. And, needless to say, Shaman are not nukers.<br />
<br />
Give us a lich spell with the same HP to mana ratio as Canni 4 and a one-hour duration. Heck, give it an initial mana cost (say, 250 mana, tops). Or, what the hell, make it a basic class AA (level 59+) if you're REALLY against Shaman having a spell like that.<br />
<br />
If Shaman HAVE to click for mana, then would you reduce cast times on our other spells by at least a third? Or perhaps cut mana costs a bit so that we don't have to constantly cannibalize in the first place? it's a self-perpetuating process, we have cannibalize because our spells cost so much, because we have cannibalize.<br />
<br />
Now, on the issue of Shaman damage,<br />
<br />
I want to do as much damage as a cleric, at the very least. No, I'm not joking. There isn't a single reason why clerics and druids should BOTH out-heal and out-damage Shaman. I don't care if it's fast-casting low-resist nukes, big meaty DoTs with short durations, or vastly revamped melee abilities, I want to see some damage coming from my toon when I DO have time to go &quot;damage mode&quot; in a group.<br />
<br />
You know what? I'd actually be happy with being able to buff up my groupmates' damage output, to the point where it's like we have a cleric along nuking and meleeing with us. Damage mods, higher spell crit rates, proc buffs, maybe even some hefty mob mitigation debuffing (Combine the new cripple in with the Malo line, and watch the Shaman start to drool a little)<br />
<br />
And finally, healing and slowing.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm putting these two together. Why? because Shaman are being penalized in healing for having Slow. I've said it once and I'll say it again, Slow spells are an albatross hanging on our class' neck! <br />
<br />
Ryan, I'm sure you've read it elsewhere, but if I may reiterate, slow is a luxury these days. it's nice to have, but groups do just fine with other classes cranking out worse slows, or even without a slower in the group at all. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, heals and damage are absolutely nessecary, even WITH our &quot;best&quot; slow heading the way. <br />
<br />
The time has come where you can no longer compare slows to heals in terms of damage prevented. Fights are too fast, heals are too good, and slows are mitigated right and left. It's still a heavy hitter in the lower part of the game, but NOBODY stays at that point forever.<br />
<br />
You know what? I'd be perfectly willing to sacrifice Slow. If cutting Turgurs down to 70% would give us KEI, charm, mezz, lull, haste, and aggro tweakers, I would be willing to lose that 5%. If knocking it down to 65% gives us big melee capabilities, better HP buffs, a dangerous pet, passive mana / HP regeneration, long-lasting ATK buffs, and faster cast times, I would be willing to lose 10% from Turgur's.<br />
<br />
Shaman need to stop being penalized for having a marginalized ability. Clerics, for the longest time, were penalized for Complete Healing, now look at them. Druids, likewise, got the shaft for having ports and good nukes, now look at them. Now it's the Shaman's turn, our slows are simply obsolete in modern content and we have no backup plan, because we were crippled in every category for having slow.<br />
<br />
For real, man, spoil us a little here. We're hurting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Balance of the Nihil is still inadequate.  It needs at the minimum a -55 resist adjust (akin to Malos), preferably higher though, like -70 (akin to Malosinia).  This is not an unreasonable request.  Our main purpose is to slow mobs.  We didn't get an upgrade to the one spell that we cast on basically every mob we encounter for YEARS.<br />
<br />
This was fine for years, because in most circumstances, mobs weren't that hard or that deadly that slow was a super significant benefit.  And they also survived longer, allowing us more time to slow.  But also what happened is the other slowing classes gained slowing power, thus marginalizing the Shamans unique ability.<br />
<br />
Mitigation furthur reduces the Shaman advantage.  Often in my pickup groups I hear &quot;Do we have a slower?&quot; not &quot;Do we have a Shaman?&quot;  Also just to illustrate my point, I never hear &quot;Do we have a dotter?&quot; or &quot;Do we have an inadequate nuker/healer?&quot;<br />
<br />
Changing the resist adjust to -70 will have a two-fold benefit.  It will guarantee a slow.  Which then puts us into the REVERSE HEALER role.  We become better healers because we can more reliably prevent damage.  A bigger blast heal with a heftier mana cost, and a more powerful heal over time = the perfect compliment to a reverse healer.  Also, we can reliably do damage if we don't have to heal.  Which brings me to the next point.<br />
<br />
DPS.<br />
<br />
Our cold nukes are much too long casting.  When I want to get in a nuke, I have to time it pretty well with a nearly 8.0 second cast time.  Faster cast time, longer recast time...seems like the obvious fix.  Damage of our cold nukes is somewhat acceptable to me, if I can cast them faster.  Oh, resist adjusts are nice to have (hint hint).<br />
<br />
Poison nukes.  Faster casting, lower damage.  Bad idea.  Why?  Because there is no Poison Nuke DD focus.  This is quite an oversight.  And to put a Poison Nuke Mana Preservation focus on our Ornate and Elemental gloves.  Please address this.<br />
<br />
DoTs.<br />
<br />
Once again we see a 2+ minute disease dot.  Unless you're gonna have plenty of mobs that last for 2+ minutes, you should just go ahead and get rid of that one right now.<br />
<br />
Bane line of DoTs:  A big gripe.  Huge recast time, NO RESIST ADJUST?  This line BADLY needs a resist adjust, along the lines of -100.  On top of Shamans hurting for spell gem space, I usually am doing zero dps if Bane is resisted.  By the time it refreshes, the mob is mostly dead....<br />
<br />
DoT crits: Needs to happen more often.  We spent a lot of aa's for this.<br />
<br />
DoT aggro: Needs to be lessened a whole heck of a lot.  And yes, crit dots do get you summoned.<br />
<br />
Buffs:<br />
<br />
Hastes.  Swift Like the Wind needs to last longer or Talisman of Alacrity needs to be 60%.  Our pet buff from Velious (Spirit Quickening) needs to be looked at, ie. make it last a longer, up haste, up atk/str/dex.<br />
<br />
Avatar line. Please for the love of god, please take away the recast time and up the duration.  You guys don't seem to mind letting rangers buff groups with 130atk +hp...I don't see where this gets to be overpowering.  But it sure is annoying when people want Ferine Avatar.  If you don't believe me, play a Shaman in a group and try to keep a 5-person FA rotation going.  Do it for ONE NORMAL LDON ADVENTURE.  Then see if you don't agree with me.<br />
<br />
Mana Regen:  The GoD Canni is the only spell I was looking forward to.  Thanks for making it so I'll probably never see it.  :p  That spell is beautifully well done, and perfectly addresses the problem with being a Shaman (who actually uses their mana....).  Now if I could just scribe it.  :(<br />
<br />
You change all Canni's to be like that, and you'll make a lot of Shamans happy.  Coding it so we can't cast them sequentially...c'mon.  You can put that in later.  It wouldn't be that big of a benefit because we lack spell gem space.  After a res though..hehe.  Anyways, this should be a top priority.<br />
<br />
Stat buffs:  Noone cares about them, they're minimally useful today.  Fix Avatar and you don't need to worry about stat buffs.  We're more interested in spells that actually do something.  +Accuracy, +Avoidance, stuff like that.  Perhaps one thing to look at is if you have over 305dex, you get a % of +Accuracy, that is if you really wanted to continue stat buffs.<br />
<br />
Thanks for listening~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Darjeelingx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Nice post Uggok!<br />
<br />
I'd like to add one point. You said:<br />
<br />
As I said at the beginning, the game you guys have made has three important roles in it:<br />
<br />
1-Tanking<br />
2-Fast damage dealing<br />
3-Fast healing.<br />
<br />
To make us viable in this new game you have made, you must make us much better at 2, 3 or both. The game that the shaman class was designed for is gone, and it isn't ever coming back. Make us worthwhile in the new game.<br />
<br />
I'd add Fast Damage Mitigation to the important roles. As you point out other classes can do our primary job of slowing well enough for shaman to be not needed. And if a mob is dying in 30 secs, and it takes 10-12 secs to debuff and slow, then we're largely irrelevant. Even with a bigger heal, clerics will still be better at it. <br />
<br />
If we had new faster debuffs or faster buffs to do this job, i think we'd be back on the viable list.<br />
<br />
My preferred method is faster and more potent buffs, because debuffs are less reliable. Your tank is unlikely to resist a buff whereas a mob may resist cripple version 3.1. So, you can guarantee your effect with buff, whereas a debuff you can't.<br />
<br />
My suggestion in another thread was a few defensive and offensive type of buffs along the lines of the lvl 14 Burst of Strength spell. A set percentage boost to mitigation or criticals in the 60ish lvl range then both at 65 for 30 secs to a minute. <br />
<br />
I know people complain about short lasting buffs, but having been casting cannibalize every minute for 4 years in EQ i think i can safely say i'm adept at button pressing. These buffs would also have the advantage of boosting knight appeal as tanks for hard grinds.<br />
<br />
Maybe my buff idea is not the best solution, but i'm trying to think of something new.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Healing:<br />
<br />
PoP<br />
Nature's Infusion 1750 -lvl 63<br />
Tnarg's Mending  1300 -lvl 62<br />
<br />
GoD<br />
Sylvan Infusion 2100   -lvl 65 / +350, +20%<br />
Daluda's Mending 1550 -lvl 65 / +250, +19.2%<br />
<br />
OoW<br />
Omen-Druid-Heal 2275     -lvl 68 +175, +8.3%<br />
Omen-Shaman-Heal 1690 -lvl 67 +140, +9%<br />
<br />
If you look at those increases % wise, it appears like a reasonable upgrade.  While %s are fine and dandy and makes everything look nice in charts, we are falling slightly behind in healing power vs the druid in every expansion.  In PoP, we healed for 450 less than a druid.  In GoD, 550 less.  In OoW, 585.<br />
<br />
What they should've done is increase our healing power by the same amount of hits points healed as the druids; not % increases.  If their heal did 350 in GoD, ours should do 350 more also.  If theirs got upgraded and did 175 more for OoW, ours should do 175 more also.<br />
If this solution were applied, our GoD heal should do 1650 and 1825 for OoW.  This is the most fair solution.  I know this will not bring us to the 2000 mark some of you want, but this is the most reasonable request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tickmunki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ok, here is my wish list. I know have ranted and raved on this board, however l have taken my &quot;happy or chill pill&quot; and would like make a post. If I this post dont last long,oh well lesson learned. Need to go back to college more. <br />
<br />
1) Make are healls more effective in a group or what ever setting the shaman is to use his or her's heals. <br />
 1a) Druids, and Clerics are Number one and two in healage, thats fine l can live with that, But why cant we have a better Single targe heal that does enough if not the same as the Number 2 guy. <br />
  1b) Raise are base heals to the point that it would            make all my healing aa worth getting. <br />
2)This is my biggest issuse. Spell casting time. <br />
  2a) In the every chancing worlds of Everquest, most fights in or what ever setting you are in, don't last long. I have a 65 wizard, l can compare and constast the Just the nukes alone. <br />
  2b) My wizard is the king of Direct Damage, it is there job, too be the king of Direct Damage in what ever group setting Wizards get into. Shaman are again are Number 3 in this department. If we cant get a increase in damage at least give us a Spell haste AA that way, it cuts down and goes with the faster fights that are out there. It not like we evergoing to nuke like a Wizard but casting time should be cut down just a bit more for the fast paced &quot;way of Killing today&quot; <br />
<br />
3) Stat buffs are a joke today, in what ever setting you are in the stat bufffs are just plain useless to cast. <br />
 3a) I do like the idea of making us the king of this department, however just go a little farther and make us the only ones or the best ones to GO over any limit the target being casting on has. I do like that AA Idea of this that Ryan has said in another posts, I like it. Just dont make it so costly that it would be months or years before l could get it. <br />
<br />
Just my hubble top 3 things that bugg me, l hope l was claar and gave some facts and helpfull pointers, if not l learned. Thank you Gloriana for this thread. Have a good time play Everquest and enjoy the game for what ever you do in game just have fun, its a game have fun with it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bluudson_MT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I just wanted to post on this thread.<br />
<br />
I stopped paying my shammy although still love the class.<br />
<br />
He is 65 with over 500 AA before  LDoN came out.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe that the trials in PoJ were the first place timed and high dps had to be a consideration.  This was the turning point where shaman were not one of the desired classes for the trials.<br />
<br />
The result -------------&gt;  I  call it, &quot; The Brute Force Group &quot;.<br />
This idea was born to do maximum dps in short time frame.  No slows required, just healing.  Shaman at this point were only asked for FoS prior to the trial.  This group still is one the LDoN type groups and is fairly efficient for normal LDoN.  <br />
<br />
1.    Eliminate the inefficiency of the shaman spells for damage and give them fast damage spells. To be able to add dps.  If we can't slow it, let us nuke.  Shaman dots are almost always resisted.  If you give us dots, make them last less then 5 sec do, high damage, less then a second cast times and no debuff's required.<br />
<br />
2.  Shaman had charm before druids.  Why didn't shaman get the ability to have AA for charm.  In beta of EQ, shaman had charm and it was taken away from our class and only the enchanters were allowed to have it.  This is not true any longer.  Mages charm, Druids charm, Necroes charm..... why leave shaman out of being able to charm.  Enchanters are not the only ones now.<br />
<br />
3. Healing spells are not big enough and are way to slow casting.  Quiesance is nice,  but doesn't match the cleric heal over time and is covered by the lowest cleric HoT.  Why didn't shaman get the best heal over time?  We had it first as torpor.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">These are my concers on the issues with the shaman class, i'm playing a shaman in a Guild that just entered time.<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
<br />
I think we still need some more power to our blast heals, i feel that i can't function reliably as a patch/backup healer in kt+ content. I don't want to be able to replace a cleric, i just want to be able to function as a patch healer for kt names/ikkinz trials.<br />
More patch healingpower on raid would be usefull but not that important, i feel i can do my job here.<br />
<br />
What i do feel we lack is a reliable way to keep group alive during boss fights on a raid due to us not having a group heal.  As you said yourself the HoTs need some attention, well give us a group version of our hots.<br />
We all know Hots can keep up with direct melee dmg, but they can help a great deal on AoE dmg.  Giving us a group version of our HoT will make us good group healers on aoe fights (make it mgb'able is a plus) and make us a little bit more stackable on raids.<br />
If you like to beef up the HoT group heal, add in a cure xxx counter each tic :D .<br />
<br />
Slowing<br />
<br />
Nihil was a big step in the right direction, but like some said adding a bit more to the resist modifier wouldn't hurt.<br />
Make less mobs mitigate slow, espessialy bosses! There was nothing more fun then calling UberbossXXX Slowed in raid chat, knowing you made a difference in taking it down, knowing you just made an encounter winnable. Slowing trash on raids is cumbersome now, and the effect is minimal due to mobs dying in 15secs. (ok i still like seeing my name in the hott box, knowing that i was faster then our knights)<br />
<br />
Slowing in groups is ok, but again make a named like PAnnihilator in ikkinz trial slowable... You penalize our heals due to us having slow, but on those encounters we really have to use our healing power (as backup to a cleric) you take away the advantage we had over other priests :( and we are reduced to a crippled healer.<br />
<br />
Debuffs<br />
<br />
Our resist debuffs are ok, maybe tweak casting time a bit to be inline with the faster fights, but other then that i find em ok.<br />
An Aoe version of malos may be a bit too much to ask i guess  :rolleyes: ..., but man there are so many situation i would have killed for that.<br />
<br />
Cripple line is useless, and has the potential to be really powerfull and add that 'Wow' effect back into the shaman class.<br />
You could replace cripple with a whole new range of spells debuffing mob melee dmg.<br />
Accuracy Cripple, Max dmg reducting cripple, reduce dual wield skill Cripple, etc etc <br />
These spells wouldn't aid us much soloing, but would make us wanted and stackable on raids.<br />
<br />
Buffs<br />
<br />
No more stat buffs please.<br />
The buffs with the %focus effects are the right way to go, add those. (ie striketrue,accuracy,%dmg mod)<br />
<br />
Overall dmg potential<br />
<br />
Mobs die too fast for us to do a lot of dmg. No use in adding more slow disease based dots unless they do more then just dmg a small ammount of hp, let em act as debuffs that scale down in power the longer the fights lasts (ie tic1 60% slow, tic2 50%slow, ...)<br />
Bane is about right in dmg/duration, but remove the recast time or add resist modifier please.<br />
As mentioned the aggro of dots is way off, the crits applify this even more.<br />
Our nukes could use some attention, lower casttime would work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">My first concern is that we are becoming increasingly worthless in groups that fight mitigating mobs with high dps  and low hp. If a mob dies too fast, mitigate slow and resist the slow is more or less worthless leaving us with DPS (wich is too slow) and Healing wich is sub par at best.<br />
<br />
If slowing is being punished then atleast give us something to contribute to our group, either DPS (nukes/rains/doggy) or healing (heavily improved fast heal and heal over time).<br />
<br />
My second concern is about us causal players ever getting a copy of good and class defining spells.<br />
<br />
Right now i should be happy if i meet someone who has heard about someone who has seen the new lure slow.<br />
<br />
Im not saying everything should be for causal players, but the lure slow is something that really sets slowing into a new perspective by removing much of the need for Malos (wich takes a long time of quick fights). Therefore i say: Let everyone get a copy of the lure-slow.<br />
<br />

So, what did I do during that raid?<br />
<br />
* Slowed dragon once<br />
* Cast torpor a bazillion times - kept clerics, mages and tanks alive<br />
* Cast chloro a bazillion times - on main tank whenever I could, on casters, on people that came up and needed heals<br />
* Cast disenfecting aura on the main tank to make sure he was untashed and unslowed<br />
* Cast at least 3 focuses on newly rezzed people<br />
* Malo/slow on add, kept offtank melee alive (WITH torpor)<br />
* NO ONE IN MY GROUP DIED<br />
<br />
I'm sure some of the other shaman here could post even better stories where they felt valued and important on raids, why else would we keep playing?<br />

Well... one time I was helping some youngsters to get medallions in PoT and the cleric died right off the bat. I had to chain heal the poor (youngster) tank and we managed to kill the named somehow.<br />
<br />
Talking about spells... I would not mind if we could crit out inComplete Heal. In that case I may even use that spell sometimes.<br />
If Sony don't want us to chain cast DD why dont we get a decent DD with a decent casting time but eventually with longer recast time.<br />
At least we could malos/slow and throw in a DD before the mob dies.<br />

------<br />
<br />
Shaman slow changes target ring and/or Mob Name color     To aid in multiple shaman stacking on raids.  Target ring would get a inversed color ring around the main part of the ring to indicate a shaman had slowed the mob.  Additionally one could code it so that the mob text would change color if a shaman slowed it (the text floating over the mobs head).   Only shaman slows would do this... you want to know its been slowed then get a shaman :)<br />
<br />
Remove short duration buffs or extend them<br />
    I think Gloriana posted this also... I can't stress how painful FA is to keep up when its the shortest duration attack buff and gives nothing like the DPS add that longer lasting buffs do... (i.e. haste or predator)<br />
<br />
Improve shaman DPS<br />
    One trick I thought of was to give us a DOT type buff that we can cast on our pet that would allow him to do the half the dps bane does per tic.  This  would allow us to provide the group with some DPS while we are malos+slowing the mob that only lasts 30 seconds..  I know this sounds a lot like a BST pet buff, but this is one of the reasons a bst brings so much more to a group than a shm.... while slowing, they can use their pet to provide group DPS.  It would need to be of similar duration to the BST pet buff to make it worth meming (given the number of spell slots we have)<br />
<br />
Improve shaman healing<br />
  Trying to think outside the box here.... how about a targeted HOT that will heal your target either full or by a set percentage  before moving on to the next lowest HP member in the group or raid.  This would be of similar nature to the &quot;chain lightning&quot; type spells the dev mentioned, not truly a group heal.  It would work its way through the group or raid topping their HP up.  Of course a group quiesence would be easier to code......  Regardless of HOT,  shaman need a better blast heal for GoD.<br />
<br />
Feral Bear  (a wannabe old-style rage buff)<br />
  This has to be one of the worst thought out AA skills i've seen..... I've got 500+ aa and no intention of ever getting this...  Not when I can toss out a partially resisted nuke once every 30 minutes and out damage what it can do....   Why not re-investigate that old-style rage line that would drain your mana to half while it was active but allow you to be a battle priest?  (i.e. melee and survive).  You could recast it right away on yourself but you'd be OOM after the 2nd cast....<br />
<br />
I'll think of more when it isn't so late... but on a closing note:  I've played a shaman since beta 2 and was in most the beta's since then.  I love my shaman but have never been so discouraged as I am now.  Even when I posted way back that the developers had screwed up SLOW agro and it took 100's of posts to get a dev to look at it.  That process took weeks and shaman were chain dying right and left.   Yet back then I was angry that they wouldn't listen to us.... (note: some shaman would post here saying they didn't notice any difference in slow agro)  More angry than discouraged.... now I'm just tired of fighting battles with developers who don't know their own product.<br />

Rytan's original post for consideration:<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was. I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future. <br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time. Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen. I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing. (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
-Ryan<br />
<br />
Let's see malo, turgur's, root, canni 4, Haste, Torpor, and two utility slots that get swapped out for buffs, debuffs, heals, regen. Where am I going to put a second canni spell? If I was going to memorize 2 cannis I would still have canni 3 in my spell sets. Yes the issue of how something can be abused must be looked at, because a good part of your job is preventing the abuse that is rampant in other games. But in this case I think it is going a bit over board.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Veril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The Game, Slow and Healing.  <br />
<br />
My contention is that shaman healing is badly out of balance.  Shaman are a priest class and should be able to function as such in a group or raid situation.  Below I will discuss this as regards to both grouping and raiding.  <br />
<br />
In Luclin and previous expensions, mobs hit for 100-200.  Groups needed a tank a healer, everything else was optional.  <br />
It was an advantage to have a slower in the group, because it meant that the healers mana (from whoever was doing the healing) was empowered so that the group could keep going and have no or drastically reduced downtime.  Downtime for the average group is determined by the mana of the groups healer, nothing else.  <br />
<br />
In the GoD expansion mobs hit for 600-1100.  Groups need a tank, a healer and a slower everything else is optional.  <br />
It is now REQUIRED to have a slower in the group.  Without a slower each individual fight will drain the healer of approximatly 50% mana chain casting their heal spells.  Downtime every other mob without slow. <br />
<br />
I believe that the developers balanced shaman healing against the slow, on the basis that as shaman have slow they can get by with weaker direct heals.  This balance though only works when a slower is an optional part of the group, when a slower is required this breaks down.  It breaks beause all groups have slowers, thus all priest healing is 'affected' by slow.  <br />
<br />
It breaks down further because in the case of a shaman, if you are the groups slower, they you simply cannot be the groups healer as well, you don't have the time to do both malos/slow and heal.  Even worse when slow is resisted then you have the invidious choice of spamming inadequate heals on the tank to try keep him alive (relying on crits) or accepting that the tank will probably die while you try to reslow and hope the rest of the group can stay alive.  <br />
<br />
It further breaks down as the heal was presumably balanced against a certain effectiveness of slow, but the different level of mitigation mean that this balance must be out of whack somewhere.  <br />
<br />
It further breaks down in the extreme case of when mobs are immune to slow.  Typically these are the toughest mobs in an area who have the highest DPS/attack/hp anyway of mobs around.  A heal balanced against the other levels of mitigation is so clearly not balanced when mitigation is absolute.  <br />
<br />
In Summary as regards groups:<br />
Group have slow as a required place that must be filled.  Blanacing only one of the three priest classes heals against slow must be fundamentally wrong.  I don't see how you could rationally argue against this point.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids:<br />
General trash mobs on GoD raids typically die so fast that it seems pointless to slow them, to reduce their damage output for 3 seconds of a 10 second fight seems a waste of mana (Malos on inc, click from Times Anthesis).  The trash mobs in PoP/Time it is worth slowing as they last long enough for that to feel effective.  <br />
<br />
Boss Mobs: Most boss mobs are immune or heavily mitigate slow.  <br />
<br />
With that as a basic feature we can see that the main function of a shaman on a raid cannot be deemed to be slowing, it should presumebly be healing, we are afterall a priest class and our main function is notionally healing.  <br />
<br />
Damage that is dealt to the MA/SA is healed by clerics, their heals are so much more effective and powerful that it is down to them to do that.  <br />
<br />
Damage that is done by AoE's that fire on a 30 second timer or so it a nightmare for shaman and druids who are the group healers, the cast time on the heals+recharge is 6 seconds + lag (effectivly 7 seconds).  There are no AA to speed up direct heals and very few focu effects do either.  Thus to heal eveyone in your group takes 42 seconds, by which time the mob has done anotheer AoE.  <br />
Shaman doing nothing else can just about keep up with a mob doing 1K/30 seconds, druids are at about 1500/30 seconds, clerics can keep up with anything (multiple group heals and heals over time).  <br />
<br />
Mobs rampaging or briefly doing a round of attack on an overaggroer do such harsh damage that shaman really can't keep up.  the time taken to target the overaggroer and hit them with a heal is too long- the mob will have done another round of attacks on the overaggroer probably because of low HP aggro anyway.  <br />
<br />
In essence I simply can't save anyones life on raids with my heals, because they are too slow and too little.  That makes me feel so inadequate and sad, that as a priest, a primary healer class I cannot fulfill my prime duty, that of healing.  I simply hate the fact that I can't function as a healer effectivly, I hate having people die.  I'm not inattentive on raids or slow, I simply haven't got the tools (spells) to do the job<br />
<br />
It is my contention that on raids Shaman healing simply isn't enough on raids.  Sure we can patch here and their, but not in any meaningful or effective way.  <br />
<br />
For healing purposes you are better to have a druid or a cleric.  <br />
<br />
There are some (very few) specialised encounters where a shaman is an advantage, when we need to cast Blood of Nadox.  Quarm and Innoruck are the only 2 fights that come to mind that a shaman is an effective healer, and that is because our heal is not more effective than what a druid or cleric can do, it is because it is a group heal.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Overall Summary<br />
It is my contention that shaman healing was balanced against slow with the view that slow was an advantage to a group, not a required ability.  That the healing was not balanced against the slow mitigating (especially IMMUNE)<br />
It is my contention that shaman healing is inadequate on raids.  <br />
<br />
I think that the healing of shaman needs to be drastically improved (I also think that druid's heal for too little as well)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">We argue that stat buffs aren't significant - Rytan would disagree. I would propose that, whilst stats do help, they are, except for stamina, indeed insignificant in the big scheme of things once over a threshold of around 200 or so.<br />
<br />
So, I present to Rytan the following figures, starting with Dexterity. I will try to investigate agility later.<br />
<br />
Dexterity<br />
Increases proc rate, afaik that's all it does.<br />
<br />
Notes &amp; Assumptions<br />
<br />
- Assumes no WA skill<br />
- Assumes having two procs (one from aug) still gives the same ppm - evidence suggests it is slightly lowered, perhaps due to 2 procs not being able to trigger at the same time<br />
- Assumes 20% of procs are resisted. This is vary variable depending on the proc and the mob<br />
- Assumes 2 procs on each weapon for 100DD and 150DD. Many players will have non-dps or indirect DPS procs too (debuffs, dots etc) which may benefit less from an improved proc rate.<br />
- Assumes standard proc-rate weapons (some weapons have modified proc rates)<br />
<br />
From the Steel Warrior forums (http://www.thesteelwarrior.org/forum/showthread.php?threadid=5644), these are the parsed ppm for a default weapon (no proc rate modifier) without any AAs such as WA.<br />
<br />
<br />
For mainhand weapons:<br />
305 DEX - 2.0 ppm<br />
205 DEX - 1.5 ppm<br />
105 DEX - 1.0 ppm<br />
<br />
For offhand weapons:<br />
105 DEX = .5 proc/min<br />
205 DEX = .75 proc/min<br />
305 DEX = 1 proc/min<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, the average procs on a weapon at the higher end of the game might be a 150pt aug + 100pt base. So 250dmg per proc. That's probably being generous. Then factor in a resist rate, I'm guessing here but lets say 20%. Again I think that's being generous. DPS from procs is then:<br />
<br />
305 dex: (2ppm main + 1ppm off) x 250dmg x 80% non-resisted = 600/minute = 10dps<br />
<br />
205 dex: (1.5+.75) x 250 x 80% = 450/minute = 7.5dps<br />
<br />
Dexterity Conclusion<br />
Buffing dex by 100 points from 205 up to 305 increases the base proc rate from a total (main and off-hand) of 2.25ppm to 3ppm. This all translates to a 2.5dps difference. <br />
<br />
100 dex = 2.5 DPS is NOTHING SIGNIFICANT at the high end of the game.<br />
<br />
I humbly submit that dex buffs are not significant and the devs shouldn't worry about stat caps, but look at direct boosts to abilities that matter. Increasing the number of double attacks for dps classes, reducing ripostes against tanks, increasing mitigation for tanks, helping casters critical nuke more, these are the sort of things that would be useful on buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">the bottom line is that what you have done to shaman is make them not fun to play. at the moment to me and i sure other shaman your spew balance out so you dont have to do anywork and not think about it!<br />
this is the bottom line for all eq. you are so involved with balance and crap like that that you forget people play this to have fun. not to fit into YOUR vision of what we should do.<br />
YOUR vision is not fun, that is why soo many poeple are leaving and shaman are so annoyed.<br />
i am always happy when other classes get great spells , i was happy for beast to get their mana line and nice quick nukes. I love enc charm. i like dc mobs for druids etc.<br />
if cleric want wizard nukes againt undead, sure. they want to solo undead great, they want to solo normal mobs let them?<br />
<br />
shaman want to be fun, fun is not debuffing the mob, thats something we have to do because we have no choice. fun is doing large damage to amob. being able to cast a heal that save the tank. watching the dot do massive damage to a mob quickly and not getting summon and killed myself. fun is standing up to a mob taken a beating but being able to take it! this is fun. buffing 6 tanks every 6 to 9 mins is not fun its tedious! short lasting spell buffs are not fun they are tedious that is way they get longer most of the time. buffing a whole group every 10 mins? well its more fun than 1 every minute. it would be more fun if avatar did more than add stats and attack and you could see the difference.<br />
there has been many threads on this broad on things that make it fun and ways to balance them out, but you have ingored almost every one!<br />
for example you could give us a 2k nuke quick cast 3sec but that has a 30 sec recasts similar to beast line. this would give us a nice burst dps but mean that druid/wiz will out nuke us easily. but it make shaman feel they have done something. that is fun!<br />
make avatar double the hits of the tank! (3 min recast maybe)thats is fun. now in this case it likely too much so make it a targetable aa that has a 30 min recast? last 9 mins. then its a nice aa? see? fun!<br />
it is noticeable too, for it to be fun you need to notice it!<br />
<br />
quite frankly it doesnt matter whether you think stats are great and slow still powerful. it is what the players think that matters and we dont.<br />
you shoudlnt be thinking when a class suggest something no, you should be thinking how?<br />
you shouldnt have to think about anythiong exept is this fun? then you work out how to make it work.<br />
<br />
you tend to more think they got this cant give them this or it doesnt fit YOUR point of veiw. bottom line we dont care about what YOU think .<br />
WE JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN!<br />
what is so hard about that? why do you fight us? you realise that without fun poeple stop playing? this is what is happening. because you forgot fun and went for your own vision!<br />
<br />
thankfully SOE isnt the only poeple out here now with products to tempt me. that is now my only hope. I wont buy GoD till it is fun, i wont buy OOW just because of level 70. I will not buy EQ2 because you`ll just do what you do in eq there.  I will buy these only if i think i will have fun, and i see little evidence that you know what fun is. <br />
the fact you dont listen will make it much easy for me and alot of other to leave, which will leave you without jobs. and quite frankly unemployed is where most of EQ SOE employess should be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I didnt read this thread. Nor am I going too. I am simply going to respond to Ryans letter, section by section. If I repeat things others have said, GOOD. <br />
Hey guys,<br />
<br />
I feel like I was somewhat misrepresented in the previous thread on my view of shaman and I'd like to clear it up a bit.<br />
Listening, but I have a BIG scowl on my face.<br />
Mana Regen<br />
Glori mentioned she really liked bear form when Velious came out and was sad that it wasn't nearly as useful as it once was. I thought that was very reasonable and would be happy to add an upgrade for it in the future. <br />
Add as much passive mana-regen to bear-form as we would get from being on a mount, so we can have an actual choice here please. Also, if I am a bear, I wanna be able to SHRED mobs in melee, with Rabid line, I wanna be close to Rogue DPS for a couple minutes, with a long re-cast timer. Bears are pretty powerful beasts in any form of any game you choose.<br />
As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time. Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen. I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing. (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
This arguement is ridiculous. Any shaman that would sacrifice a spell slot for a 2nd Canni is not doing his job. I have spell sets now to re-mem 1 spell in the MIDDLE of some fights (like Cripple, for example) because I cannot afford to dedicate a slot to it. The AA Cannibilization and the Highest grade of Canni spell are ALL that 99% of us will EVER use. Regardless of that anyway, who cares about mana-regen? SOE has obviously decided to remove Mana-regen from MOST equations. I never run low on mana. I never even get under 50%. Most of the time, Cannibilization gets me back full with room to spare. Mana has ceased being the end-all issue it was in the old days. No one stops to med anymore, no one. Not raids, not groups. <br />
Stat Buffs<br />
The initial implementation with the Accuracy etc is still on the table, as the Omens spells are still very much in transition. I know you're all very well aware of the effects stat buffs have on players, so I won't bore you with a recap. This is something to look at during beta and adjust the spells as needed. I will, however, say that 75 str does have a noticeable difference on DPS. The cap increases that are there now will likely filter down to the other stat buffs regardless of whether the Omens spells are changed. Then again, that might change to the same system as well.<br />
On a related note, we also discussed increasing the buff limit most likely through an AA, which should alleviate many of the concerns over buff slot limitations. Most likely this will be 5 new slots for a total of 20.<br />
75 str makes a notable difference in DPS when you go from 175 to 250. Not when you go from 250-325. If you do not believe me, PARSE IT ON A LIVE SERVER PLEASE! People with a LOT more free time than you have establised over and over again that STATs have diminishing returns as they get higher. Stop tying to tell us different please. <br />
In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc. I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect. Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
<br />
Why do I keep hearing this same theme over and over? You know, the same one my son tells me when I ask him to clean his room. &quot;In the future, Dad, I will clean my room&quot;. I put it to you, sir, that the future is NOW.<br />
Slows<br />
Generally I feel that the importance of slows (even in Gates) is being overly discounted. Yes they have less of an effect on shorter fights then longer ones, but you're still mitigating a tremendous amount of Damage from a given mob. <br />
Slow has evolved to the point where I'm not comfortable adding any more slows that are at a higher % then existing spells, simply because even the smallest change in % has a dramatic effect on the DPS of an NPC. In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc. I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect. Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.<br />
The importance of slows is obvious, no one is denying they are great. What we have issue with is your &quot;claim&quot; that slowing a mob 20 seconds into a 30 second fight makes a &quot;significant&quot; difference. How much damage do you think a Migated-Slow mob does in 10 second vs a non-Slowed one? 1 heal? Seriously, we have RUN THE NUMBERS ourselves. If you want to see them, I will be happy to provide link after link. Heck, we have pretty legitimate numbers that say a Druid can heal better (more efficiently) on an unslowed mob than a Shaman can on a FULLY slowable mob in a fight that last under 45 seconds. With Balance, if it lands first shot, we get a lot closer, but still not EVEN EQUAL to a druid. Again, I can provide links. <br />
Heals over Time<br />
Generally I agree that these spells across the board are too weak and need adjustments. This goes for all classes with Heal over Times.<br />
Honestly, here is where we can actually produce some results, if you can JUST make certain things happen. One, give Shaman the best HoT in the game. Come ON man, Clerics are BURST healers, and long term CH-ers, Shaman are HoTers. If you are not going to give us a 2K+ fast heal (pre-focus, pre-AA) then at LEAST give us the best HoT. It would add HUGE desirability. Heck, one shamans JOB could be to keep HoT on the MA. Yeah, yeah, trivializing older content. Shaman soloing . . who this time, Fire Birds? This is wearing me out, honestly. Leave the Cleric one where it is. Give Shaman a better one, and be done with it. My god man, throw us SOME bone. <br />
<br />
Finally, I want to touch on a topic not mentioned, DPS. <br />
Give us a GOOD nuke. Now, sir. I mean it. I dont want to be a wizard, but in situations where I have NOTHING to do because my heals suck and my nukes suck, give us SOMETHING. Make it AA, and AA that adds damage to Spear of Torment. 3 levels costing 5, 10 and 15, pre-requ FoM3, adds 200, 300 and 500 to Spear pre-focus, pre-crit. You already have stupid Orante and EP focus effects that ONLY target this spell, take it a step further and make it WORTH MEMMING AND CASTING!!<br />
<br />
Thats all I have. <br />
<br />
Blazz out. Maybe out-out-out soon. I am with Murtak on this one. OoW could be the nail. Read his posts Ryan. He and I are guys that have been IMMENSLY loyal over the course of all this controversy, but it would seem we are both at our breaking point. And I dont even agree with the guy on the &quot;direction&quot; shaman should be taken (he wants heals, I want buff-debuff-dps) <br />
<br />
I dont want to make a new toon. I want to be a SHAMAN for gosh sakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">the bottom line is that what you have done to shaman is make them not fun to play. at the moment to me and i sure other shaman your spew balance out so you dont have to do anywork and not think about it!<br />
this is the bottom line for all eq. you are so involved with balance and crap like that that you forget people play this to have fun. not to fit into YOUR vision of what we should do.<br />
YOUR vision is not fun, that is why soo many poeple are leaving and shaman are so annoyed.<br />
i am always happy when other classes get great spells , i was happy for beast to get their mana line and nice quick nukes. I love enc charm. i like dc mobs for druids etc.<br />
if cleric want wizard nukes againt undead, sure. they want to solo undead great, they want to solo normal mobs let them?<br />
<br />
shaman want to be fun, fun is not debuffing the mob, thats something we have to do because we have no choice. fun is doing large damage to amob. being able to cast a heal that save the tank. watching the dot do massive damage to a mob quickly and not getting summon and killed myself. fun is standing up to a mob taken a beating but being able to take it! this is fun. buffing 6 tanks every 6 to 9 mins is not fun its tedious! short lasting spell buffs are not fun they are tedious that is way they get longer most of the time. buffing a whole group every 10 mins? well its more fun than 1 every minute. it would be more fun if avatar did more than add stats and attack and you could see the difference.<br />
there has been many threads on this broad on things that make it fun and ways to balance them out, but you have ingored almost every one!<br />
for example you could give us a 2k nuke quick cast 3sec but that has a 30 sec recasts similar to beast line. this would give us a nice burst dps but mean that druid/wiz will out nuke us easily. but it make shaman feel they have done something. that is fun!<br />
make avatar double the hits of the tank! (3 min recast maybe)thats is fun. now in this case it likely too much so make it a targetable aa that has a 30 min recast? least 9 mins. then its a nice aa? see? fun!<br />
it is noticeable too, for it to be fun you need to notice it!<br />
<br />
quite frankly it doesnt matter whether you think stats are great and slow still powerful. it is what the players think that matters and we dont.<br />
you shoudlnt be thinking when a class suggest something no, you should be thinking how?<br />
you shouldnt have to think about anythiong exept is this fun? then you work out how to make it work.<br />
<br />
you tend to more think they got this cant give them this or it doesnt fit YOUR point of veiw. bottom line we dont care about what YOU think .<br />
WE JUST WANT TO HAVE FUN!<br />
what is so hard about that? why do you fight us? you realise that without fun poeple stop playing? this is what is happening. because you forgot fun and went for your own vision!<br />
<br />
<br />
I totally and wholeheartedly agree with Bara Cudar here.<br />
<br />
Being inferior is NOT fun!<br />
<br />
If our slows are being mitigated, we do not contribute significantly to the group the way other slowing classes can when they face mitigation. <br />
<br />
Being a bad choice for a group is NOT FUN!<br />
<br />
The solution:  Remove mitigation and take fights back to where they were 2 years ago (when we were a class to be reckoned with) in duration  :rolleyes:  or buff our healing/buffing/DPS to a point where we can make a difference, this is frustrating   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I posted above about dexterity. I now come to look at agility.<br />
<br />
Agility<br />
So what does it do? Well, agility adds to your damage avoidance part of your AC. For every 3-6 points of agility you'll see one more point of raw AC. What you can't see, is what difference this makes to your avoidance.<br />
<br />
The parses<br />
Rather than copy it all, I refer you to the excellent parsing and analysis over on our hybrid's class forums - The Beastlords' Den (http://www.beastlords.org/forums/viewtopic.php?t=1944&amp;highlight=agility)<br />
<br />
Notes and Assumptions<br />
The parses were only done against a level 63 druid; its assumed the calculations are the same for other mobs<br />
The parses are only done in the range 90-200 or so. Thus, it doesn't show the big kink at 75 agi, nor does it examine effects on agi up in the 280-300 range. <br />
As AC increase from agi reduces over 200 agi, so it is assumed the avoidance factor would too.<br />
<br />
The Conclusions<br />
Raising Agility by 100pts from around 100 to 200 yeilds ~3% increase in avoidance<br />
<br />
Raising agility from 200-300 yields diminishing returns (not quantified), guessed to be about 1-2%.<br />
<br />
To quote the guy that did the parsing:<br />
<br />
Assuming therefore that these equations scale properly over the whole range of possible AGI values, there's no reason to expect the benefits of AGI to continue above 200, since you get diminishing returns to your listed AC from AGI above 200. As it is, a 3% increase in avoidance for a 100 AGI increase is a joke anyway, SOE might as well remove the stat completely and reduce the CPU load of having to calculate its effect<br />
<br />
100 agi (from 200-&gt;300) yields ~1-2% increase in avoidance at most - NOTHING SIGNIFICANT</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I would like to know when Shaman are going to stop having to pay over and over again for having Malos line  (similar questions could be asked for Slow and Canni lines).  All our spells are adjusted (except mana cost - another ding) to account for the fact that we can Malos, therefore making it essential to cast.  But at the same time, most other classes spells are adjusted (neg resist checks) to account for the fact they don't have Malos lines.  The only person really needing Malos cast then, is Shaman themselves (other than maybe boss mobs).<br />
<br />
Of course, in a xp group situation if you must Malos then slow the fight will already be 1/4 over.  If you don't Malos, but then slow, aside from taking the risk of a bounced slow, you can't even use the saved time to dot or nuke since it's almost guaranteed that it will be resisted since you didn't malos.<br />
<br />
Add on to this the PvP penalty for Malos.  All the recent PvPResist changes also carry this inherent penalty for shaman.  Looking at similar spell lines across classes, the other classes get a bigger neg resist check.  But of course, by the time you malos, and try to cast a dot/nuke/whatever, malos will be dispelled.  I don't even play on a PvP server to see the problems with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Group FA is overpowered, yet have they looked at the weapons dropping in expansions lately? The DPS upgrade is hardly out of line.<br />
<br />
I think the comparison of how our dots have fallen vs nukes has been done to death, but once again... The best DoT used to be more efficient mana-wise, and deal more damage than the best wizard nuke, because it worked over a period of time, and could be chain cast. Now DoT's deal less damage of comparable efficiency, draw more aggro, and often have trouble running to completion. Anyone can see theres a problem.<br />
<br />
Regens and HoT. Mob dps has risen dramatically in comparison to what these spells heal. I would like ot see them restored. Traditionally, shamans kept a group alive through a combination of HoT's, Regens, Slows and direct heals. 2 of those components are jokes in Ele+ content, one very sub par, and one being phased out entirely.<br />
<br />
Buffs with useful effects. Once again, our spells get th shaft so theres more wiggle room with items. The entire point of limiting flowing though was to make enchanter mana regen buffs desirable. Otherwise they could all be from the same pool. Strikethrough, combat effects, stun resistance, dodge, cleave etc should ALL have been effects contained in shaman spells in the first place, and not just at level 66+. <br />
<br />
Mana regen - We now fight more battles per hour than ever before, because the mobs die so fast. As a result, we sling more Malos and Turgurs/Nihli per hour. Wizards simply have to nuke until the mob is dead. Whether they face 20 mobs with 40khp each, or 5 mobs with 160k hp, it doesnt matter. They have to deal X damage to get the job done. But the tissue paper mob model results in us having to spend a lot of mana to debuff a mob for a very short amount of time. The more time a mob spends debuffed, the more efficient and useful a debuff was. If the mob dies so fast that slow only prevents 2 rounds of attacks, then pure healing is a much more efficient way of keeping the group alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>FafnerMorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I see a glimmer of hope in Ryan's statement: &quot;In the future we'll be adding debuffs that function in different ways, such as decreased dual wield chance, double attack chance, decreased maximum hits etc. I think this has the potential to help shaman stackability on raids if you have several debuffs that need to be applied to the mob, each for a noticeable effect. Again this is something we'll be looking at heavily during beta.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd really like to see some new shaman spells - NOT the same old buffs / heals / DoTs made better by 5%.<br />
<br />
I want to see something that makes being a shaman unique - not a wanna-be druid/cleric. Something that gives a guild a reason for wanting more shaman, or that makes a group say &quot;We've got 5 people and a BL &amp; druid already, but there's a shaman LFG and that would add so much more to what we have!'.<br />
<br />
Folks keep saying - what's the purpose of a shaman? My answer: Shaman make their allies stronger, and their enemies weaker.<br />
<br />
Ideas:<br />
- A new line of debuffs (think of reverse Focus effects) would be great.<br />
- A new line of buffs which gave casters some focus effect abilities (imagine - a caster WANTING shaman buffs?!). These spells could be dropped by the same level of mobs which drop items w/ these effects, so they wouldn't be overpowering.<br />
- A new line of buffs for melee which gave shielding / stun resists / whatever. Likewise.<br />
<br />
Some of these things are available from tribute masters so I don't see them being unbalancing to the game. Have the best spells drop from raid-level mobs which drop gear that gives those sorts of focus effects.<br />
<br />
I think SOE is catching on that EQ has lost a lot of it's shine. To many shaman, it's not as fun as it used to be. Adding in a 5% better heal will NOT bring fun back to the game. We need something that makes folks go &quot;Wow!&quot; rather than &quot;I wish I was playing WoW&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I don't believe this has been directly addressed except through the slow line, there isn't anything (other than mana regen, even there the margins are narowing) that distinguish the shaman from other classes.  The %'s of shaman heals vs cleric heals seem to be sacred (47% of cleric heals), but the %'s on our slows are not.  I've seen some of the ideas here and on the test server (from Lucy's) and while some of the new buffs there include things like strike through and what not, every class seems to get them.  There is nothing to make a group want a shaman over say a BL, cleric, druid, pally ... all of our abilities are watered down in effectiveness, mostly due to content and sharing them out with other classes.  Generally, you go with the class that brings the most to the group.  If that group can find someone like even a bard who can slow and is arguably the best pull class in the game, the difference between a shaman slow and a bard slow on a mitigating mob is so marginal that the difference can easily be made up by the bard in his DPS, CC and other abilities, most notably his superb pulling.  In today's content, even some older content, I can find more encounters where a group is not as effective with a shaman than with another class taking his spot.  This is largely why I retired from EQ and cancelled my account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Healing-basic data<br />

1. Normal Healing ; cast time 3.75 or so.<br />
2. Instant Healing ; cast time 1.75<br />
3. Complete Healing ;Cast time 10.0<br />
4. Group Healing<br />
5. Healing on Time<br />
             (I exclude chloroblast)<br />
Comparison among Priest Class. <br />
I will use 2 types of lvl cap(60 and 65)<br />
I exclude lvl 70 because that spell line is not stable.<br />
<br />
1. Normal Healing<br />
---till lvl 60<br />
Clr hp 1600 mana 525 hp/mana 3.0(CT 4.75)<br />
Dru hp 583 mana 250 hp/mana 2.3<br />
Shm hp 583 mana 250 hp/mana 2.3<br />
---till lvl 65<br />
Clr hp 3275 mana 650 hp/mana 5.0<br />
Dru hp 2100 mana 550 hp/mana 3.8<br />
Shm hp 1550 mana 490 hp/mana 3.0 <br />
<br />
2. Instant Healing<br />
---till lvl 60<br />
Clr hp 438 mana 175 hp/mana 2.5<br />

<br />
5. Healing on Time<br />
---till lvl 60<br />
Clr 300/tick mana 300 total 1500 hp/24sec<br />
Dru None<br />
Shm 300/tick mana 200 total 1500 hp/24sec<br />
---till lvl 65<br />
Clr 600/tick mana 480 total 3000 hp/24sec<br />
Dru None<br />
Shm 420/tick mana 280 total 2100 hp/24sec<br />
<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
1.Normal healing<br />
 At normal healing we have 2 disadvantage; the amount of healing and heal efficiency. The difference of the amount of healing is getting worse if each class have AA and focus. <br />
<br />
2. Instant healing<br />
Only Clr has. It might be Clr's speciality for Dev team.<br />
Now at GoD, Clrs use this spell very frequently.<br />
The importance of this spell is getting higher.<br />
It means shm and dru has not enough power for emergency heal.<br />
<br />
3. Complete healing<br />
Our complete heal is not upgraded since lvl60.<br />
So,practically at lvl 65, Complete heal was equiped at 2 class.<br />
<br />
4. Group healing<br />
Same as instant healing. good for AE...<br />
And combination of DA and Group healing is awsome.<br />
So shm and dru have no talent to heal against AE and to save MT life at emergency. <br />
<br />
5. Healing on time<br />
Clr and Shm have.<br />
Clr is superior to shm at lvl 65. At lvl 60, both healing has character and heal same amount. <br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Situation study. Now our group battle is lasted 30sec or so.<br />
At lvl 65. without AA and Focus.<br />
(it means if we have AA and Focus, the difference becomes LARGER.<br />
And if Clr has DA, this calcuration will be dramatically changed.)<br />
If it will be longer, we can simply multiply them.<br />
<br />
30sec healing (without CH)<br />
Clr (use instant)<br />
        HoT3000, Heal 1450x6 total; hp 10700 mana 2880<br />
Clr (without instant)<br />
        HoT3000, Heal 3275x5 total; hp 19375 mana 3730<br />
Dru                  Heal 2100x5 total; hp 10500 mana 2750<br />
Shm HoT 2100, Heal 1550x5 total; hp   9850 mana 2730<br />
<br />
<br />
30sec healing (using CH)<br />
Clr     HoT 3000,       7500x3 total; hp 25500 mana 1680<br />
Dru                          4680x3 total; hp 14040 mana 1800<br />
Shm   HoT 2100,       1950x3 total; hp  7950 mana 1480<br />
<br />
If someone feel dru and shm are same, I should say thank you.<br />
I never think so. if we have another slower, I never take shaman.<br />
If full AA and focused, difference will be MUCH increased.<br />
<br />
And at Raid, we can not use HoT on MT. our supportive heal?<br />
It is not enough for anyone.<br />
<br />
I did not mention about OoW. but this difference will undoubtly  be larger than before.(because dru has another CH... 6000or so)<br />
<br />
In my opinon, supportive healer should have Splint heal .. it means short CT.<br />
For exmaple, before 60, Clr normal healing CT is 4.75 and we have shorter CT heal (CT3).<br />
Now Mob's DPS will be increased insanely, so all of us need splint heal power. But we do not have any.<br />
So everyone want to invite clr. <br />
And it causes the inflexibility of Grouping and Raid forming.<br />
Moreover Dru has mana regene, DS, snare and GG.<br />
Shm has..... pet? <br />
The difference is .... obvious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">below if relevant to XP grouping ( which Sony claims is their main focus)<br />
<br />
I would love many of the requested improvements but most would put us in place to take our role back from sony's reinvention of the shaman aka beastlord.  Not goint to happen, there are probablly more beastlords playing now than shaman ( except for buff bots).<br />
<br />
Seriously, there is not room for both classes (in xp content) at level 65 (once beast gets 65% slow).  If we do not get improvements Shaman class is DEAD as more and more players discover how well the beastlord (level 65) functions in XP groups.  Sony seriously screwed the Shamans game when they gave the Beastlord class a 65% slow.<br />
<br />
Since tugurs is already too powerful (so much so that mitigation is becoming common)  we cannot expect to reclaim the slowing role we once had through improvements.  <br />
<br />
I want an ability that inclines KNOWLEDGABLE players to want a shaman in their group.  Out of habit many groups still look for shaman as first choice slower but that is fading quickly.  Our competion in slowing ( enchanter, beastlord, and bard) bring much more to the group than current shaman.  All add powerful buffing and great dps.  The enchanter and bard have vastly superior crowd control and the beastlord does as well as the shaman.  Our significant addition lacking in the enchanter, beastlord, or bard is some spot healing ( or more if main healer is out of action).  That is not enough.<br />
<br />
In the healing department we a very distant third choice.  While I do sometime play healer in a group with a beastlord slower ( other choices not available at the time), it is definately a less optimal group.<br />
<br />
So PLEASE do not worry so much about making us overpowered, but PLEASE do worry about the SURVIVAL of the shaman class.  Make us best at something ( or a combination of things) in a significant way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">1) Parsing and presenting our case -- I believe it is the responsibility of SoE to prove to US that stats are as useful as they claim. We, the playerbase (not just Shaman) agree that based upon our experience in the game, stat buffs are of minimal benefit when left to decide between a buff that provides raw HP, raw Mana, or mana regen. We are the majority and though most of us do not know the percentages, our in-game experience has taught us that stat buffs have little impact on our grouping/raiding experience. Seeing as how SoE development is the minority, claiming that something is true in the face of the thousands(?) who believe otherwise: YOU show US the parses. <br />
<br />
1b.) Let's throw parsing out the window for just a moment. IRL, we do what works. In the game, our characters would do the same. The gaming experience has made certain truths obvious. Numbers be-darned.<br />
<br />
2.) Ferine Avatar -- This spell diminishes the Shaman's potency in a group situation due to the recast time and provides nominal NOTICEABLE benefit. (Forget parsing and percentages. The gaming experience using this spell compared to the alternative makes it's minimal usefulness readily apparent.) Given the sacrifice vs. the reward, I choose not to cast this spell unless we have something like 3 Rogues in the group. <br />
<br />
2b.) A typical spell lineup that includes FA in an LDON: <br />
<br />
Slot1 - Heal<br />
Slot2 - Root<br />
Slot3 - AE Slow<br />
Slot4 - Turgur's<br />
Slot5 - Quiescence<br />
Slot6 - FA<br />
Slot7 - Canni4<br />
Slot8 - Malos/Malosinia<br />
<br />
As Shaman do not get hardly any combo spells, our spell slots are incredibly valuable. The list above is my spell lineup for a normal LDON and there's no way around it. Most of the spells in the lineup are situational, but must be available to me when needed and there is little time to demem and remem spells when we get 3 adds. So, they can't be dememmed. At best, in a Hard or a traditional style XP group, I could drop the Tigir's in slot 3 and put a DoT, Rain, or Nuke there. To keep FA up on the melee's in my group, I am pretty much a slower and an FA'er unless things get ugly and I have to root-park or heal or something. What this means is that I sit at 90% mana and spend most of my time recasting FA when I'm not slowing. I've done quite a bit of experimentation with abondoning FA in favor of a rain or nuke. Even with our gimp nukes, the mobs were dropping 25 - 50% faster when the melee's were without FA and I was blowing my mana load to do damage. Do I have numbers? No. But the numbers don't mean anything to me anyway. I see noticeable benefit in leaving FA out of my spell lineup. It COULD be useful if I didn't have to keep it memmed all the time -- consuming a spell slot for 100% of the adv. <br />
<br />
Note that making this a group spell does not fix this either. It might reduce the pita factor a bit, but it would still have to be perma-memmed with it's current recast and duration.<br />
<br />
3.) Shaman Playability Comparison -- Okay, okay, we all hate being compared to Druids. However, they are the &quot;other&quot; priest class that isn't a cleric. We both base our spells on what I call &quot;hedge magic.&quot; Let's look at how we stack up. <br />
<br />
3a) First, here are the benefits of a Shaman over a Druid. Capabilities we have that they do not.<br />
a.) Slow<br />
b.) Active Mana Regen -- Neutralized because it is active and requires constant maintenance. Also neutralized considering the cost of our spells and the amount of resistance our spells receive which requires recasting.<br />
c.) Numerous Melee Stat Buffs -- All but neutralized given gear, stat caps, and generally accepted nominal impact of melee stats in the game. They do get some, but not as many as far as I can tell.<br />
d.) Pet capable of producing at least some damage -- Situational use only. Parsing shows that they do next to no damage on raid-level mobs.<br />
e.) Higher AC and HP on the average -- Presumably this is a leftover of the Battle Shaman idea from Kunark. In today's game, it has some nominal benefit as we might be able to get a root off in the face of an angry mob, but in general, it's been negated by increased damage output of the mobs. <br />
f.)  Haste -- Gimptastic, but haste all the same.<br />
g.) Unresistable Resist Debuff<br />
h.) Melee Debuff -- albeit this hasn't been upgraded since level 53 and only effects stats.<br />
 <br />
<br />
3b) Benefits Druids receive over Shaman. In theory, benefits of each class would balance each other.<br />
a.) Healing similar to clerics<br />
b.) MGB'able mana regen and HP boosting <br />
c.) Harmony<br />
d.) Snare<br />
e.) Nuking class style DD<br />
f.) Combo spells which relieve the pressure on spell slots AND make for less effort to provide the same effect as the Shaman equivalent (e.g. Flight of Eagles combines SoW, Lev, and See Invis in a group MGB'able form.)<br />
g.) Damage Shields<br />
h.) TRACK <br />
i.) PORTS<br />
j.) Illusion spells that are beneficial at high levels.<br />
k.) Charm<br />
l.) Succor<br />
<br />
(My point here is not to justify deleting your SHM and starting a druid but to show how the Druid class has evolved in power vs. the Shaman's negligence since Kunark. WE are supposed to be the utility class... but look at this! Utility-wise, we have jack in comparison. Not only that, but the utilities that we do have are single effect per spell. You want sow, lev, and see invis? It requires one cast for a Druid to do this for the whole group (or raid). It requires 8 casts for a Shaman -- THE UTILITY CLASS -- to do the same. It's a royal pain the butt!)<br />
<br />
4.) The Beastlord Factor -- If BST's are a hybrid of SHM and MNK, where is my MGB'able mana regen spell? <br />
<br />
5.) The Battle Shaman (tm) -- This was a novel idea that was unofficially abandoned some time ago. Our ability to be Battle Shaman presumably had an impact on our class balance around the Kunark era. PoP Shaman (save for those rare exceptions) find this unavailable to them. If we were meant to be Battle Shaman, where's my plate mail? The point is that if you look at our capabilities, they are the same as in Kunark, only seriously marginalized by the empowering of mobs vs. us. We should have seen this option be developed along with the content or be toe-tagged officially and other benefits provided in it's stead. Yes there is some benefit to our higher AC and HP, but in the face of mobs that quad for 1k, it's hardly worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Ryan, what you are seeing are hundreds (thousands?) of Shaman who love their class and love their game, but struggle to find their class's place in it. Regardless of numbers, percentages, parsings, etc... this is the reality of our class. Our in-game experience rules over the statistics. It's one thing when a class-base asks for attention, but we have the sympathies of other classes as well. Just take a look at the SoE message boards and you'll see that. Even if the parsing comes back and shows that stats play a major role in the game experience, it won't change anything. The Shaman community's opinion will not change until our gameplay experience changes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Itzkul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">It honestly would be very easy to fix this whole thing. All you have to do is up the hp on the mobs in GoD and OoW. You have been making the weapons and spells do more and more DPS but the mobs do not have that much more hp. If people are killing mobs in 8 sec and we can't even nuke or slow they do not have enough hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">1) Parsing and presenting our case -- I believe it is the responsibility of SoE to prove to US that stats are as useful as they claim. We, the playerbase (not just Shaman) agree that based upon our experience in the game, stat buffs are of minimal benefit when left to decide between a buff that provides raw HP, raw Mana, or mana regen. We are the majority and though most of us do not know the percentages, our in-game experience has taught us that stat buffs have little impact on our grouping/raiding experience.<br />
WOW what a fantastic point. Ryan, SHOW us the numbers of STAT buffings increases. Seriously. And PLEASE PLEASE do not count ANY of it unless the players stats are MAXXED with gear (or within, say, 10 since I think most Bazaar players can get that close with a bit of effort) before buffing. <br />
<br />
You show me how my buffs will give a BIG jump to DPS on a max stat character and I will back off. OK? Fair enough? Because Orgak is 100% right, its on YOU to prove us wrong, because WE have run the numbers and seen the results. <br />
<br />
Do the same for slow please. Indicate to us how much damage is saved by slowing a mob HALFWAY through a 30-45 second fight. Then convert that damage dealt into real mana numbers for a Cleric or Druid to heal, taking into account their mana regen, and show us some PROOF that OUR slow is THAT huge a deal over, say, a Chanter or BL who can provide SO much more to a group than we can (relates directly to the ineffectiveness of stat buffs, link em if you want).<br />
<br />
No offense Ryan, but I think you are speaking as an expert on things that you have no REAL hardcore data on, because, in your mind, it would SEEM that slow is major, it would SEEM that stats over the cap would help  . . .<br />
<br />
. . . but in reality, in the REAL EQ world, neither is true.<br />
<br />
I want answers Ryan. I want numbers. I see you SAYING things, but I see no proof. I see you telling us about our &quot;future&quot; but I see nothing in the &quot;present&quot; that convinces me that Shaman is a viable class. <br />
<br />
BUT WAIT! I can solo trivial dragons! Open up Nagafen to 65s, please, so I can farm CoFs for my twinks, /snicker.<br />
<br />
Whoops, sorry Gloria, I got a bit &quot;uncalm and irrational&quot; there at the end.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Context - I play a 65 shaman on Xev server, 200+ AA.  I've been playing since just before Kunark release.  My guild (a group of great, fun people) was racing through EP's with little difficulty when I canceled my accounts.<br />
<br />
(Gloriana - Thanks for making the thread, and for taking the time to police it in order for it to be effective.  Thanks Snoww for that great repost - it perfectly outlined what I used to love about playing a shaman (when raiding was exciting, not a chore).  And what I managed to read above just had some great points.  Now for the meat.)<br />
<br />
NEW SPELLS:  The point I canNOT stress enough, is PLEASE have someone playtest these changes for FUN!  Any buff that lasts less than an hour and isn't MGB'able will make me detest what's happened to this class even more.  I know a lot of people have voiced their aggrivation with trying to keep their sanity while using avatar raiding and grouping... but seriously.  I'd rather the avatar line die out entirely than continue with this 6-minute single-target misery.<br />
<br />
MANA REGEN:  with FT4 and SCRM, I really don't have mana problems.  I'm not concerned with this area.<br />
<br />
STAT BUFFS:  my guild was JUST getting hipdeep in EP's when I left, and our main tanks are capped on DEX and STR WITHOUT focus.  I'm not excited about stat buffs.  I know perfectly well that after 255 (or was it 250?) stamina, the HP-STA ratio is something like 2:1.  As an example, if you were to increase our sta buff by 100, that would, in theory (assuming the ratio doesn't get worse) give my shaman 50 extra hps.  Might give a tank 75?  100?  I'm sorry, it's not exciting.<br />
<br />
SLOWS:  I agree with you!  Slows are great!  If they're not immune.  If they're not mitigated.  But that's not the bone of contention here (in my view).  Shaman slow is NOT dramatically different from enchanter slow or beastlord slow.  If slow is the only significant utility that we bring to a group, that group is usually better off looking elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Let me put it another way:<br />
(exp group context)  In all cases,  a shaman must compete for their spot as a slower with a class that provides mana-regen to the group.  Mana-regen is fun.  Everybody likes to be able to cast more spells.  A shaman could really use something comparable to that to bring to the group  fun-wise.<br />
<br />
Keeping this as short, direct, and upbeat as I can.  Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">1) BUFFS My number one concern, is the overabundance of shaman buffs.  We have at least twice plus amount of buffs to cast than any other class.  It's distracting to my gameplay, when I have to spend more time looking at tells, than what's going on around me.  It's time consuming.  It's not fun.  It's not what any class should come to be.  What to think about are:<br />
     <br />
     a) Do we really need higher stat buff spells with OOW?  With stat <br />
         AA's, gear (and future gear) and our current buffs, I believe<br />
         it will be sufficient enough.<br />
     b) If we are going to recieve them, then why not combine them?  <br />
         Put strength/stamina into one.  Agility/Dex in another.  Or  <br />
         combine them all.<br />
     c) Remove the physical stats from the Avatar line, and replace<br />
         them with better enhancements.  It's rare if not at all, the full<br />
         usage of them are used, because stats are already maxed or just<br />
         a small amount is needed to hit the cap.<br />
     d) Reduce our buff load.  Make buffs last a significant amount of <br />
         time.  Definately make them group castable.<br />
<br />
2) HEALING We are a priest class.  No matter how many shaman dislike healing, we are looked upon to heal in many situations.  Our healing is scaled from the old days.  They are not scaled to the difficulty of damage dealt from mobs encountered in PoP and GoD, nor are scaled to the heavy amount of hit points melee recieve from AA's and their gear.  I want to see confidence in our healing, not praying to get through it.<br />
      <br />
      a) We should at least be able to heal a third of a melee's<br />
          projected hit points, pre-healing criticals.  With my current<br />
          heals, I'm lucky to see a tank's hit point bar move, when my<br />
          heal lands.  Relying on crits to see hit points move up, is risky<br />
          and gives a very uneasy feeling.<br />
<br />
Remember, not every mob is slowable and many mitigate.  They still hit hard, regardless.  An 1800 heal, just isn't going to cut it.<br />
<br />
3) DEBUFFS We need unique debuffs that only pertain to the shaman class, and no other.  We have enough debuffs shared by other classes (malo line, cripple, slows).  I saw something about infection type spells and debuffs that affect dual wielding and the such.  Those are exactly what we need.<br />
<br />
4) DAMAGE It's been officially stated the game has been gearing for the fast paced world.  Yet, our damage is sllllloooowwww.   Not only slow, but mostly ineffective for this type of play.  We also seem to have unwarranted agro with DoTs.<br />
<br />
      a) There is no reason for a wizard to crit 7-8k and not recieve<br />
          agro, yet a shaman DoT that does 256 damage on first tic,<br />
          gets me killed.  All of our DoTs should recieve hefty<br />
          deagro attached to our DoTs.<br />
      b) There is no reason for a wizard to crit 7-8k and yet for<br />
          some reason, our DoTs are restricted to low output<br />
          damage for the length of time it does.  I would like to see<br />
          higher per tic damage.  Somewhere around 700-1k.  At least if<br />
          it doesn't run its full course on a short-lived mob, it does<br />
          something more noticable to it.<br />
      c) A good fast DD.  At least in the 1200-1500 range in about<br />
          3-4 second cast time.  It will still be far behind wizards,<br />
          mages, and druids.<br />
<br />
Stacking many DoTs from one shaman, is nearly impossible due to limited spell gems for other needy spells.  If that's a worry from the developers that we can, it shouldn't be. :)<br />
<br />
5) EXTRAS<br />
<br />
a) Shamans have zero ability to detract or escape damage and/or  <br />
agro from a mob.  We have no Rune, DA, FD, Defensive Disc, Jolt, or quick evac spells/AA, like ALL other classes have.  Slow doesn't count.  We still get hit and can die. ;)  I wouldn't mind seeing some sort of deagro ability, either by spell or AA.<br />
<br />
b) Retune Rabid Bear to be noticably useful. The refresh rate is ridiculous.  I don't see how this is so powerful, yet Innate Camo, Snare AA's and the such, refresh much faster and are more useful, but not seen as powerful?  Maybe tune Rabid Bear into what's suggested above.  Or make it a &quot;last stand&quot; ability if the group is in serious trouble (people dying left and right) where we do good melee damage for a short period of time, with an ability like Weaponshield or the such.  Maybe &quot;save the day.&quot;  Granted, the current time Rabid Bear has, will need to be reduced.  These changes, would also give good reason to get Rabidity.<br />
<br />
c) Improved Invisibility.  Spell or AA.  You think with all the shamans' mysticism, by now, we'd develop a better and safer invis.  :)<br />
<br />
d) Retuning of bearform.  It also needs a facelift in appearance.  The current usefulness is marginal.  Perhaps make an improved version at later levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">I would like to have an explanation of the resistance we are getting to having FA changed.<br />
<br />
Here is my data supporting a change to FA.  If this is to be refuted, it needs to be refuted with contrary data.<br />
<br />
FA provides a 140 pt increase to ATK.  This is it's primary purpose.  Yes, it provides stats as well, but as everyone has said, stats are meaningless to the capped, and even if you aren't capped, Focus will put you there.  So, FA's one &quot;meaningful&quot; attribute is the ATK bonus.<br />
<br />
We've been told over and over that a group version would be extremely unbalancing as would a longer duration.<br />
<br />
I give you Rangers.<br />
<br />
At Level 64, one level before a Shaman gets FA, a Ranger can buff +130 ATK and have it last one hour (SotP + SoT).  Group version.  Additionally, Rangers add another 400 HP, which is something meaningful.<br />
<br />
:boggle:<br />
<br />
I submit that FA, at L65, should be a Group based spell, lasting 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
What data could refute that, given the Rangers already have the ability to do MORE?<br />
<br />
:doubleboggle:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">New spells and ideas are great, but absolutely meaningless if they do not drop.<br />
<br />
Drops for GoD spells need to be improved (yet again) and possibly be attainable through several routes like quests and research.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Georgina Ofthejungle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Okay. I am a 65th Shammy on the Luclin server with 59 AA's. I would like to thank Glow for making this thread. I don't post often but I've been reading for a while. I would also like to say a thank-you to the Dev's for agreeing to take a look at our opinions. I know that there is a LOT of us that feel pretty hopeless right now for our loved and cherished Class. A shaman is all I know, in EQ. This is what I think would help us. <br />
<br />
1. Spells: First off, I would like to say that not everyone can afford GoD and OoW and every other expansion that comes out. But, we would ALL like to take advantage of the spells and gear that makes Shaman better and special to a group. I suggest that maybe you let all of us have a FAIR chance at getting these spells, even if we have to A&gt; Quest for them  or B&gt; Buy them from the Shaman spell merchants in PoK. They are suppost to have the &quot;uncommon&quot; spells for us. Why not make it so that we can all benifit from these new spells. Please!<br />
<br />
2. Slows: I have to agree.. BST/ENC/BRD slows have disabled our ability to get a group and actually get a chance to be useful and effective. I have been booted out of a group in favor of both Bards and Enchanters, both because they could slow the mob faster and easier (I couldn't get a slow in because it would resist both my Malo and my Turgur's.) and they could give a mana-boost to the cleric who was &quot;Wasting mana&quot; on my failed attempts at slowing by having to heal the Tank all the time. This made me very sad, and worthless. Also, could we possibly have a TRUE AE slow spell that hits all the mobs instead of a limit of four.. and misses the players..<br />
<br />
3. Heals: Could we please have a heal that would benifit everyone? With the high level game, we have been bumped down the line in slowing, and now in healing as well. Clerics will always be the &quot;King of the castle&quot; with heals, with Druids coming in a close second with their Natures Infusion CH. Then, the Shaman who bring in the rear with a 1300 Tnargs mending or a 320/tick (every six seconds) Quiescence. High end mobs quad for 1-2k/hit. Once the Clerics and druids fall due to their CH's, us &quot;Shamans&quot; are expected to hold the fort and keep the Tank alive. Once, we might have been able to help some.. but even spamming Tnargs won't help the Tank for long. It *COULD* Be probable if we had a good HoT, and an AA that would crit like Warriors /discs would so that we could get &quot;Exceptional heals&quot; like &quot;critical hits&quot; For a short period (like.. say.. 2 minutes?) of time every say.. 30 minutes. This way, the AA could save the Tank's life at least for a little bit?<br />
<br />
4. Pets: Shaman pets are suppost to be the best in the game. We are suppost to have a Warrior style pet that is suppost to /shield us and make it easier for us to add DPS to the group/raid/ect. But, unless I equip my pet with rusty daggers or beg for pet toys.. he hits as hard as I do. I may as well get up there and beat on the mobs by myself.  When we Solo, our pet is suppost to &quot;taunt&quot; this mob off of us. To make a long story short, it sure doesn't. If we could have a pet like a Beastlord Warder who &quot;procs&quot; certain taunts, or if it could Duel Wield... or if it could crit.. or Enrage.. Lifetap.. I don't know. But, Since we aren't Battle warriors ourselves, what about giving us a pet who could actually keep it off of me? <br />
<br />
5. Something special: If you research the Shaman Culture in our society over the years, you will note that Shamans are described as:<br />
<br />
A shaman may exhibit a particular magical specialty (such as control over fire, wind or magical flight). When a specialization is present the most common is as a healer. The distinguishing characteristic of shamanism is its focus on an ecstatic trance state in which the soul of the shaman is believed to leave the body and ascend to the sky (heavens) or descend into the earth (underworld). The shaman makes use of spirit helpers, with whom he or she communicates, all the while retaining control over his or her own consciousness. (Examples of possession occur, but are the exception, rather than the rule.)   <br />
<br />
Traditional shamans developed techniques for lucid dreaming and what is today called the out-of-the-body experience (oobe). Along with these techniques, the NDE or near-death-experience have played a significant role in shamanic practice and initiation for millenia. There is extensive documentation of this in ethnographic studies of traditional shamanism. With this renewed interest in these older traditions these shamanic methods of working with dreams and being conscious and awake while dreaming are receiving increased attention. <br />
<br />
<br />
 The ability to consciously move beyond the physical body is the particular specialty of the traditional shaman. These journeys of Soul may take the shaman into the nether realms, higher levels of existence or to parallel physical worlds or other regions of this world. Shamanic Flight, is in most instances, an experience not of an inner imaginary landscape, but is reported to be the shamans flight beyond the limitations of the physical body. <br />
<br />
(More can be found at http://deoxy.org/shaover.htm#2 about Shamanism) <br />
<br />
If you're thinking of trying to make something spectacular for Shamans, why not research a little and try and find something that we MIGHT be interested in for the next expansion (OoW!). <br />
<br />
-Something along the lines of Lucid dreaming, the ability for us to &quot;posess&quot; a mez'd mob while it's &quot;sleeping&quot; and control it for a time... or disease it? What about giving us a &quot;Finishing blow&quot; AA or ability that we could rip the soul out of the mob and in essence &quot;assassinate&quot; it? <br />
<br />
-Or use it's soul as our &quot;new and improved&quot; pet? Kind of like a charm until the spirit world calls it back?<br />
<br />
-Give us a nuke that is a short cast time, but gives us the power to wield a duel element (Fire and wind, Cold and earth, Fire and Earth, Earth and spirit?) So, essentially we're rooting/snaring a mob into it's place and seering it with Fire/cold/etc with a rain spell. Or Freezing it in a spot (Root) and making it insta-freeze (like Dry ice). Torpor Heals us over time with a snare, why can't we have a nuke that snares for the duration of it's time? This way, we are GUARANTEED That this rain spell we have will work to it's completion. Our rain nukes do not completely hit because once the mob moved out of the rain spell, it was useless.  <br />
<br />
- Give Shamans the ability to reach into the spirit mob and use it's mana or HP for a time? Or maybe use the spell like FA, and &quot;channel&quot; the mob's AC/Str/STA/etc to the melee in our group and the mana to the casters?<br />
<br />
Anyways, that's all I have for now. Thank you for letting me have this opportunity to voice my ideas and opinions. Have a great day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Haagen had an interesting idea with the combined disease dot/debuff.  It's creative and breaks the mold of the same old same old.  Someone else said also &quot;think outside the box.&quot;  Yes it's a potentially cliched saying but some of us are old players and some CHANGE and VARIETY would have great appeal.  Stop repackaging all of the same old stuff we've always had as a new higher level spell.<br />
<br />
I have a lot of concerns but the one that I will continue to harp on is HEALING.  If the level cap is increasing to 70 and lord only knows what sort of encounters and difficulty we will have in OoW will be.  But even if only based on GoD...  in *NO* uncertain terms do I find a new fast heal of 1690hps acceptable.  With healing adept maxed that will get you what, rough guess of around 2k?  I'm terribly *sorry* that I lack hard data, there are others that can and will provide it.  But rest assured that my opinion is not some wildly random thing I grabbed out of thin air.  I have played for nearly 4 years as a Shaman and have been raiding hardcore for 3 of those.  I hope and trust that you would find that my opinion holds some merit.  But as it stands (and this is not a threat!) I cannot even entertain purchasing OoW if Shaman are not going to have their healing rebalanced more appropriately to fit the newer more difficult content we are playing in.<br />
<br />
I really think it was a great sign, and I truly appreciate it, that SOE listened to us about how *useless* our GoD disease dot was going to be and replacing it with Daluda's.  I love Daluda's, it's a step in the right direction.  But as it stands the spell data currently showing for our OoW quickheal falls short of what we need.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Gloriana you need to subscribe the folks (Dev types) to this thread who were participating in the other.  I'd be really surprised if they even look at this thread since it isn't controversial enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">As far as Canni goes, I'd like to change all the existing cannibalize spells to something more like the Ancient version with a larger hp/mana hit with a recast time. Right now I'm waiting for some new spell functionality that will allow me to link spell timers together, as I think being able to memorize multiple cannibalize spells and chain them together would end up with too much mana regen. I think this set up should allow shaman more time to cast other spells rather then chain cannibalizing. (plus the chat spam is annoying)<br />
<br />
All the other Shaman out there are fighting the battle for healing and desirability already, but I just cannot stress the following very specific point enough.<br />
<br />
Ryan, please push for this new spell functionality you speak of.  I believe that if shaman were able to spend more time casting our current heal and damage spells while spending a lot less time maintaining our active mana regen, this change would greatly benefit us.  Such a change might be even comparable to adding a small modifier to the class as a whole while not changing the balance on any specific spell line.<br />
<br />
In other words, giving us more time to use the same amount of mana would increase our potential to contribute during quick fights.  As a wonderful side-effect, this also alleviates some of the chat spam and key mashing we have to do with our canni line :)<br />
<br />
I would have *greatly* renewe joy for EQ if one day I were to check a Shaman spell vendor in PoK to find a spell the likes of Ancient Chaotic Pain.<br />
<br />
On an unrelated note, I spoke with you at the Vegas Fan Faire about spell recovery times and I still get the &quot;spell recovery time not yet met&quot; on various 4+ second cast time spells ;) ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">ok here's your suggestion.  Tho it's gonna be more in the frame of a manifesto.  <br />
<br />
1) Our healing gets changed to match/equal druid healing.  &quot;Having Slow&quot; is no longer a good reason to make us wimps at healing in the highest content.  We bring nothing else to the table, and marginalizing our class on the very PRIMARY SKILL it possesses will have the effect as already seen.  Shaman as a worthless class. <br />
<br />
2) refer to number one.  we are PRIESTS.  We need to be able to HEAL at a COMPETENT level!  <br />
<br />
3) If we do not recieve healing upgrades to an equal level with druids, then kindly remove slow abilities from the following classes:  Bard, Beastlord, Enchanter.  That should also fix our desirability, even if it will make things quite a bit harder to get a &quot;balanced group&quot; together.   <br />
<br />
Sorry for calling you a suck up Glori.  Hope you don't delete this one too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Zethrir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">I have 2 mains areas of concern:<br />
<br />
1.  Healing / slow<br />
If the reason for our lower healing capability is due to our slow, then I feel we should have a fast casting unresistable slow, as heals don't get resisted. Balance of the Nihil is a step in the right direction, but -40 resist adj is by no means unresistable.<br />
<br />
Now theres a thought for a new NPC cast debuf spell, how about having NPC's cast spells which cause a PC to have a chance as 'resisting' beneficial spells :p <br />
<br />
2.  DPS<br />
I think our dps is underpowered for the class in the current state of the game and the only viable way to fix this would be to increase our nuke power.  I don't think we should nuke as good as the Druid or Magician, but an increase so we are inline with the Necromancer seems appropriate.<br />
<br />
As it currently stands our best DPS single target nuke is the level 54 spell Blast Of Venom (3.9 cast time, 2.25 recast time, 680  damage: 680 / (3.9 + 2.25) = 110.57 dps, in a best case scenario)<br />
<br />
I think our level 61 spell Spear of Torment should be increased to do 840 damage, with the other parts of the spell staying the same (apart from a mana cost increase), which would put us inline with the Necromancer in terms of nuke power.  And that the proposed new nuke spell for the next expansion Obkin's Spear of Venom should do 1095 damage.<br />

There is no possible way that I can fill that role anymore as group healer.<br />
(One more role in EQ which was striped away from shaman)<br />
<br />
We need some type of group heal, preferably some type of group HoT (just so we can be different from paladins).<br />
<br />
DOTs.  I dont mind if they do not last their whole duration as long as they dont get resisted as bad.  Our bane spell is rediculously resistant, to the point of almost being useless.<br />
As for the agro they make,  I would just like to know why the DMG vs AGRO our dots make is twice that of a DD nuke that has even been criticaled. (mob runs after me right after I cast Bane, even when a wizzy just criticaled a 4k nuke on it).<br />
Since there are more advantages of using a DD then a DoT, I do not see any logic behind makeing DoTs more agro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Hi all, Ugguk has a very good post on the first page and I agree 100% with his assessment that the most pressing issues are burst healing and burst damage.  To summarize my concerns: 1) more than 2 shaman on raids do not stack well 2) because of slow mitigation and lack of dps shaman are having increasing difficulity getting into newer content experience groups.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my &quot;ranting&quot; post : &quot; I just know that when I am in a GOD group (or a bad LDON hard group, lol) my spot heals which are only used in an emergency are not sufficient for their intended use. I know that in a raid situation that having long casting DD's (that don't pack much punch) rarely make it to typical clearing mobs who are dead by the time it lands.&quot;<br />
<br />
Since I am not providing stats and #'s and I can hardly speak for the developers who are balancing everything including content, classes, etc. I simply point out what I consider to be obvious but might not appear to be &quot;on paper&quot;.<br />
<br />
I personally feel that increasing burst healing rather than healing over time is a more important consideration given todays hard hitting and relatively low hit point mobs.  I also believe that lessening the casting duration of our DD's is a more favored fix for fast paced shaman playing styles in harder content experience groups since we tend to malos and slow. Also we would like to be able to contribute at least a touch of damage in non-boss raid situations.<br />
<br />
I also respectfully suggest as others have that the short FA duration and the absence of a wears off message is tedious.  Additionally, many of us shaman would very much like to out of group shrink either with confirmation or in raid-only (either one is fine).<br />
<br />
Certainly there are other ways to increase shaman direct and indirect dps, thru pet, buffs, melee, dots, etc.  Personally, except for DOT's which can not be efficiently or safely used in modern EQ grouping or raiding I don't care where the extra dps comes from.  I just think that increasing the punch of our DD's and lowering the casting time it an obvious and easy fix. As an aside, I have always wondered why our AC line did not stack with cleric's virtue since it hardly seems overpowering.<br />
<br />
DOT's are a totally broken type of damage in much of modern EQ due to agro issues and/or short duration fights so no need to discuss that as an option to help the grouping 65 shaman in experience groups or raiding. Now am not I totally discounting DOT'S - no - they are fine for small group play and soloing.  Maybe they will make a strong comeback if solo LDON ever gets realized.<br />
<br />
That leads me back to DD's, and the long casting time issue.  Also, I have wondered about the lack of available poison focus items to increase the potential damage if the shaman chooses to use spear of torment rather than cold?  <br />
<br />
Lastly, I will re-post another topic I mentioned previously - &quot;I know that cannying all the time creates carpal and really isn't a big part of balancing, and having an ancient spell in GOD to partially remedy that will be like torpor was in the old days - in the hands of very few because of a coding mistake. Why not just double canny4 and extend the recast time if you are worried about shaman chain cannying?<br />
<br />
That's all for now. Everyone have a nice day.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I'm a 65 shaman with about 300aas and a fair number of leader points in a guild that farms Time and is working our way through Uqua.<br />
<br />
I'd normally go all into reams of numbers, but I'll refrain for the most part here.<br />
<br />
Major issues:<br />
1.  Healing.  Everyone knows we need better healing.  Shaman are a priest class.  Any single priest class should be able to function as the main and single healer for an xp group anywhere (named mobs don't count ie Kod'Taz named or Bot tower bosses or whatever).  With max AAs, my best heal is 1547 (plus focus item).  That heals just over 1/10 of the HPs a well equiped tank has.  That's pretty sad.  Shaman and druids heal for the same ammount from level 1-57.  We get severly left by the wayside when they get their first cheal type spell, and we get a very poor one.<br />
Suggestion:  Shaman quick heals need to be upped to 1800-2000 with God, and if levels are going up in OOW, shaman heals should probably be jumped up to 2k-2200 probably (depends how much mobs hit for)<br />
<br />
2.  Slow.  Everything mitigates slow in new expansions or is immune.  Gimping our other spells because we have slow isn't acceptible anymore.  There are many other classes with slow, and they aren't all gimped.  They are all desirable for groups due to other things we bring to the group.  I've managed to acquire the new slow, and I totally love it.<br />
Suggestion:  The duration would be nice to increase a bit more for the seldom occurance that a mob even lives for 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
3.  Stat buffs.  Nearly useless.  Damage output from stat buffs is mediocre in increase.  10 attack translates to roughly 1% more damage output.  Attack buffs are good for dps.  Stat buffs provide nearly zero parsed dps increase, and certainly no noticable increase to the average person.  With high end gear, stat buffs are totally useless.  The only people in my guild of 70+ active people that ask for sta/agl are recruits that haven't been geared up yet.<br />
Suggestion:  no more simple stat buffs.  we have good enough ones.  let shaman buffs go over cap, but don't give us any more stat buffs.  if you want us to get more cool buffs, give us ones that are unique like +strikethrough, +shielding, +spellsheild, +accuracy, etc.<br />
<br />
4.  FoS is only a hp buff for most people.  STR and Dex are wasted on tanks that would have 400-500 unbuffed str if the cap didn't restrict it.<br />
Suggestion:  keep the HP portion of the buff.  scrap the str/dex component as it's now unnecesary at high level.  give other combat effects to it instead mentioned above.<br />
<br />
5.  Avatar is only a 140 attack buff for 10 minutes (with AAs and focus).  Rangers can buff similar attack in group form for much much much longer.<br />
Suggestion:  Make a group avatar.  increase all duration of avatars to 30 minutes minimum.<br />
<br />
6.  Regen.  20hp regen is nearly useless when well equiped people have 7-12k hp.<br />
Suggestion:  increase regen spells by a factor of 5 in how much they heal per tick.  make it noticable, and a desirable buff.<br />
<br />
7.  Heal over time.  They don't heal enough.  In Kunark, when we got torpor, I used that as my primary heal, and chloroblast if it wasn't healing enough.  It healed as much per tick as a mob hit for max damage.  HOT spells haven't gotten much better, but mobs hit for easily 3-4 times as much.<br />
Suggestion:  increase the healing and casting cost of HOT spells by a factor of 4 (AAs not included).  I'd love to see Quiescence heal 1k per tick, and cost something like 600 mana.<br />
<br />
8.  Nukes.  Too slow to cast ice nukes.  VERY FEW and far between poison dd focus increases.  Nuke for inconsequential damage.  We used to go neck and neck with druids for nuking ability up to level 50, then got left by the wayside.<br />
Suggestion:  increase nuke damage by 25-50% that shamans have at upper level.<br />
<br />
9.  Dot.  Where to begin.<br />
9a.  Dots are slow, and don't usually go full duration.  Obviously mana inefficiencies dotting mobs with 45 second dots that only live for 30 seconds (including debuff time).<br />
9b.  Dot aggro.  Typical situation is that if a shaman slows a mob, and dots it once with bane or blood, a tank with less than elemental plane quality weapons (bow, sews, ele god loot, time weaponry, etc) tries to pull aggro, it's tough.  If a shaman slows, and dots twice with band and blood or blood and ancient 60 poison dot, the shaman tanks the entire fight.<br />
9c.  Resist rates.  Our dots absolutely need malos to land on a mob before it's worthwhile for us to try dotting a mob.  Compare this to druids and necros who have little problems stacking their dots from what I know.<br />
9d.  Disease dots blow.  They take 2+ minutes to go full duration.  Fights go for 45 seconds.  They aren't any good except for Boss Luclin targets that aren't immune to disease (like Emp and VT), or for some soloing in places like ele planes, but this involves tedious spell swapping between diseases and poisons every mob.<br />
When you add it all up, our dots suck.  They take way too long to go full duration for the fast ones, and and way too freaking long for diseases.  Even when we can fight something that lives long enough for us to dot more than once, if we do, we become the main tank 90% of the time.  Spell Casting Subtley 3 doesn't fix this.  We have no method of reducing our aggro except by hoping someone else taunts better.<br />
Suggestion:  -half the duration of all poison and disease dots, and double their damage output per tick.<br />
-scale aggro of a dot with the aggro a wizard would get for a comparable sized nuke.  They can nuke for 6k+ without pulling aggro, while a 2k shaman dot pulls aggro no problem.<br />
-add a -20 or -30 resist mod to shaman dots.<br />
<br />
10.  Pets.  Our pets suck.  They parse around 15 or 20 dps from what I remember.  They don't start with spirit of wolf inherantly buffed as a &quot;spirit wolf&quot;.  At level 34 pets helped to tank and do appreciable damage.  At 65, pets are a speedbump and don't do appreciable damage.  They only CC tank easy mobs once the mobs are already slowed and you somehow managed to not get aggro from slow.<br />
Suggestion:  -give shaman pet inherant sow (you gave mage pets inherant armor equiped).<br />
-make shaman pets duel wield without need for equiping them with weapons.<br />
-increase shaman pet dps to 50dps (still about 1/2 that of a good BST pet)<br />
<br />
11.  Debuffing.  Cripple doesn't really do much except help cut down on flurry/rampage.  Reducing the str of an npc doesn't really affect it's dps in any noticable way.  The AC decrease in the mob is very much inconsequential as well.<br />
Suggestion:  Other debuff types that could:  increase chance to miss, drop max damage by x%, make mob noticably easier to hit, reduce mobs ability to parry/block/riposte/etc<br />
<br />
12.  Group heals.  Giving all classes that heal a group heal would be nice.  There's immense numbers of mobs that have AEs.  Having only clerics and paladins being able to AE heal is annoying.  Give shaman and druids ae heals.<br />
Suggestion:  1k mana, 1k group heal, 5 second casting time.<br />
<br />
13.  Rabid bear.  Sucks.  Bad AA.  I bought it for the 50CR buff it gives me, not for the haste.  Shaman melee, assuming a 1:1 ratio weapon goes from about 20dps to about 25 or 30dps with rabid bear.  I can get that total dps from my level 58 dot by right clicking my pants.  For my suggestion, I'll mention the way that the rage line of spells used to work for shaman.  Back when level 60 was max level, the shaman rage line of spells would give you an AC buff, stat buff (I think), and dramaticly increase your regeneration.  The downside was your mana was dramaticly dropping per tick (if you had any mana left), and all your spell gems were greyed out for about 3 or 4 ticks so you couldn't dump all your mana right afterwards.  The regen was huge, but effectively cut you off from spellcasting until you dropped it, so it was kind of a last ditch effort spell at surviving a fight.  It's regen went 5, 10, 20, 40 if I remember right.  Considering how many hps we had in kunark days, and that our best regen spell only healed 15 a tick, this was big.<br />
Suggestion:  -Make rabid bear duration get reduced to 1 second.<br />
-give rabid bear a +250 double attack skill bonus<br />
-give rabid bear a +250 bash attack skill bonus<br />
-give rabid bear a 100hp regen bonus<br />
-give rabid bear a 100% haste bonus<br />
-give rabid bear a mana drain component of 100-200 mana per tick.<br />
Basicly, this lets shaman become melee characters for the duration of the spell, at the sacrifice of spellcasting ability.  Don't make the spell auto-dispell itself when mana becomes totall drained either.<br />
<br />
14.  Spell refresh times.  Why does our AC buff have a refresh time of 10 or so seconds?  Why does the rage line of spells still have a hugely massive recast time on it and all spells (see #13 above for why it used to have a huge recast time which is no longer warranted).  Why does Avatar have to have such a long recast time considering how good other attack buffs are such as BST or RNG.<br />
Suggestion:  remove recast times on these spells.<br />
<br />
15.  Improved invisibility.  Shamans lack this spell.  Mages, wizards, enchanters all have improved invis.  Druids and rangers have AA invis instant cast.  Necros and Shadowknights have circlet of shadow instant invis.<br />
Suggestion:  give shaman improved invisibility<br />
<br />
16.  Lack of res.  I don't want real res for us.  Clerics and paladins and necros can keep that right to be able to res.  I'd like for druids and shaman to be able to at least bring a fallen group member back to their body to continue fighting and they can look for an xp res later.  Waiting for someone to run back to CR is highly annoying, or a complete impossibility for some situations (vxed, tipt, sewers, deep sebilis, chardok, etc)<br />
Suggestion:  Give us and druids a 0% xp res that doesn't prevent a later xp res for the body.<br />
<br />
These are just the things I can think of off the top of my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Razzaziah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I'll try to keep this short and organized.<br />
<br />
Part i. What does a shaman bring to the table.<br />
Part ii. What groups are a shaman 'MORE' useful then say a bard or beastlord (i.e. other slowers)<br />
Part iii. myths.<br />
<br />
Part i.  What does a shaman bring to the table.<br />
- Buffs.  Approximately 15% DPS to melee.<br />
- Low healing.  Can NOT be a primary healer except when dumpster diving (i.e. doing lower level content)<br />
- Moderate tanking ability (best of the chain classes), though not sufficent to tank any 1200+ hitting mobs.<br />
- Slow<br />
- Low sustainable DPS ~60<br />
- Medium burst DPS ~ 140-200<br />
<br />
Part ii. What groups are a shaman 'MORE' useful then say a bard or beastlord (i.e. other slowers)<br />
<br />
Why bother with this comparison?  Because shaman are said to be SLOWERS.  That is the common line that people say is their role in life.  So if you grant me that a 50% slow and a 75% slow on a mitigating monster doesnt amount to a hill of beans then we can move on.  If you don't then you simply never play a shaman.  Your group WILL survive without any reprocusions if a mob is 50% bard slowed.  It's a fact.  You wont be medding, you wont be doing anything other then pulling one after the other.<br />
<br />
So what else do they bring to the table? Shaman have the BEST slow, maybe amounting to 5-15% less damage over a long time.  But when you group with a shaman, a LOW dps class.  Doesnt that mean that combat is LONGER, thus whatever damage saved is damage taken due to the longer battles?<br />
<br />
The short answer is YES.  Except when a shaman is buffing a charmed pet, a beastlord or bard are ALWAYS more beneficial towards the goal of &quot;more dps&quot;.<br />
<br />
Detailed example:<br />
Shaman provide: 5-15% DPS to any melee in the group.  Lets assume this is 25% (overestimate) so there is absolutely NO confusion.<br />
5-15% DPS = Not enough to put us even in the league with our class compeditors.  For the purposes of this arguement lets say that the DPS of any melee who is shaman buffed goes up by 25%.<br />
<br />
Beastlords provide: 10% Dps Increase.  Similar STR buffs, and Ferocity.  This is likely an 'underestimate' but is a good ballpark answer.<br />
<br />
Bards provide: 30% melee 15% spell DPS increases.  This is a &quot;underestimate&quot; again.  Bard damage shields, attack, str buffs will all add above and beyond this.<br />
<br />
Grant me the following: <br />
- Shaman DPS 60 (with pet, which dies in 2 hits and I personally find impossible to keep up).<br />
- Beastlord DPS 120<br />
- Bard DPS 50<br />
- Rogue DPS 160<br />
- Wizard DPS 150<br />
- Tank DPS: 100 (high for a shd/pal, but makes no difference)<br />
- Enc pet DPS: 700<br />
<br />
Assume your groups are are one of the following:<br />
Tank, CLR, ENC, One of the above. 3 Rogues.<br />
SHM Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+60+160+160= 587.5<br />
BRD Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+50+160+160= 575<br />
BST Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+120+160+160=540<br />
<br />
Add your buffs:<br />
410*1.25+60=572.5*<br />
460*1.25=575 &lt;-- note I lowered the bard melee dps to 25%<br />
540*1.1=594<br />
* you cant say a shamans dps goes up 25% as a result of buffs<br />
<br />
NOTE: bards add +25% overhaste, and 180 damage shield and +attack. Conservative estimate is 25% increase in dps.<br />
or<br />
Tank, CLR, ENC, One of the above. 2 Wizards.<br />
SHM Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+60+150+150=460<br />
BRD Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+50+150+150=450<br />
BST Total DPS: 100+0+0(no pet)+120+150+150=520<br />
<br />
Add your buffs:<br />
100*1.25 +360= 485<br />
150*1.25 +360*1.15=601.5<br />
220*1.1+ +360= 602<br />
<br />
Does a shaman maintain a lead? When its a PURE melee gorup arguably they are equal across the board.<br />
<br />
However in a caster group a shaman HURTS you.<br />
<br />
So the argument always turns into utility:<br />
shaman can haste, cripple, heal, buff, slow, have a pet, etc etc.  Give it up!  Both classes are a boon to casters BEFORE youa ddin their various utility.<br />
<br />
<br />
Part iii. myths.<br />
- Shaman are good healers.<br />
- Shaman are indespensible slowers.<br />
- Shaman buffs are useful to everyone.<br />
- Shaman buff better then beastlords.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what is my POINT?<br />
<br />
I will never dispute that on paper shaman look good.  But after 2 years of neglect they have not adapted to the game which now exists.<br />
<br />
Shaman basically have far to long a time before their potential is realized.  It takes 20-30 seconds before a shaman debuffs and starts doing dps.  And by that point any other class is so far ahead of them it makes shaman look bad.<br />
<br />
Shaman can not use dots due to their high aggro.<br />
<br />
Reconsider the casting time on DoTs.  Why not make it so they are 1 second? or 2 seconds?  Reconsider removing poison aggro from dots.  It is far to high to do it every tick.<br />
<br />
Reconsider giving shaman some sort of CASTER enhancement.  Perhaps changing our 'SPRIT SHIELD' spells form AC to Runes for spell damage.  I doubt wizards will complain.<br />
<br />
SOMETHING has to be done.  There is simply no way of comparing shaman to other classes (other then solo ability) which places shaman on the forfront.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Well I can think of tons of things to add....<br />
<br />
However I think I am going to limit myself to the rationalization of the maintained heal ratio.<br />
<br />
The 100/64/47 heal ratio was made to balance slow vs our heal to the other priests abilities.<br />
<br />
Now while that ratio has been maintained (only on patch heals and recently I might add not all healing) the balance against slow was tragically lost.<br />
<br />
Heals gained in power over levels and expansions.<br />
Heals have aa and focuses that directly increase them<br />
Heals can now have a critical effect.<br />
<br />
Now in contrast slows:<br />
Slow has stayed static at 75% since level 51.<br />
Slow has no aa or focus that will allow a higher %.<br />
Slows can not have a critical effect.<br />
Slow mitigation was added.<br />
The number of slow immune mobs have increased.<br />
The cost of debuffing went up to land slow.<br />
Now to combat that Nihil was added with a resist debuff.<br />
It has a lower duration and longer recast time but a faster cast.<br />
Shorter fights mean higher mana costs on slow because more mobs need to be slowed and slow is less effective because fights are shorter and not saving the heal mana it once did....<br />
<br />
What has that done to our heal balance if slow is less useful but our heals maintain the same ratios?<br />
Everybody else grew in power but half of our balance got nerfed so we LOST power.<br />
<br />
We had to fight to get the same ratio heals that would have been balanced to slow that many expansions ago.<br />
We had to fight to have Nihil increased to its current level.<br />
<br />
Since we have had to fight for every scrap thrown to us to even be as unabalanced as we currently are we are left with the conclusion that you don't know because we always have to fight to be semi-working.<br />
<br />
PS<br />
I will add a few other things.<br />
Other classes damage is mostly limited by their mana pool.<br />
Shaman is limited by cast times, recast times, and high mana cost.<br />
Remove the high recast from Nihil and Bane and lower the cast time on our cold nuke.<br />
Recast times on MANY of our spells need to be looked at.<br />
Cheeta and VoB (no other class self buff has a nutso recast like that).<br />
<br />
Instead of Diaku we should have received something better like a VoB or Bear form upgrade.... or both since its actually 2 spells.<br />
Our str and dex lines were combined into focus for a reason (decreased spell slots).<br />
You went and made them seperate again in a way and pretty much useless.<br />
The progression to each upgrade of Focus after that should have been to take another stat in and make it part of Focus. Agi should be removed<br />
and put into FoS and Fo7 and the OoW focus should Sta added. Thus opening us up for other spell lines to get upgrades and less buff slots.<br />
<br />
Fix the damage on our 61 (675) poison nuke that actually does less damage than our level 54 (680) poison nuke... and the upgrade we are slated for in OoW is (878) which is in turn based off the bad number that wasnt fixed for PoP.<br />
It is things like that that have us conviced your wrong.<br />
There is way too many incidences of things like this.<br />
<br />
