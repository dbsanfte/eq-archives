<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I looked at a couple of the Stoicism quest threads, and it seems like most folks my level are having no trouble at all killing all the pirates they need.  I did pretty well killing a dozen or so pirates before  all of the sudden like I am getting swarmed by dock patrolmen.  I think for the first 45 minutes or so, someone else was hunting the guards/patrolmen keeping them out of my hair.  There seem to be 4 of them the wander about along in front of the five buildings where the drunken pirates hang out.  Is there someplace there to pull the patrollmen?  I have tried a few spots, but always seem to get adds.  I am level 53, and have both my epic and a jbb.  I can kill a pirate and a guard with ease, but I am often getting two guards/patrolmen along with a pirate.  That is just a bit more than I can deal with.  I should add that the houses I am dragging the drunken pirates out of are to the right as you zone in to dulak harbor.  Am I missing something obvoius?  Where should I be pulling these guys?  I read one post indicating a safe spot across from the second to last building, and found that it works, but seems to be pretty unreliable.  Well unreliable at least for me, perhaps it is just a small area and I am maneuvering around too much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Invis, get one on target, go behind the houses against the wall and pull with malosi/slow.  Will bring a solo everytime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep what warador said. There is no line of sight so long as you have a target can pull to the back of that row through wall. I was pulling to the spot behind there with ..hmmm what was it ,...broken looking still thing?</div></div><hr />

Right by the dock is a chain fence to keep you from falling in the water between the dock and the hill behind the buildings. Camp is right there where the fence meets the hill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are not using pathing or aggro range to your benefit it sounds like.  Watch where the guards path and poke around inside of buildings to see if mobs will aggro on you from inside a building then pick a safe spot to fight and pull the mob to there.  <br />
<br />
You can fight safely in many different spots in Dulak and get the drunken pirates out of middle and end houses if you watch pathing a bit.  You will do best if you run around as little as possible while fighting and try to stand just outside of melee range once you root a mob.  If you are JBB tanking then you don't need wiggle room at all.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;safe&quot; spots go, you can fight easily on every dock entrance to the right of zone entrance, on the strip of ground just outside the porch at the bar, in spots behind the first row of houses to the right of the zone ent, and around the center lighthouse with the 2 trolls in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Where the fence meets the hill is a great camp spot, but can be crowded.<br />
<br />
If you find that it is, try moving up the fence a bit.  You'll come to a pier leading out to one of the ships. <br />
<br />
I used this spot to setup camp.  Just have to watch out for one or two roamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>0791</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yep, where the fence meets the hill is a great spot.  I would only add that there are two mobs in the back of the nearby house that will agro through the wall if you don't root at the end of the fight.  Just keep that house cleared, everything inside can be single pulled except for two mobs in the back corner, and look out for the two wandering patrolmen as mentioned earlier<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks all I was going to try pulling to a spot behind the houses, but after training the zone 3 times in 20 minutes I figured I would get a bit of guidance before diving in again.  I may have my problem solved in that I may be able to convince another guild shaman to help, or I may even get my wife to download/register Ykesha so she can help with her 53 rogue.</div></div><hr />
