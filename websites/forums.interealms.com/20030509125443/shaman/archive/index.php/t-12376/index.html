<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am finishing up my defensive AA right now and was wondering if Channeling focus was worth going for afterwards.<br />
<br />
If you have it, let me know how much of a difference it made for you.<br />
<br />
I am sure the Ogers are gonna have a field day with this thread =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">if you get bashed channeling focus isn't going to save your cast, it's going to get interrupted.  this just decreases the chance of getting interrupted from being pushed.  If you're got LR5 I'm sure that's not happening much anyways.  I'd think there are better things to put points into, but I don't have it yet, and couldn't give you any first hand knowledge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can channel through a bash actually unless you get stunned. However I dont't know how good the AA is, I just have level 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 1 level of CF but it came from a bug.  I had spent the points in MC and they moved on me.<br />
<br />
With just one level I cant notice any differance at all.<br />
<br />
CF is low on my list behind a lot of other aa skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My priority after canni5, no idea if the skill is good or bad but i'm hoping in it.<br />
sometimes we have to slow fast or sometimes we need to heal in emergency<br />
<br />
CH 10sec...<br />
9...8...7...6 scrachhhhh!... you regain your concentration...5...4<br />
<br />
and solo + CF = safer ? (torpor)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I don't have CF and haven't noticed a degradation in my game ;)   Neither do I have the healing focus AA's or innate CHA (if you can belive that!)<br />
<br />
I'd think about ND3 for the free HP's (very important when Can V'ing) and SCRM (for lengthened buffs and more healing out of Torpor/Q)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i have all that .... well not SCRM but thats already planned to be bought soon<br />
<br />
Regen 3<br />
Run 3<br />
MC 3<br />
Canni 5<br />
MGB<br />
SCR 3<br />
CA 3<br />
LR 5<br />
ND 3<br />
SCM 3<br />
CS 2<br />
<br />
<br />
i didnt ask how it compares to other skills i wanted an opinion on the effectivness of the skill itself</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh, and with that list, I'd do QB2 before CF.....  Those high level buffs don't speed cast with Hand of The Master and heaven knows, it's nice to land Q quickly, when the giants are beating bear butt!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">*bangs head against wall*<br />
<br />
ok i guess no one knows how good it is ... just that there is other stuff to get before CF eventhough they dont have CF.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Unei what rank of channeling focus you have?<br />
If I evaded 3 of 5hits, I think even u dont have focusing aa u might have chance to fire off ur slow.<br />
<br />
BUT if you took all 5hits and still get off slow, I would say it definitely worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's one of the most retarded AA skills, 'nuff said.</div></div><hr />
