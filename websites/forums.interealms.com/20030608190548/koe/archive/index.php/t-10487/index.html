<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Did some research and it's Wyverns on cobolt scar that drop the arctic wyvern hides. So I guess I'm farming Wyverns, should be good xp at my level too, range from light blue, to blue, to white, to yellow at my level. Also need velium, which I need to farm of Rygor miners in CC also should be fun. Also you need the coldain temper which is purchasable in Thrug correct? Anyhow, if there are tailors out there that can make this, heck or even close, I'll farm the components and let me know how much of the components you need. I'll get extra components for failures/getting your skill up if there are tailors not quite good enough for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I do a lot of quadding down in CS.  I just sold a stack of the hides you need for that but I thinki plop has about 10 on him right now if you want em.  Ill be on after this week and will look for you when i get on<br />
<br />
Plop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK great, thanks a mill. I think I only need 1 hide per item, but extras would be GREAT for failures, now I just gotta get the velium and find a tailor to do combines for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Plopnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK I officially have 60 Wyvern hides that I am saving for you...<br />
<br />
That might be enough for you to do the tailoring yourself.  Either that or make someone a pretty good tailor.  Send me a tell in game and ill load you up.<br />
<br />
Plop<br />
<br />
If you still need them that is; if not I'm making &quot;arctic wyvern hide car covers&quot; for all the keepers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sweet plop! Honestly I do need to work on my tailoring eventually for the Coldain Shawl quest, but I think it would be better if I gave them to RoW, that will definitely help her getting to 250, I think she's 225 or so now. I'll search for you sometime. Thanks a ton!</div></div><hr />
