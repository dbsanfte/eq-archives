<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a 40 troll shammie of Innoruuk and after leveling for the past month Ive decided to flesh out old Crem.  Im lucky enough to have a brother with an uber wizzie so Im recruiting his services for the canni 2 quest amongst others.  Hes already gotten me a REIF.:D <br />
<br />
Anyway, Ive been trying to find two spells to complete my possible spellbook.  I was disappointed to see that the cleric version of Imbue Sapphire in Neriak is not compatible with shammie action.  Any idea where I can find this spell?<br />
<br />
ALso Shock of the Tainted has eluded me.  Would like to add a non-cold based DD to my repertoire, but the hand man in da swamp doesnt have it nor do the vendors there or in Shadowhaven.  Does the barb in Everfrost hold it?  I just dont know.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shock of the Tainted is Velious, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Sold in Thurg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shock of the Tainted can be found in the Thurg cleric guild.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you can find it in the Bazaar for a light mark up... /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Heh. Shock of the Tainted is bought at the gnome pirates in Iceclad Ocean. I don't remember it ever being in Thurg, hmm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you go to Igloos in Iceclad to get the spell, make sure you buy several 3-5 pp deluxe toolboxes from the gnomes there!! t!<br />
<br />
They are 10 slot and hold giant-size items---make good bank containers!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I bought it in Thurg many moons ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Found it as welll as Tumutuous Strength.  Group buffs are quite the boon.  <br />
<br />
Appreciate the help.  Any troll shammies of Innorruk know where to obtain Imbue Sapphire or did they screw the trolls by Cazic drops AND that unscribable spell in Neriak?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">All the imbue spells are sold in the respective races home town.  I.e.  Imbue Ivory is sold in Halas.   You cannot scribe imbue ivory if you do not follow the tribunal, same deal for the other spells you will not be able to scribe it if your religion does not match the spells (I think I'm remembering this correctly).<br />
<br />
So you should be able to find what you need in Grobb ~ that's where I bought it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cremkorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can find Imbue Amber for the Cazic-Thule portion however I cannot find Imbue Sapphire unless it is perchance with the shadowknights there.  <br />
<br />
Ill try the SK guild and see.</div></div><hr />
