<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">more group buffs are good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you're not 60 and you have to be primary buffer on raids, this buff would be very, very handy. Single-targetting 50+ people with HoS is, in a word, painful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In a word, yes. Here we go...LOL...you knew it was coming....my DRUID friend has a group hp buff!!! Not me! They're 52 and I'm 54! So yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">when the majority of shammies were lvl 50 .. we didnt have hos <br />
<br />
we had to buff talisman of altuna + str + dex ... now you have it in one nice condenced buff, just hurry up and get to lvl 60 for gfos !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">People actually voted no on this one?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Would you like group STA AGI and CHA buffs too at level 49? Group buffing is one of the reasons to reach for level 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heehee -- I'd settle for group Talisman of Kragg. I have group strength and dex. I wouldn't mind casting all three really. I just hate single target buffs with a passion these days. /chugging to 60 as fast as he can. It's funny. I used to want to get to 60 primarily in the hopes that I can get torpor and malo and do the big keels, but now that I raid a fair amount, I find myself yearning for 60 so I can finally cast group focus. I still want torpor, naturally, but my sanity demands group focus. Single-target buffs == the debil ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Let's see Shaman improvement history:<br />

  <br />

Maybe we can ask Verant : Why Shaman lv 49 spell Infusion of Spirit require give an Eternal parchment to BST NPC?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">hmm... let me guess why i want a group version.<br />
<br />
<br />
let see. 18 to 20 melee. Vox Raid. Only Shaman there.<br />
was there when i was 47. Casting Sta, Talisman of Atuna and Deftness on 18 to 20 melee. Good thing there was group Str buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also the only Shaman there.<br />
<br />
Nzak</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">*Bump*<br />
<br />
I wish they would consider this. /sigh, single target HoS = 425 mana X 6 = 2550 mana (not counting specialize kicking in) for a full group, ugh. I'm hating it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, how quickly things are forgotten!<br />
<br />
People were quite happy when finally they didnt have to cast Hp+Str+Dex on every tank and could use one buff finally!<br />
<br />
Now it is too great a bother to cast this one spell, so we want a group version.<br />
<br />
That doesnt mean I dont want you to have that group version, in fact it would fit nicely in the mid50s range.</div></div><hr />
