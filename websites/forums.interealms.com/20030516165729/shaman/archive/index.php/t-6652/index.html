<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kraeger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How much longer duration can you have on torpor really?<br />
If you have all AAs, thats 50% duration right. Torpor heals for 1200 from the start, so It should heal for 1800 then?<br />
And adding the Focus effect, think thats 20% (If it stacks) would push it to 2100. And thats 7 ticks, for the Zephyr or brell on the coldain shawl you need 8 ticks to further increase buff duration. Is there any way you can do this, anyone know ? And would it work?<br />
<br />
<br />
This was more of a question, but it would be nice to hear what you guys have to say about it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Focus 3 items don't work on torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>matumboo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree focus item affect only spells with 8ticks or longer...<br />
<br />
only spell casting reinforcement and quick buff affect torpor.<br />
<br />
So an ubah shaman cast torpor in 3sec and heal 1800 in 6 ticks with 200 mana.<br />
<br />
And i think you cant have more than 50% bonus duration on any spells...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">8 ticks???<br />
<br />
that doesnt sound right, our dots are 7 ticks(poisen ones, 42= 6*7), im im positive that they are effected by EA3.  <br />
<br />
I dont have EA, but i know they are from what people tell me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">correct, our 7 tick dots ARE affected by EA3 (which is very nice btw!)</div></div><hr />
