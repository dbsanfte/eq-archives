<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello,<br />
<br />
Long time lurker, first time poster :)<br />
<br />
I am looking for a shaman channel on Rodcet. There is one named shaman but it has a password. <br />
<br />
Any help?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Junder</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">try passowrd &quot;shaman.&quot;<br />
<br />
On SH it's &quot;shaman:shaman&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Why bother? :p<br />
<br />
On the Rathe there's a 'taxi' channel with the password 'taxi'. Do people not realize that you can make chat channels without passwords?<br />
<br />
It seems sorta anti-effective to have a PW on a utility channel like one for getting TPs. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">a passworded channel stays around for a while (i think a day) even if no one is online, but a non pworded one goes away when no one is in the channel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kudd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Im on RN as well and havent been able to find a chat channel either. Pretty sure i tried shaman:shaman alrdy as well...</div></div><hr />

a passworded channel stays around for a while (i think a day) even if no one is online, but a non pworded one goes away when no one is in the channel. <br />
<br />
And a non-passworded channel is created as soon as someone joins it.  If no one is in the channel, does it really matter if it exists or not? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The real issue is the way autojoin works. It used to be that you couldn't autojoin a channel that hadn't already been created. Passworded channels can be autojoined even if nobody's there.<br />
<br />
I haven't tested to see if autojoin will allow to join a nonexistant channel. It may not. In which case PWs are still required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can autojoin a nonpassworded channel that doesn't yet exist. IE you can create the channel by autojoining it.</div></div><hr />
