<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">why didnt you include this in your other equipment post?<br />
<br />
obulus death shroud is better than crystalline torque.<br />
i think thats obvious.<br />
<br />
what is not obvious is what you are wearing.<br />
<br />
so if you are using UBER_SHOULDER_ITEM_01 and crappy_neck_item_03 then you might want to use the torque huh?<br />
<br />
If both slots are empty you could use both because both are better than empty!  :p <br />
<br />
/clap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I WEAR A CRYSTALLINE TORQUE! saves me mana when I buff on raids; I have an ancient medallion of faith in my pack:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">um, yay for you?<br />
<br />
Ancient Medallion of Faith is pretty nice.<br />
Too bad you can't get your Mana preservation 3 in another slot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">&quot;If both slots are empty you could use both because both are better than empty!&quot;<br />
<br />
hehehe, I like it!<br />
<br />
Actually I posted them seperate as that is more standard armor (hp/ac/etc. in same slot) type questions and this is very specific to a Mana Preservation discussion.<br />
<br />
I like to keep em seperate so if someone wants to link the specific discussion point, readers won't have to wade through the other stuff to get to what they want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Zaspacer - if ya posted a profile it would be easier to give advice that is relevent to your situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok, then here is my current profile:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=238580<br />
<br />
I have finished all but the final turn in for the Cloak of Truth quest (need to find help in taking down the final 2 mobs), but I should have that at some point as well.<br />
That will boost my bonus to med to 12%. (skullcap is 3%, brain is 4%, cloak is 5%)<br />
<br />
Is there any way to avoid getting knocked out of casting everytime I am hit?<br />
Is that where I use a wall?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'd stick w/ the torque.  There are very few good neck pieces, while there are quite a number of good shoulder items (spirit wracked cord, str. of elements, matchless mantles).  Course this all depends on what you've got now (magelo won't load).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol :)<br />
<br />
level 22 shaman worrying about level 3 focus items :)<br />
<br />
Since you have the ODS now, I would stick with it.  It is at least solid in the shoulder slot.  Certainly better items out there, but there are tons of better necklaces than the crystalline torque.<br />
<br />
The neck item you have currently has affliction haste that is useable at your level.  It's pretty easy to get something like a dragon talisman from WW later on, or run twinky out to loot one now... well whenever you are tired of the focus effect or don't use spells under level 44.<br />
<br />
You could also shift the wardog collar to your neck and strap on a JBB, when it comes time for that.  :)<br />
<br />
*note: Focus items dont effect the JBB*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">oh, make sure you put a point into channelling at your trainer.<br />
<br />
it's not an automatic skill.<br />
keep your back to a wall to avoid getting moved, corners are actually the best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hey i think you are covered at least til lvl 55 with that gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zaspacer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ah ha, that's it! )<br />
I gotta go train that skill.<br />
Wish I hadn't just binded in SH. Oh well, ROAD TRIP!<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the input.<br />
<br />
I am really only twinking/upgrading this cat because my main spent his time farming instead of leveling due to system crash problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">That will boost my bonus to med to 12%. (skullcap is 3%, brain is 4%, cloak is 5%) <br />
<br />
It will do no such thing. Only one skill mod item will affect a given skill at a time. There is some question as to what order the game looks to determine which item gets used. It appears that the order is the same order that items are placed on your corpse for looting and the first one found is used regardless of other skill mod items. The evidence on the ordering is not 100% conclusive, but the evidence that only one item works has been absolutely proven.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I prefer the Crystalline Torque to the ODS myself, because the difference in better shoulders items v. the ODS is greater than the difference in better neck items v. the Crystalline Torque.  <br />
<br />
So, I use a Deathwatcher Shroud currently with the Crystalline Torque.  I think that's better than the ODS plus just about any reasonably obtainable neck piece.  <br />
<br />
I pull out a Shrouded Medallion if I feel the need, but that hasn't been too often - or at all really.  <br />
<br />
Crystalline Torque is much underrated, imho.  And much cheaper now than an ODS.</div></div><hr />
