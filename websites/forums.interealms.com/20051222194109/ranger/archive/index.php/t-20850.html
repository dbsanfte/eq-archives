**********************************************<br />
<br />
        <br />
        <br />
Katta Castellum was as quiet as it ever was. Magical lanterns dimly lighted the dark streets, making shadows dance everywhere. There was a haunting quality to the city that scared off many outsiders. Few Norrathians took residence here; the continued darkness was something many were not accustomed to. Even the races that dwelt in darkness were none too comfortable here. The howls of sonic wolves would sometimes echo through the still air from the nearby Tenebrous Mountains, sending chills up one’s spine.<br />
<br />
The view of Norrath was a stark contrast to the city below it. Katta Castellum was ever hidden from the sun. Only the stars and the face of the planet above lighted the sky. Norrath was bright with color. The deep blue seas complimented the green of the land. The swirling clouds mesmerized those who watched, as the white wisps curled around in a myriad of patterns. <br />
<br />
Against the background of Norrath, the towering spires of Katta Castellum looked like dead fingers clawing at the living planet. The towers were far from dead. The dim lights inside the towers belied the activity within. Inside the Magus Congelium, all manner of spellcaster were awake. No matter what time of day, men and women of the craft silently walked its hallways. Some conducted experiments, some researched long lost knowledge in the library, some were in quiet discussion with their fellows, and some just watched it all happen.<br />
<br />
Lasriias sat at a window of the highest tower. His familiar lazily draped over his shoulder, smoke floating from its nostrils. Las enjoyed the view of Norrath. He had only recently set up a residence here. He much liked the quiet and the darkness. He found it to be comforting and relaxing. He had already garnered the trust of the city guard and was slowly gaining the trust of the Magus Congelium. Aside from Nathyn Illuminious and his cohorts, none disliked him. This spot at the top of the tower was his favorite meditating spot. It was a perilous fall from this height, but he was at home nonetheless.<br />
<br />
A grunt and a puff of smoke from his familiar brought the sorcerer out of his contemplation. A small air elemental, approached carefully. It was nervous and from the look of it, very tired. An airy voice reminiscent of the howling wind came forth. “Art thou the Master Lasriias?”<br />
<br />
Curious as to how this elemental had learned of his title, Las nodded. “Yes, I am Lasriias. What would you have of me?” Not another request to ferry someone from a remote location, he hoped.<br />
<br />
“I come at the bidding of my mistress. I have a missive for you, Master.” A vaguely humanoid hand held up a rolled up piece of parchment.<br />
<br />
Raising his eyebrows, Lasriias gingerly took the note from the tired elemental. He unrolled the letter and carefully read it, his eyes narrowing at the mysterious request written within. He turned to the air elemental and spoke. “You may go now.”<br />
<br />
“I-I-I was instructed to guide thee, sir.” The small cloud of air spoke.<br />
<br />
“There is no need… I know the way to Nektulos Forest… rest assured your mistress will not punish you for not guiding me to the forest.”<br />
<br />
“As you wish…” with a small burst of wind, the air elemental vanished from sight.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The platform was worn out from constant use, but its power could be easily heard from the slight humming within. The dark forest of Nektulos stood quietly with little noise from any direction. Those who dwelt here knew that there was more noise than this. The forest only muffled what commotion can be heard. The forest had been corrupted ages ago, it’s evil seeping into the ground and into the trees. The air itself was heavy and smothering. Failed necromantic experiments wandered the woods; their undead existences making them hate anything that lived and breathed. Guardians of the Teir’dal, stone and metal golems, attacked anything that was not recognized as Teir’dal or their evil allies.<br />
<br />
Despite the natural and supernatural threats that lived in the Nektulos Forest, the greatest danger to anyone lay in the hands of the Dread Guard. A force of Teir’dal warriors trained in the arts of death. They attacked first and asked questions later. A tactic that often yielded corpses before answers.<br />
<br />
The humming of the platform gradually grew louder until a crackling noise signaled the opening of a portal. From the portal a hooded figure dressed in dark robes stepped out, looking around carefully. With a gesture, the portal suddenly closed. The forest was quiet again, save for the slight humming. <br />
<br />
The figure moved quickly and whispered a short incantation. Upon speaking the last word, the robed personage disappeared.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The retinue of dark elf guards passed noisily by, their armor and weapons clanking louder than their reputation spoke of them. The Dread Guard of Neriak was confident in their supremacy over this forest. Nothing could escape them in their dark abode. Yet for all their confidence, a wood elf watched as they passed him not an arm’s length away. He was a hunter, but today his prey was not these evil elves. He had someplace to be. Moving with the retinue, ever hidden from plain sight, he followed them to the northern reaches of the wood, just where the Lavastorm Mountains started to burn their way into the Nektulos.<br />
<br />
<br />
***<br />
The dry heat greeted the half elf as the discorporating wind materialized him amidst the ancient druidic rings. His companion, a female wood elf materialized to his right. She nodded at him, a smirk on her face.<br />
<br />
“Let me give you the spirit of eagle to hasten your trip, my dear.”<br />
<br />
Smiling thankfully, the warrior made his way through the hills and crevices at the foot of the Lavastorm Mountains. His stride was confident, displaying his prowess to the fire dwelling creatures that may decide to make a meal of him. <br />
<br />
The druid watched him, her eyes on his legs, her gaze slowly working its way up. The smoke and gases from the fissures rose up behind the warrior, making him fade off in the distance. Astilbee sighed longingly as his form disappeared. Reaching out towards the ground, she brought up a carrot. Surprised that a tuber can survive here, she took a bite, all the while looking out towards where her warrior had disappeared.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The robed figure waited atop the rock that marked the end of the Nektulos Forest. Northwards on the path was the Lavastorm Mountains. He was early, the appointed time to meet was a few hours from now, when the sun would set and the fiery peaks of the Lavastorm Mountains would light the night sky with shades of reds, oranges and purples.<br />
<br />
“Master Las…” spoke a familiar voice.<br />
<br />
“Hunter Trev…” replied the robed man. “Your attempts to surprise me unprepared are growing more feeble, dear brother. My days in the quiet of Katta Castellum have helped to sharpen my senses. Not as keen as yours but enough to detect you.”<br />
<br />
“Bah! As usual, you’re no fun anymore!” the ranger complained.<br />
<br />
The older high elf chuckled. “You know, I wager that Harne has received one of these… as have you?” Lasriias held out the invitation.<br />
<br />
Trevian nodded. “Shall we?” He asked, grinning.<br />
<br />
Lasriias smiled.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Harne made quick work of the shadowed men that attacked him. He was tired from fighting off four attackers, but he was less hurt than he looked. Now he stood floating above the rock that was the meeting site. Grunting, he sat down and proceeded to remove his armor. The bandaging should be quick, he thought. There may be enemies lurking….<br />
<br />
“CAW! CAW!” <br />
<br />
Harne grabbed his twin swords turning around prepared for a battle. A bolt of fire came rushing down towards him, missing him by a few inches. Harne turned to face the direction of the attack. A tingling sensation suddenly overcame his body as blue light circled him. His head jerked back as he felt the cool light heal his wounds.<br />
<br />
He took up another combat stance as he waited for another attack. His eyes darted back and forth, taking in his surroundings. A muffled laugh caught his attention and he pointed his blades towards it. “I can hear you!” he shouted.<br />
<br />
“And we can easily hear you, noisy warrior.” Came a quiet voice behind him.<br />
<br />
Harne turned about, swinging his swords at the figure that appeared before him. His blades would have easily cut this man in two, but it met an invisible barrier. His eyes betrayed his confusion. “Huh? What are you doing here?”<br />
<br />
Lasriias smiled. “Making fun of the oldest one. What else would your two siblings be doing to you otherwise, Harne?”<br />
<br />
Harne sighed. “I could have killed you! Do you know how close you were to dying?”<br />
<br />
A high-pitched voice mimicked “Do you know how close you were to dying?” Trevian stepped from the shadows, trying hard to muffle his laughter.<br />
<br />
Shaking his head, Harne smiled. “AHH!! You two!! Come her and give me a hug!”<br />
<br />
Las looked at the sweaty dirt stained warrior. “I do not think so.”<br />
<br />
Harne launched himself at the wizard, hugging his brother tight, making sure to dirty the pristine robes. Once he was satisfied with the disgusted look on his brother’s face, Harne went after the ranger. Trevian tried to run away, a look of fear on his face. But somehow Harne caught him. Trev gave in and hugged his brother back…<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Night had fallen when the red robed figure appeared. Her dark blue skin and white hair plain for all to see, she carried a scepter in one hand. A red glow emanated around her other hand. She looked around the rock where the meeting was to take place. No one was there. Whispering a word, an enormous elemental came into being, guarding her closely. Glancing around again, she sat down.<br />
<br />
“Why did you ask us to come?” A voice whispered.<br />
<br />
Startled, the magician stood up, her elemental ready to attack. “Come out and show yourselves!” she shouted.<br />
<br />
The air shimmered next to her as Las appeared out of thin air. The dark elf gasped. “Y-y-you?”<br />
<br />
Lasriias smiled. He gestured for the dark elf to look behind her. Harne had appeared, ready to take on her elemental. Las tilted his head and his eyes darted towards Trevian, bow ready, a short distance away.<br />
<br />
“Again, why have you asked us to come?” Las asked.<br />
<br />
The dark elf was alarmed but she sighed. The brothers would not kill her arbitrarily. They would need a reason to take her life. At least she knew Trevian and Lasriias need a reason. Harne on the other hand, he was different…<br />
<br />
“I-I-I…. come bearing news of your father…” she stammered. “Please put down the weapons and lay aside your spells. I am here as a friend.” She opened her arms out in surrender.<br />
<br />
Reluctantly the brothers lowered their weapons. The woman whispered a quick word and her elemental discorporated.<br />
<br />
“I apologize for the secrecy of the meeting. What I am doing is punishable by death. The Dread Guard may be after me… I suspect that they may soon come to find me… but I owe your father this much at least…” <br />
<br />
“Who are you?” Las asked calmly.<br />
<br />
“My name is Aerunaya. I am a magician friend of your father. I… I was his childhood friend…”<br />
<br />
“Childhood friend?” Harne queried.<br />
<br />
“Yes… I do not think you know it, but as you may remember, your father was a half-elf. He looked human save for a few elven features. What you may not know is that his elven half was Teir’dal.” She explained. She saw the shocked look on the brothers’ faces. “I know it sounds incredulous, but it is true… if it were not for the dark elven blood, you would not be who you are today. You three have the taint of Innoruuk…”<br />
<br />
Trevian drew his blades. “I don’t believe you.” He growled.<br />
<br />
Aerunaya raised her hands up in defense. She backed away slowly. “If it were not for the Teir’dal blood, then why did Harne invade the Plane of Growth? If it were not for the Teir’dal blood why did the youngest of you three, change his name from “the elven light” to Trevian, the name of a celebrated Teir’dal hero? And if not for the Teir’dal blood why does Lasriias possess a Rainment of the Chosen, a robe that only Innoruuk’s favored may wear?<br />
<br />
“The tainted blood is in you all… refuse to believe it if you must, but it is the truth.” The dark elf’s eyes narrowed. She stopped and stood steadfast.<br />
<br />
Las’ hands glowed. “I could kill you where you stand.” He calmly stated.<br />
<br />
“Yes I know. I would not do this, if I did not love your father… “<br />
<br />
“Love? The words Teir’dal and love are far from synonymous, lady.” Trevian spat.<br />
<br />
“Yes, Teir’dal are capable of love… it is forbidden, but it does happen. Lasriias should know this best among the three of you. He has enjoyed the companionship of a few dark elven women.” She retorted. <br />
<br />
Lasriias stayed silent, a slight flush colored his cheeks.<br />
<br />
Catching them off guard, the woman stood up unwavering. She snickered softly, “Before you kill me, allow me to show you your father’s legacy to you.” Opening her belt pouch, the dark elf produced three rings. “You had thought your father was slain by the Ring of Scale, just as your mother was. And so the vendetta you have pursued against the dragons of Veeshan’s Peak. But you are wrong…”<br />
<br />
The rings were mithril, each delicate but sturdy in design. Inset each ring was a different stone. An emerald set with a leaf design that seemed to grow around the ring, bore the elven symbol of the number “three”. A sapphire that was centered upon the iris of an eye was set into a plain ring, bearing the etching of the elven number “two”. A ruby set within the hilt of a sword that circled around, completing a ring with the elven symbol for the number “one” etched within.<br />
<br />
The brothers stared in awe. Each ring was created when they were born. Their father, Lartanthos, wore each with pride. This way, his sons would always be with him on his travels. When he would see his sons, he would show them the rings and always tell them, “We are a family, and we always take care of our own. These rings always remind my heart of you. I may be in another part of the world, but I will always have you with me.” The last the brothers ever heard of their father, he was taken by a dragon and never seen again. The three boys vowed vengeance for their father’s death. Their mother mourned his passing and shortly after, she herself had perished to the poisons of dragonkind. <br />
<br />
Left with family friends, the brothers quickly grew independent of their caretakers and looked after each other. They did not think much of how their father passed away, until now.<br />
<br />
Lasriias took all three rings and walked off. His brothers watched quietly as he mumbled an incantation and his eyes glowed briefly. After a few moments of silence, he looked up at his brothers, tears starting to well up in his eyes. “They are his rings.” He whispered hoarsely. He held out the rings to his brothers. <br />
<br />
Harne held up the ruby ring to the stars, blinking back his tears. “Show me the ring, father.” He remembered his father proudly showing him that he was the “one”. His father’s voice came back “You are the one, and you must take care of your brothers always. They look up to you, so you must be strong, like your mother. And when others see your strength they will follow you.” The words rang true.<br />
<br />
Trevian gingerly picked up the ring, sadness overcoming him. He remembered always sneaking up on this father, catching him by surprise. And each time he startled his father he would demand to see his ring “Show me mine! Show me mine!”. Trevian put on the emerald ring as tears streamed downs his cheeks. The voice of Lartanthos echoed in his mind, “My sneaky son, you should be a rogue! But you are like your lovely mother; the wolves and bears have a liking of you. Perhaps you’ll be a ranger or a druid like your mother.”<br />
<br />
Lasriias held the sapphire ring tightly. He breathed heavily, trying to hold back the flood of tears. The strongest memory he had of his father was when he asked, “Can I be a wizard, father?” and his father smiled down at him. Picking up his son, the father whispered, “You can be anything you wish to be! And whether you be a wizard or a baker, I will love you the same.”<br />
<br />
Turning to Aerunaya he whispered, “Please… tell us what happened.” The other two nodded in unison.<br />
<br />
Aerunaya’s eyes were filled with sorrow. If only she and Lartanthos had been one, perhaps these three young men would be her sons. “Your father was a bastard half-elf. I do not know the details of his parentage, but he was Teir’dal. I befriended him in the orphanage. It is not a kind place to be, but he protected me and because of that I did my best to be his friend. The Teir’dal hated his human side, but it seems that Innoruuk’s priests had plans for a half-human half-Teir’dal. When he was of age, Lartanthos was taken to the barracks.<br />
<br />
“I remember that day… I did not want him to leave so I held onto him. The soldiers did not like my behavior. They were eager to punish me, but your father intervened and volunteered to take my punishment. They laughed at him and for that they punished us both. Twenty lashes later, neither of us had strength to cling to each other.<br />
<br />
“It was ten years later that I saw him again… He had grown into a strong man. He was as handsome as ever. And he wore the uniform of the Dread Guard. He had risen in rank faster than anyone would hope. He commanded his own troop and even though he was half-human, the Guard respected his prowess. His charisma brought him many followers.” Aerunaya stared at Harne, so like his father.<br />
<br />
“He did not recognize me at first, I wore the robes of a mage apprentice. But when he finally knew it was I, he hugged me tightly. He did not care that his men saw this weakness. For all my intentions of being his mate, he did not think of me in such a fashion. He called me his little sister… it was not how I wanted to be thought of, but it was better than being nothing to him.<br />
<br />
“In the years that followed, he led missions into the territories of the good elves. His predominantly human half-elven appearance made it easy for him to infiltrate the city of Kelethin. On some of these missions I was sent to wait for him in the orc stronghold of Crushbone. I would take his missives and deliver them to the priests in the Lesser Faydark. <br />
<br />
“It was on one of these infiltrations that he met your mother, Tesansala. Something about her struck a chord in him. Before long he was enamored with her… He tried his best to attain her affections. It took all of his patience, but when she finally spoke of her feelings for him he was overjoyed. He was reluctant though, to proceed further. He loved this woman dearly, but he refused to lie to her. He risked losing her love when he told your mother of his Teir’dal heritage. She did not believe it; she thought it was a jest. Then he took her to a secret place in Crushbone. There, hidden from prying eyes, she witnessed his true identity. She was appalled…<br />
<br />
“She left him and did not want to see him any longer. I was pleased that they were no longer a couple. Yet, I felt a great gloom come upon me every time I saw Lartanthos and the cheerless expression on his face. I cared deeply for him and did not want him hurt… and unlike many dark elves, I chose to sacrifice my own happiness for his… I sent Tesansala a message… We met at this very spot.<br />
<br />
“She did not trust me, of course. But somehow, I was able to acquire her attention. She listened to me and how I felt about Lartanthos. She lamented of losing him. In the end, she left with a thoughtful heart.<br />
<br />
“It was weeks later that Lartanthos told me he had won her back. He did not know of my role in this, but I was content with that. He was happy. And that was all that mattered. When your parents joined in marriage, I was present. Your father did not think anything when your mother kissed me and thanked me.<br />
<br />
“From time to time I would cross paths with Tesansala. She was kind as always. Sometimes, her kindness was sickening, but nevertheless I understood. When each of you was born, your mother took you to me in secret. With each of your births, she had commissioned a ring. She showed me each when she brought you. They were for Lartanthos, she said. I was jealous of her. She had a family I wanted, a family with him. But I saw your father in each of your faces. I was charmed by all of you.<br />
<br />
“Shortly after Trevian was born, I was sent away to Kunark. A beachhead was established and the darker races wished to make a foothold on the lost continent. I there for years… when I returned to Neriak, I received news that your father had disappeared. I was distraught. I set out for Felwithe to see upon your mother. When I arrived, I used cloaking magics to come to your home. She was gone, and the house was abandoned. I later learned that she had died and that foster parents took you in.” Sighing, the dark elf smiled gently. She was much relieved that these children had done well on their own.<br />
<br />
“Where did you find the rings?” Harne asked.<br />
<br />
“I had only recently returned to Neriak. It was not so long ago, that I was visiting the prison quarters. I stumbled into the priests dragging away a tortured prisoner. Normally I would not take note of such things, but something caught my attention. The prisoner wore a silver chain with three rings looped through it. He no longer had hands or feet. The bloody stubs were covered in dirty rags and his face was badly beaten. I think he was dead, for when I came back to look upon the man, he longer breathed. I looked at the rings… I knew them as well as I knew the beaten face…” Tears started to flow from Aerunaya’s violet eyes.<br />
<br />
Aerunaya sobbed and her body shook with every word. “That night I used my magic to hide your father’s body. I took him away and hid him. I found out later, that the priests brought him back to life every day. And every day they would heal him and torture him. His hands and feet would be severed, his body burned, his face crushed… he… he would die… And the next day he would be brought back to life just to be tortured again and again.<br />
<br />
“The priests punished him so because he betrayed Innoruuk… I kept his body well hidden until I could prepare him for burial. But somehow the priests found me. If it were not for my elementals, I would have also been taken… I escaped, but your father… his body is still secreted away.”<br />
<br />
The three brothers were stunned by the news of their father’s demise. Harne was both sad and angry. His face burned with such fury that death would have fled from his rage. Trevian was pacing back and forth, his barely contained anger held in check. Lasriias sat quietly, tears still flowing from his eyes; eyes that burned with an ancient magic long ago lost.<br />
<br />
Through tears and anger, Las spoke, “Please tell us where we can find my father. He deserves a proper burial.” The other two brothers stood by their sibling, nodding in agreement.<br />
<br />
Aerunaya swallowed her tears. “Come, I will show you.”<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
That night a mysterious fire raced through Neriak. Some say it was an elemental beast. Some say it was a demon from the pits of the netherworld. Others contend it was a small band of dark elves, a band of the Dragoons gone insane. Whatever it was, no one dared say it was a small group of elves. Neriak had never been entered with such a small force. And never was it damaged so badly. It seemed that an army had ravaged the city with blades, arrows and spells. <br />
<br />
Many buildings were destroyed, but no residence was touched. Whatever struck Neriak seemed to have targeted only the most prominent structures. The worst damage was upon the temple to Innoruuk. Its walls had collapsed and the high priest was found with bits and pieces of him strewn about the main altar, his head skewered upon his unholy sprinkler. The other priests and priestesses present were found dead. Some were found with numerous arrows in them, making the bodies look like pin cushions. Others were cut in two, a mighty blade cleaving them from shoulder to groin. Those who were not accounted for were assumed to be the piles of dust and bone found about everywhere.<br />
<br />
Whatever damage was done, the dark elves knew only one of their own, filled with the hate of Innoruuk, could have done this. <br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
The Combine Spires in the Dreadlands crackled with magical energy. The two robed figures stood somberly. “Do not worry. Where I am taking you, the Dread Guard will not find you…” Lasriias offered his hand to Aerunaya. She was family now. And family takes care of its own.</div></div><hr />
