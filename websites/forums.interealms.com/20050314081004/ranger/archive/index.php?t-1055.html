<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been told that the little needle guys in Echo caverns are AWSOME exp solo at around 25 to 30.  My question is how doable are they for a 23 ranger solo?  I figure since I started over with my ranger I might as well do some new hunting grounds while I'm at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tenien</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't know how they will be at that level.  Been killing them with my SK alt at 30.  They hit very fast but not too hard.  One on one is easy, 2 tough, 3 may kill you.  AC around 690 with MoSS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">04-10-2002, 02:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">one on one easy at 30? but 2 on 1 is hard at 30?   that may be a bad thing at 23 then.   Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

Once that peters out at 27 do the needlites.  They hit machine gun fast but for low damage so keep that root up to make sure only 1 is beating on you at a time.  At 30 they become much easier as they beat themselves to a pulp on your new damage shields.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thyramon</div><div class="date">04-19-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ran through Echo on my way to fungus grove doing the Trade commissioner's quest a day or two ago, at 15, I couldn't hit the needlites after I wandered into there hive (okay, I can't follow maps and steer around red mobs at the same time) but even with 3 of them on me, I had enough time to make it all the way back to a guard without losing more than 3 bubbles of health..and I wasn't even sowed at the time.  They hit really fast, but none seemed to hit for more than 9-11 hp..<br />
<br />
Just an FYI...:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twylight</div><div class="date">04-23-2002, 10:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I camped here at 27 and have ridden this camp until 31.   At 27 I could take the whole camp one at a time working around clockwise.   Each clear of the camp gave me a full yellow bubble of exp at 27 with a 5 min rest/med period between respawn of the first one I killed.<br />
<br />
At 30 I was still getting 3 blue bubbles of exp for a clear of the camp.   I went from 27 to 31 in 5 hours of play time.  It's INSANE exp for a ranger.  Make sure your snare lands because you will have a hard time taking two of these buggers before 30.<br />
<br />
Also, the queen spawns every so often and is 28th level.  She drops a nice int caster only cloak and can be soloed at 30 with the damage shield up.<br />
<br />
Have fun !!</div></div><hr />
