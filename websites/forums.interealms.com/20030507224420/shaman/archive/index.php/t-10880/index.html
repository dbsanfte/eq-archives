Getting into the factory is no problem but I can probably only get one really solid group of high 60s to play with me maybe with another group of with a smattering of mid-high 50s and low 60s.  I am under the impression it would probably take more than that.  I noticed that quite a few shammys here have these items and didn't know if anyone had some time to jot down a strategy on how to get them.  Any thoughts?<br />
<br />
ps.  tried searching for info and my weak search skilz turned up nothing.  please link a thread on this if one already exists.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dams</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">any idea of the minimum force strength needed to get to and take out a behemoth?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hullk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Both of those items drop off of the Manaetic Prototypes.  I think there are 3 of them total, and each have a chance of dropping them.<br />
<br />
They prototypes aren't too difficult.  A guild mini raid did them with less than 3 groups of 60-65.  They hit for 450ish, quad, flurry, and enrage.  They also do an AoE oil spray, I think it's the same AoE as the clockwork dragon.  Curable with radient cure 1.<br />
<br />
They also tend to banish the tanks into the other Manaetic prototype rooms, which can be quite annoying.  Each Prototype room has 2-4 of the clockwork golems in the same room serving as guards.<br />
<br />
They can be slowed relatively easily at 65, but it's only 'partially effective'.  Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
