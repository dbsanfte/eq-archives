<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Where could i take my Mage who is lvl 65 to basically kill for the shaman and lvl him quickly?  Would Dulak work even though the mobs are LB to the Mage?  Basically i want to Kill stuff with the mage while the Shaman sits back and absorbs exp.  Please post if you have a solution to my problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you want max exp for the shaman:<br />
<br />
Go somewhere where the mobs are green to the mage but still exp mobs for the shaman (with the exp changes made recently this has become harder to find).  Group them.  Mage kills, shaman gets exp.<br />
<br />
Having said that I think that doing that type of exping is a terrible disservice to the shaman.  When the shaman joins groups and gets agro from a slow and doesnt have maxxed defense it will show in how fast his hp drop.  When the shaman fizzles 3 slows and spends 20% of buffing mana on fizzles it will show.<br />
<br />
Just my thoughts</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BRC223</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My shaman Currently is 200 offense 200 Defense.  As well as 235 alteration and Conjuration.  The only thing he is lacking skill wise is Divination which is only 150, the same goes for Abjuration at 124, and Evocation at 187.  Thanks for the heads up though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">go someplace like velks and just tear **** apart. Have shammy slow and sick dog dog, and heal. Rinse repeat and watch the xp fly.</div></div><hr />
