<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Romp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know this may seem really dumb to ask but if verant has done such a good job of race balancing at upper levels..is race just flavoring till you get to your 50s?<br />
<br />
I have spent the last week or so sending tells to about 40 different shaman of all races in their 50s to 60s asking them if they would change their race, what do they mainly do at their levels and is wisdom the stat to pump up for new shaman or hits?<br />
<br />
Not one would change their race, I never got a consensus on whether higher wisdom is more important for bigger mana pool, or more hits is better to survive AoEs and canni 3 and 4s?  <br />
<br />
Ogre stun was said to be nice when you threw slows and a mob swung your way..but none of the ogre shaman meleed much so it was not so important at their levels as it was when they were wee shamans..regen same thing with all the regen spells and mana and focus items.?<br />
<br />
So Race benefits are just situational and short term and when its all said and done, But I am still interested to see when you hit 50+, what is the modern shaman's need in order to function as a better Shaman?<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice?<br />

unless I'm on a raid. Always have, from level 1 to level 60. <br />
Can, stab stab stab, can, stab stab stab. Never cared for<br />
sitting on my butt. <br />
<br />
Being imune to stun is great! I found being stunned REAL <br />
annoying the first time I made a twink. Can't cast any damn<br />
spells!<br />
<br />
The only downside is the faction. However, the only time that<br />
bothered me was when trying to buy my vision spells in Oasis. I<br />
just buffed up some stranger in exchange for buying the spells<br />
for me. Gave him a nice tip too. Oh, and Overthere faction sucks,<br />
but since we now have port idols to Innothule Swamp, it's a non-<br />
issue. <br />

Ogres is be DE MOST funest class to play!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think you should choose whichever race you find more appealing. Just do some research on different races &amp; make up your own mind.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Boobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ogas are the best of course!<br />
<br />
But making an Oga/Troll/Iksar and you'll go through life hated almost every where.<br />
<br />
Stat wise it's not a real problem at high levels, but unless you make an Oga pump some points into stamina as you get 3 hp per stamina point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">is race just flavoring till you get to your 50s?<br />
<br />
perhaps you meant AFTER you get to your 50s?  thats where the lines start to blur.<br />
<br />
I have spent the last week or so sending tells to about 40 different shaman of all races in their 50s to 60s asking them if they would change their race...Not one would change their race <br />
<br />
They lied to you. I can prove it:<br />
<br />
a) number of shamans you asked: 40<br />
b) number of Ogre Shamans above 50 on most servers: less than 10<br />
<br />
a + b = c) you must have asked non-Ogre shamans.  <br />
<br />
d) Ogre &gt; all.  <br />
<br />
c + d = e) all non-Ogres shamefully admit to secretly wanting to be an Ogre.<br />
<br />
Since E didn't happen, they must have lied to you. :)<br />
<br />
You can't beat logic...<br />

Serious response:<br />
Search the forums and you will find the answer to all 3 of your questions.<br />
<br />
My quick opinion:  Play the race you want, I slow in groups and tank solo for dogdog, and pump 20pts into Wis unless you are a twink.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd be an ogre if I could.  They look so friggin' cool, don't get stupid kilt jokes all the time, and the stun thing must be very nice also.  I'm a barb btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fieryfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Be a vah shir :P<br />
<br />
I had a 49 iksar shaman and remade a vah shir one ( my iksar started with 90 wis and some stupid amount of charisma he was my first toon didnt know stats well) I love being kitty... Innate safe fall, sneak, and night vision..<br />
<br />
But really just play the race you want, all are good if you know how to play your class....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Snap - that was funny.<br />
<br />
I started out as a Barbarian because my buddy who had been playing for a year (made level 30) warned me of the &quot;faction&quot; problems.<br />
<br />
In retrospect I would have gone Troll or Ogre.<br />
<br />
I can &quot;live&quot; without the frontal stun immunity - I just wish MOBs wouldn't wait until I am 7 seconds into my JBB blast before interrupting my click.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>molgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the truth is, you can't make a bad shaman, even if you make him barbarian an put all your points into int and agi.<br />
<br />
as everyone has already said (on this thread and many others), just pick what you like best.<br />
<br />
but don't let those barbs fool you by claiming their &quot;sexiness&quot; makes up for their low hitpoints and bad vision (who the heck cares anyway? if i want to see sexy i camp out and call my girlfriend...)<br />
<br />
my personal choice was ogre, because i thought it looked coolest in the make a character screen. ten minutes later my housemate who got me into all this said troll might have been better for the regen and snare necklace, but i didn't really feel like switching, and i haven't regretted it yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Iksar is best !!!! <br />
<br />
And those who disagree have no scales !!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I don't know, for about a year I thought about redoing my shaman ( the instructions said put points into all the green marked stats) becasue I'm very charming but a bit wisdom challenged.  Now I have trouble finding gear that gives more HP and I still have 200+ wis. After 50 whatever you do in the beginning doesn't matter.  But if I'd get to redo me a twink shaman I'd go ogre - the faction problems are half as bad as troll or iksar, and I used to get stunned a lot at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Ogurs probably are the best, but not by all *that* much. <br />
<br />
You don't get a frontal (bash type) stun, but you still have to make a channeling roll, and you're still vulnerable to spell type stuns. You will have faction issues, you will have xp issues, you will have crappy graphics models (ogur leather models/custom helms look pretty awful imo), those are the breaks.<br />
<br />
The extra sta is nice, but once you're in higher end gear you can buff to max sta anyway.<br />
<br />
=&gt;On the whole, play whichever one you friggin want, because there really isn't that big a difference&lt;=<br />
<br />
Ok?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I play a troll shaman.  Absolutely love him, but if I had it to do over again, I sometimes think I would have chosen an ogre.<br />
<br />
The no stun from the front is just an amazing ability.  Not to mention the new ogre model is killer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i luv my barb , there isnt a sexier shaman baby yea !!<br />
<br />
if i HAD to change i would be a troll i think . ogres just look plain and boring.  you cant deny they are a good choice, but they just have no style they all look so much the same , there is almost no differnece and they just look very dumb ( no offense ogres , looks isnt everything  ;) )  Troll have style , their armour looks vastly different . they are evil and look the part . Im not a big fan of iskar either , they look pretty frail , but they do have a style to them ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
i go like this<br />
<br />
<br />
Barb<br />
Troll/Kitty<br />
Iskar<br />
Ogre<br />
<br />
its not that i dont luv my brother and sisters . but i have to honestly reply ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Romp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ya my post said 50+, I did mean after you hit your 50 to 60 levels.  I also said I asked 40 shamans of all races.<br />
<br />
So if we completely forget about race..if you were making a shaman today..is having as many hits as youu can get once you hit your 50s more important than having as high a wisdom as you can get?<br />
<br />
AC is always good to pump up but I heard that the new shamans want more hits to survive the raid AoEs and mobs jumping them when they throw slows and debuffs?<br />
<br />
If you can canni 3 and 4, wouldnt having mass amounts of hits be better than high wisdom as you can alsways dance the mana back if your hits allow it?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">best would be ogre or troll, but i wouldnt change if i had the chance :) i love my barb</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i still think the game is a bit different for iksars because they can't wear JBB, but asides that, we all get the same spells...so it's not a huge deal.<br />
<br />
but do your research if you're starting a shaman and make absolutely sure you've considered every aspect of every race, because shaman races are the most diverse in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alliza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Play whichever you like.  <br />
<br />
I did a similar thing on my server, sent alot of tells to different people.  Most said they wish they were iksar, but that I would have to live without JBB.  <br />
<br />
I choose Iksar anyway, only because I couldn't stand playing a &quot;big&quot; race like troll/ogre.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yes, I get enough yells in /gu telling me to shrink my bear ass, I can imagine life as a Troll or Ogre indoors.  The vision thing's only a big deal for a few levels and then you start getting vision spells anyway, so don't let that sway you.  I wouldn't change the race that I'm in when I'm not in bearclothes for anything....  Finaljustice sounds REALLY DUMB as a oggur!  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Vargo Hoat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">This shaman is the first character I've ever gotten past level 24. Because of this I am very glad that he is a barbarian. I am able to explore areas and move around much easier than I would if were a dark race and being KOS to most places is not something that a new player really wants to worry about. If you are going to solo alot I suggest barb or Vah Shir just because its alot easier to restock and you have the ability to fight nearly anywhere. Just my humble noob opinion though. Pick the race you think is cool and run with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just some advice:<br />
<br />
In all of the billions of roleplaying games I have played in my life, charisma has never, ever, mattered.  It is _always_ the worthless stat that no one cares about (except bards and merchant classes if said RPG has a merchant class).<br />
<br />
Next time you play a MMORPG:  don't put points in to CHA.<br />
<br />
I'm not really one to talk, though.  I put 15 points in to int =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I see a lot of people using the term &quot;best&quot; in this thread, and &quot;best&quot; is a very relative term.  It implies that there is a set standard on which all shamans are judged, and that just doesn't exist.<br />
Just because one race tends to be the &quot;flavor of the month&quot; does not make them the &quot;best&quot; by any means.<br />
<br />
In closing, I think this quote by molgar sums it up the best: &quot;the truth is, you can't make a bad shaman.&quot;<br />
So true.</div></div><hr />
