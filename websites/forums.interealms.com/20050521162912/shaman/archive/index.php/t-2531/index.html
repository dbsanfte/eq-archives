<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I find it curious that in all the discussions of caster balancing, no one has mentioned caster melee abilities.  I find this curious for 2 reasons:<br />
<br />
1.  Melee classes have increased tremendously in both melee and magical abilities.  A large number of spells are available to melees and hybrids from equipment, etc.  Melee abilities have been greatly enhanced by the &quot;free&quot; disciplines they get post 50.<br />
<br />
2.  Caster NPCs have had their melee abilities greatly enhanced in each expansion.  Many caster mobs do a majority of their damage through melee damage.  Often their spells are minor annoyances (dispells, minor dots, slows).<br />
<br />
The only increase in abilities PC casters have had have been in the form of spells.  Spells which are severly limited by mana regen.  PC casters still have melee ability caps that reflect the strength of mobs from the original game.<br />
<br />
Some may say that casters shouldn't melee, but should rely totally on their spells.  However, there if there is nothing wrong with increasing the abilities of melee classes to use spells, what is wrong with increasing casting classes melee abilities?<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing that casters should be able to melee like monks, rogues, or warriors.  I just think that the gulf that separates the least powerful melee classes ( e.g., bards) and the most powerful meleeing caster class (probably shamans) shouldn't be as great.<br />
<br />
The fix would be easy.  Simply raise caps on caster class melee skills (including bash), maybe add double attack to shamans.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, there are some very awesome melee stats on some caster useable items, but the items are a joke because casters rate of hitting higher level mobs is almost nil (I've got a 40/38 1hb that I never use unless I want to whack that annoying green skeleton that will still aggro on me even tho I'm over 50 levels greater than it).<br />
<br />
So in the caster balancing equation, don't forget to balance out melee abilities.  I'd dearly like to melee better than those froglok shamans in OS who are ten levels beneath me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Actually, this has been mentioned several times.<br />
<br />
most of the talk is about NPC's not restrained by line of sight stuff, but they are now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would like to have my post-50 offense/defense and weapons skill caps raised a bit.  Not to the levels that the true meleers get, but 1hb/piercing/2hb could go to 210, 215.  Something up there.  The coding's in place for skills like Bind Wound, I'd imagine they could do it for our melee skills, too.<br />
<br />
Double attack... /drool<br />
Dodge &gt; 50... /drool</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I Think hes talikng about PC casters and wall i think it would be a nice change to up mele dmg for caster it would not change verry much for most casters.wizzards and all the pure casters would still gett better DPS if thay sat and med insteds of got up and hit the mob, how ever i do think it would be a good idea to up the avodance of casters.<br />
<br />
what i think would be verry cool is if you could get skill checks on you resistants, so say when you get hit by a fire based Dd you can become more resistant to fire kinda like when you get hit buy a mob your defence gose up and you get better ac, how ever only verry low skill like say 50 or so and verry hard to get up but still a cool idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">All I want, the ONLY thing I want, is to have the offense skill cap raised by 10 lousy points.  I'm at 997 atk right now with max str, max 2hb, max offense, and Billy.  That's just plain cruel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heck, I'd must rather then raise our dodge cap than our offense cap.  Considering dodge was &quot;balanced&quot; back when level 50 was the highest level and the typical exp camp was LG frogs.  Snakes in Sraa temple were popping me for 200+ last night, would be nice to dodge more!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Crashem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Man, I would just be happy to be more melee balanced vs int casters.  That staff of the silent star owns me even with facesmasher.    400dd lure DROOL.<br />
<br />
As for melee skills, I really think shamans at least should be given another look at.  Raise melee caps, increase dodge, etc.  Make rabid bear stay around till you zone, etc.  The fact is that this isn't really unbalanced.  We won't get near the damage potential of a melee even with all this stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think we deserve any abilities that equate to being &quot;skilled&quot; at arms like a melee class, i.e. double attacks, dual wields, reposte, crippling blows, criticals, etc.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I am a large race with an healthy natural strength.  I spent my youth doing a good measure of melee.  I don't see anything wrong with being able to engage in straight melee and actually hit something.   I would like to see all casters get a revised melee table and priest classes get the weapon damage bonus.  Verant has given us access to some really amazing weapons (my guild gave me a primal brawlstick) and this would make owning them fun.  Naturally, our damage should still pale next to a melee or what we can do with our spells.  <br />
<br />
A paladin asked me what my average hit was and I told him, &quot;wiff&quot;.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tenien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Raising the skill caps will do no good whatsoever unless the hit table is changed.  From 40 to 50, Shaman have the same offense and weapon skill caps that Paladins, SKs, Rangers and Bards do.  We still do far less melee damage because the chance to hit and damage done are calculated differently.  We also have no minimum damage built in to main hand hits.  Could be fixed easily, move Shaman/Cleric/Druid to pre-50 Bard-type damage table at 51, with 1/2 the damage bonus.  Would up or melee output substantially when fighting lower level mobs without significantly infringing on melee classes superiorityin this area.   Double attack is not gonna happen and damage table changes are preferable anyway.    I agree that a Bash skill/cap increase to 50 or 100 would be a great addition as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Barm and Tenien, these are great suggestions.  I agree that casters should not ever be more proficient at meleeing than hybrid or pure melees.  The key then, is to change hit tables, especially post 50.  I think its very unbalanced to have melee abilities of casters operating under PRE-Kunark hit tables.<br />
<br />
Something needs to be done.  The ONLY melee ajustment EVER given to ANY caster class that I am aware of is Rabid Bear.  Although the melee boosts on this ability are impressive, the short duration and long recast delay make it nearly useless.<br />
<br />
I get the impression that there is plenty of room for increasing caster melee effectiveness post 50 before one would have to worry about the increases being unbalancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This would be really funny if it weren't so true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am for two things. <br />
<br />
1) Implementing Tenien's idea about the dmg table and dmg main hand bonus.  This makes really good solid sense to me, and wouldn't piss off melees or anyone really that I could see.  You wouldn't notice it unless you actually meleed.  <br />
<br />
2) Increasing duration/lowering re-use time of Rabid Bear.  This is a skill that a very few shamans have paid dearly to possess and it shouldn't be merely a novelty, but something with an actual USE!  My suggestion would be a 15 minute duration with a 1 hour re-use.  That would be enough time to last through any extended battle, and still make it so shamans wouldn't become melees at all times.   I really like the Rabid Bear skill and am probably going to choose it next for the sheer novelty of being able to melee for a small time.  But if I had any other AA skill in mind, I wouldn't be spending the points on it.  <br />
<br />
3) GIMME A DAM NUKE!!!!  I want a NUKE so I can do some dmg once in a while!  It bugs the SNOT outta me that a lvl 54 CLERIC has a nuke that does 250 more dmg than the one a lvl 60 shaman does!  Why?  Even their undead dots work much faster and better.  And let's not talk about the 1k+ dmg undead nukes a 59 cleric gets.  Where's my DAM NUKE?<br />
I'm really really tired of shaman nukes being a joke.  Gimme a 900 point nuke and I'll shut up about this.  It sucks being KSed by paladins and clerics who feel like KSing me.  <br />
<br />
At this point in time, there is no other class that deals damage as slowly or as poorly as a shaman at lvl 60.  It sux to be last place.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">&quot;At this point in time, there is no other class that deals damage as slowly or as poorly as a shaman at lvl 60. It sux to be last place.&quot;<br />
<br />
Wrong. Every once in awhile when either my wife or myself comes back from going LD or some other reason that causes us to not be grouped, we will try to KS each other on a mob. My wife almost always wins if her pet is up, even when I have all of her buffs on. Usually she isn't even trying.<br />
<br />
I specifically remember one time we were in the basement in KC and I went LD. I came back in (was fully buffed with str and haste ) and started to kill a skeleton. She KSed me. I grabbed another, she KSd that one. I gave up. The first mob, all she did was dot and send in her pet. The second mob, she dotted, sent in the pet, and bracer nuked. I never had a chance.<br />
<br />
Bane of Nife by itself does 34 DPS. Epic dot averages at about 15 DPS. Her pet was probably doing at least 10 DPS, more likely about 20 DPS, if not more. That's about 59-69 DPS. Add in 29 max DPS from JBB, and you are looking at anything from 75-100 DPS. Of the melee classes, only a monk or rogue can keep up with that. A ranger using trueshot, or with maxed archery AAs could beat it too, I would imagine.<br />
<br />
http://pub14.ezboard.com/fthesteelwarriorthearena.showMessage?topicID=1639.topic<br />
<br />
There is a thread on the steel warrior with warriors talking about breaking 70 DPS on xp mobs with weapons like BoC (off AoW) if that tells you anything. Here is a quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;I usually get 66-72 dps with BoC/Bonechiller/Primal combo, against shrooms in FG. My haste would be 54% (34% item haste plus 20% eye patch). &quot; &lt;----Essentially the 2 best weapons in game for a warrior damagewise, plus avatar proc.<br />
<br />
With full haste and buffs DPS can go higher, but that means you have someone else acting in support. Shamans don't need any support to output those damage numbers. If you want to gripe about the numbers fully hasted, throw a KEI, cabbage, and canna into the equation and a shaman could put up some big DPS numbers using full dots and nukes. Most warriors can't hit those number fully buffed and hasted.<br />
<br />
Shamans definitely do not suck at damage output, especially sustained DPS. Pet, mana free dot, JBB, and canna all make sure of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">i'd really like a better nuke, but i dont think we need one with better ratio than ice strike, or if so, give it somewhat of a recast time, we do alot of dmg with pure nukes if we want to, even compared to wizards (over extended periods of course).<br />
<br />
if you are able to use dots, as many as you want, theres not many classes able to outdo us.<br />
<br />
we dont really need double attack no :)<br />
a better to hit table would be nice tho.<br />
<br />
limited parry or increased dodge cap would definetively be something we &quot;deserve&quot; we do actually get hit alot, yet cleric gear is way above ours(lots of clr only stuff, and generally it's better than anything we can get) having at least a minor chance of evading more blows would be awesome :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Grall, I appreciate your post, I really do. However you are overlooking a few important points.<br />
<br />
1. melee isnt resisted. It is dodged, blocked, wiffed etc. that however is calculated into the DPS ratio. I just spent several seconds channeling through an assbeat to deliver a Bane of Nife that gets resisted.<br />
<br />
2. Melee types need hps to deal damage. If you have Hps, you are alive, you are dealing damage. Shamans have manna. I can still right-click damage while oom but the dps value is more than halved without BoN &amp; Plague. (58 shaman here) <br />
<br />
The Caster balancing that VI has offered is a joke. One morning I woke up &amp; my shadel bandit ring was enableing my buffs to last  25% longer! I was stoked! The next day I could summon a dog in half a second less. joy .. glee..<br />
<br />
I'll go with increasing our dodge.. 75 is absurd. Where is slam? 50? The shaman damage table is also a silly thing.. don't get me started. Why would i want to poke a mob i'm soloing for 2 to get riposted for 115? Make it worth my while to attack.<br />
<br />
I have to get my head around the new focus effects now.. extended affliction would rock with the epic... But if i have to either A. equip some craptacular piece of gear or B. kill Vulak to obtain it I wont do either.<br />
<br />
Melee woke up one morning &amp; they were buffed. My self.. I'm still scratching my head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Isn't dodge 50 and slam 1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">LANDRAGON-<br />
<br />
Give clerics Bane of Nife, i'm sure they will give you judgement.<br />
<br />
shaman offense lies in having the best dots out of all priests, druid offense lies in better nukes. cleric power lies in stuns, and lesser nukes than druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
you have 75% slow, torpor, canni, 2nd best dots in game, if not best. i'll trade you my 1150 damage nukes for that. really i will.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The way I solo:<br />
Pull mob with Curse of the Spirits, slow, JBB, swing with Barbarian Spiritist Hammer, rinse repeat. Add double attack to it, even if it's capped low, and my DPS increases considerably. Add mainhand bonus and my DPS also increases.<br />
<br />
There might be serious balance issues adding double attack and/or mainhand bonus to casters, especialy shamans. Casters have some very high damage proc weapons or some very good dam/del ratio weapons.<br />
<br />
On raids I am mostly useful with spells, but when I solo, my melee does already nice damage. On a level 45 regular Kunark mob, I do around 500-700 melee damage, not counting procs. Give me double attack and/or mainhand bonus and it will be much more.<br />
<br />
Also we have Avatar, Spirit of Bruce Lee and haste. That is all melee boost.</div></div><hr />

Would like to see some logs and hear specifics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually, drifting death(think that's the name of it -- my druid has used it many times but i mix up the names sometimes) from druids is better than our dots, because it is resisted far less frequently.<br />
<br />
Plus, don't forget the obscene length of time it takes disease dots to work.  It's pretty unusual that at least ONE disease dot in a fight doesn't lose half it's damage because the mob dies before the full thing can be dragged out.<br />
<br />
Bane of nife is great, but drifting death is a bit better.  Pox of bertoxx is nice but the length of time it takes renders it irrelevant a great amount of the time.<br />
<br />
When you're talking about our DPS and mentioning the wonders we can do with canni and torpor, you really miss the boat when you forget that canni and torpor both take time.  And canni doesn't really give you that much mana that quickly; you have to do it a number of times to get enough mana for another dot.  Torpor takes a good long while to cast and to work.  It makes no sense to calculate numbers from JBB use when you're busy doing canni alone, much less canni plus torpor.  And just try running after the guy who is leading your mob away when you're torpored. ;)<br />
<br />
And remember spells can fizzle or be resisted.  Then you've lost a great deal of time and possibly a good amount of mana, too.  Very hard to catch up from that.  A JBB takes about 8 seconds to cast -- for only 263 damage IF it is not resisted, fully or partially.  You can quite easily spend 16 seconds for 200 damage and change, and that's nothing to crow about.  Too many &quot;best-case scenarios&quot; working together do little to clarify our REAL damage/second.<br />
<br />
And remember, DD damage or melee damage gets aggro and starts to potentially steal a mob right away; by the time a shaman gets done casting his first dot, a melee or DD caster can already have landed his damage and aggro and be running away with the mob, leaving the shaman to try to duck out and pathetically run along behind trying to hold still long enough to try another DOT.  We root the mob?  DD caster breaks the root with a blast and we've wasted more time.  Melee just keeps on pounding in further damage.<br />
<br />
The fellow who was talking about our pets forgets that we often don't have pets up.  Some shamans don't have JBB's.  Some of us don't have torpor(epics are more common).  Some of us don't have bane of nife(epics are more common).  Some of us don't even have epics.<br />
<br />
I have all of them, lucky me, and all my spells and some nice gear.  But still it's pretty easy to KS me.<br />
<br />
If you want to look at how fast we damage things, check out how fast monks solo at 60 compared to us, even without buffs and heals.  With their DOWNTIME not even fighting at all they still kill notably faster than we do over time.<br />
<br />
Which is not to say shamans aren't a great class and a powerful one.  But DPS is not our forte.  I have to fight two or three shrooms in Fungus Grove at once, non-stop, to come close to getting the AA exp/hour a monk does fighting only one shroom at a time.</div></div><hr />
