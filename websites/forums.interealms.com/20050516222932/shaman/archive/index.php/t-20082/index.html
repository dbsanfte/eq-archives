<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Trial 6 (Tipt) is a joke on what classes are needed.  I got they flag on my ranger because he could do 2 things.  Snare and Root.  Snare the charmed pet, root it if it breaks loose.  Shamans and Mages are also needed for 1 reason.  Malosinia.<br />
<br />
Now this is if your doing the trial w/ a charmed pet.  If so, then the trial is pretty much trivial (did w/ cleric, chanter, mage, war, ranger, pally).  The only problems we had was the chanter going LD (but mad things interesting)  I cant imagine how hard it is though without a charmed pet doing well over a 1000DPS.</div></div><hr />

Expedition 6 is the Tipt expedition - i.e. the second mountain expedition which you can do after doing the sewers expeditions and/or smith rondo flag.<br />
<br />
In my guild, we had a pretty frustrating time flagging everyone for this.  Tight cliches of the necessary classes went through it pretty easy, but it is quite hard to put together a competent pickup group for this.  You can't just grab 6 people and go (which is what I think sucks the most about this expansion).  So, if you are a class that either isn't required (like the monk in the movie), or you're a common class (clerics), or worst of all both (druids) then you're going to be LFG for a loooong time before your guildies take pity on you and take you through.  <br />
<br />
Think of it like PoJ trials when they first got started and they were hard.  We mainly did it by having our top players take weaker players/unsuited classes through 1-2 at a time until the whole guild was flagged, and that's what we did for mountain expeditions too.  Took about a week to flag most of the guild.  I spent several days LFG for an entire evening and then finally got in to a group, only to have it wipe because people were so tired and jaded after a day of being LFG.</div></div><hr />

I gotta agree here, and despite being ok geared, playing with guildmates who are equally geared you can easily fail, simply due to bad luck, poor pathing or a small mistake. I simply say that m2 is very unforgiving, expect to fail this trial if anyone makes a mistake during the 1-3 hours this takes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Pooka pet owns.<br />
Actually quite a few of the mobs can be charmed, including a nocs in the boss room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've read from my guildies that pooka's seem to be the best for charming due to low resists.<br />
Low resists are kind of needed though when you charm and equip the pet so it's doing 3000dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Really no need to take the chance throwing all that on the pet, too risky, I've failed once due to chanter being owned by his pet during boss fight, not a pretty sight :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, the pet doesn't really need to kick that much ass.

Working, with 2 clerics is not working it's piss poor design in my not so humble opinion. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Agreed, Shummn.  I think Wulf is talking out of his ass.<br />
<br />
Any time that you are REQUIRED to have 2 clerics to pass a trial, it's bad.  Ikkinz needs 2 clerics and a defensive warrior (or a hell of a lot of luck and a time equipped paladin or SK).<br />
<br />
Unslowable 2200 hitting mobs with 6 people = total ****.<br />
<br />
Now that they've nerfed charm, that means you need to have enough dps in the remaining 4 people (since clerics will be chaining SL or HL because CH is too slow) to take the mob down before your clerics run out of mana.<br />
<br />
Just FYI, the nameds summon 2 pets on inc that hit in the 400s.<br />
<br />
Shaman are not made for these groups.  Our agro is too large to provide a major portion of the dps.  I got summoned and owned about 3 times (4th we got the named).  Shm, pal, war, ench, clr, clr.  These trials are NOT forgiving.<br />
<br />
For that matter, let's talk about actually GETTING there!.  What f'ing genius at SoE thought it would be a good idea to put like 30+ mobs, many see-invis, in front of the trial area.  What, they think people WANT to spend 3 hours clearing to a 4 hour trial?  Morons.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Made it through Tipt on my 2nd attempt with just a paladin tank and no charmed pet.  Was very rough even with cleric and druid healers.  I think the pally got down to around 10 percent health 2 or 3 times and I'm suprised we made it.<br />
<br />
Next time through the trials, I took my enchanter instead.  I had a charmed pooka pet with just tash for debuffs.  Only bothered to slow mobs until I got the pet and then only the boss after that.  Only hasted the pooka for the named and we finished that trial easily with a paladin tank in probably an hour or so less time than with my main.<br />
<br />
Not too bad I guess, but it is somewhat depressing that my alt who has around 3k less hp, 2k less mana, and 250ish less AAs is more useful up through trial 6 than my main.</div></div><hr />

My experience was a little different, but then again I only have 1 Ikkinz trial under my belt.<br />
We had 1 cleric, 1 shaman (me) and 1 paladin as only healers, We did kill the first named, but DD wiped us due to larger than usual aggro range and that stupid summon (bug?). We were doing quite nicely, and I felt usefull enough. Would another class have been better off in my place? Not sure, because I was needed for healing and slowing. Replace the paladin with another cleric and me with an enchanter, and it's definately easy to replace a shaman, but it isn't required.<br />
<br />
To get in the trial we didn't clear. After getting expedition from the damn iksar sitting in the middle of what, 5 roamer paths, we just used a cleric to find the right hole, then a bard to Invul the rest of the group to same spot. Worked well, but requires a bard I guess.<br />
<br />
I am interested to see more of these trials, as my first experience was positive. Things might change as we get in deeper of course, and I certainly agree that needing several healers and a def tank to do a 6 man trial is moronic, but I believe at the moment there is a &quot;little&quot; more leeway than some are admitting to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Anyone that is claiming that charm is not overpowered for these trials is either ignorant or just stupid.<br />
<br />
Using charm to get through the ikkinz trials was clearly not intended therefore it was an exploit and I'm glad it has been fixed.<br />
<br />
Yes, I know that they are very hard, but they are hard for a good reason; it prevents people from skipping previous content (potime) by zerging flag mobs etc.<br />
<br />
Saying that shamans are useless in the DD encounter is also ignorant, we are great at cc'ing the dire illusions and then add some damage/healing after the adds are stable. I have personally completed around 10 ikkinz trials so far and I still enjoy them and there is also several decent augments that drops in them.<br />
<br />
The &quot;stupid summon bug&quot; Mixelplux mentioned is not a bug at all, it only occurs when DD is aggroed and someone is outside the room. This is a fix for the exploit where you could use the dire illusions leashes against them and almost completely bypassing them.<br />
<br />
Personally I love the ikkinz trials, they force everyone to play their class to the fullest and use their brains instead of throwing overpowering numbers at a mob and hope it dies.</div></div><hr />

Ahh righto.  I knew Tipt was the 6th trial, and it was a mountaintrial but that was -all- that I knew about it and Vxed.  My guild is still getting our asses handed to us by Purifying Plant heh.  The smith/rondo thing I don't know anything about either..ahh well.  Eventually we'll get through this stuff (if our clerics decide to ever agree to go back to GoD)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">i will agree that these trials (ikk ones) are very hard.  I might even agree that they are just a bit too hard if you don't have the right classes. Then again, my guild has finished almost all of them with a chanter or cleric pulling.  Last night I got the third trial finished and I am very happy to say that I'm one of the first in my guild to have done it.  What's great is that each trial that I passed, I did it with completely different people.  Oh.. sorry, but I completed first trial back before the summon nerf (we just used warrior to kite the named around while the druid and I doted and then zoned out to clear agro).  The second trial was tough and took me a while before we figured out a good strategy, but when I ended up beating it, we had two shamans and a cleric as the healers.  Both shamans were doting and using tnargs, and the cleric was using CH.  Wasn't that bad really now. <br />
<br />
Third trial is a joke.  Was easy compared to the other two.  That first named gave me problems the first time I was in it, but we weren't exactly using our top warriors and it was a cleric and I healing.  Even with great dps, we couldn't keep the tank up past 50%.<br />
<br />
These have been my winning combos I think<br />
<br />
1st:  war, sham, cler, dru, bard, rog<br />
2nd: war, sham, sham, cler, rog, monk<br />
3rd: war, sham, cler, dru, monk, wiz</div></div><hr />
