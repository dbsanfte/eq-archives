<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here is the log that I took a while ago while talking to one of the devs.  I was doing some testing with him and afterwords he spoke with me for about an hour or so on some things that we are seeing.  Take in mind that at the time that this happened, there was only me, and two other non-beta buffed shaman on, and neither of those two had any real imput (I did ask them to let me know if they wanted a question answered and neither did).  <br />
<br />
To protect the identity of this guy, I hopefully removed his name from the log.  I also took out the date and the identity of the group that I was with.  The bulk of this was done in the hour that I talked to him, but the beginning of it was at done while we were testing out stuff, hence the big gaps in questions and answers.  If I missed taking out the guys name, please tell me asap.  If it looks a bit jumbled at the beginning it's because like i said, we were fighting, and there were five other people oocing questions to him at the same time.  <br />
<br />
Last thing, for those that ever payed attention to my posts, I don't have any beef with the AAs or spells.  Yes, I would have liked to not had the dot, and I would have liked to have at least one AA that was unique, but I really don't mind what we got for the most part.<br />
<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'so.. question.. was the nerf of Secondary Forte.  Letting the second specialization only go to 100 makes it very less likely that it will be something that people will want to get'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'secondary spec was always meant to cap at 100...the description was just altered to show that'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'okay, i can understand that, but leaving it at 100.. gives you about a 2&amp;PCT; mana savings only leaving it at 50.. '<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'shamans need a mgbable healing line.. just like alot of other classes'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'with mana regen where it is currently, any mana savings at all is going to be expensive'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'yeah, that's one of the more common requests from shaman'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'hehe, i do have a quesiton dev.. are there any more shaman AAs that are seriously being looked at right now?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'the current list of AAs is done...but I have a bit list to include for next time'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'being brutally honest, if you have ever looked at the shaman crucible, you will see how disgusted most shamans are about GoD (i'm not one of them btw), most don't think that we get any real unique AAs.. or ones that makes us better as a class, and on top of that, we aren't getting any healing spells or damage spells, other than a disease dot that is worthless outside of soloing'<br />
[Wed 2004] newb cleric says out of character, 'I swear to GOD shaman asking for good aa's is retarded :P'<br />
[Wed 2004] newb cleric says out of character, 'once they take away canabalize five come back and ask for something'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'the general problem with all the AAs is that they're small increases'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'every single class thinks everyone else is getting a ton more than them'<br />
[Wed 2004] You tell your party, 'difference is that our mana regen is based on castings spells.. IE canni series'<br />
[Wed 2004] newb cleric tells the group, 'well I've seen what shamans can do and quite honestly at times it sickens me ;)'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says out of character, 'oh, shaman MGB heals...MGB heals was an unintended side effect of MGB and not something we particularly care for'<br />
[Wed 2004] tough warrior says out of character, 'does that include paragon'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'I can agree with you on that, but what I think it comes down to, is that MOST shamans have been designated as now being only buffers and slowers now, we can't heal as well as three other classes now, and just barely slow better than two others (and with mitigation, it makes our advantage obsolete), we can't put out the dps, cause our dps is in our dots, and one dot on a mob will get us summoned'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say out of character, 'i know that spells prob isn't your field.. but you can solve all problems by getting rid of the new disease dot (not needed) and giving a heal or a bit higher DD (or bring down cast time on our cold one by 1.5 secs)'<br />
[Wed 2004] You tell your party, 'it's alright.. i'm not really one to bitch about new stuff.. but i got a new disease dot.. i mena.. where in any setting is a disease dot used for'<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'you able to talk a few more min about AAs and such?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'sure'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well, let me first ask something, was it an oversight that we never got Spell casting subtlety in the first place?  I mean, even sks got it along time ago'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'no, definitely not an oversight'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yeah, SKs probably shouldn't have, but that's before my time'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'healers didn't because healing aggro is a really touchy balance point'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'we can give it to them now because the increased damage requires more healing to balance it out'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well, you know how much it's costing AA wise.. when I picked it up just recently it cost me 0, 0, 0 for all ranks'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yeah, that was a bit &quot;broken&quot;'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe, yeah, i figured'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'figured it would be just along the lines of the normal archetype AAs'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'alright, now, there is a new upgrade to canni spell right? (sorry.. not an AA, but a question nonetheless)'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'when you spellscribe, we aren't getting it, which is why I'm asking'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I'm not up on new spells at all, unfortunately'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'it's alrigh'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well. in the system there was a new AA.. which seemed to be a new canni spell for us, but it was never implemented'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I had a canni upgrade in the original AA list, but it didn't work out'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. why's that?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'mana effeciency is currently well past where people want it and giving any more tends to get shot down fast'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i'm serious.. I do love my shaman, and I don't mind the new AAs/Spells, but i'm far from the majority'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'there might be a same efficiency/bigger chunk one though'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'in the works?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'or in a future expansion or something?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'not sure, but if there was one, that's what I'd expect'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'oh, the future is easier'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'if/when we can increase the level cap, we're less hampered with what we can give'<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'honestly, i'm really concerned because I seem to be about the only person that is defending alot of the new abilites that we are getting'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yeah, i can understand that'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hmm.. so there is no mgb type heals in the works?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'nope'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'group heals are kinda curtailed atm until we can get a way to make them not MGB-able'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i guess the real problem with us is that we are scared that we are now becoming really less desirable period'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i can solo stuff that most other people can't'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'well, with 15 (16?) classes and 6 group slots people tend to feel left out a lot'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'hah, yeah, I still hold firm that no one solo's as well as a skilled shaman'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'me too.. unless charm is involved'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'I think overall yeah'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yeah'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'anyways, like i said, i love playing the shaman, but we don't have any stackability anymore on raids'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hoenstly, you can't change this i'm sure.. but get rid of that new disease dot that we are getting (almost worthless cause you can't use a disease dot on anything), and give us just a bit better heal, or a little bit higher nuke and we'll be happy again'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I have nothing to do with spells :('<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'let me check something'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i know.. but through this chat there way if you could hehe'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'throw*'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. curious.. what about is the &amp;PCT; to crit dots.. i've been seeing parses close to 7&amp;PCT;.. i've managed to get 15&amp;PCT; on a few small two or three mob parsings'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev is checking internal boards.<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'its up to 9&amp;PCT; per tick or so, I believe'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'for the third rank right?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yea'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'ok, there's a thread going on the shaman spells already'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'and the dot is mentioned'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. what does that mean exactly about the boards?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. and why is the dot &amp;PCT; that much lower than what the DD &amp;PCT; is?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'because DoTs have been built for the last few expansions to be on par with crits that already include the DD &amp;'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, '&amp;PCT;'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'since we didn't have the ability to give a crit mastery previously'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hmm, well, problem with dots is that they are about 100x more agro than DDs'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'not 100, but more, yeah'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i can do 2k dmg with a dot and get summoned whereas someone else can do 10k with DDs and not get summoned'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yeah :('<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. do you know if SCS works with dots.. or is it just the initial agro from the dot landing?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'its cause DoTs generate aggro over the course of their casting whereas DDs are all at once, I'm sure'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'SCS works on all spells as far as I know'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i guess there was pretty extensive testing on that before (dots and SCS) and it was found that only the initial casting of the dot was checked by SCS, and that each succesive tick was just like you dind't have SCS'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'definitely a possibility'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'not sure how you'd check aggro generation, though'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'me either, was just something that I read'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well, did those boards say anything about that dot or just mention is?'<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I think it was along the lines of &quot;I see no point in this&quot;'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'just a few quick things.. I'm very happy with us getting the crit dots (although making the crit &amp;PCT; just a bit higher would be nice.. it's 30AAs for it to finish)'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'I love having SCS now'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'I also love FoMM'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe, that's funny, cause i fyou read the shaman boards everyone says the same thing.. &quot;we have a 64 disease dot that we already can't use, why we need a new 65 one&quot;'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'I think that the changes made to the Advanced spirit call were very nice too, although I haven't seen much about them yet'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'can you tell me if the new pets have an increased level or even proc something?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i see that they hit a bit hard.. 95 was the max that I saw'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'the new spirit call pets?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yes'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'it was just changed today to make them now 3 pets.. instead of six (or 7)'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yeah, shaman and wizards got upgrades that essentially replace the old ability with stronger pets (I think with procs) that do more damage using less numbers'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'should help with push, etc.'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'alright.. i used it a few times today, and saw that he hit harder and that he looks just a bit darker'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yeah, they're still being tweaked'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'he still got smoked real quickly by a mob though hehe'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'haha, yeah, they don't tank'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i was fighting something.. and i saw this emote that it looked like the pet proced something.. but i wasn't sure about it'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'alright.. if you can answer this, will the Call of the Ancients be actually needed.. right now, i haven't had or seen anyone need it yet, so i'm very cautious about this'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i guess though.. is that are they implementing a newer melee system that actually uses endurance so much that they will need what extra this AA gives them?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'call of the ancients just heals, I believe'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I think the description is wrong'<br />
[Wed 2004] You begin casting Cannibalization.<br />
[Wed 2004] Your body aches as your mind clears.  You have taken 1924 points of damage.<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'it was originally an endurance heal, but that was kinda worthless right now'<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] You begin casting Call of the Ancients III.<br />
[Wed 2004] Valsuvious`s ward begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Wed 2004] You are washed in an aura of restoration.<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. do these wards stack? can a cleric and shaman have one going at the same time and it give double the healing?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'no, they don't stack'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'that'd lead to sick, sick healing in raids'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i agree.. why i asked'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'that's the reason they're implemented as a bard song'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'packrat.. will this go live?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'yup'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe, any reason for the it..other than for monks?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'its a general ability *shrug*'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yeah, they need Advanced Metabolism.. that is one that I would kill for'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'haha, that's one that won't happen'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'nothing like making it even harder for bakers to sell their goods!'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe, why not.. it's one of the most popular AAS'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe.. screw the bakers'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'cause people need to actually BUY food every now and again'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i do.. every two months'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'otherwise baking goes the way of jewelrycraft ;)'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well.. the jc people made enough off of everything that they made before'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'for ones that were around'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'what they need to do is implement a reason to actually work up alchemy.. the potions just don't do enough or last long enough to justify their insane prices'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'minus gate potions.. which everyone likes '<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I think they have some new alchemy stuff going in with GoD'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'oh.. and the AA Alchemy Mastery is broken.. it doesn't seem to actually give any increase just like JC did at first'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'weird'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well.. my last quesiton would be.. is there anything that's still a possibilty AA wise that might change.. or is there anything that we could be gaining in the near future'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'i personally think that you guys have done a great job with some of the new AAs.. on the shaman side of the house that is, i just hope that the public backlash isn't too bad though once this goes live'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'well, they're all kinda minor'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'people are used to huge upgrades'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'the current AA list is final, but I'm sure we'll be adding more soon and have already started a list for that'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'would that be for a new expansion ..or just part of patching?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'next expansion mostly'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'hehe.. so they already have another one in the works'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'always'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well.. i'm a raiding person myself.. so raiding is basically what keeps me interested in playing.. so hoping that they<br />
give us alot of raiding content this time around, as well as further increasing it next time'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'there is TONS of raiding content in this expansion'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'on that note.. i hope there is enough that it takes us literally 5 months at least to even get close to the end game of GoD'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'heh, we shall see'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'people tear through stuff so fast'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yeah, and everyone else blames it on zerging.. no matter how they got there'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'well, the progression in this expansion is in instanced zones'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'can't zerg those'<br />
<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'wait.. one quest'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'why limit it now to 54?'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'how do you mean?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'all of pop was 72.. now we have to physically tell this many people that they can't enter'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'all of the bigger raids that i've been on here have been a limis of 54 people'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'well, actually, pop was 60'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'basically, there has to be a limit somewhere...72 is too many to be able to tune the encounter around'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'unless there actually is alot more content that you guys haven't tested yet that we didn't see andhave a higher increased raid limit number'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'too many variables'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'and with 72, everyone is just a minor voice in the wave of people...its unhealthy'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'haha'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'well, txevu isn't instanced and is the end game zone'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'bring 200 for all I care to that one ;)'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'I think it'll wipe the floor with people'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well, yeah, but what i'm getting at.. is that now you actually have to lower the size of your guild, cause who wants to sit out'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'lol.. no ****'<br />
[Wed 2004] dev says, 'wanna see it?'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'well, why not make it instanced though?  what you going to do once more than one guild gets there'<br />
[Wed 2004] You say, 'yes please'<br />
[Wed 2004] You have entered Txevu, Lair of the Elite.<br />
<br />
yeah, now that I look back at it, I wish that i would have asked different questions or suggested different things, but i was trying to hit everything I could think of at the time.<br />
<br />
Hope that this clears up some of the questions and concerns that some of you had, and also why I have said certain things on the boards up to this point.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you did good.<br />
you asked questions, gave suggestions, even mingled. i just hope they play a shaman to know how weird the new aa's work ...<br />
a bugged second forte is amazing to say the least. but we all know sooner or later its gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm...so spell casting subtlety is supposed to lower our healing aggro?  If this is the case, it would be helpful although no one can be sure if it is significantly...<br />
<br />
Any feedback on SCS?<br />
<br />
I have some AA points, but none make me feel impulsive enough to want to spend them (</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just got some bad info before the expansion...<br />
<br />
I was reading in several places we would get the pet crit thing and some crit thing to make our pets do more damage.  We got neither.  I just got bad info I guess.  Now I'm looking at the AA's and spells..I like Canni (new) but who knows when anyone will get it.  The new slow..the verdict is still out, but sure doesn't look to make us more needed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Excellent job. Getting to talk one-on-one with a developer like that is a great opportunity.<br />
<br />
I think you raised the right points without being too pushy or complaining too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sorry that you got the bad info, I did start a thread on here the day that we got the new AAs (and lost the pet ones) and explained them a bit.  The informatoin was available here, but so many people didn't either read it, or just kept their own opinions because I had to correct alot of people up till yesterday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you did great, thanks for the post. that was a worth while read even if it was only to show that &quot;they&quot; do talk to players now and then and treat you like you have a clue. very cool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The cleric was funny though ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think you represented the class well!  Quite unlike the other shaman who was obviously a Beastlord spy or a moron or both.  I can't say that I agree with you view regarding the new AAs but it is good to see that a dev got face time with an intelligent member of our class.<br />

It does seem that the dev liked to give &quot;before my time&quot; answer to problems currently facing Shaman.  I think this is weak.  A plumber does not come into a home a say I can't fix your leak because it was caused by the guy before me.<br />
<br />
I also notice some sort of Catch 22 issues the Shaman.  We can't get a better Canni (more efficient) upgrade because that is seen as a mana regen issue that policy makers seem to be cool on.  We did not get spell casting subtly earlier because that would lessen healing agro which is a touchy point with Policy makers.  We were getting penalized as being a healer by not getting SCS but we had the extra agro burden of Slow.<br />
<br />
I am glad you made the dev aware that the Alchemy AA is broken.  He did not seem to be aware of this and something may come of it.<br />
<br />
From what I can see Shaman are so complex and are touched by so may areas of the game and balancing and while that means we have had great utility we now suffer because we are subject to everyones limitations (like limit on mana regen, limit on SCS. limit on MGB heals) and now those limitations are having a mulitpling effect.<br />
<br />
All in all good job with your interview.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">nice questions, but i dont agree with your view on the aa , but do agree the dot is useless<br />
<br />
'hah, yeah, I still hold firm that no one solo's as well as a skilled shaman'<br />
<br />
this is darn right annoying to me, a necro can out solo a shaman anyday, as can a wizard, druid. bards can kill the same high mobs we can just takes them even longer than we do. this statement is just a lie.<br />
yes i can solo well, but we are noway near the best. and havent been since kunark.<br />
<br />
what i did notice, and which i believe is the reason that these expansion is so bad (in my opinion) if the complete lack of knowledge of game mechanic, what happen when ect that dev have! i mean we made the new dots to have inbuilt crit? wft? so that will be bane? 1 dot? that does 2500 ? (3k with focus) ? excuse me but that is not a crit dd.<br />
<br />
it does the damage of a druid crit just, but they can cast 3  in the same time (going on 10 sec for a cast which wuld be long with focus)<br />
<br />
i think it shows acomplete lack of understanding of long duration fights compared to the short duration that are now the norm... my faith that they will be able to do anything when they raise the level cap is tiny now. how can they do anything right when they dont understand whats wrong , what they are doing with the game and why critical dots and dots just dont compare even remotely to dd?<br />
<br />
the thing that this give me the impression is there is a whlole lot of newbie devs, who have no idea what the game is about, how it works or even to talk to each other .<br />
shaman need a complete work over, but you know what ? i think they did it already and called it a beastlord!<br />
<br />
sorry i cant quite explain what i want to.<br />
<br />
ah well i despair, but there is a time for everything to come to an end. and i believe eq time is very close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bara,<br />
<br />
I cut out a small section in there that i was talking to him about soloing in the plant.  He asked where I had soloed, and I told him that I was able to in the plant, but that the mobs hit very very hard and that it wasn't easy.  Then that is where he came up with the part about shamans being the best soloers.  I think that he meant it like shamans overall are the best utility class that can solo, meaning we aren't forced to rely on mobs that don't summon, or mobs that have to be charmed.<br />
<br />
But yeah, the developer was a very nice guy.  From start to finish he was very upbeat and didn't send me off on my way.  At the end he even summoned me into the final zone of GoD and let me roam around for a bit.  I had a really great time in that zone just looking at things and bull****ting with him.  <br />
<br />
One last thing that I didn't add to the conversation that maybe I should have.  I'll have to search for it in the log files, but it went along the terms of me asking him a little bit about his job.  He told me that it was very rewarding, although very long hours.  I then asked if he played EQ, and he told me that I would be surprised, but most of the developers were hardcore gamers.  Of course, I asked him what his character was and what server, but in his best interest he elected not to tell me (and as such, should be that way since knowing someone in a guild is a dev and giving inside strategies is very &gt;:O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i would say that if you have a necro, with the same type of gear  he will be able to solo most things you can, and probably a few you cant.<br />
<br />
i must admit that most things druid wiz can do are in outdoor or large areas parts. but i have seen a wizard tank a sol ro mob that i cant.<br />
<br />
What you say just adds to the misconception that shaman are solo gods because they can do 1 or 2 mobs that other cant? this is not the case.<br />
<br />
Apart form mobs that drop loot, i dont want to be soloing in placed where exp isnt good, which generally means i still in the same places every other solo class can do, and do 50% faster.<br />
<br />
this leaves groups and raids. for grouping we are underpowered due to the slowness of our spells to work mainly. for raids we are underpowered because we cant do our full dps due to high argo. add to this that our heals wont save anyone we are really quite lacking.#<br />
Now the devs dont seem to see this, and this is what depresses me.<br />
I really dont like being a nearly 1 trick pony, no other class is.<br />
<br />
and can you really say that we havent been overlooked or purposely not given anything because of the fact we where very strong in kunark? even that dev seemed to hint this was the case, which is a extremely silly way to work. it seems they are using popular misconceptions and lack of knowledge on how the quick game works (ie the desease dot)<br />
<br />
really the shaman class needs a complete overhaul, and made into a class that unique. and no at the moment we are not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">if it's not undead, and there is nothing around in the area to charm, the necro won't be able to solo stuff that hits too hard.  That stuff in the plant, especially for instance the turtles I doubt will be soloable right now for any class but maybe us.  But, that's only saying that cause we can pour on the dmg over a 2 min period and keep ourselves healed with a slowed mob.  There was some fights in there that I had to lliterally chain heal myself just to get up enough hps to take a chance at doting once, then chain heal again.  Anyways, that's not important.  It wasn't worth the time and effort to do it.  He was the one that said that he thinks that we still are the best soloers, I said nothing of the sort to bring it out of him, other that I said I soloed something that was very hard and took alot of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">it still not soloing well, it all depends on your idea of soloing well.<br />
<br />
i dont count being able to solo something as meaning you solo well, it means you can solo harder stuff, but not always meaning better. The fact other class cant solo it really has nothing to do with soloing well for exp, for example. now most poeple i know will not solo hard mobs just because they can for long. you want a chance at loot/exp. <br />
<br />
How long exactly did it take you to solo these? inculding down time? was the exp or loot worth it? unless exp or loot if worth it you are not soloing better. now if you can solo these in the same time as the other classes solo in there spots, and get great loot, then i will concede that in certain situation we can solo better, but only certain situations. Which still doesnt make us top solo`ers over all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i did this on beta, so it doesn't really apply now, however it took me about 3 - 4 min per kill, and prob only a minute or two of downtime in between (used clickie pox, ultor, deluda, bane, BoS and ancient nife - which I don't have now).  I counted upwards of 300 dps in the final minute of every fight, but the first min was more like 100.  Fights would have been higher, but whenyou have a mob hitting you for double 1200s sometimes, you have to keep good track of your hps and make sure to keep yourself Qd.  Like I said, i was very pleased I could do it, but I couldn't do it everytime.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm also incredibly depressed by the new artificial raid constraint of 54 people. As an elemental guild, we've padded out our roster to be able to attempt events like Rathe Council. Now we're going to ask people to sit out? As a PST player, I'm particularly upset about this, I know who'll be sitting out.<br />
<br />
The fact that Call of the Ancients is a lame hitpoint regen because some dev thought that endurance regen would be useless is maddening. The warriors in my guild I talked to were incredibly happy about the idea of endurance regen. I wanted something unique for us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Devs don't play do they?<br />

I mean seriously, they sit back look at numbers or something, go home and play counter-strike don't they?<br />
<br />
BTW, not knocking him as a person, he sounds like he was a pretty cool guy and all, and well intentioned, but he doesn't actually play, and I doubt others do.<br />
<br />
But what really scares me is the &quot;that was before my time&quot; bit.  Does anyone know the turnaround time on these developers?  Is there any sort of cohesive voice at all in development?  People who have seen past mistakes recognize them and try not to repeat them?  People who say &quot;I know this isn't my end, but issue XXXXX needs brought up and tweaked, there is no way our customer base will enjoy this because they are asking for YYYYYY, and dread any more useless XXXXX issues.&quot;?<br />

Why am i bothering to say that here?  They don't read here, they don't read feedback, they don't read /bug.  They do not listen to their customers for the most part.<br />

I guess they all play BST and not SHM. If the shaman hybrid class is fine then the shaman class must be fine too. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Blaorfi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Ok I dont normally post on these boards I just like to read what others are saying, about everything in general.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to GoD about 98% of shamans dont seem to be happy with it at all, be it with the AA's or spells or both.<br />
<br />
Now I have only just got GoD 2day and its not even installed but I have not explored it so cant really comment on the mobs/hardness of the zones<br />
<br />
Now overall im not happy with the AA's I cant see the point of spending the required amount on most of them.  The only one I am looking forward to is crit dots just casue it looks fun even if it does cause to much aggro for me.<br />
<br />
now the spells, new Canni great, i dont use Canni 4 now, I cant see the point with having over 6k mana pool it just dont move im hoping this is a little better and will be worth casting if/when I get it.<br />
<br />
The slow, well it might be a little worse than Turgors but the faster cast time and less chance to resist has to be a bonus (and if you like me in a raiding guild the faster the slow can get in is the differnece between life and death sometimes.  It also means that you can get the mob slowed why another shaman is casting turgors to get the best effect and there is always more than one shaman on a raid.<br />
<br />
The rest of the spells I dont care about to me there just bo***cks.<br />
<br />
Now alot of peeps say shaman are now just unbalanced, are we though? We have never been the best healers, I dont think we are meant to be or ever will be (and to be honest im proud of that, healing sucks arse if i want to heal I will make a cleric) but I do belive our heal does need a bit of an upgrade and thats only because if you read the history of a shaman. <br />
<br />
You say our dont have that much of a differnce from the chanters and bsts, when all is said and done ours is still better even if its a little bit its better and tanks should notice the differnce aswell as the healers.<br />
<br />
Just to end this as im getting bored of typing  :p we are an odd job class, &quot;Jack of all trades, master of none&quot; we can do a little of everything even if its not that good at least we can do it</div></div><hr />

Yes i can slow and heal in a normal LDoN big deal so could a cleric at level 39. or a druid at level 53  too bad i'm level 64.  Who at Sony or on the development team has a damn clue about our class?  Who is in charge of the Shaman class is what i want to know because they need a swift kick in the ass.

I don't know about you, but I've been in situations and dealth with alot of people in the past.  The last thing you want to do is walk into a place and tell them that their **** is totally ****ed up.  Do you think that he would have continued talking to me if I showed outrage towards what we got as AA???  Either way, I was honest with him.  I told him that although I liked the stuff, I was not the majority.  I told him some of the AAs that I liked, and some of the reasons why i was leary about other AAs.  <br />
<br />
And last, just remember that this guy was only the AA guy.  He had nothing to do with the spells that we get, and he did me a favor by even looking at the internal boards about deluda.</div></div><hr />

You dont have to act like an ass to let him know he needs to rethink his efforts.  I guess he was lucky he bumped into you.  Cant say it helped the Shaman community out much.

I would be safe in assuming that &quot;most&quot; of the shaman class are not happy with the way things went this expansion.   I believe enough posters here have shown that.<br />
