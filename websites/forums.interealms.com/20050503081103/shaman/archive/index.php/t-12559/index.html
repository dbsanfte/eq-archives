<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pibs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I leveled a shaman to 42 last year.  She was a caster shaman, not melee, and she also got hooked on alchemy.  Alchemy took all her money.  She was crummy solo and poor as a church mouse.  I let her go.<br />
<br />
Current shammy is 52 and she rocks.  She is melee shammy (well was, but at 52 I now send pet, dot and relax, because all melee stats maxed)  But have avoided alchemy because of previous unfortunate experience.<br />
<br />
So question is, should I take up alchemy again?  Is it now useful and/or profitable?  I really dont want to lose my cash, which I now know I need for AC and stat equipment.<br />
<br />
But I love the thought of alchemy.  Just feel real burned after previous venture into it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno if its good now or not, I haven't touched it. When I first tried it with my shaman I got up to about 35 skill in it and decided it was already too expensive for me.  :eek: <br />
<br />
I think they added some illusion potions to alchemy with LoY expansion, but besidesthe cool factor I bet they require lots of skill and cash to make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a money making tradeskill forget Alchemy<br />
<br />
Only use I have for my alchemy skill is making gate potions for my main (65 Rog) and for guildmates. Cost me a lot of PP to get to 176 to triv Gate potions.<br />
<br />
If players are creative there are heals and a few other handy potions, Damage shields being the obvious winners, but most people aren't that creative.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">im 65 now and am finally starting to push the alchemy thing, before i had just nuff skill to make the ds potions and others at that skill, was upset about all the neg effects and the stacking issues...at least they got rid of the neg effects on our potions and brought back some of the usefullness of them.  i for one dont mind the money issue really. atm i have some nice gear, and since im in a dkp guild i dont have to buy much to make me happy. so about 2k a week goes to alchemy either in keeping the ds potions handy or getting my skills up. one day i might even take a shot at the gm trinket ahhahahaa</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can leave a toon in the bazaar at night when you sleep then yes you can make a bit of money on sow potions etc.  Just get your alchemy skill up to level 70.  If you can't use the bazaar in that way then don't bother - at 52 you can make better pp from killing mobs, especially those that drop items for other tradeskills.<br />
<br />
Also the cost of learning alchemy has halved now: Sony doubled the rate at which we get skill ups on alchemy some time ago.</div></div><hr />
