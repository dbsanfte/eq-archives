<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm assuming that it can be MQ'd.. Would just like to verify.  I have the pouch of bone dust, changeling essence, Glowing Kunzar Amulet.. but not the Blackened Iksar bones.. a fellow shaman of mine has the bones.. he should be able to turn those in then i turn all my stuff in and it should work correct?  Just wondering if anyone else has mq'd these.. thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">edit: Whoops..i was wrong.  <br />
<br />
Hang out in karnor, you can loot bones off VS or VSR..so it's not THAT hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You should be able to MQ it as long as the person with the bones has good faction.  I read something about an attempted MQ with one person being KOS that failed and resulted in the items being returned.<br />
<br />
For the relics you don't combine squat unless the quest has changed recently.  You get the skull neclace from Xalgoz and turn that in for the pouch of bone dust which is not a container.  The pouch, bones, amulet, and essence are then turned in for relics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Skek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There was no container used for a combine to get the relics as of 2 weeks ago, so unless it changed last patch an MQ should work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's the assumption I was under Skek.. the guy who told me it could me MQ'd is a cudgeled bud of mine =) So I'd figure he'd know what he was doing hehe.<br />
<br />
*edit*  Just checked.. and the bag of iksar dust I got for turning in the xalgoz necklace is *NOT* a container....   So I guess it can be mq'd then since I haven't received a container to make combines in.</div></div><hr />
