<br />
           I,m returning back to Eq after a 4 years vaction from Eq...I'm making a shaman [Human] and wondering what should i put my skills into..Also what skills to work on?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't make a human shaman, but the following racial advantages might want to be considered:<br />
<br />
Troll: Higher regeneration and stamina<br />
Ogre: Cannot be stunned from front (this is a HUGE bonus) and have high starting stamina<br />
Iksar: Higher regeneration and AC<br />
<br />
None of the other races have major advantages/disadvantages.  I went barbarian, like most other people have :)<br />
<br />
The ogres and trolls do have slightly lower wisdom which will make your mana pool smaller at the lowest levels.<br />
<br />
When rolling up a new shaman, I would put all but maybe 5 points into stamina, the remaining 5 I would put into wisdom.</div></div><hr />

All three have negative exp modifiers. Also all three kos in good areas. I think the good areas like Crushbone are much better leveling than the evil ones.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make a Beastlord, save yourself the heartbreak later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Kinda have to agree with Warg on this one. The way EQ is going theres less and less need for a shaman's skillset and beastlords are close enough to take our spots when they are needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agreed.  You actually want to be either a beastlord for a great slow and lots of damage with decent tanking for some exp groups.  Or a druid, for fantastic heals and nukes.  Or possibly an enchanter, to be incredibly useful at any time, for any group. At this point in EQ's evolution, shaman is a bad choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Vah Shir or Ogre for above stated reasons (if I could change on my Barb).<br />
<br />
As for the stats, they will help you level, but should all work out in the end anyways.<br />
<br />
Skills - all of them.<br />
<br />
Good luck and enjoy - I still love my shaman regardless of the problems they are currently facing.<br />
(BL would be a good choice too though! :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Seems like wizards are a hot commodity at the moment.  DPS is always good though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">. At this point in EQ's evolution, shaman is a bad choice.<br />
<br />
Come on now. This simply isnt true. Shaman may not be the best choice if you are headed for a HIGH end game, like Time or Gates, but its still a VERY powerful class for a VAST majority of the content from 1-65 early PoP. We are even pretty darn solid in LDoN hard, although that is where we truly begin to become marginalized. <br />
<br />
My suggestion, Kitty (no XP penalty, no faction problems, nice racial abilities) or Frog (looks cool when you cast spells, heh), all points in STA, and have fun. Great solo, great in groups, great in LDoN, an overall FUN class to play. <br />
<br />
HOWEVER . . . and I grit my teeth when I say this . . . IF you are planning to head for a super high-end guild, then Shaman probably isnt your best choice if you want to be truly useful. Cleric, Wizard, Rogue. Just cant have too many of any of those guys, it seems. <br />
<br />
But if your just gonna play the game, and have some fun, then by all means, make yourself a Shaman. Check the Equipment board for gear suggestions, you can actually put yourself in very very solid gear for under 1K these days. And get buffs. Temperance pretty much trivializes all content from 1-30, and makes it super simple even after that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaetestrophii</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I love my Kitty Shaman!  When I play an alt I always have to remember that falling causes them damage.  Can go lots of places good or not so good and they are indifferent to us as we are to them.  That said, being Agnostic, no deity, therefore no imbue (if you are looking to do that) and no cultural armor (they say we have no culture), higher/lower (not sure which one causes it) metabolism causes you to go throught more food/water.  None of these should dissuade you from playing a kitty.  Another great plus with Kitties is that if you love to quest as I do (hence I play EverQUEST) Vah Shir have more quests than you could want!  And the experience is nice too (doing citizenship quest you are almost lvl 2 before you leave home).  Nice newbie zone with good drops and if you are also a tradeskill addict (again I'm guilty) each class has tradeskilling as part of their newbie quests (and cloaks give modifiers to that tradeskill).  And people are always offering you catnip!  hehe Good luck in whatever race you decide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Two negatives and one kinda misperception usually come through on any race comparison thread.<br />
<br />
The misperception -- ogres have low wisdom.  They have 3 less wisdom than barbs, which are never noted for their low wisdom(since they don't have it).  So calling ogres low wisdom is kind of really stretching the point of how valuable 3 wisdom really is.  At high or low level -- it's not much.<br />
<br />
The unmentioned negatives -- trolls have negative 30 to fire resist, and iksars have negative 30 to cold resist.  That's actually quite a lot.  It's not as important as it used to be when the game was in velious, and in raids you were constantly fighting dragons that cast fire/cold spells -- or even in kunark groups, where many more monsters you battled were wizards casting that kind of spell(very few are now).<br />
<br />
On a side note, I would have to agree that if you are big into raiding and seeing the high end game, shaman isn't the best choice.  DPS classes can stack infinitely, and very few guilds don't have at least occasional, sometimes severe shortages of healers(clerics  especially, druids sure ... don't count shamans, it's not worth it).  You can even stack quite a few chanters without wasting your time.  But, you only need a few shamans even in the biggest raids.  Once you have a reliable handful of them in a guild, there isn't much incentive to pile more on.  Compare that to how many wizards come in handy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm making a shaman<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Damn. it's sad seeing people on the Shaman board saying &quot;Don't make a Shaman&quot; :( it's even more sad that i agree with them.<br />
<br />
Here's the thing with Shaman. They're a pain in the rear in the early game. They level slow, not just because of possible racial penalties, but because shaman kill things very slowly, and in the early levels (1 - 50) don't have a terrible lot to offer a group. Once you hit 49, though, you really take off. You get some nice DoTs, a shiny new pet, and in two levels your Spell, Turgur's. From 51 - 62, it's a hell of a ride, and then, at 62, it slows down quite a bit, and just sort of grinds along as you watch other classes do the same things you do, only bringing more to the table, and you can't really solo for exp anymore.<br />
<br />
But, if you do anyway, here's some recommendations :<br />
<br />
The best Shaman race overall is probably Ogre. Stun immunity from the front, high hit points, still nice wisdom. Slap 20 points into Wisdom and 5 into Agility (if you have under 75 Agility, you take a rather hefty AC penalty). <br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I would say Froglok is #2, because it has a small, low-lag model, innate ultravision, same stats as a barbarian, better than Iksar swimming and breath, some very nice newbie quests, and the absolute best animations in the game... Their armor graphics look very dippy, though, more like original EQ skins than luclin polygons. For them, I would slap all into Wisdom, and the remaining 5 into Stamina (which is already pretty high for an amphibian)<br />
<br />
For a full newbie, I would advise against Iksar or Vah Shir, both for the same reason - They don't get free armor. Sure, the Vah Shir get Ghulam, but, personally I found this to be disgustingly tedious.<br />
<br />
Finally, for your skills... Max your Defense, your Channeling, and your Meditate every level if you can. Save your skill points for stuff you have to buy (Channeling, meditate, Dodge) and tradeskills. For a weapon, stick with one handed peircing or blunt with a shield - There's really no 2hb worth the loss of AC and stats a sheild can give until some really high-end stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Don't listen to the nay sayers.  If you would like a class that is a powerful soloer, is very popular in groups and is still one of the best classes in the game when played well (in my opinion atleast) I would advise going with a shaman.  I feel that there really isn't anything I can't do to fill roles in groups and I have the advantage of being able to solo in good time if I feel like it.<br />
Out of all the choices for races of shaman I would go with Ogre just because the advantage of not being able to be stunned from the front is huge, I often wish I had it even though I still love playing my troll.<br />
I would advise putting your starting points into stamina as it will give you more hit points down the road when you get canibalize.  After you put however many it is into stamina I would put the remaining points into wisdom (unless of course you are under 75 agi).  I never really maxxed out wisdom until I hit the higher levels and it has never been a problem for me when I have the option of cani.</div></div><hr />

All three have negative exp modifiers. <br />
<br />
<br />
You really don't notice it until you hit the mid forties.  With the new group xp bonuses in PoP, the racial penalties aren't an issue after you can get into Planes groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also all three kos in good areas. <br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't even an issue at all.  If you have to go through KOS cities, you can always use invis.  PoK has almost everything you need now and with the shared bank you can make alts in other cities to mule things for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the good areas like Crushbone are much better leveling than the evil ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
All newbie areas are pretty decent for leveling.  Innothule is good.  Field of Bone is good. After level 10 or so you don't really need to go back to old world zones.  Kunark and Luclin all have great areas to group and solo in until PoP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think Vah Shir do have the advantage of highest WIS and most balanced stats. Sneak and Safe Fall can be a big help too.<br />
<br />

<br />
I see almost no Vah Shir shamans on my server.  Barbarian is the most popular followed by iksar, then troll/ogre and then vah shir and froglok.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think Barbarian is the worst, since they have absolutely no bonuses.  If I were to remake a shaman I would probably stay iksar or go ogre.  Frontal stun resistance is really nice.  Though at the high-end of the game trolls and iksars can regenerate ~100hp/tick with self buffs, item buffs and maxed worn regen.  High regen is really useful for mitigating AE DoTs that many mobs have and for reducing canni damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm a Barb, and if I had to do it all over again... I'd probably stay Barb, just because I like it. Although Ogre makes more sense, with the stun thing. Or with a Cat, I guess I wouldn't get all that cross-country spam about falling damage. Nah, I'd stay Barb.<br />
<br />
But yeah, whichever you pick, get Agi to 75 or more, put all you can into Sta (won't matter at end game, but will be handy early on), leftover into Wis.<br />
<br />
And I still have lots of fun with my only character - Shaman. Hoping to get Elemental flags through pickup raids, but I get plenty of invites for normal and hard LDoN. I've stopped accepting invites to BoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Barbarian shaman here, <br />
<br />
But I'd say pick the race that you think looks the coolest.<br />
<br />
Seriously.  There are reasons why most all of the races are &quot;the best&quot;, and none of them are bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Barb Shammy, love to look like Conan, the heck with stats.  I agree, only other race I sometimes wish I had picked is Ogre, but they are just too butt ugly, :)<br />
<br />
As for those that say don't role a shammy, BS.  It is a super fun class to play, I never have a problem finding a group (tell that to a druid), and I have plenty to offer even in the early levels (just lower versions of heal, slow, and buffs).  I am a casual player, 8-10 hrs a week, so I will never be in a big guild or get to the elemental plains (don't really want to either).  I play for fun. If that is your goal, you can't do any better than a shammy.<br />
<br />
True, Beastlords (I have a BST alt) are also plenty of fun and probably a better choice if you want to melee and go to the very high end-game.  But I don't want to melee (that's why I made a caster, duh) and BST only come into their own very late in the game, level 65 with 65% slow and some defensive/offensive aa's and paragon aa.  If you dedicate your life to EQ, then you can get to that level in a few weeks.  Since I don't, I prefer  play a character that has been fun and useful his entire life, not just the end game.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, shaman slowing is hard to justify mana-wise (unless you're a c3 junkie) until lvl 51 and turgur's.  That's a blistering NINE whole levels before a beastlord gets their 50% slow - which coupled with the impressive DPS they put out, along with their mana regen buff, will probably save the healer about the same amount of mana (and benefit you and the group) as a shaman's superior slow.  Unless of course you really want that healing ability - in which case, why didn't you roll up a druid?<br />
<br />
The argument of &quot;shamans only suck in high level raiding&quot; doesn't quite wash.  Still fun to play, sure, in the right situation.  But you can get better results from a host of other classes, both for soloing fun, raiding fun, or all-around balance.</div></div><hr />

 I like barbs cause they are the closest thing to human. Maybe im boring or shallow but i dont like being a big fat Ogre ugly green troll tony the tiger or some flavor of the month frog.<br />
<br />
I have a 52 beastlord and he is a Barbarian too. I did take a Ogre beastlord to 45 but i deleted him because i couldnt stand the size of the model anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I certainly respect your opinion, your statement, &quot;you can get better results from a host of other classes, both for soloing fun, raiding fun, or all-around balance.&quot; doesn't wash with me.<br />
<br />
Most classes in game can not solo, so this statement is not true for almost all melee (except BST), also, chanters can certainly solo using charmed pets, but it's much higher risk and they will die on a regular basis, I can't even remember the last time I died solo.  So which classes are left?  Necros and Druids can certainly solo very well, but neither is able to get groups as well as a shaman (justified or not, just reality).  Yeah, Beastlord can solo and group, but again, this assumes you want to play a melee (which some folks don't) or u want to play pet cleric (boring).  Oh, and which classes are better balanced than a shaman, could you please point them out to me?  Maybe druid, maybe bst if you don't care about heal, maybe necro and bard.  That's perhaps 4 out of 13 classes.  Doesn't really seem like a host of other choices.  And let's not forget, they all have their weaknesses too.<br />
<br />
Some of you are quick to discount shaman strengths and overstate our weaknesses.  Using this logic, you can make any class look like do do.  Keep your comparisons objective and I think you will see that things are not quite as bad as you may think.  <br />
<br />
Yes, there is a huge difference between a shammy's 75% slow at level 51 and a BST's 50% slow until level 65 (and most BSTs I know don't even have the 65% slow spell).  There is also a huge difference between being able to heal for 428 (at level 62) and being able to heal for 1950 or 420/tick for 4 ticks.  So, yeah, BST dps is nice, not at the level of a true dps class like a wiz, magician, rogue, monk or ranger, but nice.  Coupled with their other talents make them a great class.  But they in no way take away from what a good shaman can do.  They have their strengths and weaknesses just like every other class.  So when you compare, be fair.<br />
<br />
And, most melee's I know would rather have a mob slowed 75% than not at all, and have to rely solely on healing and dps to keep them alive.  One thing I personally hate about playing a tank (especially warrior) is that I am totally dependent on the healer to keep me alive.  At least with a mob whose dps has been cut by 75%, I have a much greater chance of survival even if the heals are a bit slow in coming, or the healer is distracted for a tick or two.<br />
<br />
Also, the comment about &quot;why didn't you roll up a druid?&quot; is again, very simplistic and flawed logic.  I guess then, if you want to heal, you should be a cleric, if you want to dps, you should roll a wiz or rogue, and if you want to tank, roll a warrior.  I guess there is no need for hybrids or any of the other dps classes.  Only problem is that they are some of the classes that are most fun to play.  Sure, the one-dimensional &quot;specialist&quot; classes will always be better at a specific task than a hybrid, but that is why they can also be very boring to play.<br />
<br />
Bottom line is that I do not share the overly dramatic &quot;end of the world&quot; view of some of the folks on this board.  Sure, shaman and other classes could use some tweeking, in this type of complex game, it is to be expected, class balance will NEVER be perfect.  However, I would never, EVER, discourage someone who wants to play a fun and versatile classs from picking a shaman. <br />
<br />
On the contrary, I believe shaman are still one of the best choices, if not THE best choice, available for someone who plays to have fun.  Yes, to me, being able to heal well and save someone from death is huge.  Being able to buff their stats, atk, haste, regen, speed, thus making them better at what they do, is huge.  And being able to solo with doggy when I feel like it is nice too.<br />
<br />
Give me a shammy anyday.<br />
