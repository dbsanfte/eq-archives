Feel free to delete this thread as a deliberate attempt to troll. Just gets annoying to come here and see 5 threads on the EXACT same topic.</div></div><hr />

Um no, because THIS thread is absolutely NOT about the &quot;world coming to an end if they dont merge servers&quot;. In fact, if anything, it is ANTI merge (which I am, for a couple months at least).</div></div><hr />

Ive been around for 5 years and I have never seen the amount of threads popping up as has been coming forth lately.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you could do some research please:<br />
<br />
Cite the number of threads in regards to the 'sky is falling' with threads of similar nature in the past.<br />
<br />
Do a comparison over a 3 year time limit with say the release of UO, DAOC,FF##,SWG etc. <br />
<br />
Either way, I dont need a statistical analysis to see that there is a substantial decrease in server population based on my time in eqlive.<br />
<br />
Negating the cries from some of the people is the same as saying ****, you dont have a tooth ache and ignores the symptoms, which is ignorance in and of itself, rather than analyzing the validity of the multiple threads that many members have laid claim to. Here, look at this on the Eqlive boards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq?no_redir=true<br />
<br />
<br />
Down in the search column, type &quot;Server Merge&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I sorted by date, and came up with 25 pages of threads related to the server merges within the past 3 months. At no point in the search did I come across a time prior to these last 3 months that requested server merges with the release of other MMORPG titles. Do it yourself and compare.</div></div><hr />

One in particular that didn't use to be exactly &quot;friendly&quot; with mine.<br />

<br />
Yeah, I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that Sony's forums don't have threads older than 02-26-2004.<br />

That is where you are so dead wrong.  Its your opinion that servers need to be merged, just as its our opinion that they don't.  But you ignorantly insist that your opinion is fact, when it is nothing more than an opinion.  I can site as many examples of why servers don't need to be merged as you can to say why they should.  If things were so horrible as you mention, would there not be hundreds upon hundreds of threads screaming for a merge?  Instead there are just a handful out of the hundreds of thousands of players in EQ.  Just because you and a few others scream the sky is falling doesn't make it so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">This thread needs more made up numbers in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">92% of made-up numbers are false.  However,  94% of statistics are interpreted incorrectly, so that means that the accuracy rate of the non-made-up numbers is just about the same as the made-up ones, after interpretation is taken into account.<br />
<br />
If you add to that the indisputable fact that 40% of people will add their own misinterpretation, and 58% just ignore what's written and spout their own opinions anyway, you're down to 2% getting and understanding the message, so the difference between made-up facts and real facts shrinks even farther.<br />
<br />
Oh, and here are some more made-up numbers: 116 237 12 91 and, of course, 42.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">do you have any idea how much time it took to come up with the number 42? It deserves some respect!!! =D</div></div><hr />

Whew...namecalling- at least that is how some will interpret it and the snowball will just roll downhill.  The EQ boards have always survived on drama/info, so it's pretty natural to see &quot;XXX is Doomed!&quot; threads at any given time of the year.  <br />
<br />
The Basic Math....<br />
<br />
-2 New MMORPG out now(considered heavy contenders-lots of hype)<br />
<br />
-Multiple new videogames out (Halo2)<br />
<br />
-Holiday Season ('tis the season to be jolly as you work your *** off trying to pay for Christmas presents.)<br />
<br />
-College Semester is ending (lots of papers and exams going on)<br />
<br />
With all this going on I am sure there are some servers hurting, but many of those servers had really small populations to begin with.  It's not a sign of EQ failing, its just a random incident that many never went to that server to make their character.  There will be many players coming back come January- I, myself, am coming back in a few days once the DSL is worked out and I figure out what I did with my CD keys.  There are also new players continually coming into the game (EQ and MMORPGS are big with the military.)  So, I wouldn't worry if the sky is falling- stay optimistic and keep chugging along.</div></div><hr />

I really hate to break it to ya, but those numbers are in fact real numbers.  They aren't fantasy made up numbers.  They really do exist! :)</div></div><hr />

Only reason you would need your CD keys is if you sold your account and were going to try steal it back.<br />
<br />
Otherwise, all you need is your account name and password.  Once your Keys have been entered, there is no reason to ever use them again, unless it is to prove ownership over someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Damn.  Caught again.<br />
<br />
OK, multiply them all by 'i' (square root of negative 1).  Then they will not be real numbers.</div></div><hr />

/bonk...nope- if the account was cancelled, you need your cd key to reactivate it....</div></div><hr />

Is this true?  I haven't cancelled my account, but if I did, this is a problem as I have no idea where my cd keys are.  <br />
<br />
Would any cd key work, or would it have to be the original one?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am thinking the original cd key- not sure to be honest.  I switched bank accounts after I took a break, and when I came back it asks for a cd key.  I assumed that I could just go back in and reactivate the account with the login/password, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  I think it might be due to the changes to the &quot;new&quot; login screens that came out in May/June?</div></div><hr />

Nope when i reactivated an account a couple of years ago you do need the CD Key.Lost mine.<br />
BUT if you have the details of the original Credit Card that was used to subscribe that suffices as well.<br />

BZZZZT! Wrong answer, but thanks for playing! Vanna...tell him what he DIDN'T win! :)<br />
<br />
CD key is only used the first time you set up an account and that's it. Unless, as others have stated, you sold the account and are simply providing the key to customer service to prove you are the original owner of the account.<br />
<br />
I've cancelled my EQ accounts dozens of times, literally. I've never been asked for a CD key when I resubscribe the account.<br />
<br />
Maybe they changed it since the last time I resubscribed (Aug/Sept 2004, 5 accounts, all for one month each. And this was after they changed everything over to the web based subscription interface vs. the old in game graphical sign up screens.)? Either that, or you guys are smoking some really good chit! :)<br />
<br />
Oh...and to stay on topic...&quot;so...exactly when will they merge the servers? Cuz, well...the sky is falling ya know&quot;.  :p</div></div><hr />

Bah! Well, I am going to check out the login screen again because I swore it was asking for the CD key again.  Believe me, I would prefer not to have to track down my original CD key.  Anyway, derailment over- back to the subject.<br />
<br />
Edit: They are indeed asking for Account Keys now....</div></div><hr />

No, they're not requiring CD keys to resubscribe existing accounts. So long as you remember the login information for the account, all you have to do is verify name/address, specify billing frequency/account type, provide credit card info.</div></div><hr />

Your right, I just found out what the problem was.  It looks like I had 2 EQstation logins and I was using the wrong one that wasn't attached to any off my accounts.  I switched the login and went straight into my old account activation.  Sorry about that mess.</div></div><hr />
