<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Terar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have just recently started playing on the Sullon Zek server.  I want to know if anyone can tell me some good equipment and also some good Shammy PvP tactics.  I have started a Vah Shir.  Any help will be greatly appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shammann65</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you just started that means that you have no Equipment... right? Okay.. you'll just have to keep killing Yard trash and stuff till level 10 or so (Takes about 8 hours of good play to get to level 10). Then run to Lake Wrath and kill gnolls (close to South Karana zone). At night fall a white underd Gnoll spawns (Might be named) every 20 min or so. KILL THAT FU*CKER! and loot the skull... its like +30 mana offhand and stuff (Can't be looted off you when your PK'd). Then run to Split Paw (In South Karana Zone) and start killing Gnolls there for a wepon/splitpaw eyes/and Tunic. All this can be done in 8 hours. From there get to Halas and buy Poison spells (think you get first one at level 12) At level 12 with shaman spells you can get some good PKs. With the 30+ mana side wepon it makes another spell cast :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Flea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">on a note ... items can't be looted on SZ only PP if it is an even kill ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Quit now and go to a fun server.....that is all.<br />
<br />
And shammann I hope you are joking about getting that skull of jhen tra @ lvl 10 as the gnoll embalmer is lvl 20ish and Gnolls in SK are lvl 25+</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got bad news for you. Goods are vastly outnumbered by the evils so you can't just pick and choose a place to hunt at will. As a nontwink you will be getting owned by the twinks for a long time.<br />
<br />
For decent newbie gear do the quests in ST. I outfitted my vah shir beasty with almost a full set of ghulam armor, a nice cloak and some rebirth leather sleeves. It takes a while to gather all the items but you get decent xp while doing it and for some reason there aren't many pkers hanging out in ST to ruin your day.<br />
<br />
For hunting this is what I've done so far.<br />
<br />
1-9 ST<br />
9-14 PC on the ST side. Amazingly this was controlled by the goods so I was only pk'd once. I also split time doing the lodi camp in ST for my quest items<br />
14-22 PC on the HS side. Again mostly good and newt controlled. However once you try PC from SH side it's a different story. After getting pk'd about 10 times in a row doing recondites I finally gave up and looked for alternate ideas :)<br />
22-27:  ST again :) Only this time the caves with all those alien guys. Quite fun and good money. Soloable by a beasty but as a shaman you'd probably need a partner.<br />
27-30: Swamp of No Hope skellie camp. Yep right in the backyard of the evils. 99% of the time I was the only one in the zone. Only died once and that was due to a guard. It's a long trip there but worth it.<br />
30-33: FV. Drolvargs on east side of zone. Evils don't like this place because it's loaded with dixies that they are KOS to.<br />
33-34: Currently in a place I don't want to disclose till I'm done :)<br />
<br />
SZ is actually quite fun even with the reds pking you and the frustrations of trying to kill a twink with mega resisists. There are certain zones that you just can't touch because the evils or newts own them but at the same time there are plenty of areas to hunt where nobody is at. You also level 20% faster and lose 50% less xp when you die to a mob or PC so if you can find a nice quiet spot to level it goes by fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>winuvyen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I beg to differ with the person who said quit and go on to a fun server. By that, I guess he is referring to a blue server. I have been on a blue server since the Kunark expansion came out and two months ago made the switch to pvp...and I have NEVER had so fun playing the game. I believed that I was at the top of my game when I made the jump. I had been on numerous raids with one of the best guilds on my server and I also felt my solo skills were the sharpest they could be. BUT when I jumped to SZ, I learned that I was really a one-dimensional player.<br />
<br />
On a red server you have to be much more aware your surroundings every minute of the game. You have to know your zones--not the creatures, they are secondary. You must know who controls the zone you want to go into, what the chances are you can make it through in one piece. You constantly do /who all to see who is in the zone. You learn your enemies, their names, their guilds.<br />
<br />
Gear. You know that worthless resistance junk (like MR) you shun on the blue server for other stats like WIS, MANA, etc? I never really cared much about MR, CR, FR, etc on the blue server. They were practically meaningless to me. On the red server, ALL of the stats have great importance, especially MR.<br />
<br />
And I haven't even mentioned the fights. The fights can be epic. I've been on numerous epic fights on the blue server and I've seen much better fights at lower levels on the blue server. I've been in all kinds of brawls, I've been rooted, tashed, blinded, nuked, backstabbed, slashed, dotted, killed by a pet, you name it. But I have learned how to deal with it. Do you know what a pumice stone is?<br />
<br />
It used to bother me a little bit too that on the blue server the storyline didn't matter. Yes, a Wood Elf couldn't go wandering around in Cabilis, but beyond that the Woodie could pal around with his Iskar buddy away from their respective zones. I happen to be a Wood Elf on SZ and I see an Iskar....well, let's just say I know I'm not going to be grouping with him.   :eek: <br />
<br />
But there are drawbacks to a red server. There are bullies who kill newbies and I have found that the SZ server as a whole is a little immature. But it is a great challenge and a lot of fun to play there. It has made me a heck of a lot better player. And yes....it has been FUN!</div></div><hr />

I 100% agree with you here. Life on SZ takes on a whole new meaning and my adrenaline pumps in a way that I don't get on a blue server. When I med I don't just sit down anywhere, I look for a place that offers cover and a tree or rock to rest my backside with. I always shrink myself and pet to make me harder to see from a distance. I do /who constantly :)<br />

<br />
Aye, isn't it amazing how all the annoying people pick small races like gnomes and halfings? :) There are some truely idiotic 10-year old types on SZ but there are also mature peeps like me who enjoy a good battle and like to talk and laugh about it afterwards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Welcome :) <br />
I too have to say that playing on Sullon takes the gaming one step further. It's challenging in another way than on a blue server and you'll get the adrenaline rushes you thought you'd lost. Both winuvyen and Solariis describes it pretty well, so listen to them :) <br />
<br />
Don't be afraid of the immature reputation of the server either - I find it pretty easy to avoid most of them most of the time.<br />
<br />
Killing a mob like for instans Gantru Dralkenr is always a challenge since you never know who will enter the zone. On my blue server it was just a yawn.<br />
<br />
For my first 40something levels I was very untwinked. I quested for armor and all money I got I put on MR stuff. Everything else came second after that stat - if they can't snare or root you, you can always run away and fight from a distance or chose a better place to fight (or just run away if they're too red). That philosophy served me well and I would start that way over again if I had to, so that would be my best advice. Might be bit harder for you starting now since there are so many twinks now (with 3 chars allowed instead of only 1) but I still think it's a good base idea.<br />
<br />
Start with the vah shir newbie quests for armour. When you get bit higher there drop some ok stuff to wear in Stonebrunt. This won't cost you any pps so you can use all you get for spells and mr equipment. <br />
<br />
Also don't forget that levels means a lot in PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Excellent choice going with the good team bro.<br />
<br />
As far as gear you want to shoot for, let me just say this.  Hit points and magic resist will be the things you are shooting for early on.  Your goal is about 130-160 svm.  If you get rooted or snared in battle, pretty good chance you're going to be screwed.  Extra wisdom won't save you in most of those cases, so it's just better not to get snared or rooted.  With this in mind,<br />
<br />
pair of velium fire wedding rings (6ac, 65hp)<br />
earring of essence (30hp, 10svm)<br />
sabretooth amulet (see invis neck, 5sta, 15svm)<br />
bloodstained mantle (10svm shoulders)<br />
hollowed bone bracers (15mana, 7svm arms)<br />
not sure if you can wear the dwarven ringmail or not from crushbone<br />
<br />
just some of the gear that i can recommend off the top of my head.  get used to ****ty gear for a while, most low lvl gear isn't known for both good resists and other good stats.<br />
<br />
here are some sites to get you in the right mindset...<br />
<br />
-Flowers of Happiness site-pk guild on both rallos and sullon, check out some of the links on the left.  http://www.notacult.com/<br />
-pvp101:  http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp101.html<br />
-pvp102:  http://www.geocities.com/neferaza/pvp102.html<br />
-sz score boards:  http://everquest.station.sony.com/stats/sz_summary.jsp<br />
<br />
um, for places to level:<br />
9-32: Estate of Unrest (just off dagnors cauldron, which is connected to butcherblock) - great for cash farming too at low lvls.<br />
7-18: crushbone - heavily trafficked by high lvl evils and neuts looking to grief lower lvls.<br />
20ish-40: Mistmoore (off lfay, which is off gfay)<br />
15-26: pladual - also heavily trafficked by high lvl evils and neuts looking to greif lower lvls.<br />
35-55: jagged pine forest - pretty pk safe (more pk action than tm or katta though)<br />
35-49: tenebrous mtns - pretty pk safe<br />
40ish-55ish: the hole<br />
49-60: katta - pretty pk safe<br />
53-65: Plane of Innovation<br />
<br />
if you can put groups together, karnors, seb and the dungeons are pretty safe for goods.  don't come to PoI if you're not 53, you're pretty much worthless before then.</div></div><hr />
