<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dacron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There is a spot that I have found after a suggestion from a Mage friend of mine. Good xp, consistent spawns and fairly safe. It seems to have been made for Melees and Casters alike from levels 25 to 30. Once you reach 30, move on.<br />
<br />
Got to the entrance to Dalnir in WW. There are two rooms of Hulking brutes that can be pulled singly w/ out agroing the others. <br />
<br />
One room has a three spawn, while the other has 2 spawns. It is hardly camped at all and you can clear each room, med and start all over. At level 25 and 26 I was clearing approx 2.5 bubs of blue xp.<br />
<br />
Check out the map on EQ atlas and have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ahh i remember this spot, spent my early years there.  Theres a spot just like it in the Dreadlands also, think the levels for it are 35-40.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dynovet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The brutes outside of Dalnir aren't nearly as safe as they use to be. There are anywhere from 2 to 3 roamers in the cave system now, which can make root and rot dangerous, and getting from the 2 spawn to the 3 spawn can be dangerous because of the 'hidden in the wall' brute that is at the crossroads all the time. Be careful here, don't wander around with 40% hit points after a canni session, and keep sow up to zone into Dalnir if things go bad, which they can now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Runners will &quot;poof&quot; into the wall as well. I solo'ed my BL there til about 29 and I would /feedback this about 4 times a day. I sincerely doubt the problem has been fixed ;) <br />
<br />
It is a good spot though :)  No lack of mobs and Brute Hides for that aspiring tailor you know :D</div></div><hr />
