<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just hit 35 on the toolbooth guards in wc. They were really good exp, but no loot. If I can find a partner, the druids in ec/wc are good exp, and awesome loot. I was wondering if there are any other guards that I can kill effectively as I have found them to be really good exp.<br />
<br />
Any other really good exp areas for my lvl? I was thinking of going to oot, as suggested on this board, but a friend wants to pl me on specs so I want to stay around for a bit. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im in dawnshroud, good xp, no loot, but i think im gonna make a roadtrip and try out CC in velius.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The Uthorks are not bad either at 34-40ish  though I did them form about 29 but were much harder.  Nice loot too just dont let the tusks rot they are worth a pretty penny.  20pp ot other players or 1-200pp plus for turning them in for quest in Cobalt Scares.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>oneyebarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">stupid question but where are <br />
The Uthorks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ulthorks are located in Eastern Wastes in Velious. Just north of the bridge past the Coldain camp, just follow the shoreline north. You'll come to a clearing where Walrus, Ulthork Warriors, Ulthork Hunters, and Whooly Rhinos. <br />
Stay away from Rhinos and Ulthork Warriors until 39 or so, they hit very hard, very fast and have a mountain of HP's. <br />
Good exp and loot I've been hunting them since 35, I'm 39 now.<br />
<br />
PS - Coldain will not help you if you overpull so run to bridge.</div></div><hr />
