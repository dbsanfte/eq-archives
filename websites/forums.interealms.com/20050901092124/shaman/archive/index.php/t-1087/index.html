<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">for some reason i can't reply to blarg's thread... so:<br />
<br />
all the activated AA skills are done by a text line in the format:<br />
<br />
/alt activate #<br />
<br />
where # is the number assigned to the AA skill<br />
<br />
i can't remember what offhand can5 was... im guessing 48, and mgb is 37 i think.  <br />
<br />
you can just scroll through the numbers.. valid range is 1-125... after 125, you get an out of bounds error.. it is kinda funny to have it say you have no skill in manaburn or escape</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I couldn't reply to his thread either.  Wierd.  Anyway, make an AA hotkey like normal (hit the &quot;make hotkey&quot; button).  Right-click the new hotkey to edit it like you would a social.  You'll see the command used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mogur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">well, the way i have it, is if you want to put it in a multi-line macro in socials box...<br />
<br />
like my can5 hotkey has a message saying im about to tear off a limb so i dont freak my clerics out</div></div><hr />

To get the number use the AA skill, then hold down Shift key then press the up arrow, it will show you the alt activate # you need.</div></div><hr />

Dunno why  my thread there is jammed, but oh well.  My wording was so clumsy I'm glad it wasn't totally unintelligible.</div></div><hr />
