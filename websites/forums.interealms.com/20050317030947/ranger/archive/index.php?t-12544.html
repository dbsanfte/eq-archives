They dropped down a cliff and got destroyed by a bunch of hobgoblins.   Anyways after 15 minutes of death their corpses spawned at the zone in... I was just wondering if this is only for Plane of NIghtmare or if it is true for all the rest of the planes.</div></div><hr />

Id like to see a 1 hour timer, with a trigger to move your corpse to graveyard after 15 minutes should you choose.  Or even just a confirmation box asking if youd like to be moved to the graveyard after 15 minutes would be fine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arath</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For the lager raid type guilds would it not be possible to camp a cleric in the zones graveyard? The number of folks who two box clerics should allow that and possibly a mage in the raid could CoH the player back if the Graveyard is in the same zone as I am reading it they are.<br />
<br />
I am far from a raid/plane expert but I would think this well within the ability of most raid type guids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 04:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Aye but if they still have a mage alive where the person died and the raid is going on it would be quicker to just click the person there and have em back up in running.   <br />
<br />
From what i understand your corpse lays where you died, after 15 minutes it moves to the grave yard at zone in.<br />
<br />
During a raid with clerics camping then coming back on after mobs have moved and rezzing this could be annoying (as it could take more then 15 min, and then all the corpses move).  Reall annoying if you have repops behind you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Braslo</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">some people are even reporting their corpses warping to the graveyard after they have been resed at the combat site, but before they were able to loot their gear.  That's just stupid.<br />
<br />
And we don't know if they have or will disable CoH in these zones, so CoH might not be an option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Borzak</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 06:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm guessing CoTH will soon be disabled. As is now there's a fair number of &quot;events&quot; that NPC teleports you to and states a maximum number of 12. Well guess what, you can CoTH more there when you there so I'm guessng that's going bye bye soon.<br />
<br />
I don't like the mandatory 15 minute deal either. In an experience group it's ok. But once you get to killing some gods in the planes I'm betting fights last longer than 15 minutes and if you don't get a battle rez oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaynia</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 07:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They should just make /corpse always succeed while in the graveyard regardless of distance from your corpse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Icye</div><div class="date">10-24-2002, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is gonna suck for big mobs  you die you need SUPER REZ fats your gonan need like 5 clerics just sitting wiht epics waiting for someont o drop then immediatley casting rez to keep the raid going or once  10 people go or if you on a 2 group raid 1 group goes you scrwed until the cleric/cleric is done haling to rez ALL of em or you have a nice long run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Northerner</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 07:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see this as an intentional move.<br />
<br />
On the one hand it encourages risk-taking and I love it.  On the other, if you wipe you wipe, camping Clerics out won't do you much good unless you are fast.  And on that note, if you are you will be back and running long before the GY timer sets off.<br />
<br />
I'd also wager this is not a feature in the 'upper' planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LyssaRZ</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 08:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">15 minutes is long enough for most people to get their act together.  Unless its a total wipeout, and in that case you'd want your body at the graveyard anyways.  I've also heard that having someone move the corpse will keep it from warping.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 bits.</div></div><hr />

That would address everybody's problems. Great solution, but no clue if it is workable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 11:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had someone go link dead last night for about 5 RL minutes. In that time, he died and his corpse seemed to warp immediately to the graveyard. As if that isn't lame enough, you cannot drag corpses away from the graveyard. So when I went back to drag him back to the group and res him back to the group, every time i got a couple steps away from the graveyard his corpse would fly on back there. I don't think this is a very good feature, though I am aware of the sorts of abuses people would use to move raids around were this not in place. Still, something has to give here, it's not like he chose to be link dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delyth</div><div class="date">10-25-2002, 08:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dunno, I personally like the graveyards.<br />
<br />
They just require people to change their raid tactics is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorongil Eless</div><div class="date">10-27-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the reason the corpse keeps going back to the graveyard is the zone checks the corpse timer and if it is +15 mins, it goes to graveyard.  The corpse prolly gets a check each tick so it will pop back there every time.   <br />
<br />
I think the /corpse trick from the graveyard would be a great change to the feature as it automatically going can cause trouble.</div></div><hr />

If the group can't find time to click me within 15 minutes, odds are they have bodies that will be en route to the yard themselves.  We haven't run into any insanely long fights, so far the planes seem to be all about fast and high damage mobs, with lower end hps</div></div><hr />

Took us about 5 minutes of running around lookig to rez it. We did a shout in zone and sure enough he was in the graveyard.</div></div><hr />
