<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings my fellow mystics,  I recently dinged 46 and am wondering where i should go to hunt.  Ive been told the Plane of Fire is good but this is my first character and im not sure if i want to just leap into the Planes without knowing what to expect.  <br />
<br />
Heres my info, <br />
<br />
46 Iksar Shaman, i have around 900 AC if I remember right, and roughly 200 Wisdom.  Im fairly well equiped but not uber twinked.  I like to pull mobs with slow, send in the Dog of Doom and load em up with a few dots then melee the rest.  <br />
<br />
Any info would be a tremendous help for me!</div></div><hr />

You wouldn't last 2 seconds in any of the PoP zones at lvl 46. You'd have a hard time at 56 much less 46. Who ever told you that it would be perfect at your level was jerking your chain. <br />
Go to City of Mist in the Emerald Jungle, you could tear that place up. Plus there is an 20% experience modifier in that zone. There are epic drops there too, so go to CoM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm 46 and I read somewhere in this forum that the gnomes in Echo are good to lvl 50, thats where I think I'm heading but I too am open for suggestions, I see here some one suggested CoM. Where and what would you kill in Com? any specific camp spots?<br />
<br />
thanks for the info...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samyen Elementia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One time I killed the gnoll king with my necro (I think it was the king)  I fear kited him to the zone and when he died, he died on the zone border and I couldn't loot him (said it was too far).  Everytime I tried to get close enough to loot, I zoned into SH.  I was mad.  Faction hit for no lewtz.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns is great, or you can move on to Dreadlands and kill the skellies by the pyramid.  Pull with Slow (they shouldn't add if you pull from max range with ER item) and then Root, DoT, dog, melee.  Great experience.  About 1-2% per kill depending on which ones you kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yea I was bummed that I didn't get to do soloing in there. Back in the day I once led a raid through there for fun. Fun zone, though I'm looking forward to revisiting when i'm higher level.</div></div><hr />
