<br />
Don't take that bad day out on someone you know, take it out on someone you DON'T know.<br />
 <br />
Now get this. I was sitting at my desk, when I remembered a phone call I had to make. I found the number and dialed it. A man answered saying, &quot;Hello?&quot; I politely said, &quot;This is Fred Hanifin and could I please speak to Robin Carter?&quot;<br />
<br />
Suddenly the phone was slammed down on me! I couldn't believe that anyone could be that rude. I tracked down Robin's correct number and called her. She had transposed the last two digits incorrectly. After I hung up with Robin, I spotted the wrong number still lying there on my desk. I decided to call it again. When the same person once more answered, I yelled &quot;You're an *******!&quot; and hung up. <br />
<br />
Next to his phone number I wrote the word &quot;*******,&quot; and put it in my desk drawer. Every couple of weeks, when I was paying bills, or had a really bad day, I'd call him up. He'd answer, and I'd yell, &quot;You're an *******!&quot; It would always cheer me up. <br />
<br />
Later in the year the Phone Company introduced caIler ID. This was a real setback for me; I would have to stop calling the *******. Then one day I had an idea. I dialed his number and when I heard his voice, &quot;Hello?&quot; I made up a name. &quot;Hi this is Trevor Dawson. I'm with the Telephone Company and I'm just calling to see if you'd be interested in our caller ID program?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; he shouted and slammed the phone down. I quickly called him back and said, &quot;That's because you're an *******!&quot;<br />
<br />
Keep reading this, it gets better! An old lady at the shopping center really took her time pulling out of a parking space. I didn't think she was ever going to leave. Finally, her car began to move and she started to very slowly back out of the slot. I backed up a little more to give her plenty of room to pull out, indicator still going. &quot;Great&quot;, I thought, &quot;she's finally leaving.&quot; All of a sudden this black BMW comes flying up the parking aisle in the wrong direction and pulls into her space. I hit the horn and started yelling, &quot;You can't do that. I was here first!&quot; The guy climbed out of his BMW completely ignoring me. He walked toward the shopping center as if I didn't even exist. I thought to myself, &quot;This guy's another *******; there sure are a lot of *******s in this world.&quot; Then, I noticed he had a &quot;For Sale&quot; sign in the back window of his car. I wrote down the phone number. Then, I hunted for another place to park. <br />
<br />
A couple of days later, I'm sitting at my desk. I had just gotten off the phone after calling ******* #1 yelling, &quot;You're an *******!&quot; (It's really easy since I have his number on speed dial now) I noticed the phone number of the guy with the black BMW there on my desk and thought I'd better call this guy, too. <br />
After a couple rings, someone answered the phone and said, &quot;Hello.&quot; I said, &quot;Is this the man with the black BMW for sale?&quot; &quot;Yes, it is.&quot; &quot;Can you tell me where I can see it?&quot; &quot;Yes, I live at 1802 West 34th street. It's a yellow house and the car's parked right out front.&quot; I said, &quot;What's your name?&quot; &quot;My name is Don Hansen.&quot; &quot;When's a good time to catch you, Don?&quot; &quot;I'm home in the evenings.&quot; &quot;Listen, Don, can I tell you something?&quot; &quot;Sure...&quot; &quot;Don, you're an *******!&quot; And I slammed the phone down. <br />
<br />
Then, I added Don Hansen's number to my speed dialer. I must say, for a while things seemed to be going much better for me. Now, when I had a problem I had two *******s to call. Then, after several months of calling the *******s and hanging up on them, it just wasn't as enjoyable as it used to be. I gave the problem some serious thought and came up with this solution: <br />
<br />
First, I had my phone speed dial ******* #1. A man answered nicely, &quot;Hello?&quot; I yelled, &quot;You're an *******!&quot; but I didn't hang up. The ******* said, &quot;Are you still there?&quot; I said, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He said, &quot;Stop calling me.&quot; I said, &quot;Make me.&quot; He said, &quot;What's your name, pal?&quot; So I told him, &quot;Don Hansen.&quot; He said, &quot;Where do you live?&quot; &quot;1802 West 34th Street. It's a yellow house and my black BMW's parked out front.&quot; &quot;I'm coming over right now, Don. You'd better start saying your prayers.&quot; &quot;Yeah, like I'm really scared, *******!&quot; and I hung up. <br />
<br />
Then I called ******* #2. Don Hansen answered, &quot;Hello?&quot; I said, &quot;Hello, *******.&quot; He said, &quot;If I ever find out who you are...&quot; &quot;You'll what?&quot; &quot;I'll kick your ass.&quot; &quot;Well, here's your chance. I'm coming over right now, *******.&quot; And I hung up. <br />
Then I picked up the phone and called the police. I told them I was on my way to 1802 West 34th Street and that I was going to kill my gay lover as soon as I got there. <br />
<br />
Another quick call to Channel 13 about the gang war going on down on West 34th Street. After that I climbed into my car and headed over to 34th Street to watch the whole thing. Glorious satisfaction! <br />
<br />
Watching two *******s kicking the crap out of each other in front of 6 squad cars and a news crew was one of the greatest experiences of my life! Now you know what to do if you have a really bad day.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telloran Treehugger</div><div class="date">04-26-2002, 04:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, that story sounds very familiar to something that one of my co-workers is doing currently. He commutes to work from another state so he's up every morning at about 5am. <br />
<br />
Well, one day he was driving to work on the highway and a guy blatantly cut him off. He slammed on the horn and then noticed, &quot;Hey, he's got a for sale sign in his back window. Not a very smart thing to keep there if you're going to be cutting people off left and right.&quot; <br />
<br />
So he proceeded to take down the guys number, who happened to leave both his home and cell number. <br />
<br />
Now for the past month or so, my co-worker has been calling this guy at 5am, when he wakes up for work. He has also been calling him on weekends when he gets up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom or something. I must say I admire his persistence.<br />
<br />
He says he's going to keep on calling this guy until he gives him a verbal apology over the phone. The guy knows who my co-worker is because every morning he introdues himself as &quot;the guy that you cut off the other morning, bastard.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taamar Bladesworn</div><div class="date">04-27-2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, there is hope for a glorious civilization now... the world needs more vigilante ***hole monitors. Here's a joke I've heard in two different versions:<br />
<br />
CONVERSATIONS WITH ***HOLES:<br />
1. When you get in a conversation with someone who obviously thinks he knows more than you do, answer all this statements with 'Fantastic!' Now, of course, he will start to wonder... and you explain to him that you took a course in business management. He will have no idea why this is relevant and will likely tell you so... Then you tell him that your professor taught you about the uses of the word 'Fantastic'... and he mentioned that its more polite then 'bull****'.<br />
<br />
2. Some people are obviously far too proud of their belongings. When faced with one who incessantly brags about material objects use this tactic: <br />
WENCH: Did you see my new BWM? Shiney red, leather interior, my husband bought it for me.<br />
YOU: A new BMW? Thats nice *smile sweetly*<br />
WENCH: ANd we just bought a summer home in the mountains... with a Jacuzzi!<br />
YOU: Thats nice, you must be so happy<br />
WENCH: You should see all the things I had to buy Junior for that new prep school we are sending him to... you'd be amazed how much they charge for tuition.<br />
YOU: You must be so proud of him... thats nice<br />
WENCH; OH! And did you see the 3 carat diamond my husband got me for our anniversary? Did you get anything nice for your anniversary?<br />
YOU: My husband sent me to Charm School.<br />
WENCH: Charm School?<br />
YOU: Yes... it was wonderful, they taught me to say 'thats nice' instead of '**** you'!<br />
<br />
All day at work I tell people 'thats nice' and 'fantastic!'... it makes me feel better.<br />
<br />
