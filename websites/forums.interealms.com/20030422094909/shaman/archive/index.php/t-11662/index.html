<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all!  I've gone through the trial of execution about 20 times now, failed each time. I was wondering why spells you used during trials and what classes you had in your group.  Please help me with some suggestions, most of my friends and guildies are flagged now.<br />

<br />
Try a different trial, you might be surprised. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My way when I was 60 was with a 65 War, 61 wiz, 61 mage, 60 chanter, 65 cleric, and we AE'd.<br />
I used rain spell only, ToP.  <br />
I had tried all kinds of different groups, but this was by far the easiest. Only took 2 tries.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I got my flag, I had to two box cleric and shaman.  To keep from taking damage from my own rains, throughout the waves the cleric used aes, shaman healed, and used pet.   Once exe popped, cleric went to healer, I slowed, dotted, sent gang of puppies, the works.   Was a lot smoother that way than trying to have the cleric healing and me doing damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Finally finished, this was kind of an odd group.<br />
<br />
Had no CC, but 65 monk, 65 warr, 62 cleric, 60 rogue, 61 paladin.  I torpored the cleric when she got heal aggro, and chained ice strike.  No slowing, the warrior and paladin used a DS potion, had outside C3 and druid thorns.<br />
<br />
Kept feeding dogdog fine steel weapons (ran out of everything better LONG before) because I couldn't remember if the 61 pet needs to be alpha'ed.<br />
<br />
DPS were JUST on the line.  I think the mobs fell as the exe's axe was swinging at that little guy's neck every single time.  No nameds or we would've scratched for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Took a long time for me as well. Don't slow until you get to the end mob. Go for DD instead. Bring your pet. Get him out before you head in, buff him up and give him some weapons. When you go into the trial room summom him to your side. Assist the tank, sick your pet and nuke whatever he is on fast and hard. <br />
<br />
I have seen people get through pretty well using AoE but thats not how I got through. I don't remember exactly what classes we had when I made it but it was something like, Warrior, cleric, rogue. monk, mage, shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To win execution everytime...<br />
wiz 62+ ae dd<br />
wiz 62+ ae dd<br />

you ae slow<br />
<br />
Fastest and safest way possible, period. Beg 2 wizs the rest of the group will come easy. Tried 30ish times with pickup groups all failed. Sit for a couple of hours begging wizards and you will pass with ease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I thought druid DS and the DS potion didnt stack?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman ds potion stacks with thorns, but not with the mage ds.<br />
<br />
What mcast said about aoe groups is dead on, they are 10 times easier than melee groups.  I think one wizard plus plus one mage is better though, because the mage pet can whoop ass on the Exe when/if you are kiting him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well, I have to disagree with the &quot;don't slow&quot; crowd... DO slow, but with Tigir's, and accept the results of that 1st cast.  I've had excellent results; some resists, but not too many.  Keeps agro off the cleric, and there's generally sufficiently less damage dealt that the cleric has better mana for nuking, etc, later on.  After that, if you have the 61 poison dot, use that.  If there's no CC other than you, use Torrent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i was lucky enough to pass on my first ever trial attempt<br />
<br />
the setup was: 65pally 61shm(me) 60rogue 60chanter 62ranger 61rogue 60mage.<br />
<br />
we had pally stand in middle, when wave spawned all mobs went to him.. i ran just outside of tirgirs range and right when it hit i ran right next to him.. whole group ran in after that, chanter did single target mezzes while group beat the mobs up quickly.. of all waves we only had one close call, others werent even close, our dps owned.  the mage is a real plus becuase he can instant-kill the rock mobs with the lvl60 banishment spell and has great dps to boot.<br />
i healed the entire thing, had c3 from outside chanter of course, the paladin helped heal party members that got hit like the enchanter a couple of times but other then that i just casted kraggs mending on the pally, torpors not an option because it lowers dps too much, but i bet having tnargs would have helped a bit.   never finished a wave under 90m and when it came time for the exec he died when i was at 40m, we didnt even use DS potions.<br />
all party members were in pretty mediocre gear, like skyshrine quest or worse, exept for the paladin who has vt+ gear.     best of luck, i know some guys that tried it over 50 times before they passed it but its worth it.</div></div><hr />
