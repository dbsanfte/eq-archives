<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday, a ranger told me that shaman's slow has the same chance to land as an enchanter 5 levels higher. However, I've noticed before that Lucy's indicates that neither our slow nor the enchanter's best one, Forlorn Deeds, has a resist modifier.<br />
<br />
I assumed he was getting confused because a shaman slow is 5% higher than an enchanter slow of the same level.... Or put another way, for levels 51-60, a shaman can slow as much as an enchanter 5 levels higher.<br />
<br />
However, one of my recent experiences was in PoI factory, where I (59 shaman) replaced someone in an existing group who already had a 61 enchanter. Both the enchanter and the cleric commented that my slow seemed to get resisted noticeably less - the cleric had much less unslowed healing to do. The enchanter said that she was resisted a lot - I seemed to be much less resisted.<br />
<br />
Was the enchanter just having bad luck? Could even the fact that I tend to slow from melee range have some bearing on it? (I don't know how she was slowing, but she was tashing, nuking and dotting from outside melee range, so I assume she was slowing there also). The cleric might have noticed he had more mana because my slow was faster cast, and as slower, I could take a beating better than the enchanter.<br />
<br />
I spoke to a 65 enchanter friend about it too... He said, anecdotally he's noticed that shaman slows do seem to resist less than enchanter slows.<br />
<br />
I've also heard people here say that beastlord slows seem to be much more likely to hit than shaman slows.<br />
<br />
Is it possible that shaman slows are less resistable than enchanter ones, or was the ranger just mistaken? I still think the latter, but the other stuff has put just enough doubt in my mind to ask if anyone else has any stronger evidence one way or another. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">None of the slows you mentioning (magic based slows) have any resist modifier on.<br />

So resists are based on your level and your luck on the R(andom) N(umber) G(enerator).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know about the resist modifier - I mentioned it in my post. But, neither do I believe that what's in Lucy is the be all and end all of spells.<br />
<br />
Plus, I remember shamans writing (complaining) here that a beastlord's slow is more likely to hit than their own.<br />
<br />
Hence, I'm asking for other people's opinions based on their experience, rather than just relying on Lucy. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its all luck of the draw , some people thing beastlords land better, some enchanters, some shaman. Alot of it has to do with persception. Like you get your slowed bounced 3 times but the beast gets lucky and lands it, suddenly the beastlord has a lower resist cause his landed sooner , then word spreads and it becomes a self re-enfoorcing delusion.<br />
<br />
They are all the same. Now levels can and will make a difference , generaly the higher the level the easier it will be to land , but again , this isnt a exact science. I remember in HoT i used to get resisted while people 2 levels lower then me would seemlingly land. But generaly speaking , higher level = less resists</div></div><hr />

There's no difference in resistability between shaman and enchanter slows.  In fact, back when doing ToV was all the rage, there were shamans speculating that enchanters' slow was LESS resistable than shamans' slow!  It's all a matter of perception.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Having played both a shaman and an enchanter to high lvls I found absolutely no difference between thier ability to land slows. Both where annoyingly streaky and would get the one freakishly resistant mob that would seem to resist every spell cast.<br />
<br />
My shaman is now lvl 65 and my enchanter is still 59 but my enchanter got to 59 back a while back when 60 was still the level cap and I hunted with both in the same places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I play both an enchanter (64) and shaman (65).  Since both of my characters are BoT flagged, and I spend more or less all of my time there, I have had some opportunity to consider this exact issue over the course of the last few days. <br />
<br />
My feeling, which I will of course point out is not based on anything but my subjective experience, is that there is approximately no difference in terms of straight-up resists.  <br />
<br />
There most certainly IS a difference in WHEN slow, lands, though, and that difference is very likely the source of the misperceptions.  As an enchanter, it takes approximately twice as long to cast the spell, and there is also the delay that has to be worked in prior to casting Howl Of Tashan (and then Boggle, Boggle, Boggle if the delay was not long enough).  When you are slowing as an enchanter, you are taking your life into your hands, so you are obviously very careful in how you go about it.  Since this is the case, enchanters tend to be much slower at landing slows.  Why is that significant?  Probably because during that time the shaman or magician in your group is also casting malo/mala or even malosini/malosinia.  These extra debuffs stack, so with both on the enchanter (who is probably by that point getting around to casting slow) has a much better chance to land the slow than the shaman who is most likely either casting cold (with no debuffs) or casting malo/slow one right after the other.  (If you find an enchanter that tashes at the same time you malo, then you have either found the uberest enchanter ever or someone with a deathwish.)</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I might know the wrong enchanter, but those I typically run into have 6k HPs (including runes of course) and got their aggro reduction AA skill (not sure about the name) maxed. They catch less aggro than me and can take nearly as many hits as me. Of course their AC sucks, but with runes I never got the feeling they had big problems slowing.<br />
<br />
The fun part is that all enchanter I met in the last months didn't want to slow. It's not the &quot;fun&quot; they want to have anyway (aka charming giants in BoT who can fight for themselves, where the group is just near for when charm breaks).<br />

LMAO yeah at 51 I duoed with a 65 bard there by /begging my way in and telling him I'll heal. XP was super and every 10 min or so I would drop a heal on the fooker. If you can be main healer and slower and you're dropping stoic on your tanks then it sounds like you just have great tanks and you might as well be a 48 druid for all they care. <br />
<br />
It seems retarded to me if you can land your slows the way you are saying 1st time w/o debuff most of the time. You're on par with me at 63 in poi. Something doesn't sound right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Chanters have a 3000hps rune that makes them unstunnable and costs 10pp and lasts until they have taken 3000 damage (or zone?).. umm poor enchanters.. if an enchanter dies just means poor enchanter in the literal sense drop 10 dots on him and tell him to keep up an inventory cheapass. - 2nd hand info since all I know are shamans but I don't think I'm wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can have:<br />
<br />
Eldritch Rune 1:  500<br />
OR<br />
Eldritch Rune 2:  1000<br />
OR<br />
Eldritch Rune 3:  1500<br />
AND<br />
Rune Of Zebuxeruk:  850<br />
<br />
You could also (for some reason) have:<br />
<br />
Arcane Rune:  1500<br />
Rune Of Zebuxoruk:  850 (costs ~11p)<br />
<br />
That works out to 2350hp.  You are not unstunnable, btw.  The rune absorbs damage, and that is all.  You can be knocked back, stunned, and interupted as normal.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  It should also be noted that the Elritch Rune series is an AA ability, and a costly one at that.  It is not something every enchanter will have (though it is obviously something every enchanter will want).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">AS to the point about spell levels. Yes it does make a difference. You gain a bonus for casting spells that are lower level..aka trivial to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I've often thought Enchanter slows seem to land more often then Shaman slows.<br />
But yes there is no &quot;apparent&quot; resist modifier that we can see.<br />
<br />
Shaman tend to try to land slow sooner owing to the fact that Malo(s) has extremely low aggro compared to Tash.<br />
We're also more likely to throw a Slow at a mob without it being fully debuffed as we normally have the HP's to survive a reslow attempt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Notice i included a little disclaimer &quot;and isn't uber&quot; in my statement.  Perhaps you need classes in reading comprehension.  Or perhaps you simply didn't know what I refer to as &quot;uber&quot; which is a fair thing.  I HATE having to explain picky things to picky people tho, so you're going to get it anyway.<br />
&quot;Uber&quot; chanter is someone with gear that is all or mostly all obtainable thru raids only, NO DROP stuff you know, and has their Eldritch rune (AA ability) and other helpful spells/aids.  That is an &quot;Uber&quot; enchanter.  Consider such a chanter vs. the average one fresh out of the grind, with 1400 unbuffed hitpoints, hardly any AAs, and not all of their spells.  That enchanter has about 3900 hps fully fully buffed with top of the line shiznit.  Add a 600 point rune (has to pay for this mind you, one dot per rune), and he's got a bit of a margin.  He's comparable to my own hps, with only focus on.  <br />
<br />
Course if you're comparing an enchanter in a large raiding guild, with numerous pieces from VT and/or the elementals, he'll have unbuffed hps around 3500-4000hps.  Add buffs and you got upwards of 6k hps as you noted.  Add Eldritch Rune and that bad boy is better at taking hits and slowing than I am by quite a large margin.  With the one concession that I can generally slow them faster. <br />
<br />
I have a haste item 18% haste right, so Malo in 3.4 sec, 2.5 sec recast, and then Turgurs in 2.5.  That's about 9 seconds total from inc to slow.  And at 65 it's a rare thing that I get a resist.  If the mob isn't horribly resistant, or the situation demands urgency, I'll forego the Malo and have it slow in 2.5 seconds with some margin of error due to occasional resists.  Add my goodly amount of hps/AC and my ability to keep a 300/tic heal on myself INDEFINITELY, I have a better shot at surviving a bad pull than your average enchanter.  By a lot.  <br />
<br />
Now add Virulent Paralysis (My favorite CC(crowd control) tool, and I'm root mezzing mobs out of the way in less time than it takes the cleric to yell &quot;ADD!&quot;  People that work with me in places where adds are common (tactics pit for example) just note the adds and don't panic after the first 10-15 minutes go by and we're never in danger of wiping.  I love that zone.  I can use my crowd control techniques to their ultimate, controlling up to 5 adds at a time.  3 I can do with no effort, but 5 is about my limit.  Your average enchanter can only control 2 mobs TOPS at a time in PoP.  Your &quot;good&quot; chanter can do 3 or maaaaaaaybe 4.  Your uber one can do more than I can.  <br />
<br />
But I've rambled on long enough.  Hopefully EVERYONE can see what I'm getting at now.  The top-drawer shaman can really be a huge benefit to his/her group.  Over and above your average KEI dealer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">yah what he said ?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Another thing that would affect how much before-slow damage a group would take is the cast/recast time on those spells. Basically, Turgur is 3sec cast and 6sec recast. Forlorn is 6 seconds cast, 2.25 seconds recast. <br />
<br />
So, even if the slow gets resisted just as many time for both, the shaman's will still land ~3sec before the enchanter's, which can translate into a couple round from a 500+ hitting PoP MOB, i.e. noticeable. Also, assuming that the shaman leaded with a malo (low agro) and the 'chanter with a tash (oh my... so much agro for such a tiny spell), after the first resist, the shaman can take advantage of the longer refresh on turgur to sneak in a malosini/a (again, low agro), pretty much insuring that slow will land on round 2, while the 'chanter is still playing the RNG roulette with the same chances as for round 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
       Chanter ,grats for them ,have a aa ,spell and focus reduction aggro. They aggro far less than us. And on big named ,i prefer a run over a 300hp heal each 6 secondes ,if i can etheir channel it.<br />
On exp mob ,it's different ,but well they don't aggro that much with slow ,more with mez.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, in the group I mentioned above, the enchanter had been main slower until I joined the group. She was 60 at first (dinged 61 in the group), and said she'd been leading with tash just to slow at all.<br />
<br />
I was 59, and slowed straight off the bat. I got a few resists, but nowhere like what she'd described.<br />
<br />
She was 1/2 levels higher, so should have been slowing more consistantly, not noticeably less over a period of time.<br />
<br />
But again, it's all in perception, and without playing both yourself, one after the other, it's hard to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Tash - 1sec VS Malo 5sec<br />
Forlorn Deeds -6secs VS Turgurs 3secs<br />
7secs &gt; 8secs<br />
Chanters can do it faster and for less mana.<br />
<br />
Plus if you want to talk uber, chanters can cast their slow for free and in 3secs off elemental armor.<br />
<br />
HP wise, last time I checked 100hps = 100hps no matter what the class.<br />
The only thing shaman have as an advantage is the Stamina modifier and AC. Compare apples to apples.<br />
<br />
Overall your assumptions about slowing faster/better is flawed.<br />
5% better slow is not percievable difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Uh, Viscerator...<br />
<br />
The actual cast time of Tash is insignificant, because if you cast it ANY time during the first 15 seconds of a fight you *will* have agro-problems.  It isn't a possability, its a certainty.  While you can shorten that &quot;delay time&quot; using the glamourous visage spell (or beguiling visage, once every 7 minutes) you are still faced with a very long delay before you can safely Tash.  Your time listings also make the assumption that every shaman casts malo, then slow.  I usually do that, but when I get an add I usually skip malo and just cast slow.  I also sometimes play the odds and skip malo knowing that if I get resisted, I can cast malo/slow anyway.  Very few enchanters will skip tash (since the last thing you want to cast after bouncing a slow on a mob is a spell that is going to make the mob hate you 10 times more).<br />
<br />
Try playing an enchanter.  If you can successfully tash/slow a mob faster than a shaman, then you are uber beyond belief or suicidal beyond belief.<br />
<br />
Regarding Elemental Armor, I believe that the revised armor actually has Turgur's Insects as an effect now... which means nothing to me, since I'm not likely ever going to see it.<br />
<br />
Regarding HP, 100hp does equal 100hp.  You have that right.  As an enchanter, thugh, every hit is seemingly a max-hit with a quad built in.  :)  Seriously, my enchanter has lost almost half her health in 3 seconds (with a 1500hp rune, mind you) quite often.  Enchanters are just not very durable people (which makes sense, mind you -- they bring alot to the table).  As Landragoran said, there are some rather uber exceptions, but focusing a discussion on extremes is meaningless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">My focus was not on extremes, it was on facts, and in direct response to what Landragoran posted. My numbers are correct. Just because something FEELS RIGHT does not mean it is true. <br />
Tash-forlorn deeds is faster then malo-turgurs. HP's are HP's no matter who is wearing them.<br />
<br />
Slow is aggro no matter who is casting it. Risking a slow without debuffs is up to the individuals discretion. There are many ways to avoid it.<br />
<br />
I have played 2 enchanters in the last 4 years thanks, I know what they can do.<br />
<br />
And yes, shaman armor has turgurs on it, BUT it is the same 3secs cast time as the spell....see the discrepency there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Disclaimer: this is from the perspective of the 65, droppable/non-raid geared playerbase.<br />
<br />
Here is why enchanter aggro is not an issue:<br />
<br />
Boggle:  http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3229&amp;source=Live  trumps tash aggro nicely as I understand it - also near instacast.<br />
<br />
+ <br />
<br />
Arcane Rune:  http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3199&amp;source=Live <br />
<br />
<br />
That rune is free and it stacks with all other hp buffs, so the enchanter I fight with effectively has more hps than me.  I have never seen him die from slow aggro, but have bought it a few times from it myself.  We are far from uber, just typical level 65 folks in non raid guilds.  Maybe slightly above avg AA points.<br />
<br />
The shaman method of aggro reduction?  Stand there and try not to die.  Or root, etc ....<br />
<br />
On slow mitigated mobs they slow the same as us, so draw your own conclusions about who is better at it.  Even if we are 1 % better at it, Enchanters bring so much more to the table than we do its silly.  Now I have not a clue about beastlords, don't know any.  And rangers at high levels are better used away from the mob with a bow rather than waiting for earthcaller to proc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Regarding Boggle:<br />
<br />
The boggle spell is resistable.  Easily, resistable, in fact.  It also often requries three or four casts (at a relatively high mana cost) to lose the agro from one Tash.  It is also, unfortunately, very subject to the &quot;spell time recovery not yet met&quot; bug (which is a bug, I agree, but still a fact of life that must be dealt with).  It would be a mistake to assume that Boggle is the solution to all problems.  The combination of beguiling visage, glamourous visage, and boggle *can* make a big difference, but these solutions cost mana and are by no means surefire get-out-of-death-free cards.<br />

Regarding Rune:<br />
<br />
You are correct that the spell is free (from a pp point of view).  A very useful spell that has saved many an enchanter.  On your typical enchanter, that 1500hp is eaten up in only a few seconds, but those are a few seconds you wouldn't otherwise have.  <br />
<br />
Regarding Cast Times:<br />
<br />
Viscerator, I just don't see the point of what your saying.  Perhaps I'm just not thinking clearly.  What does the fact that an enchanter *can* cast his spells faster have to do with anything?  That hypothetical enchanter would die, every single fight, for as long as he did that.  Your numbers are correct, but meaningless.  If isn't important how fast you CAN slow, its important how fast you DO slow (and not just once, but over time).  As an enchanter, I would never cast tash on incoming and then follow immediately with a slow.  No enchanter I have ever met would do that.  Do YOU know an enchanter who would?  I would like to meet that enchanter and hear his comments -- they would be very interesting and relevant to this discussion.  You've mentioned that you have played an enchanter, though, so perhaps you are referring to your own experiences.  To what level?  In what Tier?  I'm not trying to be offensive, but to compare apples to apples you need to know what an apple is and what an orange is.  Ok, that made no sense.  The point is, unless your experience playing an enchanter is in the post-PoP environment, in Tier 2+, it does not really relate to the discussion we're having very well.  If that IS your experience, by all means please tell me how you are able to tash/slow faster than a shaman and still stay alive without forcing the cleric OOM.  I would really like to know.  If would make me a better enchanter.<br />

EDIT:  Spelling.  Grammar.  Complete sentences.  All that fun stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>gnarishal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">We have been running a test on slows for some time, and have results proving that when one of our shaman, an ogre, casts slow he is resisted twice as much as when I cast it, a troll, thereby, the troll is better at casting slow. Long standing study :)<br />
<br />
 My guess is I just get luckier on the RNG alot of times.<br />
<br />
The one thing you all are forgetting to mention is defense skill. Ours caps at 200, theirs at 145, so we stand a better chance of mitigating that damage. toss in some AA's, and we have a better chance of avoiding it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">The good news is that most enchanters hate slowing like we hate doing haste, so even if they are better at it they prefer not to do it.</div></div><hr />
