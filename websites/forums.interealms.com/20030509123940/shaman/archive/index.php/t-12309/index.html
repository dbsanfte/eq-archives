<br />
<br />
am i evil or just playing fair ?     :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A good chanter could have killed you easy (or at theleast kept you from killing them).   Did they have rapture?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was under the impression that rapture caps at level 61.  Is it different for PvP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you need BAT****INSANE MR to resist chanter mez lately.  I had 215 and still got mezzed in the arena a couple times by a 65 one.  Then again he tashed me . . so it was lower i guess.  He did complain about resists on me tho.  Btw, I think the DoT needs to hurt you to keep you from being mezzed.  If innate regen is &gt; DoT, it won't break mez on yourself.  Vs. a chanter, plague yourself to make sure you do yourself damage.  Mez is the worst.  <br />
<br />
On that note, I dueled a fellow shaman on my server recently . . . it went on and on and on cuz both of us were rather good.  In the end, the reason anyone won was because of my mace sucking his mana faster than he could make it, and me figuring out how to get enuf DoTs on him at once to negate Torpor.  He had a good trick with instaclicks . . . anyway.  <br />
<br />
Btw, the pet poof **** during a duel when u annul your opponent while pet is attacking him is BOGUS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">/nod.  Pet poofing has caused me to zone more than a few times.   Against a melee with nice haste and great mr ya really need your pet to give ya time to cast our long casting spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The really really annoying thing about enchanters is the fact that their pets seem completely immune to MR. So you can't root, slow with turgurs or blind them. Not a major problem, but it gets annoying real quickly (especially if you waste mana trying to root/slow not knowing that it's iimmune)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">they used apathy on me actually  and torment of agril (sp)   well anywas it was funny seeing thier hp's drop i thiink its near a 3k dot ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cast a low lv disease dot on yourself befor fighting a chanter. If he mezes you it will break each tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never had a problem with chanter pets...  cleric pets are immune.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">pets use their owners resists, unless the pet naturally has better.  most chanters I know have quite good MR's, that's probably why that's happening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I also never had a problem before with chanter pets. Not sure why it hapoened this time. Anyways he was a 65 chanter and I was surprised so I tested it. He took down his resist gear so he had a MR of 40. I then malosina'd him, then malosinia'd his pet. <br />
<br />
The pet still resisted every root/slow/blind I threw out, so...............<br />
It could be the case that I got so insanely unlucky and the NRG screwed me over 10 times in a row after I debuffed both pet and owner resists by 70.<br />
<br />
It could also have been a bug though so not sure. <br />
<br />
Cleric and wizard pets are immune, but they have so few hitpoints it doesn't matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rapture has no cap in pvp. A good chanter with rapture + ancient rapture can kill three people solo in pvp. A caster should NEVER win against a good chanter in pvp unless the the caster is able to selfdot himself first. People will disagree with me on this (we had this discussion before) but that's my opinion.<br />
<br />
Currently pets are somewhat 'bugged'. They do use their owners resists, but they also show freakish abilities in resisting even lures on a consistant basis. A sowed/speeded chanter pet is very difficult to take out unless you have a good dmg shield or can melee it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know my pets don't use my resists...   with over 200mr my pet is easily rooted by greens.   Could be different on each server though, I doubt SoE went through the trouble of fixing PvP resists on blue servers like that had to on SZ and probably the other zeks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Dot yourself.  a long slow one is best.  Disease cloud is fine when you're a ShadowKinght.  Allfliction should have the same affect for a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Note: you have to actually take damage from the DOT to break the mez.  If your regen exceeds the dot damage then the mez won't break.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Half true Tobasko.<br />
<br />
Your item+spell regen cannot exceed the dot dmg. Your innate regen is not counted toward the total.<br />
<br />
So you usually have to temporarily remove aura of battle items and cancel out ring10/regen spells to break mez if you doted yourself.</div></div><hr />
