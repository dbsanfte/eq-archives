<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all,<br />
<br />
Just got the first rank of the Flurry talent and it seems that it is getting canceled out when Windfury procs.  Am I just imagining this or does this happen to everyone?  It's kind of hard to notice because you crit alot when Windfury goes off and Flurry gets reactivated.<br />
<br />
If this is working as intended, I guess I can see the logic but, it makes Flurry a bit less effective when using Windfury as opposed to running it's full duration with the other weapon augs.  Still not a bad combo though, because the haste will get Windfury to proc more and Windfury will get you more crits for Flurry to activate....<br />
<br />
Really just curious if Windfury is indeed canceling Flurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes.  It cancels Flurry.  I wondered about that at first as well.<br />
What happens is, you crit, and you get flurry icon.<br />
If you then proc windfury, you instantly get 2 additional attacks on top of the one that procced windfury.<br />
Flurry only lasts for X number of seconds, or until you take 2 additional attacks (or is it 3?  can't remember.  I'm tired from being awake 28 hours).<br />
So, every time you windfury you eat up flurry buff.<br />
It kind of sucks, but oh well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Flurry lasts for 3 attacks.  When you proc windfury you get the two extra attacks plus the one that procced it.  So it's not exactly true that windfury cancels flurry, but the impact seems the same.<br />
<br />
If you get a critical strike during windfury, it resets the flurry counter back to 3 (and 15 seconds).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Skarzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the info, that clears it right up.  I didn't even think about the 3 extra attack limit on Flurry, was stuck on the different hastes canceling each other...</div></div><hr />
