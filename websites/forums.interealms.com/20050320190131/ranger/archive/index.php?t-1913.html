Comedian Tom Mabe (hadn't heard of the guy til I read this article yesterday) &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31176-2002Apr22.html&quot;&gt;went undercover to a telemarketing conference.&lt;/a&gt; Apparently, after the conference, he called the telemarketers in the wee hours of the morning in their hotel rooms trying to sell them sleep aids. <br />
<br />
Granted, I've thought of alot worse things to do to these people, this one is pretty creative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excuse, me, what company do you represent?  <br />
What is your name?<br />
Please put me on your DO NOT CALL list, thank you.<br />
<br />
I occasionally get a small print type spiel about it taking 6 to 8 weeks, but I rarely hear back, and when I do, I ask for a supervisor, and give date and time I asked to be placed on the DO NOT CALL list, and ask for the corporate address.<br />
<br />
Phones been a lot quieter since I started doing that.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Ok, and your company name?&quot;<br />
&quot;Today is date and the time here is time. I am recording that information as the date and time that I have told you to put this number on your 'do not call list.' If I recveive another call from your company, you are subject to a $500 fine plus legal costs. Do you understand?&quot;<br />
<br />
I have gotten to where I actually kind of enjoy this.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Devil speaking, Who in hell you want?&quot;<br />
<br />
IF they don't hang up then and ask for someone by name the reply is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Lemme think a second. Ummmmm, yeah   we have so-and-so in pit number 3    YO!  Beezlebub   go get  so-and-so from pit 3&quot;<br />
at which point I set the phone down<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
One other thing is to say &quot;sure    lemme go gett them and lay the phone down then after a couple mintes  tell them that its gonna be a few more minutes   they are on their way doing that several times til they hang up in frustration</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sunmoon</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 06:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually, a VERY easy and smart thing to do nowadays is totally drop your land line and go pure cellular. I have a plan now for 60 bucks a month that gives me unlimited nationwide calling at all hours of the day. For that price, I get the convenience of cellular, plus the benefit of price.<br />
<br />
The best part is, telemarketers of any kind are not even allowed to dial numbers in the range of cell phones. The reason is, you have to pay for each minute of airtime and that is illegal right off the bat for people to make you pay to receive a call. I've had only a cell phone for over two years and I have never, ever received a telemarketing call.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kullaas</div><div class="date">04-29-2002, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sunmoon sounds like a cellular add.<br />

&quot;The convenience of Cellular!&quot;<br />

We've gotten roped into those demonstrations so many times. We would fill out the &quot;Win this car&quot; cards at the mall, and then they call and offer a free meal, free night in a hotel, etc. to get us to go look at their timeshare. Then they WON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER.<br />
<br />
I want to send them all to a date-rape class NO MEANS NO!</div></div><hr />
