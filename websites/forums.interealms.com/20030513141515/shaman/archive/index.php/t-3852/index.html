<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Here's a mod that was posted earlier. Since the website was taken down, and at the request of many people, I'm posting it again to a link that I'm hosting.<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/screenshot.jpg<br />
<br />
The main thing to note is the target bar:<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/target.jpg<br />
<br />
Which has the mob number after it. I absolutely love this, because when slowing sometimes it's hard to figure out if I slowed a mob already when there's multiple of the same or very similar names. With this, I just remember the last two digits of the number if it's the same kind of mob. It's also a lot easier to be sure you have target on the correct mob when two are very close together.<br />
<br />
The buff window on this mod is my favorite too, lists positive icons in blue and negative ones in red (although group necro/sk buffs are red too and when any spell fades, it says &quot;unknown spell&quot; in it's place). I also like the modified pet window to show your player stats on the main screen instead. I already have hotkeys for pet commands, and don't use them too much anyway. Plus, the pet hp bar is right below my hp and a small bar already. The group window is missing the invite/disband buttons but you can use CTRL+I to invite and CTRL+D to disband easily enough.<br />
<br />
Here's the link to download it:<br />
<br />
http://homepages.wmich.edu/~p9boersm/eq/target.zip<br />
<br />
If you look in my spell book, I made new icons for a few spells. You can download these too, I have them posted in this thread:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Patito</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Oh, I forgot to tell you guys how to install it. Sorry. What you do is go into your EverQuest directory, then open the uifiles folder. Create a new directory and call it whatever you want, I called mine buffmod. Then open up the default directory and copy all the files in the default directory into the folder you created (buffmod). Then unzip the files for the new mod into the new (buffmod) folder and overwrite any files that it asks you about. Then load up everquest, and type into the chat window &quot;/loadskin buffmod&quot; or whatever you called the directory.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I tried to use the Target window as well (none of the other ones) and it didn't work. There appears to be an error in part of the code. I'm no XML expert or anything, but this part is the part that causes errors on mine, and prevents the skin from loading:<br />
<br />
&lt;b&gt;<br />
&amp;lt;GaugeDrawTemplate&amp;gt;<br />
  &amp;lt;Background&amp;gt;A_TargetGaugeBackground&amp;lt;/Background&amp;gt;<br />
  &amp;lt;Fill&amp;gt;A_TargetGaugeFill&amp;lt;/Fill&amp;gt; <br />

  &amp;lt;/GaugeDrawTemplate&amp;gt;<br />
&lt;/b&gt;<br />
<br />
The rest of it can be loaded with no error messages, however it just results in a really wide target window, but a normal sized target health bar. The target name part does work (where it gives you the games name, like an_orc_pawn_01), I just can't get the health bar to expand.</div></div><hr />

You need to use the TGA file included too. It's the background graphics for the extra large bar referenced in the first line you quoted.<br />
<br />
As for the this mod I didn't care the looks of it and i find the huge targeting bar annoying but I did figure out how to integrate his naming trick into my skin so i'm happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks Taraddar, I'll try that when I get home. The large size is actually good for me, because I run at 1600 x 1200 with a viewport command shrinking my viewing to about 2/3 of the screen. This way I have all of my windows outside in the black space so my viewing window is not blocked by anything. There's plenty of room for an extra wide target window on my screen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Taraddar, how?  Please help! The advantages of the mob number in the target window are enormous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Taraddar,<br />
<br />
So what's the trick? I'd like to incorporate the name &quot;trick&quot; into my targetting window too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>barmanham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">anyone know how i can get the second chat window up everything else is workin wit it expect chat2 window didnt come up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">OK I'll try to explain this as best I can.<br />
<br />
When you do the gage for hps it automatically adds the name as part of the gauge but there is also a Label tag for {EQType}28{/EQType} that gives the target name. That label is what he uses and what gives mob_01.<br />
<br />
The trick comes in at getting the name that shows up by default not to show. To do that you have to monkey with the guage properties.<br />
<br />
What I did was set {font}0{/font} to set the font size to as small as possible. You then need to set the location to something like {x}3{/x} {y}-20{/y}. This puts the gauge starting to display outside of the bounds of the window. Then use{GaugeOffsetY}36{/GaugeOffsetY} to slide the gauge down back into the same spot. Don't forget to change the {size}{{Size}CX}408{/CX}{CY}44{/CY}{/Size}<br />
y value to account for the fact that the gauge now starts 20 pixels off screen.<br />
<br />
In short change the loc line so that it's -20 of it's current value, change the gauge ofset so it pushes it back down 20 and change the size so the guage is 20 bigger. You now have you target gauge with the name of the mob being displayed off window so just use a standard label with the eqtype 28 and boom you've got your numbers.<br />
<br />
Obviously all the {} should be replaced with greater than and less thans int he xml file just didn't feel like taking the time to code it so it showed properly in the post =)</div></div><hr />

I already modified his targeting window so it should do it. As I said tho i'm at work right now with no access to an eqable machine so I might have screwed something up too.<br />
<br />
I can't post mine till i get him tonight since I did the targeting mod to my ui at about 12:30 last night and didn't get around to posting it anywhere before i went to bed. I need to get a pic of mine and the zip file host some where at some point tho =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Slimmed alot of things down. In the inventory the autoequipe box is the same as the class animation. Works out pretty cool. move your cursor over it and the class animation fades away.<br />
<br />
On the actions box i've added 2 inventory buttons. The right is my stuff bag and stats the same on all 4 tabs. The left slot switches between boots, primary melee, bp and bracer depending on which tab i'm on for easy hotswitching.<br />
<br />
The targeting window show the percent and names the mob a_mob_00.<br />
<br />
Killed the buttons on the grouping window since i keep the action window up. Also got slimmed down spell book thats not showing.<br />

A simpler way to do this would be to change the {TextOffsetX} value to 150. <br />
<br />
Learning it as i go, I like shifting the vertical better tho since everything starts at the upper left corner for co-ordinates no matter how long the name is or how big someone makes the window modifying it the name from the guage wouldn't end up on screen unless they move the gauge down and then they should hopefully notice it's loc starts it out of the window and catch whats going on quickly.<br />
<br />
I guess {TextOffsetY} would work too if thats a tag, Like i said i was doing this at 12:30 last night and just wanted to figure out how they did it not the best way to do it =)</div></div><hr />
