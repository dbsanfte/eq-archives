<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It is possible to aggro the reavers through the door to pull them.  When we were doing my epic, we had killed all the reavers but Rak's when our rogue had to go to bed (it was very late).  A guild mage suicide pulled Rak's reaver out of the temple for us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It is rather easy for a mage or wizard to agro the first reaver. He/she stands right against the door, summon an Eye of Zomm. Eye pops up inside the room. Mage/Wizard can then target the reaver and cast a spell through the eye to agro it. He/She then prays the tanks pull it off fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, I got my books last night. I took 3 attempts. The first one was stopped because 3 other guilds converged on CoM just before ours was to start. The second one failed because the rogue ended up working late. The funny thing is, is last night we ended up with 2 rogues. Go figure. Oh btw, you can agro most of the room behind the locked door. All you have to do is, walk up to the door and cast poison storm on yourself. Hehe, got a little angry after rogue didn't show up.</div></div><hr />
