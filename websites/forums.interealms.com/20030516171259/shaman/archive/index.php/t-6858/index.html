<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay here is the situation: I am a 60th shaman - no torpor - but I have most other spells, only 5 AApts - natural regen and run2 so far. I have my epic and decent gear (mostly Wolfcallers + JBB) but only FT is from the PoTC earring. <br />
<br />
I'm looking for a place to solo when I have the time/interest to play and make some decent AA exp. <br />
<br />
<br />
Primary requirements:<br />
1) Has to be fairly easy to get to - I generally don't play for more than 2-3 hours at a session and can't spend forever getting there/clearing a way in or whatever.  It also needs to be someplace I leave fairly quickly if the guild needs me for a dragon/lodi/VS run or other quick kill. <br />
<br />
2) Loot is entirely optional - don't really care if I don't see a copper drop. <br />
<br />
3) Safe - I'll be blunt, I'm not afraid to take risks and get a laugh - but not when I am trying to grind for exp. One death and the recovery time wipes out way too much of my available exp time. <br />
(not to mention I play at off hours and way too many of my 96% rezz capable friends have stopped playing)<br />
<br />
4) I don't camp guards - personal peeve otherwise I'd live in Katta <br />
<br />
5) Soloing in Maidens Eye is right out - every time I try some idiot drops a train on me<br />
<br />
6) Jaggedpine would be okay - but my FPS there are too bad to be playable<br />
<br />
I have a pet druid to port me around as well as a faithstone-everfrost so I can be pretty mobile. I tend to stay bound in the nexus. <br />
<br />
Places I have been doing okay in - <br />
Chardok zone in/out, Hole bridge/ledge, Skyfire(kind of slow), Dawnshroud (when the sambata are up), Wakening lands - Sentients</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Personally I'd probably try FG. Shroom patches are pretty much everything you described.<br />
<br />
Not far from nexus/bazaar. Invis works great in the zone. There's no wanderers to worry about. Setup, buff, med what ever with out much worry. Can't get much safer. At 60 you can solo pull easily. So easily that I've never pulled multiples when trying to pull. I have had a couple times when fido charged in after a spell or i ran in too close but pulling at range i've never gotten more than one. Loot isn't non exsistant but it isn't anything special either.<br />
<br />
At this point your probably fine with one of the smaller patches but with the right gear and aa you can keep even the largest patches clear solo.<br />
<br />
Maidens is a pretty good solo spot and i like it but i did get turn off camping my bloody shard there. If you wanted to try it again the chief camp works well and at least when i've camped it up on the hill past him by the big stone wall no one has ever managed to train me up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Added - I forgot to mention Fungus grove, I hunt there when I can (read when there isn't an AoE group going). For various reasons Fungus Grove seems like the permanent home of the revolving AoE group - after the 2nd time the AoE groups pulling methods (lack thereof) made me gate, I gave up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tried the shroomnest under the bridge? Almost no AE groups go there..<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice spot - its working out well, main drawback seems to be that it is too well known. I've ended up having to kill Chakta Fungusbeasts not shrooms both times I've tried it so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay - I'm now looking for some new options - they apparently changed the co-aggro radius in Fungus Grove pretty badly. I don't seem to be able to solo pull shrooms or fungus beasts anymore - getting anywhere from 2-4 per pull which shoots soloing there down pretty effectively. <br />
<br />
I'm sick of doing places like skyfire, chardok, hole etc where I end up killing as many lt blues as blues..<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
(thanks - but you missed that No guards part)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can root/rot in Umbral plains -- shak dathors are your best bet.  When root breaks, you get summoned.  The gantru are slow kills, so they're not as good, and the elysians don't give good experience.<br />
<br />
You can also do trees and such in Plane of Nightmare.  Skeeters in Plane of Disease, close to the zone(the closest ones, not the others like malarians, cuz they're much harder).  Rats there are considerably tougher, so try to avoid them.  You can also do the larvae.<br />
<br />
If possible, I'd really try to get a duo going, though.  Even splitting the experience two ways, you'll still have an excellent chance to get more experience, because shamans kill so slow.  A druid who can charm rats in POD or bats in PON is a great partner, as is a melee.  <br />
<br />
And I'd think about doing some hard-core money camping.  Torpor will really help your experience gain out a lot.  Not to mention save you from a fair amount of deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Even if you hate ME, I loved to solo the Cheif tree. Easy to single pull, and can mostly tank/JBB/epic/dogdog mobs. Watch out for Spiritseers (can be nasty when they cast a lot, get your MR gear out). Tribesman aren't too much to worry about, and of course, if you get the Chief, root/rot. You'll start to see some lightblue though, and spiritseers can give you 3% AA's per kill along with the Chief, everything else will be about 1-2%. And if someone trains you, then they are complete idiots since that isn't anywhere close to zone. I loved to set up on top of the wall, just down from the wall of the ruins. Nice thing about it, when they run, you just sit then and let your pet eat them as they run off, and you continue to JBB them. Very few (if you get the way they run off) will actually keep going, at which point you'll need to root them. Otherwise they'll stop about half way down the hill and try to decide if they are gonna run, or attack you.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Thanks folks - I do try to get a duo going whenever I can, but I play at odd hours so its iffy...<br />
<br />
I've had a fair chunk of change set aside for Torpor for months now - just haven't been able to see one for sale, nor has the guild I'm in seen one drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Try Plane of Disease. There is a spot between the riverhead and the bonewall which you will not get trains or roamers. You can kill the slimes (easy), rats (tougher) or spiders (be carefull they are tough solo's). They are pretty easy to single and the exp is awsome compared to your current exp spots and torpor isnt required. I get a blue of AA every 2 or 3 kills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you play at quiet times then it might be worth trying the Plane of Innovation too. <br />
<br />
Positives:<br />
Left side is single-pullable for miles<br />
Right side is single/double pullable and one can be rooted<br />
No roamers = no adds at zonein (if you keep back)<br />
Mobs are rootable and tankable, your choice<br />
No casters<br />
They don't run off so you don't need snare (good for us barbarians)<br />
Easy to get to and no break-in time<br />
<br />
Negatives:<br />
Useless if its busy, too many trains<br />
Root sometimes breaks quick (use malo/malosini, holds better then)<br />
Archaics are not slowable, if you get one on the left and one on the right you are stuck.<br />
<br />
I normally pull with malosini, run back to camp, slow as they get back in range, stick pet on it, cripple, pox, bane, jbb, renew bane. Don't have epic, it'd help a lot though and maybe save the second bane. Stacking an Ebolt might be another option but that's another spell gem :( Sometimes need to heal, in which case (without torpor) I either chloroblast if I just need a little bit to see it off or go for Kragg's Mending - but channeling KM sucks so sometimes root and back off for that. Pet can take it anyway. One day I'll parse with/without cripple, not sure how much it really helps.<br />
<br />
Buffs: <br />
Alpha pet with focus and haste<br />
Focus/Stamina/Agi clicky/regrowth/kei/sow/ac etc. Aego or PotG if I see a friend passing by who can cast one.<br />
<br />
Spells memmed: root, malosini, slow, cripple, pox, bane, kragg's, chloro. Wish I could mem canni IV and EBolt or a nuke too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jakyll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You could also try the Grey. Few people I know prefer soloing the lvl 55 skeles over by the lake that can be singled pull at 60 and easy to dot and root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vhalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Groups are easy to pick up in PoP; even if its only for 2 hour sessions; <br />
<br />
I soloed 51-60 with jbb and I must say that PoP in groups by far is 10 times better than any soloing i've done before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm on the ayonnae ro server and in the bazaar there are at least 6 ppl selling topor constantly so check there. They go for 225k! so I'm not sure if that's a rip off or what..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">prepop i soloed alot in chardok. either the entrance or exit, all single pulls. exp bonus, occasional loot aswell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
<br />
I agree with Goldark.  Just be sure to leave PoI when it gets crowded.<br />
<br />
If you can get flagged for the factory, the 7 Tin Soldier spawns are very doable.  One or two loot drops per night and these can be very profitable as well.  (Boiled Leather Cuirass sell well to PC's.  Picked up Polished Tin Mail Boots for a younger shaman in my family today as well.  Leave the golems alone if you are solo.<br />
<br />
The respawn time on the Tins will keep you plenty busy.  You may take to ignoring the door spawns and just handling the 5 inside.  You are completely safe from the common idiot trains once you are inside the factory.<br />
<br />
Out of the way, but Western Wastes can be okay too.  Use sense animal to track your targets.  Nested dragons if faction isn't a concern. :D  If you have a spiritstone, bind outside ToV, and you can still have access to PoK stones in very little time.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Shadeweavers Thicket - In the dead-end cave (locked zone to Umbral Plains) is a group of red aliens and a fire elemental fella. I think all of them are blue at 60, and single-pullable.<br />
<br />
Umbral Plains - Shak Dathor, as suggested. Hit fairly hard, die fairly easy.<br />
<br />
Sanctus Seru - I know you said &quot;no guards&quot;, but really, SS is the Grobb of Luclin - who cares about it? Guards die easy and drop good loot. Not sure about how blue they are at 60.<br />
<br />
Fungus Grove - For pure AA grinding, this is the place. On Saryrn, the place has been deserted since PoP came out. Shrooms are pullable single at 60 from what I hear... Practice by casting cancel magic from max distance.<br />
<br />
PoP - Anywhere. No, seriously, the expansion is your oyster.<br />
<br />
Jaggedpine... Do you have models on? If so, turn them off. Turn off 3d sky when you're in the zone, as well. Massive improvement, for a little hassle.<br />
<br />
Dragon Necropolis - Spiders still blue at 60? I can take them with minimal problems at 54, dunno if they'll be junk at 60...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mikshal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Im a bit under knowledge about velious high lev zone and i dont have a greate equip<br />
I passed by WW but i was wondering what is good to solo there<br />
...<br />
please dont say me dragons, i see chart and im not so uber to do it (even the warrior one)<br />
thx<br />
<br />
oh another stupid question, what i mean &quot; root/rot &quot; ?<br />
keep it rooted or some more?<br />
thx for patience, english is not my language</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Niall Graycloak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just changed to a new video card - so I may give Jaggedpine another shot.<br />
<br />
I've done Seru guards before - but they seemed to mostly psuedo-paladins and a massive pain to kill without stuns/mana-sieve.<br />
<br />
I've been having better luck getting pick up groups in PoP than I expected - so maybe I won't worry as much about soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">PoD is my favorite spot for laundry/yardwork/BBQing exp.  It used to be PoV, but I managed to get trains running me over in really bizzare spots while afk.</div></div><hr />
