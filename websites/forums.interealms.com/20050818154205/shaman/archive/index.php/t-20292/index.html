<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I like to remind many of you what the MO of SoE does and many of you have played this game since Kunark, some since Beta.<br />
<br />
At every expansion, they put something in the game that makes it look very attractive that they want to buy it.<br />
<br />
Once the sales percentage goal has been reached, the nerf bat is pulled out from under the desk and the nerfing commence. This is their way of say, &quot;Thanks for buying the expansion.....suckers!&quot;<br />
<br />
Take the recent nerfs as of 4 weeks now....<br />
<br />
1) *Fishing* - They could have nerfed this at the exact same day as they had nerfed the quest key that you can turn in for a Troll Illusion potion that sold to vendors for 56pp each. But they didn't, at least not yet. Not until enough people want to buy the expansion solely for fishing. Then after SoE sees that enough expansions was purchased, they nerfed the Fishing in which in case some of you didn't know, the fish sold to vendor for plat instead of silvers and coppers. This happened before folks, in the expansion before last and the one before last, etc. Nothing new under the sun.<br />
<br />
2) *Tradeskills* - Many tradeskills at the boat city got nerfed 4 weeks after the release of the expansion. Nothing new under the sun, same crap happened before in the 2-3 expansions prior. Bait and switch anyone???<br />
<br />
3) *Animated Bait* - Almost a week later, the animated bait got nerfed because the baits gave a huge amount of points as a turn in with the Tribunal. They know this was a bug, as many bugs are already reported in beta test prior to the release of the game. They released it anyway in hopes that when word spread about the animated bait bug was giving huge amounts of points, peeps will buy the game just to get those points.<br />
<br />
4) *Casino*- after almost a week of playing, they nerfed it. They KNEW this Casino thing would give out nice items, those items was placed in the game on purpose. In fact, SoE said it attracted old and new players into coming back to EQ solely for this. Remember that? They purposely left it as is in the beta test, only to remove it later. Don't tell me the Dev Team was blind to this so called &quot;problems&quot;. I'm not fooled. I doubt it'll come back in game.<br />
<br />
Now I know sometimes some coding can unintentionally break something, that happens not just with EQ, but any kind of software, add a code that conflicts with another existing code and you got a fook up in progress, that's life in the programming world.<br />
<br />
But when I see something that looks attractive in game, I can see why it will attract buyers to get the expansion, but I also know that they will nerf it later.<br />
<br />
Now the Zerker Epic, trust me guys, that'll soon get nerfed, but not right away, not until when many suckers buys the expansion solely for aiming to get that Epic, then when the nerf bat swings, Zerkers will cry &quot;FOUL!&quot;, their response? &quot;Thanks for buying GoD suckers, have a nice day!&quot;<br />
<br />
/em looking at WoW and yells, &quot;Hurry up Blizzard!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Geoid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bah!  Black helicopters and tinfoil hats!<br />
<br />
If only they used their powers for good the game would be so much better hehe.<br />
<br />
You give SOE too much credit, they aren't that smart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heheh, yer right about that part, they're not smart enough to hide the obvious and the SoE gets caught with their hand in the cookie jar.<br />
<br />
All you gotta do is watch their nerfing behavior and you can tell what they are doing, very easy to see if you are a very good observer.<br />
<br />
Of course, Smed was kidding when he said at the last Fan Faire convention that there will be no more nerfs. But many peeps held him to that.<br />
<br />
Same with Absor, who is a joke by the way, said &quot;Classes are not that unbalanced&quot;, uh huh, when pigs fly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think the main reason for the zerker epic being as good as it is, is to get people to play the class.  This means someone will be playing a character from level 1, this means lots of time needed to level and obtain the epic and then by that time they will have another expansion with more AA's, disc's etc.  <br />
<br />
It's one big revolving timesink that is designed to make money!  Don't take any of this stuff personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Itun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When the Beastlord class came out, they were god compare to all other class and their pets can solo the crap out almost any good mob. Now many nerfs later, they aren't as they once was.<br />
<br />
Zerker class comes in, now they will be the god class, at least for a while. SoE will break the class like a horse come maybe 6 months to a year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Compare the zerker epic with weapons that are of similar difficulty to obtain and which imposes similar level restrictions. <br />
<br />
Just taking a wild guess here, but I would expect to find the overall quality of currently available such weapons to be ALOT higher than what was available when XXX epic was introduced.<br />
<br />
As much as I love being the pessimistic cynic hellbent on proving that everything is one giant conspiracy, I have to admit that the 'twink-lure' factor of the zerker epic is more a spin-off effect than an intentional thought from SOE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Huh?  beastlords weren't very good when luclin came out.  Its with pop that they became the killing machines we see today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure the Casino's were used to pull some plat out of the gaming community that was floating around after that last exploit issue.  Gambling is a big enough addition problem in real life...image being addicted to gambling inside an addictive game. :eek:</div></div><hr />
