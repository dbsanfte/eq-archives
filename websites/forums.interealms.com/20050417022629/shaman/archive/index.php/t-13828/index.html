<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm lovin Solasek's Eye at 35, I'm gonna stay til maybe 44. You could probably just do some crap atm, then when u ding 39 you could take the gnome castle. Unless you're ub3r twinked, then u can just skip to the castle. <br />
<br />
And if you choose here, then wait on the mount, b/c you can't cast it in here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eilderts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would upgrade with hp/ac in mind. Those rings could be sold and you could buy 6/65 ac/hp rings, which kick @ss. You could get a black saphire electrum earring or 2. You might wanna switch out your ToV for Crystal Chitin Sheild. 20 extra ac, plus some extra mana. spider hide belt would be a very nice upgrade for pretty cheap. Overall you have very nice equipment. I find that 200+ wis isn't necessary. Just hp/ac/whatever regen you can get + at least 170ish wis or so.</div></div><hr />
