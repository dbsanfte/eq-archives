Also, are we ready yet for CT or UP?<br />

Thanks for any info and tips.</div></div><hr />

CT no idea, haven't been there yet. Supposed to need as many lvl 60 as possible.<br />
PoN and PoD prolly need to stick to the yard trash, not sure really, but  that should still be pretty decent exp.</div></div><hr />

Do you mean for CT?  We DO have a slot open, maybe we could pick up a tank that's LFG or something. Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
will be the best xp for you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Simas</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont have 1st hand experience in CT but from what i understand its usually 58+, for groups that know what they are doing.   <br />
<br />
But yeah id say just fill out the group, a tank would be nice if the mobs are a bit too hard for you to tank (assuming you are the ranger)  if you can tank em then another dmg class would be nice. <br />
<br />
Then just go to zone in and see how you do, if you do well go a bit deeper.  <br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Layous</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 02:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ummm... as far as CT goes I think your problem will be the warrior only being 53 and the chanter only 55. A high level slower make things alot easier in there, and a Def disc on the named mobs is really nice too. If you can get mostly singles then you would probably be ok... but if you get adds or a lot of resists on the slows... yikes! I would suggest trying the maze area, nothing spawns where you port in at... and nothing close sees thru invis. If things go bad, just get a port back to CT, rez, and try again. Also judging from your gear, I think you might be better suited to tank. You might consider getting a kei for the cleric before you start and a BoA/focus for the MT. <br />
<br />
PoP zones? Well that all depends on your cleric... things hit hard and fast. Once they get used to the pace of healing you will be fine... if not, hehe, at least there are graveyards ;)</div></div><hr />

I think level 50-55 players cause more deaths in those zones that the mobs do.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">11-11-2002, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You might wanna try PoP first and see what happens.  The worst you can do is wipe out and your corpses will appear in the graveyard whereas if you wipe out in CT you might be in for a hard corpse recovery.<br />
<br />
And yes just like Maidens Eye the trains can get bad in the PoP zones.  So far I have seen PoN with some of the worst and its usually by high level characters that just don't care... low level characters just don't seem to make it back to the zone out before those hits for 200+ hits add up.   :)</div></div><hr />

If you do try PoP zones, DON'T train the zone....just die</div></div><hr />

PoI was a lot harder, we got attacked by an archaic something that couldnt be slowed or snared, right at the zone. At least our corpses were easy to get to, LOL. <br />
<br />
Thanks much for all the tips.</div></div><hr />
