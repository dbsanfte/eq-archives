<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rikax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello All,<br />
<br />
My guild has been killing minis in PoS and collecting the drops needed for the BoT flag.  I made lvl 61 about the same time as the PoS/PoV restriction was lifted so I never did any trials.  When I get all the items needed for the BoT flag, will I need to get a PoJ trial flag before I can get a true BoT flag, or will I get the BoT flag and need to back flag PoJ trial before I can move past BoT??<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help,<br />

Askr will not talk to you for the access key quest unless you have passed a trial. The flag requirements were removed to allow people of the minimum level they stated to enter the zones and do xp groups, not to skip the progression<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's 62 but the advice still is valid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Actually, Askr WILL talk to you, and even give you the quest without a trial flag.  My friend turned in all the pieces, and got the flag.  She tried zoning into BoT from PoS, but it didn't work.  Luckily, after getting the trial flag, her BoT flag sorted itself out after an &quot;unlock memories&quot; or two.  She got the increased stats on charm, AA point, and was able to zone from PoS to BoT.</div></div><hr />
