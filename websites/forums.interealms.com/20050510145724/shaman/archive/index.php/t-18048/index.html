<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ahhh, another drive and thanks to 173 people, we have completed funding for another 6 months! :)<br />
<br />
Thank you so much to everyone that could contribute this time and any of the past times as well. It took a little longer this time, but we made it happen.<br />
<br />
Any donations I receive now will go to my beer fund! *grins* If you sent in a donation by check and would like it torn up due to us reaching the goal, please let me know, though only a couple of people asked this time.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you all very much... we've got six more months of advertising free entertainment and knowledge resource. Carry on!<br />
<br />
