<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I am a 69 Shami on the TZ (pvp) server with 301 aas. I have read a LOT about how shamis are gimps, useless, etc on these boards.  NOTHING could be further from the truth.  I go the the WoS often where I am the only slower and the Healer for the group.   With the GoD heal spell (1550) with a cast time of 3.8 seconds and all your heal and crit heal aas maxed and with a focus heal item i heal for a minimum of 2k and crit for up to 4400.  I typically crit heal about every third heal and with the new heal and crit heal aas I expect to hit closer to 4800 and crit heal every other cast.  Once I get the level 70 heal (1950) I expect to hit upwards of 7-8k on crit heals.   Use this in conjunction with you HoT spell and you will keep up with any trash mob (with the exception of Vexd/Tipt/KT type mobs).  The mini nameds in WoS are np as well btw...<br />
This healing power combined with the 1.5 second GoD slow makes you VERY valuable!<br />
<br />
My point is... have faith all!  This expansion is great and as a shami I have been the slower/only healer on many hard ldons, sewer trials and xp groups in ferubi and natimbi and WoS to name a few.  <br />
<br />
In addition, Shamis are FIERCE in pvp.  My dots, with the ldon critical affliction aas, do 1k-1500 hps of damage per tic for up to 7 tics.  Sprinkle in some poison and cold DDs with your second level multi dog attack and you win much more then you lose!  And with my healing ability and gate (if I have to hehe) makes us VERY hard to kill...<br />
<br />
So revel in the power of being a shaman.  Don't focus so much on the negatives!  The positives just rock you-all!  Heck, I solo vexd and tipt all the time and get 3 blue bubs of aa xp per kill there...  Root, malo, slow, dot-dot-dot-dot-dot-dead lol... Soooo much fun!  I typically get 5-20 tells everytime I log in to join groups.  <br />
<br />
Believe me if you learn to use your shami skills and develop a reputation for being smart, aware and proficient at your class, you will be a VERY popular toon!<br />
<br />
Hope this lightens the doom and gloom!  Shamis are AWESOME!  project that attitude and people will believe it!<br />

<br />
<br />
can I get some ove whatever it is your'e smoking please?<br />
<br />
to do 1k-1500 per tic you have to stack how many dots? 3-4 of our biggest meanest nastiest dots. and cold/poison dd's...yeah right, <br />
<br />
first of all our spells still dont land even post malos with anything that resembles regularity.<br />
second of all in pvp you have <br />
gate perma memmed<br />
fast heal perma memed<br />
Hot perma memed<br />
cani perma memed<br />
maloX perma memed<br />
Root (of you dont have the clicky pants) perma memed<br />
so thats 5-6 out of a possible 9 spell gems leave room for one nuke and 2 dots tops.<br />
<br />
what are you fighting that gives you the full minute to  spell swap mid fight? even a frigging wizard has the melee skills to make you stand up when you sit down to mem?<br />
<br />
<br />
dont get me wrong, it looks like things are finally looking up for shaman in pve, but I have been playing pvp since the very begining and I can honestly say pvp has never been more jacked than it is right now.<br />
<br />
(edit) unless of course you are fighting the bazaar geared that is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I Hunt a LOT, so this is valuable info.  Here is my typical PvP encounter and my PvP spell set.  I have 23 kills and 5 deaths (three of which were be accident from a guildie chanter pet that squished me in Vexd, so I have actually only died twice to enemies in PvP).  I have probably another 75 kills where I was KSed by one of my guildmates hehe...:<br />
<br />
Memmed top to bottom:<br />
Gate<br />
Fast heal<br />
HoT<br />
Poison Rain<br />
Bane<br />
Poison DoT<br />
Poison DD<br />
Cold DD<br />
Malo<br />
And I have my pet up fully buffed and hasted and with mage weps.<br />
<br />
I Start by summoning multi dog.  They stun like mad and they actually can proc for up to a 640hp hit (no joke, people almost always send me a tell after the fight saying &quot;*** was that!?&quot; lol).  While they are busy trying to figure out what the hell is bangin' the hell out of em, i Malo, Rain, Bane, Poison Dot, HoT myself, RC myself if needed (I dont even have my epic dot yet but if I did I would try to use that too).  Fight is more times then not over in less then a minute.  I have a druzzil's distance focus item (23%), so a lot of times people think they have run out of my range and they can regroup and all they did is give me a chance to hit them with rain again or another dot or DD.  Our dots STICK brother.  Since the PvP changes I have taken down a half dozen Pandemonium people on my server(all time geared or better and that is MUCH better geared then me btw).  Plus being 69 has greatly improved how much everything sticks as well.  I don't even bother with root or debuf.  Waste of time and mana imo.  I win two out of three fights.  I typically crit at least once with each dot (bane equals 900 to 1k on crits and Poison dot equals 650-750 on crits) so if they both stick that is a min of 750 with a max of upwards of 1800 on one tic sometimes.  People are always amazed how much damage our dots can do once you have your dot aas maxed and aa augs etc...Not to mention that rain will usually stick at least one and many times two out of three waves (650 each).<br />
<br />
I just took out a very feared necro last night and after the fight he expressed his surprise at how badly he got beat on by the dogdogs (get the higher level ones, the lower level dogdogs (five of em) kinda suck)...  They are a pvp gem!  Those three doggies kick ASS.  If you dont have them, save up the aas and please do yourself a favor and get them!  They give you all the time you need to slap your enemies around!<br />
<br />
You dont need gear nearly as much as the right strat and you can OWN in pvp...<br />

Math please!<br />
<br />
So lets see, assuming i'm currect (Porbably wrong) And any possibly bonus to healing will get doubled when you land a crit heal, to acheive this you need to land a non-crit heal for between 3500-4000.  <br />

Ok... I play on Tallon Zek and never heard of this guy....but that's besides the point.<br />
<br />
<br />
The highest healing focus (that I'm aware of ...dunno about oow yet) is the Discordant Healing from GoD items.  That's 45%...   and lets assume max AA + oow AAs.....  25%.....<br />
<br />
1950 * 25% (AAs) = 2437<br />
2437 * 45% (focus) = 3534<br />
<br />
double that to just over 7k......when all the moons and focii are aligned.<br />
<br />
<br />
...and as far as pvp.... yes, gear DOES make a difference.  When people have 300 resists without buffs, spells bounce.... A LOT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I was refering to the fact that with the new aas you get another 9% when maxed.  So here goes the math:<br />
<br />
base (65 GoD heal spell) 1550 + 20% from focus item = 1860  +27% from all heal aas maxed (max of 418 more) = a max of 2278.  on crits you double, so you can hit up to 4457 (I have done it manymany times).  I am camping the 30-40% heal items in KodTaz and above with guildied in the Hope of eventually up to 1200 hps more on crits.  That is what I was refering to btw, the hope of eventually getting better heal focus items as I progress.<br />
<br />
With the new heal spell at 70 the base is 1950 and with the aas and items I have now it will go like this:<br />
1950 + 20% from focus item = 2340 + 27% from all heal aas maxed (526 max more) = a max as I stand today of 2866.  on crits that doubles to 5733.  assuming the eventual acquisition of the better heal focus items and I will ad up to 1600 more hps on crits (800 on non crits).<br />
<br />
I am not making this up.  I do this everyday with my GoD heal spell and some shaman friends of mine that are better equipped and have the 70 heal spell are hitting these numbers!  Talk about exciting!  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hiya Kellz,<br />
<br />
Give me a tell in game =).  Ask Liedel who I am.  I know her well, as well as a number of other guildmates of yours.  I am known for playing very clean.  I never train people.  I never PK nakeds or peeps on CR so I don't cause intense hatred like some people do.  And with the new patch our DoTs stick a LOT.  Look on the PvP boards.  Roxicet (who is third and is really number one since the other two in first and second are supper twink deleveled characters-is that lame or what btw) is one of my hunting partners and usually will KS me because druids get some pretty heavy dots and dds and she is maxed on her dd aas where I am not.  And believe me friend when I tell you that our gear SUCKS lol.  I also have not broken the top 100 yet, but if PvP was my priority I know that I would.  I am 157th at the moment.  I am usually on at least 4-5 times a week in the evenings PST.<br />
<br />
See you in game!<br />
<br />
PS- I hit 4400 crit heals very very regularily.  I don't bs.  No need to.  just trying to illustrate that the shaman class is much more powerful then people realize!<br />
<br />
I am also in the top 100 in normal as well as hard ldons.  Look me up and you will see my name in shining lights LOL!....<br />

<br />
With 40% heal mod item and 27% (I'm taking your word on this) from AAs, that's 67%.  That's a 2755hp heal.  Crit for 5511hp.  Then, even if you add on the 9% for HAM3 that's still only (heh) a base 3khp heal.  Crit for a little over 6k.  Either way, that's going to be impressive =)  I think once you get the ancient heal you could probably crit for 7k+</div></div><hr />

main healer in WoS ain't exactly a shocker since we can solo there with ease now...<br />
<br />
does heal focus get doubled in crits? I know it doesn't for nukes. e.g 1k nuke + 30% focus crits for 2300 max, not for 2600.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The heal focus is definately doubled in the crits.  I have IH4 and AHA3, totalling 39% additional healing (IH4 = 20%, HA3 = 10%, AHA3 = 9%).  Using tnargs base of 1300, if the additional healing didn't double my max crit would be 3107.

Have you done this since you hit level 69? I solo in Vxed quite a bit at 65 and don't get 3 blue bubbles of aa exp even on the yellow-con mobs. The best I get is 2.5 bubbles, on yellows, and only 2 bubbles on blues. I'd be interested in how that changes as you level up, since everything will be dark blue.</div></div><hr />

How many aa's do you have, and need by your calculations to do all that?  Healing Adept, Healing Gift, Spirit Call, Crit Affliction...<br />

No offense, but it sounds to me like you're out at an extreme end - many here are at the extreme of gear, sounds like you're at the extreme of AA's.  Neither is going to help the lower level or more casual players experience any expansion.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>crollub</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">and if they running they only hit by 1st rain?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hi guys,<br />
<br />
First off at 69 I am getting 2 blue bubs plus now when I solo in Vexd/Tipt, the 3 1/2 bubs was back when I was 63/64 =).  <br />
<br />
Secondly, I took out a rogue yesterday in a guild named incursion.  They are not time geared but they are Solusek Ro/plane of Fire level from what I hear.  The fight went like this:  I was tired and I was actually about to log after an hour or so in an instanced in OoW.  I zoned out at the same time as he did into dranik.  I said hello, he said hello and attacked lol...  He most definitely got the jump on me!  I cast malo on him, he hit me a few times for about 700hps while I got my dogdogs out.  Then I ran around a bit while my dogs chewed on him down to about 70%.  I then cast Bane and it stuck.   Then I ran around a bit again.  I was down to about 60% as was he.  I then cast poison dot, and it stuck.  he was down to 45% now.  He started to realize he might be in trouble as i cast Rain of Yoppa on him.  One wave was resisted and other two stuck.  BOOM he's down to 15% and he does a /salute and next tic he suffers a combined damage of 580 hps and dies.  The /salute part was a classy and funny move lol.   <br />
<br />
Mind you when I zoned out I only had about 50% mana and still had about 25% left at the end of the fight.  I never healed myself once.  I never debuffed or slowed.  Slows just never seem to stick that often.  The new 65 slow sticks a little bit more often but not enough to have become a regular part of my PvP battle strat.   I also bagged a necro the same way last night at the begining of the evening btw.   The second level dogdogs are veryvery key.  They proc a bad-ass stun and up to 640 hp dam!<br />
<br />
Lastly.  Yes I have a lot of aas, but so can you.  What I mean is that vexd/tipt has some of the best xp in the game.  I have regularly farmed an AA every 40-60 minutes there.  On all day session on a Saturday I have gotten 9 1/2 aas in about 8 hours there.  In a Friday-Sunday period I have gotten 25 aas before.  Since I discovered that zone about 8 weeks ago I have gotten about 200 aas and to level 69...  If you want to level fast, grab an enchanter, a palidin, a snarer class, a cleric and whoever else to round it out and go to town!  The xp is that good and it is fun as can be there!  The key is to control that pet when charm breaks!  Have the pali and cleric stunstunstun, while you remalo, the snarer re-snares and you are good for another 5-10 minutes or so of ass-kicking xp!<br />
<br />
Have fun all =)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I go the WoS often where I am the only slower and the Healer for the group.<br />
<br />
<br />
I sort of view WoS as a Gimped zone so I don't expect much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With the GoD heal spell (1550) with a cast time of 3.8 seconds and all your heal and crit heal aas maxed and with a focus heal item i heal for a minimum of 2k and crit for up to 4400.  <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah so nice you have your GoD spells<br />
<br />
Count the amount of shaman that don't.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I typically crit heal about every third heal and with the new heal and crit heal aas I expect to hit closer to 4800 and crit heal every other cast.  Once I get the level 70 heal (1950) I expect to hit upwards of 7-8k on crit heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That’s nice you have all your healing AA's<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Use this in conjunction with you HoT spell and you will keep up with any trash mob (with the exception of Vexd/Tipt/KT type mobs).  The mini named in WoS are np as well btw...<br />
This healing power combined with the 1.5 second GoD slow makes you VERY valuable!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah yes but like I said this is a gimp zone!<br />
<br />
You can be powerful here! It designed for people from 63 - 67 and at 69 yes you are a bit above the level threshold<br />
<br />
Ok this is the problem you are using the lower end of expansion! Yes thats right this place was designed for the people that haven't been to GoD or Time and don't have many AA's. <br />
<br />
This is not a place a lvl 69 shaman who is Time / GoD flagged should really be hunting in. Why don't you head into MPG and be the main healer there<br />
<br />
I think you should be comparing zones which take into account your equipment and spells. Then you can draw a line between what expected and the reality of the situation. <br />
<br />
Being a main healer in 1/2 zones, which aren’t even the high end of the omens zones hardly, makes me jump for joy!<br />
<br />
Sorry if this isn't patronizing enough!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Last night, I was main heal in Kod Taz (at the north crag camp) for three hours. I have Daluda's Mending and Breath of Trushar, all my POP healing AA's and the first level of Advanced Healing Adept and Healing Boon (by the way, I have yet to see a crit HOT tick). I'm relatively well-equipped, I suppose, but I don't consider myself &quot;uber.&quot; Just over 5100 mana unbuffed, with leadership/tribute/VOQ, closer to 5900 (5860-ish I think). <br />
<br />
I didn't have too bad a time with it, honestly, except when the monk brought a Ra'Tuk. Flurry and enrage make it hard on a shaman, lol. But hynids and cragbeasts and the golems were MUCH easier, with hardly any downtime for cannibalizing (except after Ra'Tuks, lol). I did load Tnarg's and Q to see whether shaman without GOD spells could handle healing. It was *MUCH* tougher (more downtime for cannibalizing every 5-6 pulls to be sure I was around 80m), but I managed.<br />
<br />
Group was composed of myself (68/255 shaman), a roughly 9.5k 70 monk tanking, a 70 enchanter, a 66 wizard, and a 66 ranger. <br />
<br />
Flame if you feel like you have to, but I have to say I was pretty pleased with my performance. Gave me a bit of extra confidence.<br />

As for as the dot-crit aas, when you have them maxed you will typically crit 1-3 times per cast per spell.  When you reach level 70 you can have as many as 9 dots that all stack.  talk about powerful root and rot capabilities.  If you want to xp fast and hard, bring a druid or wizard friend to vexd and duo there.  pull, snare, root, debuff and dot to hell.  I typically get an aa every 40-45 minutes when I duo here with my wizard and druid buddies...<br />

As far as the rogue goes /shrug I don't know his hps were but I am sure that buffed he is closer to 6k right?  And I have killed every class from every guild who are enemies...  It is a really fun part of the game win or lose imo.  <br />
<br />
My point to everyone was that a Shaman can be very effective and deadly in PvP.  Btw I got a chance to use the new cripple last night and it was pretty effective!  I also killed a chanter, a warrior and a wizard all in the last 48 hours.  The chanter was a level 69 in Minions of Deloth and the warrior was a 69 in Pandemonium and the wizard I don't remember.  All i remember was that he was a DE.  I also was killed once while naked on a cr by a group of pande in WoS.  <br />
<br />
I personally think attacking and killing nakeds is reprehensible and I do not engage in it.  I will actually help people that are on CRs even if they are enemies.  That is my 'truce-time' if you will =).<br />

As to my computation of your opponents hit points, I simply used your own account of the fight to work my way to it.  You say that he had 15% life remaining, and your next tick of 580 HP killed him.  I simply used basic math to work out his HP from your data.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Hey brother,<br />
<br />
Don't know what crawled up your rectum and died, but last I checked shortsidedness, rudeness, arrogance and petulance were not highly regarded by any community and your missives indicate that you possess these qualities in spades.  <br />
<br />
Secondly, I will repeat, AGAIN that the point here is to illustrate that the Shaman class is very powerful in it's own right!  And if exhuberance and joy are indications of being lame or of being a &quot;ten-year-old&quot; to put it in your words, then color me lame and a ten-year-old you sourpuss rofl.  <br />
<br />
Thirdly, are you on a pvp server sir?  If you are on Tallon Zek, please let us meet up and duel and see what there is to see.  I think it would be interesting to see the results =).  And perhaps this shaman of 'dubious accomplishments'  would deliver you the spanking it would appear you would benefit most from, which would be adding you to my list of kills.  If you are not on a pvp server, best to limit your comments to a subject you are familiar with and not look a bitter fool.<br />
<br />
Lastly who appointed you as a representative of what will and will not be well received here?  You are most assuredly self-delusional at the very least sir to presume something so preposterousas to be the arbiter of this community!  Hopefully you will keep you comments to the positive in the future as that is what contributes the most to learning and sharing as is intended by this site I would guess =).<br />
<br />
If you reviewed this thread from the begining you would see that I acknowledged that being exhuberant can be annoying but that I just am trully convinced that the Shaman is an awesome class to play.  <br />

<br />
I have a suggestion for you, before you start criticising people, why don't you read what they've done.  You are obviously new to this community, why don't you look up a few names: Sudedor, samanna, Gloriana, Rytan and Absor.  I've left off quite a few names from this list, as to not do all the work for you.<br />
<br />
Then, I would suggest you read the information that's been posted about the shaman's condition which is backed with numbers and parses, rahter than blanket statment such as:<br />
<br />
I expect to hit upwards of 7-8k on crit heals. <br />
<br />
Notice, the 7K figure *might* be correct, but there is nothing to back it.<br />
<br />
and crit heal every other cast. <br />
<br />
Which is obviously wrong.<br />
<br />
I could say: I am able to easily land a critical heal for 10K with my current gear/AA/Gates heal.<br />
<br />
Granted, this is completely possible, and almost trivial to do if you think about it, and have the right person to land it on.  Hint use a pally w their epic buff up, heals land for double on him :) So yes, this isn't hard.  A friend of mine has been chealed for about 54K though i didn't see it.<br />
<br />
Another thing, regardless of what other people say/do/type/ect don't start a flame war if you are new hear (yea it's too late) you will be marked a troll for life.  <br />
<br />
Oh just thought of a new name to look up: conlin67<br />
<br />
And have a nice day/life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hehe.<br />
<br />
The guy at SOE where the spell tuning buck stops.<br />
<br />
I can no longer main heal through named I once could in oow since the reintroduction of slow mitigation.  Partially timed geared atm.  Take that as you will.  Some named yes, some named no. But in general, I will not form a group without a druid or cleric in any oow content.<br />
<br />
I could never heal through KT groups.  Some shaman report they can though.  <br />
<br />
Regardless, basing a discussion on the state of the shaman by looking at healing alone is skewed at best.  Take into account all the various parses on these boards, our buffs, our dps, and compare, yes, compare that to similar classes, and you find that we are far behind other classes in overall use to a group.<br />
<br />
6 specialty classes (with narrow but more effective spell lines) is always greater than having 5 specialty classes and one &quot;fill in the gap class&quot; (the shaman).  <br />
<br />
We can't do anything better than another class.<br />
<br />
Dots: necro higher<br />
Heals: cleric, druid higher<br />
Slow: mitigation negates the 5% we have over enchanters.<br />
Buffs: weakest hp buff, stat buffs worthless on stat maxed high gear characters.  Lowest haste.  Beast can buff attack more and resist more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Name one thing we do better than another class?  <br />
Thats the issue.  <br />
<br />
Not to mention raid stacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback all.  Both positive and negative.  The major detractor has yet to answer if he is on a pvp server though (anyone want to bet that he isn't lol).  And my offer to 'take it outside' and duel him stands.  Heck, if he is on sullon zek i will pay the transfer fee there and back again to take him on.  That would be fun lol...On to a more serious topic...<br />
<br />
As far as my answer on the shaman utility, I will answer this way:  Why do they have an Oscar for &quot;best supporting actor&quot;?  The point being that we are oftentimes the glue that holds a group together.  <br />
<br />
We can spot heal, we can dot (pretty effectively too once you have all your focus items and aa-crits), let us not forget the utility of park and root, we can DD (though fairly weak that extra K or two of damage on a snared mob can be what turns it into a fleeing mob that you get to bash on for the last 10-18% or so...).<br />
<br />
Oftentimes when I am with a druid or cleric in WoS level or higher content I wll be spot healing and in charge of HoTs while he/she cheals.  Our new cripple spell is pretty nice too btw.  I just got it last night and the -100 to the affected stats has made a substancial difference in the damage output of many mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess the thing I like the best is our versatily.  There is just so many interesting things we are capable of doing.  We are the jack of all trades of the game.  Though admitedlly we are master of none, it is still a darn fun position to be in imo.<br />
<br />
For the record, I am the original owner.  My toon was born on June 3rd, 2003 and my only alt is a level 12 berzerker so I don't even really count him.  I have to say though that being a tank has been fun too on occasion even at that low level.  Though the prospect of leveling him to 70 and to decent aas is too daunting at this time to even consider lol...<br />
<br />
Over time I have just enjoyed my shaman more, not less.  And contrary to many people I have never had problems getting a group.  On the few occasions I have had an issue there are just a TON of soloable content with very high xp returns all over the eq world...<br />
<br />
I will part with this:  focus on the positive and the fun of progressing and watching your toon grow more powerful and accomplished!   That's what I and many of my friends do and it is pure unadulterated fun!  Kind of reminds me of when I was ten... /wink<br />

Jesus, you sound just like my 3 year old when his older sisters are beating him at games.  This rant has gotten so old I wish it would be retired.<br />
<br />
1.  We have the best slow, yes, the very best one in the game.  BotN, -40 resist, 1.5 sec cast, 75%.  And we have an ae slow and a disease-based slow.  So please, no one ever say we are not the best at something, you are lying.<br />
<br />
2.  We are excellent at debuffing mobs.  Won't argue that Malos is the best magic/fire/cold/poison debuff in all situations, but damn close.  Add to that our ability to debuff disease also, and we are clearly the kings of this important aspect of the game.  Ask a wizard if he likes having a shammy around or ask a BST to slow mobs with high MR.<br />
<br />
3.  We have the best total buffs; hp, stats, atk, resists, haste and regen.  Some characters may not need some of them, but when you add them all up, we have the best buffs of any class, period.  The only thing we lack is mana regen, which only a small number of classes can buff.  And, since we have group versions, unlike BSTs and others, we can keep the entire group buffed at all times.  Show me a BST that can keep himself and 4 other melees buffed with Ferocity, IoS, stat buffs, regen, haste, etc.  Also, we have the new oow buffs which go over cap and buff abilities not stats.  IMHO, we are the best at buffing in general, others have better specific buffs, but we are the best all around.<br />
<br />
4.  In addition we have the second best dots, third best heals, useful pet, and many other utilities (invis, shrink, etc.).  We are one of the most versatile and useful classes in the game.<br />
<br />
So, please, give this &quot;poor me, I'm worthless&quot; rant a rest.<br />
<br />
Also, if we are useless, then what are BSTs or Druids?  They certainly are not the best at any one thing in the entire game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Best this. Best that.<br />
<br />
<br />
I never have cared about being the best at any of it. <br />
<br />
I just want to be able to be viable. A worthwhile addition to my group that in my own way helps the group just as much as the next class. <br />
<br />
I think that At the end of the day I am this. Even with the slow mitagation. My beef comes with the amount of effort that is required to be that contributing member. To contribute to the full extent of pretty much any other class we have to be using right at 95 to 98 % of our abilitys. Where they can do thier jobs abd contribute while at a peak of 80% or so. Then they also have more headroom when things get all pear shaped. Or in more specilist circumstances have more ability to shine at any one thing. (Or are able to shine in a more obvious role Like flashy crits. Or game/ groupsavers)<br />
<br />
Mitagation removal allowed me to slack off a little bit and enjoy the game a bit more rather than continually Work at it. And when stuff got pear shaped it gave me more time and headroom to shine in. <br />
<br />
The only class in the game that works harder than us is a bard. But they get thier rewards due to thier ability and versatility. And they have major headroom and game and groupsaving ability. <br />
<br />
Being a good shaman is hard work sometimes. And while I love it and do not want to play another class at all, I would certainly love to have a little time to smell the proverbial roses. And a little me time to shine in on occasion. <br />
<br />
That is what SoE has forgotten about. In reguards to the shaman class. They have forgotten that the effort involved should be rewarded in game. And on paper Shaman have a breadth of abilitys that is unmatched. But in game it is limited by the playstyle and locations you are playing in. and Depth of the bench doesnt matter when the superstars don't ever get tired or run out of steam. <br />

When yah get down to it, we are a utility class.<br />
We *must* adapt to each new expansion if we wish to be useful and enjoy ourselves.<br />
This is not why I made a shaman.<br />
I made a shaman because I saw a frined playing a 54 shaman and I thought, &quot;Holy ****, he can do fookin' EVERYTHIGN&quot;<br />
<br />
Then I made my own, and learned I could do *almost* everything, yes, but I had to adapt on the fly and put a lot of thought into any venture.<br />
<br />
Send me a PM, I'll detail my friend's stats and gear levels, and my own and the tactics we use.<br />
<br />
All of us need to ADAPT to the problems.<br />
Slow is never coming back.<br />
Slow is broken horrendously.<br />
We *ALL* saw it when OOW became fully slowable for that one sweet week.<br />
<br />
We're a utility class, live wiht it, and work the other mojo we have.<br />
Pray for miracles(sony giving us a new plus) but plant cabbages(**** and learn to deal wiht it) <br />
<br />
P.S. i'm gonna be hip-hop-haphaphapeee and wear a smile. We're not a horrid unplayable overly-nerfed class. We're simply, behind everyone else. It's only a bad view if it's the wrong gender or a troll</div></div><hr />

<br />
Snoww I agree with ya, being a good shaman requires more effort than with most classes.  One of my best buddies in RL is a 65 wizzie with 200+ aa's.  Talk about cushy, get in group, wait for awhile until mob is at 60-70% health, nuke to kingdom come.  Rinse, repeat, watch TV in between.  No buffs, no heals, no freaking FA every 6 min./per melee, just nuke.  <br />
<br />
But ya know, it's the versatility and ability to save the group on a bad pull, or keep the MT or cleric alive, or slow 4 mobs and get killed but the group survives, that's fun to me.  So yeah, I work at it, but that's what I enjoy.  If I want to slack sometimes, I'll tell the chanter to slow while the cleric heals (my standard guild group includes both), while I switch to dots and rains.  :)</div></div><hr />

Leaders and revered people go a step further, they actually learn how to influence people to bring about the bright side.<br />
<br />
To our friend here who is beaming in possitivity, fantastic, wether or not his crit heal calculations are spot on i GUARENTEE he is having a lot more fun than those who whine about this and moan about that.<br />
<br />
Life is tooo short, and the little time we have is to precious to spend it with negative people.<br />
<br />
Be the other sort, those who people look to for fun.<br />
<br />
Its a game, if you dont like your class you chose, try something different.<br />

Pointing out the shortcomings of the class is the thing to do now, not the positives.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have no real urge to rack up 300 aa's in order to be able to dot or heal effectively, but more power to those who do..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I cannot play a wizzie or a cleric, or even a warrior. It just bores me to death. <br />
<br />
There is no question in my mind that I go through more mana/hour than anyone I ever group with. None whatsoever. I just got the new Canni, and I am getting PISSED about not being able to Canni 4 while standing there. Seriously. <br />
<br />
I think all shaman are ADD, the best ones anyway. We jump from this to that the the other. We root, we heal, we slow, we dot, we nuke.<br />
<br />
OoW is good. Snowwy, please bro, GIVE IT A CHANCE! The AE nuke is the bomb. The 2 most common, easy to get Gates spells are amazing. New buffs are killer. SOE gave Shaman more in this expansion than any other class by FAR. They heard us guys. yeah yeah, we still have issues. Mitigation is a design cop-out. but I am feeling the power man. The desire to play is strong. I am leveling so I can gain power. I am camping spells so I can be more than I am now. I am looking for loots that will upgrade me and my mates that are 1-groupable. The power is back, that feeeling only a shaman can have when you get 3 adds, and at the end of the fight, you look around at the pile of bodies, at the tanks hps clicking up from the HoT you have have on them, and at your own mana bar, which  still looks darn good after a Canni. And while the rest of the group goes &quot;med break&quot;, you say &quot;80, pull away&quot;. <br />
<br />
I am back. Give it a month and you all will be back too. Just have patience. Progress along. Look to do trials. Look to get you and your friends into KT. Hunt around. Exlpore. <br />
<br />
I went to Ruined City today. 1 guy in my group was a semi-hardcore guy. All he did was whine aoubt the XP, whine about the person that died on the way, whine about the lack of knowledge of the zone. then we went into a tunnel thing, got 3 adds, wiped, and he left. I had a FROAKIN BLAST!!<br />
<br />
People play this game for different reasons. Its just not possible to please all of the people all of the time. But honeslty, OoW has enough to make almost ANYONE happy if you just be patient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">1. We have the best slow, yes, the very best one in the game. BotN, -40 resist, 1.5 sec cast, 75%. And we have an ae slow and a disease-based slow. So please, no one ever say we are not the best at something, you are lying.<br />
<br />
Yes, we are best at slowing.  The point I made about mitigation still holds true.  They mitigated the one thing we are best at.  And with the speed of tash, its not that much of any issue.  <br />
<br />
Rogues are best at melee dps.  You'd hear the rogues go beserk if they released an expansion where every single mob in it mitigated melee dmg.  This is no different. <br />
<br />
2. We are excellent at debuffing mobs. Won't argue that Malos is the best magic/fire/cold/poison debuff in all situations, but damn close. Add to that our ability to debuff disease also, and we are clearly the kings of this important aspect of the game. Ask a wizard if he likes having a shammy around or ask a BST to slow mobs with high MR.<br />
<br />
And tash+mala+malosinia is different how?  Again, we aren't better, at best equal in this category.  <br />
<br />
3. We have the best total buffs; hp, stats, atk, resists, haste and regen. Some characters may not need some of them, but when you add them all up, we have the best buffs of any class, period. The only thing we lack is mana regen, which only a small number of classes can buff. And, since we have group versions, unlike BSTs and others, we can keep the entire group buffed at all times. Show me a BST that can keep himself and 4 other melees buffed with Ferocity, IoS, stat buffs, regen, haste, etc. Also, we have the new oow buffs which go over cap and buff abilities not stats. IMHO, we are the best at buffing in general, others have better specific buffs, but we are the best all around.<br />
<br />
Best all around.... why would you settle for less of everything when you can just form a group that has the best of everything?  Shaman are great when you can't find the right classes... yup.  Guess I'll have to agree with you there.  And for the love of god, stop mentioning stats.  Not one melee I group with has any need for any stat.  At all. <br />
<br />
Again, not one single buff we have is greater than another classes.  Our hybrid buffs more attack, Enc's are greater haste, Druids more hp.  The only thing we have that other classes do not, is stats.  And someone with good gear doesn't need them.   But sure, I'm great at powerleveling alts.<br />
<br />
Show me a BST that can keep himself and 4 other melees buffed with Ferocity, IoS, stat buffs, regen, haste, etc<br />
<br />
Every single beast in my guild.  But you forgot one important thing.  IoS and Stat buffs are not needed.  Haven't been needed since halfway through PoP for me.  <br />
<br />
4. In addition we have the second best dots, third best heals, useful pet, and many other utilities (invis, shrink, etc.). We are one of the most versatile and useful classes in the game.<br />
<br />
Again, thats my entire point.  We are the best in one area, but it was nerfed.  Everything else we are second or third.  So again... why pick a shaman?  You pick a shaman only when you can't find &quot;the better classes&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Er, this takes 2 classes. I agree that we have peers in the de-buff department, but peers only. No one is better.<br />
Again, thats my entire point.  We are the best in one area, but it was nerfed.  Everything else we are second or third.  So again... why pick a shaman?  You pick a shaman only when you can't find &quot;the better classes&quot;.<br />
I am gonna respectably disagree here. I suppose if you want to sit there and hand- pick the OPTIMUM group, Shaman may not have a spot. But regardless of that, the current EQ has a need for people who can fill multiple roles. Paladins tank, and back up heal, and back up or sole rez. Clerics heal and rez, and can mitigate damage with stuns. Chanters have slow, and great CC, and can be great DPS in charm situations. BLs have slow, nice buffs, and outstanding DPS, and off-tankablility with pet (crowd control). Shaman have nice heals, nice DOTs, slow, decent buffs, decent crowd control, etc. <br />
<br />
Min-maxxing is fine for some, but in the real world, you find the folks LFG, you find the abilities you need to finish the group off, and you find the classes that fit those roles. I think shaman have a LOT of groupability in this scenerio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">So the one situation that you'd want a shaman is if you had a wizard and no mage in the group.  To debuff for his nukes... sweet hehe.  <br />
<br />
Druids have debuffs for their own nukes and they have -neg checks..<br />
Necro's after can scent and their dots have -neg checks.<br />
Mages can do what we can.<br />
<br />
We are at best equal.  Not better.  <br />
<br />
All I'm saying, is that a core group makeup of:<br />
<br />
Tank/Cleric/Druid/Enc performs better in all areas over us.  <br />
<br />
Enc magic tash, Druid fire or cold debuff.  Wiz will be just fine.  Don't need a shaman.  <br />
<br />
The sad thing is, even a pure melee group isn't well served by having a shaman.  Most attack? Beast. Best haste? Enc.  Best HP buff? Cleric/Druid.  Where is the one uber thing that shaman bring that makes melee say &quot;yes, have to have that&quot;.<br />
<br />
While I don't have high hopes, it will be interesting to see how the new overcaps parse out, as well as the 5% and 10% dmg modifiers in oow.  <br />
<br />
If 60% haste + our new oow buffs &gt; Enc 70% haste + melee crit(20)<br />
<br />
then... then I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for agreeing.  Thats all I'm saying, pure numbers, shaman aren't the best.  Does that mean I don't get groups?  No.  I get groups all the time, because finding the optimum group can be hard.<br />
<br />
I play every night.  And every night I have fun and get groups.  But I know I'm not the best, and I know the groups overall dps is lower because of my presence.</div></div><hr />

Then I understand the point you are trying to make, and I agree with it. We are no longer the &quot;no-brainer&quot; we used to be. But, I will tell you something about the other classes that I have found to be a true bonus for us. <br />
<br />
The other slowing classes LOVE to have a Shaman in the group. BLs love it, because most really dont like to slow, and keep ferocity up. Chanters love it because they dont REALLY like to slow, and in charm situations, malos is huge. About the only time a Chanter really doesnt &quot;want&quot; the Shaman is when its a simple, 1-mob pull grind situation. In any spot where adds are probable, chanters can focus on mezz and not worry about slow. <br />
<br />
Not every class can be the best. To be perfectly honest, I am not sure I WANT to be the best ever again. Middle road, jack of many trades, lots of flexibility, I kinda like this spot. Too hard to maintain the role of &quot;King&quot;, I just wanna soldier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>Ruoroni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">&quot;20% from focus item&quot;<br />
forgive me if im mistaken but dont the pre OOW focus effects lower in effectiveness for our 66+ spells e.g. the lvl 70 heal? dunno if its been said just kinda occured to me and didnt wanna read the entire thread =P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like you, I play every night (almost), always get a group, and have a lot of fun.  However, I guess the difference between us is that I think that I am one of the best players I know, and the groups I play with are lucky to have me along.  No one I play with is parsing dps or calculating group stats to figure out if we are &quot;optimum&quot;.  If I ever get to that point, I'll just quit, because you can always convince yourself that the grass is greener somewhere else.  I don't play with numbers, I play with friends, real people who appreciate my skill, not just my &quot;numbers&quot;.  Screw that.  That's not a game, it's a math class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Azmaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">Woot Glad people are starting to see how powerfull we realy are. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Amen. <br />
<br />
I like to think that people who group with me invite me back for more not because the numbers were slightly better with me, but because I made the regular jobs easier, and because when the stuff hit the fan, I was able to do enough of this and enough of that to allow others to focus more... and together, we survived - or made a damn fine try at it, anyway.<br />
<br />
My gear and AAs (and spells) aren't nearly as sporty as what some of you run around with; yet, I have been told more than once that I play to the very limits of my class. I take that as a compliment - even if 'to the limits of what they thought possible for a Shaman' is what they really mean.<br />
<br />
It's my job to educate those I group with, to demonstrate to them how much better they are with a single-boxed, main character Shaman in the group than dps_03 or buffbot_27.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">Enc magic tash, Druid fire or cold debuff.  Wiz will be just fine.  Don't need a shaman.<br />
It is true that others can also debuff the same resists we can but their life is not easy, either. <br />
<br />
Admittedly, Howl of Tashan (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3342&amp;source=Live) only costs 40 mana and it has a very quick casting time but it generates huge agro. Show me an Enchanter that consistently tashes as the mob is incoming and, unless your tank is excellent at snap agro, I'll show you a dead enchanter, SCS 3 not withstanding. Enchanters do get runes but throwing a rune on yourself generates agro - the last thing you want to do when a mob is beating on you. Also, the best Tash is only -50 MR compared to -55 MR for Malos and does not affect FR, CR or PR.<br />
<br />
Druids do get fire and cold debuffs. In OoW they get Glacier Breath (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5354&amp;source=Live), which gives -55 CR and an AC debuff, and Immolation  of the Sun (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5348&amp;source=Live), which is a DoT that gives  -35 FR and an AC debuff. They have similar but slightly less powerful versions in PoP. The problem with these is that niether of them are unresistable and both of them, the FR debuff in paricular, generate HUGE agro. Druids use the immolation line for agro kiting FFS! The mana costs of both of these spells are comparable to Malos (400 for Malos vs 312 for Glacier  Breath and 400 for immolation).<br />
<br />
My point is that other classes do get debuffs but shamans are the undisputed kings and queens of this. Saying other classes get debuffs is like saying &quot;Well, shamans get nukes so we don't need a Wizard&quot;. Given a choice of having a choice of having any other single debuff on a mob, nukers will pick Malos every time (other than VP or Mez if it is beating on them :-))<br />
<br />
The sad thing is, even a pure melee group isn't well served by having a shaman.  Most attack? Beast. Best haste? Enc.  Best HP buff? Cleric/Druid.  Where is the one uber thing that shaman bring that makes melee say &quot;yes, have to have that&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree. A beast may have better ATK and resist buffs but I have better haste, hp and stat buffs. An Ench may give haste and a rune but I buff ATK, hps and stats more. A cleric/druid may buff hps but I buff ATK, haste and stats better. In theory, they all have better buffs. In practise, where is the room in this &quot;pure melee&quot; group for a beastloard, enchanter and cleric or druid? :-) A shaman can keep up all these buffs as well as debuffing and slowing incoming mobs often with mana to spare since our mana regen supercedes these classes by a significant margin (assuming similar gear and AAs.<br />
<br />
Given the choice of having a single class to buff a melee, and they'll probably pick a shaman. Clerics can give more hps and AC. Lots more infact but they can't haste you, increase your ATK or give you effective stat buffs. Enchanters give you more haste but not much. Druids can give you more hps, a DS and a Str buff but no haste or other stats.<br />
<br />
I think the point I am trying to make is that other classes share abilities with a shaman but a shaman has a unique combination that other classes lack. It is this combination coupled with the player's skill that makes a difference, not the fact that class A as a bit of shaman ability and class B another bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>selligonir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Hi all!<br />
<br />
I honestly did not expect this thread to generate a great deal of interest.  I am ever so glad it did.  As an update I grouped last night with a war/cleric/druid/pali/bst/sham combo at a spot we affectionalely call the cubby in WoS.  In a three in a half hour stint we got 14 nameds!  we got the rare drop war neck item (blue something) and the rare drop face item (veil of something with +2 mana regen and a damage focus effect up to level 70!) off of trash mobs.<br />
<br />
We wiped once when cleric was afk and pali agroed a wandering mob by accident while we were killing a mini named mob.  at the end it was myself and the beasty still standing.  The named was dead, the add was chewing us up.  The beasti kept the mob busy and died giving me the time to camp out.  I came back in a minute later and used our new Call of the wild aa skill (0% call to your corpse ability) to call the cleric to his corpse and rez everyone.<br />
<br />
For those of you that don't know, it is a LONG haul back to WoS on a pvp server when you are naked.  An easy and scary 10-15 minute rush through three zones while dodging the pvp bullet!<br />
<br />
Let me tell you my group was JAZZED!  I saved us a ton of time and within 5 minutes of the wipe we were up and running again =).   Talk about a powerful ability.  It costs 9 aas, but it is probably one of the BEST things soe ever did for us!   I am working on the new canni ability next (12 aas if I remember correctly) and I am really looking forward to adding this ability to the mix!<br />
<br />
Our upper end aa skills are trully amazing imo.<br />
<br />
All the best in your hunting all =)<br />
