<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rellix CoastBearer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Nothing says &quot;cute&quot; like a baby; a little rascal. Regardless of mother or size, the young of man's best friend are treated as well as many human children are.<br />
<br />
Many experts claim that our attraction to babies (and baby animals, for that matter) is due to instinct; that our natural instincts tell us to recognize the young, and to love, nurture, and protect them. What are these cues? Mainly large eyes and a disproportionately large head that is common in FAT babies.<br />
<br />
Example 1:<br />
<br />
look how fat that baby is:<br />
http://miller.senate.gov/ZM%20personal%20pictures/Beethoven%20for%20babies.jpg <br />
<br />
Notice how cute this fat baby is; the large eyes are telling of its young age.<br />
<br />
Example 2:<br />
<br />
http://www.ameliortech.com/images/babies.jpg <br />
Again, the large blind eyes. Notice that this baby is also doing something &quot;cute&quot; - smelling the other fat blind baby.<br />
<br />
Example 3:<br />

<br />
I don't even need to say anything. This baby's picture is next to &quot;cute&quot; in the dictionary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You might think this is funny, but it's not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why did it take so long? This stuff plaguing the general section is really hurting me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Henora they are only doing this to show how strict and overboard the moderation has gotten lately.  It is rediculous, I could see maybe moving things that are offending or flames to the grey, but most things should just stay in general.  Its NOT HURTING ANYONE, why move it?  The crucible was so much better back in the day before the new mods were added and went insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Babies are only cute to their own parents.  Everybody else just says they are cut to make the proud parents happy.  In reality, babies are just so damn ugly.  Why is it that its ok for babies to be in commercials nude, but adults can't.  You can't use the perveted argument.  How many Chester the Molesters are out there spanking off to a baby commercial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">then go somewhere else if you don't like it Asheran.  Send email to Sunmoon and explain that you think I should be removed.<br />
<br />
These threads have nothing to do with shaman and don't belong in the general discussion forum.  If you don't agree, that's tough.<br />
<br />
No one is prohibiting you from posting useless garbage like this.   Post it in the forum where it belongs and you won't hear anything from me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Babies and boobies and puppies are cute because humans have a natural positive response to round objects.  <br />
<br />
Least that's what I've been told.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FYI , i like the mods here</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree. Babies are really ugly lol.  :eek:</div></div><hr />

Minus the stogie, of course.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I am a nerd and therefore I know the answer to these things:<br />
<br />
If you live in Kansas, then babies are cute because God made them that way.<br />
<br />
If you live outside Kansas then its because theres an evolutionary advantage.  Humans who start out life looking cute are more likely to be fed and survive to reproduce, humans who find their babies cute will look after their babies better and so their progeny are more likely to survive to reproduce.<br />
<br />
And while I bore you all on the topic: human children grow at a deliberately reduced rate until they become sexually mature, and then they put on a spurt of growth.  The reason for this is that humans are group animals and small adolescents are less likely to be seen as threats by other group members.  Except of course in Kansas where its because God wanted things that way.<br />
<br />
Edit:  oops Kansas, not Alabama</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I am with Mangler here.<br />
<br />
babies look like little goblins to me, squished up head, way to big, can't talk, crap themselves, cry all the time.<br />
<br />
Nothing cute about a baby, I hope when I have kids I can leave for 13 years and come back when they can start playing sports and carry on a half way decent conversation.<br />
<br />
I would kill the damn kids if they did half the stupid crap I did as a kid growing up.<br />
