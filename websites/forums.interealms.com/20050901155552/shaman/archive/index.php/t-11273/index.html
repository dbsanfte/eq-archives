<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>vandalls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hi all<br />
<br />
I was just wondering if anyone knows or would like to come forward?<br />
<br />
Who is the best shaman?<br />
<br />
I understand there can be as many answers to this as there are 65 - AA Shaman's, but I'm asking who has the best items in each slot &amp; who has the most skills &amp; AA's maxed out?<br />
<br />
Of course then there is what is the best item?<br />
<br />
Just wondering if any Shaman is reconised as the best...<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />

everyone reconises that</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I dont. I'll take a knowledgable and skilled player over the best equipped halfwit anyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'd take a shaman with playing skill(and decent gear?) or a shaman with no skill and full elemental gear.  Gear dose'nt make the shaman, the skill does... gear just helps him perform his skill at a higher ability or rate of success imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Swiftraven won botb on his server, then he won on the test. <br />
<br />
I guess that make him the best of the best, of the best? hehe</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>phantomhood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you forget a few things on botb lag issues and how long ago was that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">BoTB was ancient history.  It was SO long ago, that even an old man like me was only lvl 53 at the time (too low for realistic competition).  The BoTB shaman for my server for instance, has quit the game twice now and now sports some rather ghetto gear compared to anyone halfway decent.  He wouldn't make the top 20 Lanys shamans, let alone the best.  <br />
<br />
BotB is totally outdated.  It needs to be redone imho.<br />
<br />
As far as the most AA points, Mudcrush has the most with over 450 I believe.  Just insane eh?  I guess he finally trained hastened rabidity LOL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Spiritist of Bertox has maxed out AA.  558 or something.  He's on the list.<br />
<br />
I don't believe he posts here but I'm sure he's lurking somewhere . . . (/wave Spiritist)  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">558 aa and zero life. <br />
<br />
At 80 aa I decided to start getting laid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">pvp is mostly about gear anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I believe that any shaman who went from 1-65 or anywhere in between and learned how to really play a shaman is the best.<br />
<br />
If you can group with him, get some exp and not die I call that a good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">pvp is mostly about gear anyways.<br />
For non-melee, not really. A full spell book and a shaman that knows how to us it, is worth more then an extra 400hps or ac. Botb limited gear effects like right clickies and potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">BotB is a lousy indicator of who's the &quot;best shaman&quot; anyway.  It is ONLY a measure of PVP skill.  I don't PVP, so it's a lousy yardstick.<br />
<br />
Problem is, there is no good easy yardstick to measure the &quot;best shaman&quot;.  I guess you could set them loose on a full pop zone and give them each an hour, and the one with the most XP gained at the end of that hour would win, or the highest point count total by assigning some value to each mob killed.  Or put them in a group with 5 other people and do the same - that would be a &quot;best of the best teams&quot;.  It doesn't have the pizazz of a &quot;tournament&quot; but it would be closer to realistic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Someone please what is meant by &quot;best&quot;? What is your criteria?<br />
<br />
When I group I slow mobs, debuff them, heal hurt people, buff everyone (usually before they ask) and generally have enough mana to continuously do this. Are most shaman unable to do this?<br />
<br />
I hear people saying so and so sucks. I wanna know why. Maybe I suck. No one has ever told me. My ability to cast on a mob has nothing to do with my skill. If I get resisted there's not much I can do about it except cast again. Does that mean I suck?<br />
<br />
I've never dueled anyone with my shaman so I haven't a clue about PvP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>MojoMachine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">How do you get on that list anyway? O_o I have a magelo profile</div></div><hr />

Look at the top of the list.  How many of those with 4K+ unbuffed HP's do you see coming here and answering questions or giving out advice? <br />
<br />
I'm here.  &lt;3!</div></div><hr />
