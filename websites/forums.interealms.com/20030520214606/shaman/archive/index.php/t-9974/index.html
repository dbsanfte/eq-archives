MAGIC ITEM LORE ITEM <br />
Skill: 1HB Atk Delay: 36 <br />
DMG: 30 WT: 2.5 Dmg/Sec: 16.94 <br />
WIS+10 HP+50 MANA+35 SV FIRE+10 <br />
Effect: Scoriae Bite (Unlimited Charges) <br />
Class: CLR DRU SHM <br />
Race: ALL <br />
<br />
Proc is a 75dd/stun with a cool skull fear spell effect look <br />
<br />
The only resists I get with it is &quot;this mob is immune to the stun portion of this effect&quot; or whatever.  The only time I ever saw a &quot;your target has resisted the scoriae bite spell&quot; is on the dragoons in OT outpost. (they also resisted everything else a few times, even with a friend casting malo on it)<br />
<br />
It drops off junk beast in poi, who we did with one group.<br />
<br />
Thing is, I havn't seen any others on my server (Xev). Not one. i dunno if they forgot to put it back on his loot table after they moved him or what.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my biggest hit with it is 126, add the proc in there (maxed 1hb, high dex, I proc A LOT) and it makes for a very nice weapon.<br />
<br />
Added bonus...I get to run around weilding it saying &quot;I hate meeces to pieces!&quot; <br />
