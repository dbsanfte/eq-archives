<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a collection in LDON last night (Collect 30) and the drop rate was simply amazing.  The first 6 mobs dropped things, and then we'd get one ever 2 mobs, 3 max.    We were doing so good we actually took a break in the middle and finished with plenty of time.    This was a non-uber geared, non-uber dps group. (We finished a slaughter 58 in 79 minutes) (level 65 adventure).<br />
<br />
Okay... we all knew collection was random... and random means that sometimes you'll get some good streaks in addition to the bad streaks.<br />
<br />
Talking to 2 other guildies, doing seperate adventures, they both had amazing collection drop rates as well.   So we figured that in the patch they improved collections.<br />
<br />
Several people seemed to be telling me this.   So we do another collection (Collect 29) and this time we start off with a bang!   We had 14 of 29 collected in approx 25 minutes (basically same DPS level as the group above, but slightly different).<br />
<br />
Then ... it dried up... completely.   We won the adventure with about 4 minutes left.   The whole middle of the dungeon dropped nothing... and we cleared nearly the entire thing... we were on the last hallway when we won (Tak theme for both of these).   So then we're all thinking &quot;Dang, I guess they haven't been changed, we were just super lucky on the last one).<br />
<br />
Has anyone else has experience with collection since the patch?   Seems odd that 3 seperate adventures would get amazing drop rates... then we'd get a crappy one.  It may simply be the same as always and it WAS just dumb luck.</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
<br />
Not really collecting &quot;data&quot; as such... but I would like to hear from people who did them patch night or last night.<br />
<br />
Our &quot;feel&quot; was that &quot;OMG collections are now so uber!&quot; which we got from 3 seperate adventures, in 3 different themes... but then... we did one that felt just like normal... if you're not uber and blowing things up... you often have to fight to the end to win.   <br />
<br />
I'm actually a fan of collections... however they do account for most of my losses, and probably most of my &quot;close wins&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>khazmun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did a collect 23 the night after patch, finished with 45 minutes to spare, and that only because one of the members went LD with only one more to collect and we waited 10 minutes for her to return, so figure we could have finished in 35 minutes.  The drop rate was insane, I'd guess 80% of what we killed dropped an item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did a 27 collection last night.  It was 3 guildies and 3 pickups, and we finished in 45 minutes, despite taking 2 short med breaks.  None of us is particularly well equipped, and we don't normally rip through adventures that fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Two nights ago I did a Miragul's collect 28 and the drop was very high.  I'd estimate every other mob had a drop with no dry areas of the dungeon that we saw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did a miraguls hard, needed 23 to win. 50 mins on the clock, had 10 to go, raid called. Not entirely useful data since we didnt finish, perhaps we got the lucky streak. and would have gone 40 mins w/o one.<br />
<br />
On collects, I have always had PHENOMENAL luck in mistmoor. I may give that one a go when I get a chance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Collection is based more on the RNG than your skill.  It will always be hit or miss unless they put a drop on each mob and give you a realistic number to kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Experience pre-patch for me was that for collect missions you want to take High number collections... i.e. a collect 30 usually had a lot more drops and ended up being quicker than a collect 23.  <br />
<br />
The collect 23 had the potential to be faster, but it always seemed like the drop rate was tied to the # required for a win such that higher collect# meant reasonably sure you'd be able to win while a collect 23 you might have to kill every mob in the dungeon to get those 23 drops.  Ass Backwards, IMO.  Main complaint was and remains to be that Collection Missions are more about luck with the RNG than anything.  Why not just have the freaking group leader /random 100 in front of the wayfarer?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">my experience(pre patch) was that anything below collect 26 was extremely low drop rate, 26 to 27 was ok drop rate, and 28+ are good drop rates. I love doing low # collects myself, cause they are somewhat difficult(especially towards the end when you're pulling 5 at a time when ya have 5 at the camp w/out mezzer)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">COUNT THE MOBS...  The only way you will know for sure how collect/assassinate/rescue compare is to count the number of monsters you need to kill to get the reward...  My guess is you will be getting numbers over 75...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">its hard to tell if its just the RNG being nice or if they slanted it a bit. I did have a collection actually save me from a bad group because of some fortunate drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">missed a collection tonite - needed 30.<br />
<br />
Ended with 2 needed with 6 mins left...didn't see any for 15 - 20 more mins.  Once we backtracked to a different branch we got 3 on the first 3 pulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Did a collect 23 last night and finished in 30min... so fast that even the AA xp sucked ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have done 3 hard collections since the rumor started that they were balanced now.  The first one was 23 collect, we killed 49 mobs, and done with plenty of time to spare &quot;woot it must be fixed&quot; we thought.  The next was 24 or 25, we killed 66 mobs and won.  The third was collect 22.  At 78 mobs the last finally dropped and we lost in less than one second after the &quot;you failed&quot; message appeared.<br />
<br />
It is not fixed, and /ran 100 in front of the adventure recruiter would probably be the better option.<br />
<br />
From my understanding the drop rate is based on dungeon size.  You will have to kill at least a certain % of the dungeon.  But with larger dungeons the chance of a given mob having your drop goes way down...so you can go 10 or more without seeing one.  Someone is compiling the numbers, not sure where (pretty sure it is a Japanese board), but one of my guildmates was talking about it (and recording our numbers for it) so the info will be available soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I’ve had over 70 successful missions and over 50 of those have been collection missions.  I’ve never once lost a mission because of lack of drops.  In fact, we usually have 30 to 40 minutes to spare.  Our record so far was 55 minutes left on the clock when we collected the last item.  I’ve never understood why other people have had such problem with collection missions.  But as someone else pointed out, we rarely ever take a collection mission of less than 26.  Whether or not that has anything to do with it, who knows.  <br />
<br />
Our group, ranging from 58 to 62 depending on who filled the vacated slots, did about six missions today.  Three of us were very close to being able to unlock the armor that we wanted so we were pushing it.  Anyway, I believe all of the missions were collections.  We had one mission where every one of the first 20 mobs dropped the item we needed.  It became more sporadic after that, but we still finished with more than 40 minutes to spare.  I just assumed it was the RNG proving once again that it has a sense of humor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You haven't been in some of the crappy pick-up groups I've been in :)  Playing with 5 total strangers you've never met before, with a mishmash of poorly matched classes, makes for some very difficult adventures.  I was in a group this weekend where all the players did their jobs quite well, but we still failed on a collection.  Being able to play with a consistent group of familiar people is probably the biggest factor toward success, in my opinion.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I did 2 collections missions over the weekend and won both.  We had 2 partial wipes and a zone out on the second one and still won with about 3 minutes left on the timer.  So far they seem to drop more...but this was only 2 missions...<br />
<br />
Note:  in the past I had a partial success where the last mob in the dungeon dropped the last piece we needed...so I consider anything better an improvement  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I did 6-8 of them this weekend, and there were so many drops on each of them I was thinking &quot;This will surely be nerfed.&quot;  Maybe we just had good luck on all of them?  I do normal adventures, not hard. Don't know if that makes a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Did another collection last weekend, this time it was collect 22.  We killed ALL BUT 2 MOBS in the dungeon to collect 22 ...</div></div><hr />

We just ran out of time and we were mowing right through mobs too. Started out real nice and we thought we were gonna do it then we went 37 without a drop on 25+ mobs.  We stayed to try and get the half points and in 30 mins got no drops.  I would say it's still bugged.  On the upside the named loot farming is still damn good and damn easy.</div></div><hr />

We had a 30 collection the other night.  We had two to go with 10 minutes to go.  We got the last item after time ran out after another 18 kills.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Damize</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Completed both of them well before the time limit.  First was a 21 collect, then 28 on the second.  Me, 49 warrior, 50 beastlord, 53 druid, 50 wizard and 55 monk puller (yay - Monk Power).  We didn't even have to clear half the dungeon for either one.  Seems almost too easy, but I'm not complaining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Olympe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Did a collect 30 in EC other night and with 6 left to get and 40mins on the clock we got a total of 2 in the next 35mins. We failed with 2 to get and our ranger told us there was only 6 mobs left.  Got the final 2 we needed in extra time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I've found, or at least theorize, that it is not the amount of things you have to collect.  It is rather the number of mobs in the dungeon.  Thus smaller dungeons have a higher success rate because they have fewer mobs.  The game is forced to putting the drops on mobs, instead of placing them where ever it randomly wants to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Stareff2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">4 great collects in a row, great looot and great drop rates, I have flown through 56 and am 57 now all in around7-8 adventures. Even the Augment Drops seem better. Love the this expansion it allows a guy like me who only has maybe 1-2 hours weedays to grind good xp and some decent loots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Cragas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">My typical hunting group is only 4 people, myself (61 shaman) and my 3 friends (61 ranger, 61 SK, 61 druid).<br />
<br />
Before the last patch that changed drop rates, we would win or lose collection missions by 5 minutes either way...either 85 minutes or 95 minutes to complete.  After the patch, we are finishing each collection with about 20 minutes to spare, and last night had a personal best of collecting 29 vampire fangs with 35 minutes to spare; we stayed in the extra half hour til it kicked us out, and we ended up with 39 frickin teeth!  So, the change is pretty dramatic, and if we can finish a mission with 30 minutes to spare with a group of 4 (although decently geared, AM2 ranger, and my shaman with Canni V), then better geared, full groups should finish in half the time.<br />
<br />
I will agree, the adventures are fun and give back that sense of crawling through a dungeon.  Money drops are pretty darn good too, between gems and opal bracelets and the like, and the augments and rares (we got two last night, Flesh Eater Belt and Bracer of Blood Rage, netted 4500pp overnight) really make the dungeons fun and profitable.<br />
<br />
My only slight problem is the exp.  Typically, in one adventure (usually 100 minutes), I will get about 45% of an AA; but my same group at the King in Droga would get closer to 80% in that same time.  But again, the augments, the money, and the points are nice in LDoN.  I finally was able to purcahse Anathema and it is really really nice, not a waste of points at all.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just input from a shaman on D Ro  :)</div></div><hr />
