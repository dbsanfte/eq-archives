<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, Veksar is a Kunark dungeon.  Kunark spell drops, in geneal, are super rare for the really needed stuff (not just shammy, either).  OK, well, so far, I've yet to see a spell drop in Veksar after hunting there on about 7 occassions and killed multiple named stuff.  Well, Nurga and Droga are now redone and my guess is the kunark spell drops will continue to be &quot;not on the list&quot; for these zones, as well.  If a zone, especially a dungeon zone, is 50+ and in Kunark, mobs there should have a chance to drop the Kunark spells.  Doesn't this make sense?!?!<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kunark shaman spells are meant to be brutally hard to attain, so much so that you'll want to just give up and level to 65 and get the far superior versions much easier and cheaper.  Supposedly Chardok B is dropping kunark spells (tho as rare as ever).  <br />
<br />
Unless you enjoy the pain of camping (gwurms in SF, emp in Seb), you may as well give up unless your server has an abundant supply of L60 shaman research items (mine doesn't).  I've yet to see words of retention or sapience for sale and the one time I've seen Yaet's 108 for sale (for malo), it was 10k- malos itself sells for 20k.<br />
<br />
Otm L65, Kunark spells are a joke.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I explored chardok b with 1 1/2 guild groups. In the 2 hours we were there we got 3x mala, 3x same BST spell (forgot the name), 2x banishment, 1x group CH from random trash mobs. May be 1 or 2 spells more but not a shaman spell. I guess you can get the kurnak spells there. And shaman spells will drops as much as from Emporer or guardian wurms.</div></div><hr />
