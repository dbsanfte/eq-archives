<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Back in the day, I used to group in Kael killing giants, so needless to say they hate me now.  But a few ToV raids later, I want to make nice with them so I can upgrade my armor.  Problem is I have spent ~30 hours killing tons of coldain, but giants still hate me.  I have hunted in SS, been on a Yeli raid, and even killed dain.  Still the giants hate me.  I have about 50 dwarf heads to turn in but can't get above KoS to use them.  Any advice on how to make these big lugs forget about the past and play nice?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember correctly, you can get pass the 'riff, either with Invis or with CoH. But you need non-KOS Tormax faction because a Tormax factionned MOB is standing right next to the Shaman questgiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Spend a day or two raiding West Wastes, just offer your services to a raid if you can't get a strong group to go with you.  I went from Max KoS to Zek (Thanks AoW hits :p) to Dubious in 6 hours of WW dragon slaughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Eh, I just did the 1 step, &quot;Let Jaradis PL your faction in WW&quot; program...  ;)<br />
<br />
But, with 50 heads, if you're non-KoS to Zek, you'll get...Roughly....A bit higher than dubious with King T.  Probly boost Riff to threatning or dubious, and Zek will be max ally after 24 heads....Not that I repeatedly F**ked my faction up and had to fix it so many times that I know these numbers/hits off by heart.  ;)<br />
<br />
Your best bet (I'm assuming your 55+) is to go to the Coldain mines.  You can get some decent exp, heads, and great hits, here.  Just be careful...They hit HARD, and the first pull is a pain when breaking the spawn.  I forget the exact loc of the mine, but follow the little stream from Thurgadin down, passed the Wurm caves, and you'll eventually find it.  Be warned, these Dorfs are VERY magic resistant, and slow will be a pain to land.  Also, they hit for 117-ish if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Good luck!  Giant faction is a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">rif doesnt matter, can turn in even if your kos with out any help.  cant do it solo unless you have good tmax though, youll have to get someone to tank a mob on riposte while you turn in, then evac out.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">&quot;how u know wich giant is on wich faction?&quot;<br />
<br />
The giants that have long beards are on Kromrif faction.<br />
The giants that have no beards and are in the green plate armor are Kromzek.<br />
King Tormax, his 2 guards, Dlammaz Stormslayer, Frozen Jesus, Keldor'del Torek, and one or two other giants in Tormax's throne room are on Tormax Faction.<br />
<br />
&quot;Atmo am dubious to some and indiff to other giants in kael. how many dorf heads to get to amiable?&quot;<br />
<br />
Each dwarf head given to Capt Bvellos in the bank gives +50 Kromzek +5 Kromriff +10 Tormax faction  (Riff and Tormax might be off slightly but the Kromzek is right).  Takes 27 heads to go from Dubious with Zek to ally.<br />
<br />
&quot;am aprrehensive to dorfs atmo  will one kil make me kos?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, a few kills will make you dubiuos, then threatening.  Just buy the heads if you want to keep Dwarf faction.<br />
<br />
&quot;its amiable kaction for the kael armour turn in right?&quot;<br />
<br />
No, you need Ally to Kromzek.  And at least dubious to King Tormax since our quest mob stands right next to a very mean Tormax faction giant.</div></div><hr />

I'll give an update on my progress since that post and share some thoughts on the process.<br />
<br />
Since that post, I've spent about 5 hours killing in WToV with my guild, 6 hours killing mobs in Skyshrine (mix of solo &amp; grouping).  Also, I've spent several hours of &quot;/auc WTB Coldain heads - 100pp / each&quot; and slaughtering every dwarf I see to farm heads.  I reached Dubious to Kromriff sometime during my last session in Skyshrine and since then I have turned in 36 heads to Captain Bvellos.  I am now ally to Kromriff and Kromzek factions but Tormax factioned giants still scowl at me.  At this point it's just a matter of acquiring enough heads to reach the dubious mark with Tormax - from what I've read I should be getting relatively close.<br />
<br />
Here's what I've learned during this process:<br />
<br />
To raise Kromriff faction, you have to kill LOTS of dwarves.  Once you're dubious to the 'riff, you can give 15 to 20 heads to the recruiter near EW to reach Ally faction with them.<br />
<br />
Raising Kromzek faction requires killing Skyshrine, WW or WToV mobs.  When raising faction, the more mobs you can kill / hour, the faster your faction will rise.  For this reason, I've come to prefer sacrificing exp &amp; loot in favor of fast kills by slaughtering the greenies near the WL side of Skyshrine (Don't bother with Enots and Kcor at the entry gate because they have huge amounts of HP and aren't worth the effort to kill).  I went from scowling to dubious in roughly 6 hours of faction hunting here.<br />
<br />
Tormax faction seems to be best raised by turning in heads.  You could try getting into a Dain raid (missed out on one last night by a few minutes :(), but unless you're trying to get your 'max faction beyond just non-KoS, it doesn't seem to be worth the effort.<br />
<br />
Anyway, good luck with your efforts - as has already been said, raising Kael faction is a bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was pretty deep KoS to Kael at one point..<br />
<br />
All I did was kill dwarves outside Thurg for probably less than 10 hours, and turn in the heads to Bvellos once I was non-kos, went ally with Zek / Rif.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bahimiron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Easy head farming:<br />
<br />
Go down into the dorf mines in GD. Invis past the guards. In the first room there are three dorf miners, probably green to just about anyone 50+. Use paralyzing earth to root each of them in place, then sic your epic on them. PE usually won't break before epic is done (sometimes it will, just stick it on again, these guys don't hit hard) and then lay on the JBones when the mobs run low on HP. Multiple dorf kills. Very easy.<br />
<br />
After the first room, then go hit the third room. Ignore the second room, as unless you want XP, the guards are /not/ worth your while. The greenies drop heads just as much as the blues. In the third room, there are three greenies on one side and on the other side are two greenies and one light blue who is as easy as any greenie. By the time you're done with these six little pricks, run back to the first room.<br />
<br />
Easy peasy Japanesy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/agree Bahi.  Been spending a lot of quality time in the mines.  Stopped counting at 100 heads + 28 paws to Bvellos, still KoS to Tormax.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">1 yeli kill, 60 paws, and 100ish heads to get dub with tormax for armor quests.<br />
<br />
Got my zek faction up duoing cubes, wyvrens, and wurms in skyshrine. Basically just start killing anything with wings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kelshir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know it might envolve ALOT of work if possible but can it be possible to have good faction with Coldain, Giants and CoV?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Getting Tormax faction is clearly very dangerous to your mental health.  I get strange tells regarding mass dorf decapitation and dorf head haikus from Uggok these days.  It's quite chilling.<br />
<br />
If you know any shaman trying to get Tormax faction to do armor quests, please, for your own safety, keep your distance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jendain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">After the first room, then go hit the third room.

<br />
The 5 greenies in that room are on 8 minute timer. I usually just set up camp there  and slaughter them as they spawn (yes you will have a bit of wait, but my main is a non-invis class so would have to feign off the guards every time i switch rooms ;) <br />
<br />
They drop heads at an excellent rate honestly. I was max scowling to all giants (not sure on Tommy but i think a few statue kills ruined that one pretty fast), tried hunting sentrys in icewell keep at first. they are blue at 60 and soloable for a monk unless they spawn as a dual wielder, then it becomes ugly sometimes. That was way too slow though.<br />
<br />
Go to the mines, kill greens to no end. When all your bags are full, turn in the heads (once dub to bvellos) and come back. Buy heads too when you can (some people kill dwarves in EW for xp, and sell the heads).<br />
<br />
Tormax faction is best fixed by Dain or Yelinak kills (only did Dain myself). I think 2 or 3 Dains took me from bottomed faction to threateningly with Tormax, at that point I decided I wanted to be a gianthugger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tritan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Well now I am still kos to the kromiff recruiter, but ally to Tormax.  Is that good enough, or am I still going to get beat on if I try to do a turn in?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Xatrei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The bare minimum faction that you need is:<br />
- Kromriff:  Scowling<br />
- Kromzek: Ally<br />
- Tormax:   Dubious<br />
<br />
you can invis past the kromriff giants along the way.  you have to be ally with kromzek to do the quest.  non-kos to tormax required since there are 2 of 'em within aggro range of the spiritweaver fellow.  as long as you meet or exceed these faction levels, you're fine.</div></div><hr />
