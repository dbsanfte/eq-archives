<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm hoping to meet at 7:45 PM Eastern in Warsliks Woods at the entrance to the cave (on the shore) and be in Dalnir by 8.  Dalnir has some great drops.  Everyone is invited, and the 50+ are encouraged to help :)  Hopefully I will get enough people interested this time, I don't think anything is planned for Friday so far!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tempeus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hello Yadilu,<br />
       You may remember me from Western Commonlands a few nights ago when you were playing tag with that Griffon. I am a RL friend of Razma and Venomblood, but not a member of the KOE (maybe someday).<br />
        Anyway, I would LOVE to bring my Iksar monk to this if its ok. The problem is he will only be level 26 or 27 by then. Too low? Even if all I did was tag along and learn the layout it could still help me alot.<br />
                          <br />
                               Tempeus Maximus</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmm..  Tempeus, yes, I remember you! Thanks for that help :)  I ran oom... anyway,  you can come if you want, but I would be very careful.  It's your choice.  I fought there around that level, but I was never able to get very far.  Just don't get too frustrated if you die :)  Someone messaged me that said he might get a level 50 cleric to go, so that would be very nice.  However, it's all still up in the air.<br />
I'm very glad to see so many people want to come!  Especially some 50+'s, that will help a lot.  I will need your help in organizing; heck, one of you might as well take the role as leader when we are there :)<br />
Anyone who has a question if you are too high or too low, I would come.  44 isn't too high, it's all for fun.  26 isn't too low in my opinion, you might just get hurt, a lot :)<br />
Looking forward to meeting everyone<br />
Oh, also, I have a 10 page paper due on Monday for school.  I have to work all Friday, but I am sure I will still be able to make this.  Just don't mind me if I'm 5 or 10 min late, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Caiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doh,  just looked at when this was scheduled for.   I work till 9pm cst.   Maybe i can catch up with you guys.  Dalnir is one of my favorite zones too.   Lots of good times in there.  Hopefully I can make it sometime</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It looks I will be able to go to this tonight. I will know when I get home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Dazzyll Mindbenderr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am not yet a member of KoE (working on it) :) but I will be there with my enchanter if needed. If short on healers or if druid would be better for mix I can bring Jaru instead.</div></div><hr />
