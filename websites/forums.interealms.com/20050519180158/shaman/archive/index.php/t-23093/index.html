<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When OOW goes live and you start to level up to 70, my fear is your going to have a lot less choices as to where to fight.  Has anyone seen this discussed or gave it any thought?  If tier 2 and/or 3 turn lb it will funnel a whole lot of players into a few zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I share your thougts on this.<br />
<br />
Im quite sure GoD zones will be easier to exp in for causal players once they lock a few levels under their belt. <br />
<br />
<br />
It would suck to see all the good PoP-zones to go unused like pretty much every other zone has become.<br />
<br />
Also refer to this thread for some discussion:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably the same problems we had when PoP came out and people were 'levelling out' of their favorite grind spots.<br />
<br />
Personally, I hope so.  Even if they don't touch anything there will still be practically 4 entire expansions to grind in (PoP, LDON, GoD, OoW)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tier 1 already has quite a few lt blues at 65, particularly PoJ and PoI.  BoT and PoTactics are about the only spots outside of Tower and elementals that will yield signicant exp outside of GoD.  <br />
<br />
So yeah, for good exp its either head to new zones or be ele flaged to get to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Next redesigned zone: Befallen!  Elemental level dungeon<br />
<br />
or they could add floor 8 of ToFS<br />
<br />
<br />
(hey it already requires keys)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scalia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If the 15 level dark blue range remains in force at 70, then any 55+ mobs will be still dark blue. That includes half of Droga, parts of PoN, some Veksar, etc, athough the XP is likely to be very poor there ar 70. Heck, even UP will be mostly dark blue :)<br />
<br />
More importantly, how many new zones will OoW have and what are the level ranges for them? How many are XP zones and how many are raid zones? Depending on the answers to these questions, the greening of our old hunting ground may or may not be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">OOW has like 5 zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LDoN Hards will become a solid xp source for many as they'll be much easier for normal geared people.  The increased levels will pretty much make it easy to get to KodTaz now which means solid xp for many people.  KT is full of level 63-67+ mobs with fairly fast respawn and lots of room.  Ikkinz Trials will be solid xp spots as well, as will Yxtta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ldon hards will scale up in level and still be hard and only mediocre xp at best if you dont need the points. Ikkinz is still a pain to access unless you have a few hours to burn. KT will be fully camped on most servers, other than the mobs you need a good puller to pull (which also take time to split). Only so many people can camp fire second castle.<br />
<br />
Vxed and Tipt (and Ikkinz I guess) will become the only viable XP sources outside OOW. OOW looks like it wont have that many zones, will have many instanced zones that are a poor excuse to not design more than 5 zones in an expansion. <br />
<br />
Lets hope our 5 zones dont look all the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can't be any worse than leveling thru 59 in Velks/Seb before PoP was released :P<br />
<br />
Ado</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ldon hards will scale up in level and still be hard and only mediocre xp at best if you dont need the points. Ikkinz <br />
<br />
You assume they will scale up.  I would not be surprised to see them NOT scale up intially and what you see with a group of 65 is what we'll see with a group of 70's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Whatever happened to the Plane of War?  Do we have a missing zone for PoP that we paid for?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The pathing and scripting in PoWar was horrid, so bad that they just scrapped it.   Originally from how I understand it, Tallon and Vallon Zek were in PoWar.   You got access to PoWar by killing MB.  PoWar had some large scale events to finish to gain access to Drunder (Tactics), which had its entrance in PoWar at that time.  When they canned PoWar they added the two hallways to either side and put Tallon and Vallon in Tactics.  They can't really add it back in now as the reason for it is gone (Tallon and Vallon).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gah... I am sure they can add it just for the other named mobs and for xp reasons. <br />
