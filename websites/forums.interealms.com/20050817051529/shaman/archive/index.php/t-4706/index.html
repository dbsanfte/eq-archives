<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I hate CT with a passion, but some of the loot is pretty ok.  Stumbled upon Tae Ew Spiritcaller Coif, and wanted to know, what's the look on it?  I had bought slime rubi helm, but honestly I feel embarassed wearing it, ugly chain graphic.  Plus the clickie-off bear illusion doesn't work anymore to take off the helm look :(</div></div><hr />

Chain Graphic.<br />
<br />
Looks like you have a lobster on your head.<br />
<br />
But I'd wear a burlap sack with a neon sign that says &quot;Loser&quot; if it had hitpoints.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I ended up wearing my scaled hierophant hat in preference over a rubi coif due to that thing being so horridly ugly too =)</div></div><hr />

Yeah but beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and most the beholders out there have models off :(</div></div><hr />

Damn I'd love to see that in game.<br />
<br />
A big raid with a bunch of people with bright loser signs on their burlap sacked heads.<br />
<br />
hehehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Agreed Ramhorn. That looks like an intentional jab at shaman from the genius who cooked that item up. Sometimes it really feels like someone at VI has a bug up thier ass about shaman.</div></div><hr />

Hmm lets see not CLERICS on it either. Obviously ment to be a melee peice not a caster peice. Yeah it happens deal with it. Not everything can be all/all.</div></div><hr />

The tank version of this is the AoW helm, right?  :)<br />
<br />
&quot;Weeeeee... I'm wearing a pink helmet!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Sorry, allmighty Taraddar.  Perhaps clerics don't have to be on things shamans could have, huh?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, allmighty Taraddar.  Perhaps clerics don't have to be on things shamans could have, huh? <br />
<br />
You sound like a little kid. I want it. I don't care if it doesn't make sense I want it anyway. You use the arguement that well rangers and rogues can wear it so it must be a chain peice so i should be able to wear it but ignore the fact that clerics can't wear it and they are a plate class and other plate classes can wear it and most non class specific chain items can be worn by plate classes as well.<br />
<br />
You want to try an justify being able to wear the mask because it's wearable by chain classes but seen no problem leaving clerics off even tho other plate classes can wear it? It's a plan case if I want it and i don't care if it makes sense that i can't wear it.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again. Not everyone can wear everything in game and that is going to be the way it's gonna be. Personally I would prefer less all/all gear with 200ac on it 20 to all stats 125hps/mana and 20 sv all on it. It makes getting the things a pain in the ass cause everyone and thier mother wants it and everyone feels they are the one that deserve it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used it as an example, not necessarily as I MUST have that.<br />
Not to make it an arguement, but how many plate class items do clerics get over us? Alot.  They are a plate class. <br />
<br />
I swear, people can't post opinions on this board anymore without some moron imposing heiarchy over others.   You having 1000+ posts and having better gear than me, means nothing.    Stop belittling people as if they were born yesterday.   I've been around since beta and seen and been through alot of stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>leoice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Btw, where does this drop?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Verata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ramhorn, the fact that he replied to your post in a cogent matter and made his point intellgently DOES matter though.<br />
<br />
Your point was that other chain classes can wear it, VI must be against us if we cant wear it.<br />
That item was meant for melees was his point, using the evidence that priest chain/plate classes were excluded, but melee chain/plate classes were included.<br />
<br />
It was a simple post, and you dont have to respond just to get the last word.</div></div><hr />
