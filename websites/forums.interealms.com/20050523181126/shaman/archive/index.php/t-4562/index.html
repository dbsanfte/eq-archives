<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does EQ use 100% of your processor too?<br />
<br />
I remember back before Luclin, it didn't.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes it does for me.<br />
<br />
It's frustrating because I can't listen to MP3s anymore without them skipping every damn time I cast cann4, or look around me. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes it does since I installed Luclin. And I have a pretty &quot;beefy&quot; machine too.<br />
1.6Ghz P4<br />
1024 DDR Ram<br />
40GB HD<br />
32 GeForce 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It uses most of the first one.  Dual CPU's &gt; Megahertz.  Back in the beginning I could get EQ to run on a Pentium 166, heh :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Seriously?<br />
I run win 98 on a PII 300 and only 256MB ram and can play MP3s in the background when im on EQ without a problem....<br />
<br />
Woot! one more reason to hold off upgrading...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah the MP3's stuttering on my box was really annoying, then I thought I'd try changing the Performance option from Programs to Background Services (Gives all programs equal processor time, Winamp doesn't stutter now).  Right-click My Computer, Click Properties, Click the Advanced tab, Click on Settings, Click the Advanced tab, under Processor Scheduling choose Background Services.<br />
<br />
I'd really like EQ to not eat my whole processor though..so reminds me of AOL.  :(  I mean my second box runs EQ pretty well with an 800mhz processor...the extra 1200mhz this box has doesn't seem to do much anything in making EQ more smooth.  Anyone know why VI makes me cry?</div></div><hr />

Good call, I'll try that. Nothing more irritating to me than be kinda subconsciously moving to the beat of the music and then it sloooowwwss down all of a sudden... it's abrasive :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Oogg.<br />
<br />
I've tried running Win2k and Xp with EQ.  I hated it.<br />
<br />
Win98SE has been the best gaming platform I've used and will continue to use it.<br />
<br />
Didn't mean to hijack :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they have it using 100 percent system resources in an attempt at cutting down on cheating.  It may not stop your good hacker and such from cheating in game, but it will stop your basic script kiddie from running a trainer to cause his character to be invincible, circa diablo 1.  If you played diablo 1 you know what I am talking about, you had to use the trainer to make it so other players that were invincible couldn't come in and kill you, it pretty much ruined the game.  This may be the reason, or it could be due to poor coding... not sure what to pick..:)</div></div><hr />

I bet that if you upgrade that video to 64 or 128 mg Ram card ... you'd see a major improvement in game play.   I've been playing with some of the Nvida card's ... 32 mg to 128.   64mg cards have gotten cheap nowadays.<br />
<br />
I've upgraded all my EQ game machines to at least 64mg cards (all nvida) ... 3x98SE and 2xXP.  The improvement on the older 98SE 500-600Mhz PC's with 64mg card's was very noticeable.   My XP 1.8Ghz PC's run WinAmp without fail while playing EQ ... one 128mg - one 64mg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Start eq up and leave it at the &quot;I accept&quot; screen.<br />
<br />
Ctrl + shift + escape to bring up task manager.<br />
<br />
Select processes tab.  <br />
<br />
Scroll down to eqgame.exe. <br />
<br />
Right click select &quot;Set Priority--&gt;Below Normal&quot;<br />
<br />
Click yes on the whiny warning messagebox that pops up.<br />
<br />
Your problem should be solved :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been playing EQ lately using the Below Normal Priority Process (thanks for that suggestion, works great) but had grown tired of manually setting it each time.  So I figured out how to do it through a batch file.<br />
<br />
Just make a .bat file and enter in this info, adjusting path names where necessary:<br />
<br />
Start /BELOWNORMAL C:\Progra~1\EQW\eqw.exe<br />
<br />
Yeah, I use EQW.  If you don't, you'll have to add a bunch more arguements to make it work (if it does..I dunno, tried it once but didn't work and I don't really care :p).  If you log on two accounts on the same pc, you'll probably want to change it or leave it at the Normal setting.<br />
<br />
Now I just double-click my shortcut to the batch file and off I am, with actual control over my computer again.  Outlook opens up mightily fast - the same as it would if I weren't playing EQ.  When I need to look up a map or check on my Guild message boards or any other thing, I don't have to cry because my PC doesn't sit there and act like an old sick dog anymore.  What a concept - multitasking is possible while playing Verant's &quot;Immersive&quot; game.  Hah, immersive - yeah cause people enjoy sitting on their ass staring at a boring screen waiting for their mana or hp to regenerate for 10 minutes.<br />
<br />
EQ can be engulfing, but I also like to be able to use my two thousand dollar pc in the manner in which IT was intended.  It just baffles me that VI won't officially let EQ play in a window.  Cause I'm sure that the average EQ player with over 100 days played hasn't had enough of that staring at the mana bar with nothing else to do.  /laugh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I run 2k on a p3 800, 256 ram.  I don't use new models because I'm not a masochist.  Have no problems w/ running mp3s in background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thanks for all the tips guys. I am sticking with WIN 98. I run EQW over a 28.8 dial-up and it's about 2/3 that I get decent frame rates on both accounts.<br />
<br />
Now I won't be raiding, but for normal exp grind I do ok.<br />
<br />
Sure wish I could figure out tho why I connect best at 31.2 kbs. I figure it's the crappy phone lines, the ISP, or my Modem isn't working as well as it should be.<br />
<br />
But it ain't broke - so sticking with this.<br />
<br />
(Don't ask me about my buddy who plays DAoC on 3 different puters running 3 different OS's: 98, ME and XP.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">eqw will solve this problem.  I listen to music, have AIM open, and surf several webpages at once while I play EQ at the very least.  If I turn off luclin models I can watch movies...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jilariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yeah but what OS do you use?  XP and EverQuest don't like each other too much~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">not all the time , but if im in a high detail area or whatever , then absolutly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Great info!</div></div><hr />
