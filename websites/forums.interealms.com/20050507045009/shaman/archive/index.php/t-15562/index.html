<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">with the advent of the ebayer out there.....<br />
<br />
<br />
the ones who have does it at least <br />
<br />
<br />
how do you put a price on a toon you have put 2+ years on?<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a serious question. I dont think I could ever sell mine. And If I ever ever ever did, how do you price it?<br />
<br />
/played? lol ~ you are getting screwed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Part of it is based off of the class.  I would think that another good thing is based off of how many other characters you have on the same account.  Of course, 6 other level 30 and below characters aren't going to matter too much.. but any character above 60 is def. good.  <br />
<br />
Next is equipment, keys and flags.  If I personally ever were to sell my shaman then I'd put our a hefty price for it.  Being keyed for ST, VT and Time...and having every PoP flag I should catch a pretty big price for it.  However, on the reverse side..  I would not want to buy someone like that cause for a few reasons.  First off... everyone on the server is going to know who you are/were once you buy the character.  Basically, if you go around advertising your newly bought character and PoTime flagged, then it's more than likely the top guilds are going to know that you aren't the original owner.  Now, you say that you TRs website and notice what they say about half of the people that attempt to join their guild.<br />
<br />
So, in order, I would say based of money:<br />
<br />
Class<br />
Level<br />
Alts and their level<br />
Equipment<br />
Flags<br />
Keys<br />
<br />
Basically, I would think that a shaman would be more valuable than say... a beastlord (based off of the desireability of needing a certain class in certain situations).  Next look at their level.  After that you can start to take into affect their equipment and stuff on down.<br />
<br />
I personally with the amount of time that I've spent on my character, would never give him up.. but if I had to then I would charge $1500 as a minimum.  This is just a little incentive to know that I really don't want to sell him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">so then, another question. Of the level 65 chars out there with maxed aa's and we'll say &quot;equal&quot; gear ~<br />
<br />
which one is the most expensive?<br />
<br />
The hardest to level?<br />
<br />
The rarest?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">chanter with maxed aa would go for a pretty penny if geared as nicely as he should be.<br />
<br />
cleric similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Foggy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well equipped high AA wizards also go for a lot<br />
<br />
I thought about selling my toon once when I stopped playing but couldnt bring myself to do it.  Silly really - is a lot of money for a couple of pixels.  Glad I didnt tho as my mates pestered me till I started playing again, much to my wifes delight :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt want my character played by anybody else. When I leave EQ, Rathelon fades from Norrath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bazza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I wouldnt want my character played by anybody else. When I leave EQ, Rathelon fades from Norrath.<br />
<br />
Couldent of said it better I played my tones for 2 years now and the fun was in the playing not the being level 65 with uber stuff and loads off AA it was playing to try and get the stuff.<br />
<br />
But on the other hand if some one wants to bye a level 65 epic mage wars and shaman for say $15000 I take it and start all over again. For $15000 bucks I could got to Australia for the rugby world cup and have I hell of a good time and still pay for EQ for the next 2years of what ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
By the way that’s a real price I would take not one cent less :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree.. I couldn't bring myself to sell Val ever.  <br />
<br />
But yeah, any higher level chanter with a decent amount of AAs and such should bring in the money.  A wizard with Fire flag, great equipment, all spells and high AAs can be golden tooo... since it's so easy for them to run out there and kite at the tables.. and make a killing doing it.  Hell.. I've been watching a bard friend of mine run out at the in zone, pull everything this side of the wall, and kite it while he uses his wizard to kill everyone of them.  Says that it takes about 15 - 20 min and rakes in the AAs like that.</div></div><hr />

They say the best PCs are sold on eBay (on eBay)<br />
They say there’s always Vex Thal folk on there (on eBay)<br />
But when your monk just pulled a train<br />
And runs it back and does not feign<br />
The glitter rubs right off and you’re nowhere (on eBay)<br />
<br />
They say your rep’s for sale as well on eBay (on eBay)<br />
But I hear lots of sold toons sing the blues (on eBay)<br />
‘Cause how ya gonna show you’re phat<br />
When you forgot to buy some plat?<br />
And all your bank’s got is some nodrop shoes (from eBay)<br />
<br />
Ha! The players just don’t last too long once eBayed (once eBayed)<br />
They make fools of themselves, you can see<br />
“I won’t be tashing,” the chanter says<br />
And it seems he’s afraid to mez<br />
Now all these mobs are aggroed right on me<br />
<br />
Can’t take another pickup group<br />
I’m gonna bail and fly the coop<br />
I wonder what a shaman gets on eBay? (on eBay)<br />
On eBay (on eBay)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Name change is only $50, I would definately invest in one before selling.  I would actually make that part of the auction, &quot;I will pay for a name change to the name of your choosing&quot; - and I'd change the name before handing over the account.<br />
<br />
I have about $600 invested in it with monthly fees and the expansions I've bought.  I'd consider just about anything over $1000 reasonable.<br />
<br />
One $10k offer and I'd be starting a new character tomorrow.</div></div><hr />

too bad that name change show's up on the name change site (unless your on legends most ofthe name changes dont get recorded their)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You know what?  I've seen way too many people who bought high-level-uber characters and themselves were ok sorts get into raiding guilds without a problem and continue on, almost as if they were the original!  Add a name change to that, and aside from nobody knowing who the hell you are, you have an almost-clean slate.  If you screw up someone's playing experience bad enough for it to make it to the server message board, your name change/ebay status will come out.  But otherwise, it shouldn't be an issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">to me, its just a game. If anyone was stupid enough to offer me 300.00 US for rath, I would sell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Who cares?  The point is that the name change signals a change in the person running the toon.  My friends would know it's not me, and that's what is important to me.  I wouldn't be trying to keep it a secret that I sold the toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">i can understand your veiw of the name change but some guilds treat ebayer's like crap ... and trust me ive seen it alot</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, the guild should check out a players ability, have a grace period to see if they know their SH1T. so it should matter if it's ebayed or not.<br />
<br />
either the person knows how to play their character or not, if it's the not, don't invite into guild.<br />
<br />
thats just jelousy on their part, they've gone thru the frustration of leveling their character, and along comes some ebay'd toon.<br />
<br />
i play shamen on 2 servers, what if i want a shaman on a server that a bunch of friends are on, but i don't wanna transfer one of my current toons. I'd probably buy an ebay shammy on my desired server. maybe i don't want to have to have my friends PL me, maybe i don't wanna spend the time to lvl him, maybe the one on ebay already has uber lewt.<br />
<br />
but yes, i would get the name changed<br />
<br />
i don't care if they are ebayed or not, but i will disk a playa that don't know how to handle his sh1t.<br />

I worked too hard and spent too many hours (all enjoyable) to just sell off to someone who would reap the benefits of my labour for $$.  Not $100, not $10k.  Good, bad or indifferent, Aikoiko's personality is mine.  I think peeps who know him would be able to tell if someone else was &quot;behind the wheel&quot;.<br />

I think Steelbear summed up nicely: <br />

Amen.  When I leave..... Aikoiko is no more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">lol... some of these people make me laugh.. 11k and i guarantee you my account is sold.. 11k and i will level any character on EQ for you and sell it.. damn i will solo a cleric to 65 for 11k.. why? because it will take a month to do(not the cleric soloing bit though) and 11k x 12 is uber phat lewts.  Or if you were really enterprising, 6 box it and sell them all!! like two months maybe for all 6 to hit 65? 11k x 6 x6 months uber phat lewts =D... but honestly though... no one will buy a character for 11k.. the most ever paid for a character was 12k for an asheron's call 2 character who was leader of some exp chain.  most for an EQ character was 5-6k i heard but not definite on that.  Characters these days go for 200-500 maybe.. most i've seen on sullon recently is 1k for a 65 good beastlord.  EQ has sucked the life outta you.. why not recoup some of it by selling your character? 1k goes a long way to hawaii =D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">100 bucks, if I knew was not going to be playing again, bam, sold. Stupid, stupid, stupid not to.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Hail,<br />
<br />
However much I've spent during the many years &amp; months of playing I've been paying for EQ would likely be how much I would charge.  I don't expect to do it anytime soon, though I foresee the Ebay market prices are going to start dropping as more and more people start selling.  The life arc of the game is definitely on the downswing in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I will never ever forget so many of the good times I have had, and if I can get all the money (which I considered well-spent) back, then my several years of playing experience become essentially FREE.  Can't beat that.<br />
<br />
I would also likely pay for a name change.  I would also notify my guild, former guilds, and my extensive friends list first in the hopes I could find a quality person to buy instead of a stranger. <br />
<br />
I'm very attached to Frekkels.  My only character above level 22, and the only one I care about.  If ALL the others were deleted today, I'd be miffed that the stuff they were holding was gone, but not about the character themselves.  When I leave the game, I'm leaving for good.  No coming back.  I'll part company with Frekkels for good, and probably frame a picture of her sig pic &amp; maybe make a Powerpoint collage of the 100+ screenshots I've taken while playing as souvenirs.  <br />
<br />
I used to think I would never ever (I haven't yet bought or sold a thing) use Ebay or Playerauctions, because I've always been against Ebayed characters in general.  But several hundred bucks is several hundred bucks, and that cash would do more for my family than some unused memory keeping Frek's identity pristine on SoE's harddrive would.<br />
<br />
All that said, I have no intentions of quitting any time soon!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

1) Original owner take-backs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">yah, that can happen.  All the original owner needs to do is provide the CD-keys to the CDs to SOE support, along with the information that he has been &quot;hacked&quot; and they'll reset passwords.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I still can not believe people are still taking about ebay when it comes to selling stuff from everquest.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What is important to me about my years spent playing everquest is not Jinheim.  It is the friendships that I have made, and the experiences that I have had while playing him.  If I were to sell him, the character would be gone, but those friendships and experiences would not.<br />
<br />
However, when/if I quit Everquest, I will be handing Jinheim over to my guild.  They are the ones who have given me almost all of the friends and fun I have had over the last 2 years (as well as my loot), and if anyone is going to use my character, it will be them.<br />
<br />
That being said, though, if someone offered me $11,000 for Jinheim, I'd say F my guild and he'd be gone.  That is a lot of money to a college student.</div></div><hr />

Yeah nobody actually sells on ebay, ebay is just a generic term.  Like saying kleenex to mean tissue, or coke to mean a cola, or xerox to mean a copy machine.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kehlai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Prices are definitely not what they should be given the original cost of the game + expansions + monthly payments for years + time spent.  If you want a reality check, take a peek at playerauctions.com.  It's pretty scary, 65 PoTime flagged, fully equipped ranger with over 300 AAs going for less than 800 USD.  (Can't remember which server, but this was just a week or two ago).  I think there's a short range of prices in which level 65 characters are being sold, since someone offered me $500 for mine, very ordinary gear, not even any ornate, two pieces from epic, only FT2 and 40something AAs at the time.  What it seems like is that 90% or so of the level 65 characters sold in this manner go for $300-700 American.  So that's your price range as I see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Bah.. well... that sucks...<br />
<br />
Oh well, the game's gotten boring since BoT is the pinnacle of what I can reach without an uber guild... and all the ones here don't play on my hours, or require 6+ hours per day.<br />
<br />
I have a job and friends dammit! SoE, make your game conform to me, dammit!<br />
<br />
That said... I might do it for $500... probably wouldn't be in too much of a rush though, I made Oko over a few years, and last night I made $70 IN TIPS ALONE at Red Robin... (Bus Boy =p).<br />
<br />
Go there, get the chicken strips with unlimited fries, you'll be happy =p. 1/3 of the meal cost goes to hiring people like us to make sure you're constantly getting everything and anything you need =p.</div></div><hr />
