<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MakuSoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is he supposed to despawn after giving in the Cudgel of Petitioner?   cause thats just what he did before i could give in the 3 skulls on during the MQ.  and what is his respawn time, anyone know?  does he despawn at night and spawn at morning or vice versa?  thanx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Um... he's not supposed to despawn at all as far as I know (therefore, no idea on respawn time.) <br />
 <br />
Either this is a bug, or part of some intentional change to the quest with the last patch (that likely isn't working as intended at any rate).  Probably a good idea to /petition it regardless :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rocket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the same boat - can't find Heirophant Oxyn for Skull Quest #1. I petitioned it (9/4/02) and got a 'clever' response to the effect that they could not comment on &quot;game features&quot;. I sent an e-mail to Sony about it as well. Strangely, one day later (9/5/02) Oxyn was there, but when I returned with the three skulls he disappeared again. Is the idea that he wanders the zone? None of the write-ups about this quest mention anything about finding Oxyn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, im ready to turn in to get my  iron cudgel of the seer now and he's not up,  sent a petition now waiting to see if it gets answered....   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wasn't around when I was passing by earlier today either, no idea where he went.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Think he may keep getting de-popped because of the Tyronnium ore exp sploit for the Greenmist (don't think this got fixed yet).  VI may also be trying to &quot;fix&quot; the MQ problem as well so that you need to actually do the quest to get your initial cudgel.<br />
<br />
Have talked to several GM's about the spawn and NONE would respawn him or explain why he dissapeared.  They did state that there was an issue and told me to /bug it tho :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah I had done the combine to get the Skull with a II and it dissapeared somehow? I found the roge shaman in FOB again and luckily had one extra mendglow clay.<br />
<br />
Went to turn in the two skulls and oxyn was gone again.. Guide said the same thing. Nothing they could do /bug it.... Yeah like that will do any good :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>MakuSoto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Skrem: from your post, you referred Oxyn twice... so you saw him twice?   if so, how long apart time-wise were the two times you saw him?    and by chance, do you remember his line when he poofed if you were around?     i have been tracking him down ever since the first time he depop'd on me,  been checking 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours from the time he depop'd.  been doing that the whole week and havent seen him since.    i mean... he depop'd at around 11-11:30pm  so i went to check on him 3 hours from that and then 6 hours from the original time then 12 hours and so forth...  but still no luck :(<br />
<br />
anyone know if he despawns after doing the first two quests he gives out  back then?  like back when the quest was broken and before it was broken?   Thanx!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Skrem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm I saw him many times.. After i did the wafer quest he didn't poof, I took awhile to find the baracuda in LOIO and was level 19 when I finally got around to getting it. Every time I went into the guild to buy spells he was there until after this most recent patch.. It was probably about a week apart that I saw him but as I say I was using my monk to PL my shaman in Kurns while he camped the fingered skeleton.. After I got the fingers we went to LOIO and got the skull with a I. But by then he was gone...<br />
<br />
He didn't poof on me he just wasn't there when I was ready to hand in the skulls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">He is despawned often on Fennin also.  There are 2 exploits associated with him.  The quest exploit and he can also be killed quite easily for good exp without even getting hit.  I'm assuming GM's are manually removing him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rocket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heirophant Oxyn was up last night (9/11 at 8:30 PM PST) on the Kane Bayle server. Handed in my three skulls and completed the 2nd skull quest!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">GM creepin around cabillis last night, I showed him that Oxyn wasnt up. Said that they had to kill some npc's, and that he hadnt repop'd yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">He is being killed along with a mob in the basement and the BL trainer.  Why is what i really want to know :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">any new news about his whereabouts?   anyone know if he's been fixed or is gettin fixed pretty soon?<br />
<br />
i'd really like  to get the next few cudgels i have the pieces for done,  would put me at the 6th and close to finishing the 7th.<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cath Hatethrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Today I petitioned the disappearance of Hierophant Oxyn on Erollisi Marr as well. The GM told me that Oxyn wasn't on track (meaning that not only was he not at his spawn point, but wasn't anywhere in the zone either) and /report'ed it for me.<br />
<br />
Strangely enough, I did see the Beastlord trainer walking around in the tunnel leading to the area just outside of the Warrior guild last night.<br />
<br />
The quest NPC exploit was fixed a few patches ago, so I can't think of any good reason why Oxyn is on vacation other than what was mentioned below.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Rocket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On the Kane Bayle server, he re-appeared around 9/5/02 and now I have sighted him consistently since 9/10/02 - in the front lobby of the Shaman temple / guild.  At least he was there when I checked four hours ago.  I did /petition twice, /bug once, and sent an e-mail about this (as I'm sure others did). I'm a newbie but it sounds like this is a server specific problem and may resolve for you with repeated 'harrassment'.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sebanis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The reason Oxyn is not there is because of an xp exploit in the Greenmist quest.<br />
<br />
The shadowknight in question will at one point have to hand Oxyn an item called 'a chunk of tynommium' Oxyn then hands this back to the shadowknight along with some instructions. The problem is, the shadowknight can continue giving Oxyn the tynommium and still recieve xp for it over and over and over....<br />
<br />
Anyways, from what I've heard this'll be fixed next patch, so don't sweat it. Have an iksar SK in my guild who just needs to do this bit to get his Greenmist and it is killing him to wait :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cath Hatethrone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oxyn repopped on EMarr last night after a server crashand is still up as of this post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Strik Niine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">i petitioned last night  9/20  on 7th hammer,    guide gave me the speal:   hierophant oxyn will be back soon   <br />
<br />
<br />
so i explained that its been well over a month since he's been gone and they said that a month ago, and asked why he was up on other servers but they wouldnt repop him on ours.  <br />
all i got in response to that was<br />
soon<br />
