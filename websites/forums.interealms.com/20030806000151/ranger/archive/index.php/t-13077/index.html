<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just something that really got under my skin yesterday, to the point where I logged off so I wouldn't risk biting someone's head off.<br />
<br />
My main is a 58 Ranger, my secondary (just about a second main) is a 52 Cleric.<br />
<br />
I had more than a dozen people ask me to log on my Cleric yesterday while I was trying to exp on my Ranger. One person asked me at least 3 times!!<br />
<br />
When I say no, I want experience on my Ranger, people react as if I were a moron!<br />
<br />
I KNOW my cleric can get a group almost anywhere she goes. That's part of why I am not going to exp her until my Ranger hits 60. <br />
<br />
I've set down a levelling goal for my ranger, to hit 60 before Christmas. Yeah, that's a month and a half, but I am a chronically slow leveller. 55 took me 3 months +. At 56 I cracked down...hit 57 in 2 weeks...hit 58 three weeks after that. This is, I think, a reasonable goal for me. Anyhow, this is off-topic.<br />
<br />
It just frustrates me to have a nice goal in mind only to be interrupted by the increasing requests to log my Cleric on....whenver I get frustrated because I can't find a group, that is the ONLY solution people offer. I am thinking of moving people who continuously suggest this to my no-rez list.<br />
<br />
Especially the Ranger who asks me to log my Cleric so HE can get exp in PoN....on his Ranger.<br />
<br />
RAWR!</div></div><hr />

In the end, though, I always have been, and always will be, a ranger at heart.  The alts are just something I do when I don't want to get started on a 3+ hour hunting session.  If I only have an hour to burn, I play my alts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been thinking of doing that, Taamar....but if I do, it would be me levelling myself. :)<br />
<br />
I just don't wanna throw another $50 to VI right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I know what you mean, alot of times when i log on my friends alt to rez my 56 ranger, im already in tell hell with the people wanting me to join their groups just in the time that it takes to rez him.  For that instance if feel wanted and important, but once i log the cler and start playin my ranger again the world of eq is lonely once again.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When you find that you want to be in a group asa  Ranger, it is easy. Go XP grind in some place like the Dreadlands. I regularly get four to five invites for groups when bored and wanting to be in a group and talk to someone. When not in a group, at your level, go fear kite Giant Anacondas in Jaggedpine. Not only is it satisfying (Not for me since they would eat me alive), but, it gets you the solitude you want. You just have to find people who have more brains than &quot;Warrior, and Rogue over everything&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I've been living with this for the last year and a half... or longer.  People all know you have a very essential class to this game, and a high level one to boot.  So they try getting you to play that character *JUST FOR THEM* all the time for their own gain.  No consideration for your play time.<br />
<br />
Best solutions are...<br />
A. Delete your character.<br />
B. Say you deleted your character.<br />
C. Say and act like your account was hacked, and something nasty happened to your cleric.<br />
D. Transfer your character, get another computer (I'm about finished doing this with my enchanter)<br />
E. Take up a hostile nature when asked to play your cleric and you don't want to.<br />
F. Charge people who ask you to play your cleric just to play it.<br />
<br />
It sucked in my last guild because they didn't have any enchanters... or rangers, actually.  I kept telling them that I wanted to play my ranger, but being the raid happy guild they were they kept saying &quot;We can't do anything without Chamcham!  Come on &lt;insert guild trip here&gt;&quot;.  And even after they got some enchanters... just to be on the safe side... they wanted me to play my enchanter, especially on new stuff.  But hey, they did let me get in on ranger drop randoms, instead of enchanter drop randoms.  Oh, oh wait, that doesn't work too well with no drop items (excluding quest items like Velious).<br />
<br />
But anyway, go for the kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Siriath, DL is all light blue or green to me and so are 98% of the animals in JP :) That happened back at 56.<br />
<br />
Zelgadis, the reason I posted the rant was because it pushed me into doing suggestion &quot;E&quot;. I blew up at at least three people that day.<br />
<br />
My guildmates know that if any of them get majorly fubared and need a rez while I'm online, I will run wherever to help them. The annoyance factor comes from wanting some exp on my ranger and people constantly asking me to group on my cleric. That night wasn't people asking for rezzes. It was people wanting me to play the wrong character.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking more of moving the cleric (now 53rd level because my fiance double-boxed it with his toon while I was at work on Friday) to my 2nd account and using it as a healbot so I can solo somewhere like velks (exp for me, silk threads for the cleric). I've had her heals hotkeyed since level 35 so it wouldn't take much work. I just really don't wanna throw VI any more money right now to split the account, so for the time being I will suffer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zelgadis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's a story from my general experiences, after I got away from my last guild.<br />
<br />
I was grouped in Fungus Grove, pulling lots, taking lots, getting lots of exp... grouped with my brother and people from his guild, and a RL friend.  They invite an enchanter from their guild in and suddenly we're killing slower (because the enchanter doesn't like us taking on and fighting multiple things at once, as she wants to mes them instead).  Later on the enchanter says &quot;Hmm, KEI just went.&quot;  and then looks at my brother and goes &quot;Hey, log on your enchanter and give me KEI.&quot; and I'm like &quot;Erm, that would be me.  I am my own being, and I won't log on my enchanter unless the cleric absolutely needs it.&quot;  Reason she thought my brother had the enchanter was because I left my account in his hands while I was away from EQ during the summer.<br />
<br />
Well, time goes on, and about every 2 minutes the enchanter repeats &quot;Hmm, sure wish I had KEI.&quot;, and after about an hour of this I say &quot;If you want me to get you KEI, you'll have to pay me some odd 100p.  You have no idea how much time and experience gain I loose by switching out characters and suiting your greedy needs.&quot; and the enchanter said &quot;Want some crackers and tissues?  How is that stick shoved up your ass?&quot;  Well when she said this I was about 10 seconds or less from camping out, and being that I was the group leader I gave her the boot.<br />
<br />
My brother and RL friend said they understood the problem, and another friend in the group known for quite a long time didn't argue with it either.  The other person was some friend of the enchanter, I think, but didn't start argueing about my decision either.  But a couple days later my brother told me that he was yelled at for not doing anything about it when I booted the enchanter out.  What a laugh.<br />
<br />
Turned out that the enchanter was owned by some lady in RL, but was played between her and her fiance, who both were supposedly known for their being jerks.  And that was pretty much proven the next time I had an encounter with them.  I was grouped up in Umbral Plains, and the same enchanter was grouped there, too.  I told her &quot;I don't need Clarity, I just need haste.  Don't worry.&quot; and her reply was &quot;My fiance said to buff you last!&quot; and ignored me for the next hour or two.  I guess when I finally got my haste buff the warrior or the shaman in the group bitched her out through tells.<br />
<br />
Quite unnecessary for the person or people playing the character to act, just because I don't enjoy losing time to fulfil their desires with an ability of their own class.  I would have left the group entirely if the enchanter hadn't shaped up, and my brother said he would have left with me if I did, too.  I'm glad thats all over.<br />
<br />
But anyway, thats one of my stories.  Can't log on my enchanter to buff once and log without getting a tell across the world asking me to join them in such and such.</div></div><hr />

And I still have to lead a guild. :D</div></div><hr />
