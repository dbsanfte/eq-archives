<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play on EMarr, and 3 of the last 4 days I've tried to get into an ldon dungeon I've gotten the red &quot;dungeon is too dangerous&quot; message.  Are people onother servers running into this problem or is it just EMarr?  (I know it's not just me because I always see tons of people yelling in the zones with the same problem)  We've tried going to different camps, but it seems like the instance limit applies to all camps.<br />
<br />
Note:  my normal playing time is from 9 until 11 or 12 EST.<br />
<br />
I didn't mind when this happened once a few days after the release, but 3 out of 4 days seems a bit rediculous.<br />
<br />
It's especially annoying for someone like me that has a limited playing time and has to spend time getting players to add to our normal 4 person group.  The nightly process of finding people, getting the adventure, casting buffs, and medding up normally takes about an hour.  So if we can't get into the dungeon the night is basically blown for me (since I can't play for hours and hours.)<br />
<br />
Anyway...just very annoyed and wondering if it's just my server/play schedule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This happened to me when I had just quit an adventure because a player decided to go to the store a third of the way in.... the group leader called the adventure off?!?!??! So, anyway, a group of guildies decided to do one and we grouped up and went to the same zone. We got a collection adventure and went to zone in. The message came up that it was too dangerous to zone in. We dropped the adventure and went back to get another, this time a kill x mobs, and returned to the zone in. We got in no problem. <br />
<br />
Based on this patheticly small sample of information we decided that although I was still in the time limit for the previous adventure I was not allowed to do the same adventure type as before.....<br />
<br />
As I said this was just our thoughts and we did not try and prove them. I would recommend either dropping the adventure and trying again in the same camp, or dropping the adventure, zoning to another camp and trying to pick a new one. Total time should be about 5 minutes attempting.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My experience with the &quot;red message&quot; was a group of guildies who left a raid (not in any sort of adventure) and headed out to do a DG adventure.  We grouped up, got the adventure, ran off to UG and couldn't get in.  We ran back, got another adventure, ran out to Inny (different zone in point) and couldn't zone in.<br />
<br />
I would have to say, based on my experience of 6 guild members who hadn't done an adventure for at least 3 hours, time limits for previous adventures are not causing this problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had that message when trying to get a lv55 char  into the same adventure as a bunch of 65s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well, it only took 4 minutes for my wonderful theory to be discounted.... :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in the middle of my discussion with a GM about an unrelated matter when we had this happen to our group, so I weaseled this question in after I *yay* got my poofed item back.  To paraphrase:<br />
<br />
&quot;This is a known issue, and being worked on.  You must cancel your current adventure and accept a new one.&quot;  Or... there's no point in standing around hoping it'll suddenly get less &quot;dangerous&quot; (like we did).  It won't.  Badly worded message, IMO.<br />
<br />
About as useful as a box of rocks, but it's likely the most information we're likely to get about it.  *chuckle*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">More conjecture, but in the past each server was not running on it's own &quot;server bank&quot;, same for zones. <br />
<br />
It's possible with the LDON instancing that there is shared computers to handle it, and they are being &quot;overloaded&quot; not just by your server but other servers that utilize it as well. Possibly why even if it looks like your adventures aren't too busy they may be in heavy use on another server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That won't fix it.  We all canceled the adventure, got a new one, same message.  We didn't try another camp, however.  By that time, people were grumpy and a couple of people wanted to go so I didn't try another adventure that night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the vast majority of cases it will fix it.  <br />
<br />
This sounds like the zone isn't being created properly for whatever reason.  Because if you get n adventure and are already at the zone in it will give you that message for a few seconds.  <br />
<br />
However, in these cases the message won't go away.  So you get a new adventure and in the vast majority of the cases you can start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hail,<br />
Well, it only took 4 minutes for my wonderful theory to be discounted.... :)<br />
<br />
I have a few theories of my own...<br />
1.  I'm thinking that maybe the NPC who gives out the missions may not be updating frequently enough.  Such that if you ask the Barbarian (Perlac?) Adventure Recruiter in EC for a mission, someone else may have either recently accepted (or maybe even rejected?) that same mission, which inadvertently locks that Adventure out as unavailable for a group.<br />
<br />
2. There are simply just a limited # of instances available &amp; once the limit is reached you have to wait until a spot opens up.  How those instances are broken down (by map or zone would be most likely, but I guess it could be by either mission type or theme) I'm not exactly sure of yet.  How busy those instances are determine whether you would be able to get an adventure for that specific map associated with your mission.<br />
<br />
I personally would much prefer a menu of options to choose from based on what's available from each NPC.  So a group set on just trying a Slaughter mission but didn't care about the theme could bounce around Wayfarer camps checking menus until they find one available.  Other groups prioritizing the theme (Rujarkian for Bane for example) and didn't care about the mission type could just grab anything available in EC so they could get started on their adventure.  Even better would be a more detailed window that would show how every instanced dungeon already active is faring.<br />
<br />
So your menu would look something like this:<br />
Adventurer tells you:<br />
Greeting Frekkels, perhaps you would like to help blahblablah:<br />
We need you in one of the following areas!<br />
South Ro:<br />
1.Rescue Gnome Maiden<br />
2.Rescue Goblin Spy<br />
3.Rescue Nice fello<br />
4.Slay Basher<br />
5.Slay BadOrc234<br />
6.Collect 29 War Trophies<br />
7.Collect 25 Goblin Teeth<br />
8.Collect 21 Orc fangs<br />
9.Slaughter 56<br />
(and so forth for each Rujarkian entry zone)<br />
<br />
The more detailed version of my idea would reveal something like this:<br />
There are some Adventurers already engaged in battling evil!  They are:<br />
N. Ro<br />
1. Rescue Mission (46 minutes)<br />
2. Collection (23/27 72 minutes)<br />
3. Slaughter (43/56 39 minutes)<br />
4. Slaughter (38/52 79 minutes)<br />
5. Slaughter (54/54 90+ minutes)<br />
6. Assassinate (69 minutes)<br />
7. Assassinate (23 minutes)<br />
(and so forth...)<br />
<br />
That way even if all of the types of missions you want are taken, you could at least get an idea of when the next might be available.  In my example, you could see that one group is powering through a slaughter mission and will probably be done in about 10-15 minutes, and that another other slaughter group isn't doing well and will probably take the full 2 hours trying to win partial points.  The third slaughter mission has won and is somewhere in their extra 30 minutes probably going after named or playing with chessts.<br />
<br />
I don't know how doable any of that is from a code perspective, but all the information seems like it would be readily available serverside.  If even just a simple menu option was given it would be much better.  <br />
<br />
I'm having fun despite the occasional delay in getting into an Adventure mission.  I've never been stopped more than twice in a row for a mission yet on E. Marr, though I have heard of horror stories from others.  (I play afternoons &amp; evenings EST as well.)<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

<br />
On Sunday we tried a different camp but that didn't help.  Of course, it could have just been bad luck.<br />
<br />
I guess next time we'll try getting a new adventure and maybe switching camps...  <br />

<br />
You need to be within seven levels of each other.  You must be level 58 to adventure with 65's.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on some other conversations I've had, it doesn't seem to be a problem unless you try and start between 9 and 10 or 11 to 11:30 EST.  (on Emarr)<br />
<br />
As to the expansion itself (once you get in), I think it's great and well worth the cost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've never had a problem, I play during prime times EST usually.  My 19 adventures might be too small a sample to have run across it maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>sunsetgirl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I had the same problem Wednesday night.  Our grp left N Ro went to another camp to get an adventure which took us to Oasis and still got the message.  All the GM could say is &quot;You must be bugged&quot;  Which is a load of crap because the whole grp had this problem.  Another person was told &quot;leave the adventure and try another one&quot;  which didn't work either.  Seems with more people buying LDoN and playing the more this red text of death keeps happening.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>herkybevo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I was told that there are a limited number of each type of instance/mission.  When one of them is full(usually the collect/assassinate ones), you will get that message.  I was told the Recruiter should not be handing out an instance/mission if it is full.  It is supposed to be addressed in the next patch(at least that is what I was told).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>frostpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">on both wed and thur night had this problem canceling the adventure didn;t help getting a new adventure in a new zone or in the same zone didn;t help so its just F##ked  :( <br />
and it wasn;t just me , kind of odd when BB and the other zones for ldon go  from 150+ to 10-20 peeps  :p stoopid soe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Ran into the same thing and we tried 3 different camps, EC, NRO and eventually got the dungeon to work in SRO.  Of course I was one win away from Bane at the time and kinda P.O.'d   :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>doqtir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Have only had this happen on one occasion (actually 2 adventures right in row) but camping out seemed to solve it for us. It sounds like zoning may or may not help also...</div></div><hr />
