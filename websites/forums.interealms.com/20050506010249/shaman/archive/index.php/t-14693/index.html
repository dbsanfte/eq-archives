<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ye gods I had a mess on my hands. My Ranger board was down for over a week, PM's weren't working, and no users could sign up.<br />
<br />
I think I finally fixed it all.. and everyone that messaged me or emailed me saying their verification email wasn't working, try to login now; it should be fixed.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the disruption, hopefully it's fine now!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for fixing them all. :) Adminning a board is tough, specially when you do it in your spare time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That's a relief... I tried everything I knew how to do to try to get to the forums and was really worried that the site had been retired.<br />
<br />
Good to see it has not faded away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Luvli</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thank you for the fix  :)   I felt lost staring at that &quot;Cannot find page&quot; screen! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think I finally fixed it all.. and everyone that messaged me or emailed me saying their verification email wasn't working, try to login now; it should be fixed.Yay!  Thanks Sunmoon, I sent you an email a couple days ago and see that the link to the Forums from the main Shaman site is still broken.<br />
<br />
I can finally participate on the boards.<br />
<br />
edit: Oops, nevermind about the link problem, looks like my proxy still had it cached, it IS fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sunmoon, you rock!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The link to the forums (both Shaman &amp; Rangers) are messed up.  From interealms.com, interealms.com/ranger &amp; interealms.com/shaman, the Forums link points to www.forums.interealms.com - not forums.interealms.com.  Figured it out once I finally read the error message. ;)</div></div><hr />
