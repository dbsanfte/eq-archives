<br />
ok.<br />
<br />
but presumely they could work out how effect the 50% one is and then work out how well a 7% one does?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sometimes, the best road is the high road.<br />
<br />
All I can say is that I have multiple sources telling me that the 7% is parsing around 4%.  When beta starts, I will certainly have more direct information.<br />
<br />
For me personally, I don't feel even the full 7% is acceptable, nor do I even feel damage mitigation is a road we should be pursuing.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation is a large part of what got Shaman into the mess they are in now.  If what they really wanted to do was roll back mob damage, they could simply roll Slow mitigation levels back.  Why create more variables in the balance equation by adding a different form of damage mitigation?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">A buff that provides a %avoidance gives Shaman something other slowers do not have and will be applicable to any fight regardless of whether the mob is fully slowable, mitigates, or is immune.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's a step in the right direction so Shaman bring something unique to a group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I disagree, but that is allowed.<br />
<br />
I would far prefer to see Shaman perform &quot;mitigation&quot; by more strongly increasing the damage generated by their party.<br />
<br />
In the overall act of balancing content within the current design template, it is desired that certain levels of mob damage are reached.  If it becomes apparent that those levels are not being reached regularly, then either the damage is increased substantially (GoD) or the amount of mitigation players are allowed to apply to a mob is decreased (hello Slow mitigation).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by x%&quot; as I understand it applies a modifier to the probability of being hit. So, if your chance of normally avoiding melee (as determined by the relative values of your avoidance and the mobs accuracy) is 50% for example, a 7% modifier would push it to 53.5%. It all depends on what you are parsing and how you present that data. You might say that it is a 3.5% increase based on swing strikes if you are mathematically superficial, but in this particular case the damage reduction would be 7%.<br />
<br />
Obviously the effects of this would be larger on a low accuracy mob than a high accuracy one, so when doing parsing you need to keep that in mind. There would be negligible damage reduction on a mob with enough accuracy to land 90% of its swings (it would change to 89.3% hits with the buff, or a 0.8% damage reduction), and a large effect on mobs that landed 10% of its swings (it would change to 3.7%,or a 63% damage reduction)<br />
<br />
I think that (correct me if this is not the case) the combat effects on the linked armor add directly to your avoidance and accuracy values, and these in turn affect the probability of hitting and being hit based on the relative values of your targets accuracy and avoidance. How that probability is calculated is an unknown though, so it is less obvious how those particular modifiers affect performance. &quot;Increase Chance to Avoid Melee by x%&quot; is much easier to understand. It is probably applied after the relative effects of accuracy/avoidance are calculated, whereas the bracer mods are applied before the calculation.<br />
<br />
At least, this is my understanding of how it works, I'm sure someone will correct me if it is not so ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The original use for slow mitigation was to generate a more even damage output from very high level mobs.  For example, a mob that quads for 1100 does it's full damage unslowed but only 25% of it's damage when fully slowed.  Basically, that mob is very tough *until* it is slowed.<br />
<br />
Enter: slow mitigation.  The next mob that quads for 800 but is only slowable to 50%.  It's damage is less than the 1100 quadder unslowed, but much higher once slowed, allowing the overall damage of the mob to be much higher.<br />
<br />
I remember the reasoning being specifically, to get around the &quot;insanely high dps we had mobs dishing out unslowed.&quot;<br />
<br />
While this practice was actually a pretty fun new tweak to larger encounters, it shouldn't have been applied to trash mobs nearly as much as it has been.<br />
<br />
I don't see an overall act of balancing content within any design template because there's just too large of a player spectrum to cover.  For example, GoD mobs hit so hard and mitigate slow so regularly because they are fighting elemental+ geared players mostly.  These mobs (and arguably the entire expansion) are not balanced versus a casual pickup group.<br />
<br />
If there is a way to balance content overall though, why would you want to limit Shaman to just affecting one dimension of the group by increasing damage generated?  I enjoy how Shaman can add direct damage, add indirect damage, cure damage, and prevent or mitigate damage.</div></div><hr />

One thing that I do think needs serious addressing is the /con system.  It flat out means nothing at L65.    <br />

<br />
You make an excellent point about the /con system being broke...but it's been broke for at least the last 3 expasions.  Remember when we were first breaking into PoP - mobs in PoD / PoN that were only lvl 49 - 51 but were hitting for 300+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Got to agree here in that dmg mitigation on buffs etc is not the way for shaman to go.<br />
<br />
Its all a matter of perception.<br />
<br />
Example.<br />
<br />
Mr lvl 65 &quot;uber leet dood&quot; tank is now taking 870 dmg per hit instead of 880.<br />
Now do you really think he cares ?<br />
As long as he gets healed he doesnt care.<br />
<br />
2nd Example.<br />
<br />
Mr lvl 65 &quot;uber leet dood&quot; tank is now hitting for 70 as swing instead of 60.<br />
Now do you think he cares ?<br />
You bet he ****ing does.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do a lot of groups take a Beast over a shaman as a shaman will mitigate more dmg than a beast.Because of his far superior dps.<br />
Yes i know by a beast being in the group the mob dies quicker so therefore more dmg is mitigated in this way but thats not how the vast majority of people look at it.<br />
<br />
What they should give us is buffs that up dmg output etc not ones that limit dmg taken.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wulfbane</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Speak for yourself. When I'm being hit (and I think this applies to most people) I'm far more concerned with how much damage I'm taking than I am with my dps. Remember, these buffs don't only apply to melee, they apply to everyone, so survive-ability for all is increased. If you are taking, say, 5% less damage, for practical purposes it is as if you had 5% more hp. I don't know of any 10k tank who would turn down what is effectively a 500hp upgrade under those circumstances. Do you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">For instance . . . our +avoidance makes encounters &quot;too easy&quot; and mobs are given strikethru to counter it. <br />
<br />
Strikethrough has nothing to do with avoidance. It allows blows to go through special defences, like parry, riposte, dodge etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't want to limit us to one dimension overall, I don't want to limit us at all.  What I do want is to not have apparent 'gains' taken back.<br />
<br />

<br />
Any change can be countered in such a way.  Up Shaman nuke damage so we are too high DPS and we might find that mobs are also upped with more hitpoints, or to do more damage.  Every gain is basically countered in this type of game because it must remain balanced.<br />
<br />
What about the mobs that don't have +strikethrough though?  The way SOE normally goes about zone design, some zones and encounters would have a high ability to counter such gains as +avoidance, while others would not.<br />
<br />
Silly, I know, but that is just the way it could happen.<br />
<br />
I agree and it's the same way the game has developed over the years.  GoD mob DPS is a direct result in countering the gains achieved by tanks with 2000+ AC and 10K+ hitpoints, damage classes doing 300+ DPS, etc.<br />
<br />

<br />
The con system as it is now is nothing more than something to get kinda giddy about on a raid :)  &quot;Ooooh a yellow!  I remember when those used to be scary!  yay!&quot; :)<br />
<br />
Example.<br />
<br />

Now do you think he cares ?<br />
You bet he ****ing does.<br />
<br />
Hitting for 70 versus 60 is almost a 17% increase in damage dealt.  However, being hit for 870 versus 880 is ~1.15% decrease.  Perhaps if the tank were to be hit for about 830 instead, a decrease of just about 5%.  I think that would be pretty noticable, especially after many players spend several AA's to get that type of mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">wow this thread is actualy become a good debate on what sort of affects would be better or we would like to see , which might actually be a good decussion to have, maybe we can ut forwrd the idea to the devs sudedor?<br />
i myself would agree that helping group do more damage is perferable over damage avoidance. but some avoidance wouldnt be a bad thing, but only if we dont get nerf directly or indirectly because of it. increase damage it seems doesnt get so worked up about as decrease in dmaage taken.<br />
<br />
therefore i would say group damage increase affect first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I understand exactly what strikethru does Tugela, and my point is still perfectly valid.<br />
<br />
We get one kind of mitigation given to us, and another is taken away.<br />
<br />
Parry and riposte are most certainly damage mitigation, and strikethru most certainly nullifies them.</div></div><hr />

Sorry the figures i used were purely plucked out of the air was only an example.<br />
<br />
<br />
Like i said its all a matter of perception<br />
<br />
DPS by players probably is seen as the number 1 important thing in game at this time.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Perception is the key, you're right.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation is, to most players, a very ethereal and cloudy concept.  Sure, they &quot;know&quot; that they have increased surviveability, but it doesn't show itself as easily.  Different mobs hit for different amounts and so no one really &quot;knows&quot; what they get hit for.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, damage given is a very known quantity.  Regardless of the mob, players know what their maximum hit is.  If they see that number increase, it's a very real and noticeable thing to them.  It's not cloudy or feely or anything like that.  &quot;I was hitting for 350, now I'm hitting for 400.&quot;<br />
<br />
Let's say that Class A increased their group damage mitigation by 20%.  Class B increased their group max hit (and damage overall) by 15%.  I guarantee you that Class B will quickly become the preferred class.  Class A is statistically superior, but Class B is something players can measure without a parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Zann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I agree with what you are trying to say Sudedor, however taken that the more recent content is about speed, the increased DPS of 'Class B' would be more preferable even if example you had given comparing 'Class A' to 'Class B' was common knowledge.<br />
<br />
Both LDoN &amp; GoD seem to be about putting mobs down in seconds rather than minutes, so mitigation means little if you cant quickly kill a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Actually, it's the opposite.<br />
<br />
Damage mitigation means little if you can quickly kill a mob.  Damage mitigation means a lot more the longer the mob stays alive.<br />
<br />
In my example above for instance, increased DPS of 15% can still be considered mitigation.  The mob dies 15% faster . . . a mob that formerly died in 50 seconds now dies in 43 seconds . . . so you've got seven seconds of 100% damage mitigation.<br />
<br />
Both of my example classes offer damage mitigation, however, the DPS increase is something players can point to and say &quot;this is what the class brought to our group&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yes, but you are thinking only in terms of the effects on healing the MT. A damage mitigation buff applies to all mobs in camp, not just the one the MT is on. If you have a bad pull, adds or one of those one in a hundred bad situations, the ability of people to survive is far more important than the dps they are doing.<br />
<br />
The other point to note is that the &quot;mitigation&quot; afforded by a defensive buff such as this will scale with mob dps, whereas the &quot;mitigation&quot; afforded by offensive buffs will scale with PC dps. That means that the defensive buff would be far superior in situations where a mob might actually kill the MT, since the probability of that happening is directly related to mob dps. This is the reason warriors use defensive discs when tanking large targets rather than offensive discs.<br />
<br />
In any case the point is moot since other buffs have damage enhancers on them. The buff in question is the AGI buff with its increase in chance to avoid melee modifier. It seems reasonable to me that they should put a defensive modifier on a buff that is supposed to be defensive in nature. Are you suggesting that they should remove it and leave it as a straight AGI buff?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I am suggesting nothing of the sort.<br />
<br />
I am saying that regardless of what this AGI buff brings in terms of damage mitigation, it won't help Shaman desireability in a group setting even half as much as a lesser ability to improve damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I hate to say this, and will likely burn in hell for it, but I agree with Tugela on this point ...<br />

I like the idea of a NOTICABLE damage mitigation (fastish cast, low recast, short duration) buff on 3 counts.<br />
1) no resists<br />
2) really, shaman CAN barely heal in an ideal group with single pulls and a well geared MA.  What shaman NEED is the ability to heal in situations where things do not go to plan, or where the party is rushed to complete goals on time, or the group doesn't have one member of the holy trinity, or a bard.<br />
3) DPS is already pretty obscene and content is timed based on current DPS values.  A mitigation buff can be a unique shaman spell and help keep parties succeed while not altering the timing to existing content (two points really, one is the potential uniqueness of this spell, the second is the impact on content).<br />
<br />
I understand an like Sud's suggestion, but anyone but a shaman can bring DPS to the group, but damage mitigation should the primary value of the shaman class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I agree Tar, damage mitigation is important . . . but it isn't going to turn the class around like a damage increaser will.<br />
<br />
Apparently we are getting both in OoW.  Perhaps the combination of the two will be noticeable enough to start netting us some groups.  I don't know.<br />
<br />
I do know that DPS increase is far more noticeable than damage mitigated, and that people want a noticeable difference from each member of the group.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes i agree 100% but unfortunately thats not the way people in EQ think.<br />
On a  fully slowable mob we ALREADY mitigate more damage than a chanter or beastlord but still people will pick Beast or if DC mobs about a Chanter.<br />
Why ?<br />
Because of the superior dps.<br />
<br />
Another example is how many people wont do a normal LDoN without a cleric or at the very least a Drood healer.<br />
Lots.<br />
Why ?<br />
Because people PERCEIVE that without 1 of these 2 classes its not gonna work.<br />
