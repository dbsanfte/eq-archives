<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jlumpkins</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I looked through fort in loio but did not see him. Does he spawn in a particular area of fort or is it a random spawn? Just wanted to know before I camped it 3 hours like I did in the crypt of Dalnir only to find out I was in wrong room. (live and learn) Any input would be appreciated. Much thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Kill, kill kill every sarnak you can. Took me 3 hours to get one to spawn, not to find one but just to have one spawn i had a ranger with me so i KNEW the second he spawned. What was wierd is i remember alot more of them being around year ago when i was LOIO lvl fighting...but it will spawn, random can be in throne room hallway just gotta kill till you find it. Bruiser is a gimp youll be done with that part of teh quest 5mins after you get the helm =p.</div></div><hr />
