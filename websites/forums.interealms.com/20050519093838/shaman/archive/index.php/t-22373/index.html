Does he actually say anything? Except the usual: We are the best coder in the world, watch out here we come? Rofl.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You would think that with the aformentioned DOZENS of playstyles. (Dun.... Dun... DUNN!) they could cater for more than raiders?<br />
<br />
I sure hope they can. And while they are at it. run some of these dozens of playstyles through comparisons with the holy trinity and then some non standard groups.<br />

Sorry feeling a bit cynical this morning.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hello everyone,<br />
<br />
 I've been back on the team for about a month now and I can honestly say that I've never seen so much going on at one time.  Brenlo and Rytan had organized a quintuple elimination table tennis tournament while the rest of the EQLive team were smashing C2 cans on their head and holding a belching contest. As I'm sure you can tell from our recent updates and announcements, the Design Team has been working overtime to make changes based on the excellent feedback we've received from all of you. We're proud to announce that we have finally come up with a finished response to you, our customers from our old &quot;we're looking into it&quot;(the proud descendant of &quot;working as intended!&quot;)! Prepare yourselves for: &quot;We're testing the code, it will go live sometime soon(insert fine print defining soon as up to 5 years)!&quot; Many of your ideas and concerns have been factored into our plans for both the Live game and the development of the Omens of War expansion(also known as &quot;we wanted twice the money so we split up one expansion into two&quot;). <br />
<br />
 As you may have noticed from Cory Rohlfs' post last week, the Omens of War expansion is definitely benefiting aesthetically from our recent engine changes(and hopefully we'll fix the bugs we are currently having with characters randomly flying through the ceilings soon!).  On the Design side we hope to complement those advances with content that's benefited from the lessons we've learned from our earlier expansions(meaning introduce broken quests and new spells that will hopefully turn even more classes obsolete!).  Making new content that is compelling, fresh, and capable of catering to the dozens of play-styles that our hundreds of thousands of friends and customers(hos) fall into is challenging... and exciting... and why we're here(to take their money and laugh all the way to the bank).<br />
<br />
 When I see all of the hard work that's being poured into the game (by the beta teste...er players!) the Live changes(suggestions from players only a couple of years old); Epic creation(you know, from kunark); Omens content(well, GoD)  right now, I can't help but be excited.  As developers, players, and as an industry, we're living in some of the most exciting times in gaming(where we can constantly screw up, abuse our customer base, and STILL get paid).  There are bound to be missteps, skeptical jaunts into the unknown(especially with that zero g bug i mentioned earlier), and thrilling victories for all of us(when I say us, keep in mind I mean &quot;us the dev team who are shafting you suckers&quot;).  It wouldn't be an adventure if there weren't.<br />
<br />
 Thank you for playing and thank you even more for listening to me blather on.  It's great to be back in such excellent company(and I missed the table tennis tournaments!).  I think I can speak for the team when I say that we all look forward to seeing You in game, in beta(one and the same you know, wink wink nudge nudge), and eventually in Omens of War(the expansion you payed for with GoD but didn't get!).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My interpretation;<br />
Do not hesitate to buy OoW. Dev team prove their policy was turned back untill PoP by calling back their lead designer. Please give your money to SoE without thinking. <br />
<br />
BtW, it sounds everything is ok now and what we do is only to wait for OoW?<br />
What a wonderfull world!<br />
<br />
sorry... I am too sarcastic.....<br />
<br />
Prob OoW will be better for everyone and I should say welcome back to Shawn.</div></div><hr />

Shawn Lord appears to be one of them. On the surface, I agree with Vigdis. Let's hope they're not empty words when it comes to Shaman.<br />
