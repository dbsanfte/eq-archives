<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry if you've seen this before, I havent, so grats me on last week. I had tears in my eyes I thought it was so funny. No idea who the original source is, wish I could credit them.<br />
<br />
There are approximately two billion children (persons under 1 in the <br />
world. However, since Santa does not visit children of Muslim, Hindu, <br />
Jewish or Buddhist (except maybe in Japan) religions, this reduces the <br />
workload for Christmas night to 15% of the total, or 378 million <br />
(according to the Population Reference Bureau). At an average census) <br />
rate <br />
of 3.5 children per household, that comes to 108 million homes, <br />
presuming <br />
that there is at least one good child in each.   Santa has about 31 <br />
hours of <br />
Christmas to work with, thanks to the   different time zones and the <br />
rotation of the earth, assuming he travels   east to west (which seems <br />
logical). This works out to 967.7 visits per   second. This is to say <br />
that <br />
for each Christian household with a good   child, Santa has around <br />
1/1000th <br />
of a second to park the sleigh, hop out,   jump down the chimney, fill <br />
the <br />
stockings, distribute the remaining   presents under the tree, eat <br />
whatever <br />
snacks have been left for him, get   back up the chimney, jump into the <br />
sleigh and get on to the next house. <br />
 <br />
Assuming that each of these 108 million stops is evenly distributed <br />
around  the earth (which, of course, we know to be false, but will <br />
accept <br />
for the   purposes of our calculations), we are now talking about 0.78 <br />
miles <br />
per   household; a total trip of 75.5 million miles, not counting <br />
bathroom <br />
stops  or breaks. This means Santa's sleigh is moving at 650 miles per <br />
second--3,000 times the speed of sound. For purposes of comparison, the <br />
fastest man-made vehicle, the Ulysses space probe, moves at a poky 27.4 <br />
miles per second, and a conventional reindeer can run (at best) 15 miles <br />
per hour.   The payload of the sleigh adds another interesting element. <br />
Assuming that   each child gets nothing more than a medium sized Lego <br />
set <br />
(two pounds),   the sleigh is carrying over 500 thousand tons, not <br />
counting <br />
Santa himself. <br />
 <br />
On land, a conventional reindeer can pull no more than 300 pounds. Even <br />
granting that the &quot;flying&quot; reindeer could pull ten times the normal <br />
amount, the job can't be done with eight or even nine of them-Santa <br />
would <br />
need 360,000 of them. This increases the payload, not counting the <br />
weight <br />
of the sleigh, another 54,000 tons, or roughly seven times the weight of <br />
the Queen Elizabeth (the ship, not the monarch).   600,000 tons <br />
travelling <br />
at 650 miles per second creates enormous air   resistance-this would <br />
heat up <br />
the reindeer in the same fashion as a   spacecraft re-entering the <br />
earth's <br />
atmosphere. The lead pair of reindeer   would absorb 14.3 quintillion <br />
joules <br />
of energy per second each. In short,   they would burst into flames <br />
almost <br />
instantaneously, exposing the reindeer  behind them and creating <br />
deafening <br />
sonic booms in their wake. <br />
 <br />
The entire   reindeer team would be vaporized within 4.26 thousandths of <br />
a <br />
second, or   right about the time Santa reached the fifth house on his <br />
trip. <br />
Not that it matters, however, since Santa, as a result of accelerating <br />
from a dead stop to 650 mps. in .001 seconds, would be subjected to <br />
acceleration forces of 17,500 g's. A 250 pound Santa (which seems <br />
ludicrously slim) would be pinned to the back of the sleigh by 4,315,015 <br />
pounds of force, instantly crushing his bones and organs and reducing <br />
him <br />
to a quivering blob of pink goo. <br />
 <br />
Therefore, if Santa did exist, he's dead now. <br />
 <br />
Merry Christmas Everybody...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have emperical proof!<br />
<br />
Check under your Christmas tree this year, got any presents that say they are from &quot;Santa&quot;?<br />
<br />
Yep.  If he doesn't exist, why are there presents under your tree with his name on this?<br />
<br />
Talk to the hand!</div></div><hr />
