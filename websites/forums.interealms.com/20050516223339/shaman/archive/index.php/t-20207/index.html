<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Niknak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you've all heard this before.  I just wanted to rant briefly.<br />
<br />
On one hand I understand what he was trying to do, on the other hand it was pretty frustrating:<br />
<br />
I'm in a BoT group and we're prepping to pull the named, and the warrior tells me in group 'slow him ok'.  I say I will try to slow him, but from experience he is very resistant.  Thankfully the warrior reminded me that I should 'just malo' him and slow will land.  What kind of Shaman does he think I am?<br />
<br />
<br />
Then I think of the beastlord that was in group, and claimed not to have shrink or invis, and so had to be babied all the way to camp, and had to have him and his warder shrunk repeatedly during the grouping session.  At least he knew what auto attack, pet attack, and beast crack were.<br />
<br />
I'm then reminded the the night previous where a tank asked me as we were prepping for an LDoN 'gimme strength and don't tell me it doesn't stack or I'll kill you'.  (Diaku)  Apparently he had some bad encounters with Shaman.<br />
<br />
I was so happy when I hit 65 because I felt like by far most of the people would know what they are doing.  I suppose that is the case, and it makes it all the more offensive to me to be put into group with someone that doesn't have a firm grasp on their class when they're grouping in some place like BoT and are level 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My favorite is when I call &quot;oom&quot; (doesn't happen often but it does happen - usually after a bad pull) and someone sagely tells me to &quot;canni&quot;. LOL.. I mean, come on. Anyone in my group for more than five minutes will be drowned in &quot;Donar winces.&quot; spam so it's almost insulting to be told to do so. Even if they have spell emotes turned off, the rising and falling of my hp meter should give them a clue. LOL</div></div><hr />

Raid of idiots?..who knows<br />
<br />
Raids = more buffs, maybe AGI is the one to be left out.  In groups, I always do agility. It increases AC, whatever you say after that, it doesn't matter.  If you had two pieces of armour with the same stats, but one had 10 more AC, which would you pick?  I couldn't care less, but if you aren't putting Agility on them when there is an open buff slot, you aren't doing your best, no matter how little it helps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
False!<br />
It is better to go with fewer buffs than max buffs.<br />
<br />
Say for instance in a LDON adventure where you don't have someone who can single pull, or any form of cc other than root.<br />
And a buncha casters are pulled..  one outcome could be: they fill up the remaining buff slots with their spells you kill them, then cure/wait for the spell effects to wear off.<br />
<br />
Or you chose to fill everyone up with ****ty buffs that don't help at all, and instead now that you gave that tank a whopping ac10 more with agi.. tash overwrites his virtue, cause his buff box is full.. and then root takes off focus.. oh lookey goodbye brells, replaced by tigir's!! <br />
<br />
You just cost your tank 2279hp 72ac, and your group at least 1850 mana.. because you thought agi was a worthwhile buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">um... I get your point, but you are being a little over dramatic.  Last I checked, Agility was still only one slot, so it wouldn't be responsible for focus or brells dropping =D<br />
<br />
But I agree with the general gist that throwing on useless buffs (WHEN you are somewhat close to filling your buff slots) is more detrimental than it is good.<br />
<br />
However I would like to think that if a tank notices his/her buff slots are rather full, he/she would be smart enough to either clear the useless buffs immediately, or clear one or two when some detrimental spells fill their last empty slots.  Believe it or not, but melees can actually think for themselves, and determine if they don't need a particular buff *gasp*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Whichever piece looked better on me of course!<br />

<br />
Well I figure if he wastes time with agi, he probably does with acumen, talisman of tribunal (when not fighting disease/poison casting mobs etc), and other useless buffs.<br />
<br />
Lets make a petition to SoE to make agi take up 15 buff slots.. that way nobody will ever want it again!! :) :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh and relying on tanks to decide which buffs they do and don't need.. bah.. most pickup tanks you get think they need everybuff in the game, on them at all times :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I cast Talisman of the Wrulan on every group I do. When someone dies, on the rebuff I cast Agility of the Wrulan. If someone doesn't want it, for whatever reason, they may click it off. I also cast Talisman of the Tribunal, but only when asked (normally on an LDON pickup group, which I get *very* rarely). I cast Acumen of Dar Khura when I need a quickie group see invis. If a tank wishes every buff I have cast on him all the time, he may wait until I have mana. If he insists, he may decide between a slowed mob and waiting for one moment. When asked, I cast FA. It's part of the job, to me. But you must keep in mind ... as I said in another thread ... my EQ is different than the EQ of an end-game someone whose stats unbuffed are nearly maxxed. *shrug*<br />
<br />
I do not complain about buffing, even when it's haste. It's just mana -- mana I can regen at the click of a button. I cast whatever I can to help the group. You can argue to me all day about AGI and it's usefulness, but I will still stand and say ... &quot;if I'm helping one group member out with it, then I'm helping the group as a whole. Hush, and kill some mobs.&quot;<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yeah but the mistake you are making is that that agi is helping the group.<br />
<br />
That agi is actually worse for the group. Yes if you just blew a load of mana on agi, and suddenly get that horrible pull that so frequently happens in LDON. And I know you, and any other shaman who LDON's knows that some mobs in LDON just randomly suck for resists. Even with malo they resist slow.<br />
<br />
That 10ac from agi isn't going to save ****.. chances are if there are alot of mobs you'll be trying to slow some of them.. and thus getting beat on by at least one, and if it's not slow.. canny v is not a very viable option, as dropping to low health fast has a good chance of agro'ing all the other mobs on your group. And you are now dead, and your group is screwed fighting a buncha mobs, some slowed some not. <br />
<br />
Now had you not wasted mana on useless buffs.. you'd of had more mana for slowing and malo'ing. Cause remember canny is not always an option.<br />
Yes mana is available at a click of a button.. but that click of a button my also attract alot of unwatned attention, and send you to bind point mighty quick.</div></div><hr />

IF your tank, or any of your group members are dumb enough to run around with more than 11-13 buffs then they deserve to have their Virtue drop.<br />
I always buff the group with Agility, Stamina, Tribunal, Focus and Regen....Daiku, Bih'Li, Acumen (for See Invis or Ultravision) and other resists on request or as the party needs. You all know if you DONT buff with a given buff, you will hear about it from some group member. And I always say in group and in tells to melee that I dont know that they can click off what they dont want and if they expect Ferine Avatar to make sure they have room for it and HoT or debuffs.<br />
In general this isnt a problem, Rangers with their scads of self buffs tend to be the ones that most often dont pay any attention to me but when they hear FA is available were clearing up their drool and they pay attention.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is his fault, just like it would be his fault for having Virtue/9/Symbol in his first buff slot...often people use agility as a crap buff slot or a buffer for dispelling, its what I use it for, along with a Gobbie Earring, SoW boots (when outside) and Shrew while inside.<br />
Buff management is a key ability for raiding guilds (it was back when I raided in the Velious era), 3-4 Junk buffs were a necessity vs ToV's general population and named. It should be a key ability for all level 65s. If you havent learned at level 65 that you need to have buff slots open, and should have them buffered by junk buffs then your a sad level 65.<br />
Just cause you buffed it doesnt mean they have to keep it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just cause you buffed it doesnt mean they have to keep it.<br />

And then fail the adventure? Or tank dies due to lower HPs and AC, then you rez him, and don't buff him at all? Or what do you suggest?<br />
I am baffled ...<br />

<br />
I had one monk begging me for SoW, I told him I just cast Bih'li and he says, &quot;But I need sow to pull noob!&quot;  <br />
<br />
I always get the people who tell me to use a mala spell if I'm getting resists on slow.  One time a cleric told me this over and over.  So I got pissed enough that every time the tank got low on health I &quot;suggested&quot; using CH.  He got the message.</div></div><hr />

Such drama over a simple little buff!  I buff Wrulan on the group if someone wants it -- it's an expendible buff, but if for some reason we don't have full buff bars, even 10 AC is better than nothing.  I buff Diaku if asked -- it's usually the wizard who is convinced that the dex helps her land more crits.  I don't take the time to argue with her.  It makes her happy; I cast it.  I cast charisma on the warriors who ask.  I don't know if it actually makes a difference, but they think it does.  One who asks is one of the best tanks on our server.  It makes him happy; I cast it.  One warrior loves me because I know he likes Diaku and I always make sure he has it.  I cast Acumen for the Humans, Barbs and Erudites who don't have any vision enhancing gear.  The people I group with are smart enough to recognize which of their buffs are expendible and make sure they have enough buff slots open to recieve HOT and FA if they're a melee.  If a junk buff drops and they want it refreshed, they wait until it's a good moment for me to do so, and they wait.  Personally, I'm happy to do all of this - it increases my perceived value to the the people I play with and I have no trouble finding groups.  If I consider a request a bit eccentric, I fulfill it with a smile at a convenient time and move on.<br />
<br />
Personally, I have more trouble with bard songs filling the available buff slots and bouncing my HOTs and FA.  And I've NEVER had anyone blame me for their Virtue being over-written.  The people I play with, even in pick-up groups, are intelligent enough to know when to take responsibility for themselves.</div></div><hr />

Agreed.<br />
<br />
I like to group with regulars but I do tons of pickup groups and generally have good experiences.<br />
<br />
For every clueless noob I've grouped with there's been some uber who thinks they're god's gift to EQ, never **** about their gear and AA, congratulate themselves for performing their basic class roles, and are so generally annoying that it leaves you wishing they were a noob.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Lunira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I cast agility frequently, but only actually think it's important when I need it to cross an AC threshold - for example, if I'm at 1495 AC, I'll snag an AGI buff to push me over, and recently, It's been helping my shaman go over 1000 AC.  I may be superstitious, but I think that you do see added benefits when you cross lines like that on AC.  <br />
<br />
And the first buff I click off as a tank is Acumen.  HATE that spell and with my shaman at 60, I still can't understand why some shaman include it in their regular buff line up.  If I needed see invis, I'd ask for it! :)<br />

After Acumen, Diaku, Wrulan, and Regen are the buffs that I kill most often.  They are the buffs that are the least likey to be doing anything for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe I'm easily amused, but since I don't raid, what else am I gonna do with MGB? :)<br />

But as I have seen recently, (since PoP) there are increasingly alot of lvl 65 toons out there that are plain stupid. I always cast at least 2 junk buffs on myself, 4 if I have time before buffing starts (clickies). Sure these normally get replaced by something else but they keep V down to about buff slot 8. and as for Agility buffs, an extra 10AC means JACK. I sit at 5580HP and 1505AC unbuffed, 8K'ish HP and 1600ish AC buffed, not bad for the content I am currently doing. While Agi is my weakest of stats it is the one that I realy could care less about. If it is cast on me fine if not fine there too. I know when I need to drop buffs and when I can keep them up. When I fight Mobs that cast DoT's and Root I start dropping buffs and Acumen is 1st to go followed quickly by Agi. I have seen a Warrior miss Fo7 because he didn't drop certain buffs, when I asked him what buffs he had, he told me and I went through the roof, he had C5 on. So it really does depend on the melee in question. You may run accross the n00bie lvl 65 melee who know jack about the game, or you may get the lvl 60 that knows it all.<br />
