<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else noticed an upgrade in the Hate Armor?<br />
<br />
I got my BP a couple months ago with the normal AC 26 Sta 9 Wis 13 etc..<br />
<br />
Another Guildie went up last night and a Rune Etched BP dropped for him, but this one had AC 31 Sta 9 Wis 15 etc..<br />
<br />
Grats to Grisok :)<br />
<br />
But we were definitely confused as nothing else really seemed out of the ordinary.  Can anyone else confirm changes in Hate armor?  Maybe this isn't just for the Shaman.. any other classes you know about change recently?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I looted Rune Etched gloves a week ago and they were (and are) complete and utter CRAP.  They're arguably even worse than the jarcrap ones I already have in the bank for corpse runs.<br />
<br />
Hate was still fun, though.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">there are 2 kinda diff bp from hate .... one that is iky only and other is shm races that might be the case im not sure id look on allakazam's if it wasnt the same bp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Havnt heard about this.. but it strikes me as opening up a can of worms that they wouldnt want to open up. As it is now there is a nice armor quality progression in place..<br />
<br />
hate/fear &gt; thurg/pog/2ndfloorhate&gt;ss/kael <br />
<br />
With some ok droppable replacements that fall inbetween. Upping the ac that much on hate armor puts it very close to thurg stuff. I know MY rune etched bp(that I have had a long time) hasnt been changed.. and I will feel kinda stiffed if new ones are dropping with new stats =p.<br />
<br />
Are you sure it wasnt an iksar shaman bp that dropped? For some reason their hate armor destroys the other shaman hate armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Here's what the Iksar one looks like:<br />
<br />
Scaled Heirophant Breastplate<br />
  +26 AC +10 Str +5 Agi +16 Wis +10 vsMg +10 vsPos +10 vsDis +10 HP +50 Mana +6.00 Wt  <br />
<br />
Can you confirm he got a different set of stats?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Dyslexia?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>GrindleBashmeister</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yes, I can confirm.. as I stated his was AC 31, Sta 10 Wis 15 and some others.. he's a barb Shammy wearing it.. I'm a troll shammy.. so it doesn't have anything to do with the Iksar stuff..<br />
<br />
Definitely something to keep eyes open about..<br />
<br />
<br />
On a site note.. he won the BP 2 days ago.. but last night he went on a WToV raid and wont the Kael BP.. /sigh  lucky ass.. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">har har har<br />
<br />
everyone check thier JBB's.....does it say IKS on it now?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yeah..theres a new jbb dropping krak.<br />
<br />
Now it's IKS only, 20 ac instead of 14, and is 2 second clicky ice strike instead of 8 second clicky winter's roar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">that sucks, as shamans we should get a rightclick ice comet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">That's in planning as a drop from the ring  of fire in acrylia. Scaled Hierophant Deathorb, IKS only inv clicky, instacast. <br />
<br />
Have to wait awhile though, acrylia's on hold after all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">whatever, im still nerfed. I demand a rightclick deathtouch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nazgruul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Or a right click item that summons lizard skin bags.<br />
<br />
