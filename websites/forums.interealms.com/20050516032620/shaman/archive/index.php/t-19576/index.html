<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ughlei Duukling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I'm 64 now going to be 65 soon and I have been thinking of what AA's I want to get first and why. Anyways here is what i want to do:<br />
<br />
Run 3 (got this already)<br />
<br />
Regen 3<br />
<br />
Sta 5 (possibly may just wait)<br />
<br />
ND 3<br />
<br />
MC 3 <br />
<br />
Canna 5<br />
<br />
I was thinking of going for HP's and Canna 5 first so I can convert more HP to mana asap. I feel this would benefit me more then going for extended buffs etc first. Then from here I could go back for other AA's like improved healing and extended buffs etc. Anyways what do you think about this path for my first steps into the highend AA's?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CAN 5 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would definately make Run 3, Regen 3, MC 3, Canni 5 your first 23 AA. If you raid alot MGB is good to have if not it can wait. I am a big fan of Spell casting reinforcement AA and ND3. CA3/LR5 is a good set to work towards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hi Ughlei,<br />
<br />
I see your thoughts regarding Stamina/ND3 but I would recommend going for MC3 then Canni 5 first. <br />
<br />
The reason for doing Canni 5 first is that you could make use of it sooner. Stamina is something that you can get quite high from bazaar gear and will not be far from topping out with your own buffs. I wouldn't put points into that just yet.<br />
<br />
ND3 is a great AA set, and not to be scoffed at. Personally I wouldn't do it until after you have Canni 5.<br />
<br />
If you are concerned that you won't be able to use Canni 5 during times you don't have virtue etc you are losing out on the opportunity that you do have those buffs by not being able to canni for several more aa's.<br />
<br />
I am sure I am making this more complicated, so forgive my less than clear outline, but I would move MC3/Canni 5 above Sta.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drop the sta 5 compleated from the line up and put ND3 after cann v. Any innate stat is nearly worthless. Stats are too easy to max out and provide too little effect anyway. Best case the 10 sta you get from innate sta is gonna give a bit over 30 hps and it could be as little as NONE.<br />
<br />
I'd put cann v first since with current buffs anyone should be able to survive a cann v reasonably buffed. ND3 is nice for a bigger buffer, to make it safer, but shouldn't be required.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Pass the STAM AA's, at lvl 65 with so so gear I cap my stam with buffs and after 255, you get diminishing returns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the biggest mistake most players make on AA is buying the stat ones before they get even the marginally useful AA.  I have over 300AA and I still haven't bought STR, WIS, DEX, AGI, STA, INT or CHA.<br />
<br />
If you join a raiding guild that's at least in VT or lower-tier PoP, you're going to max out your primary stats (WIS, STA) pretty soon.  Resist AAs are useful later down the road, especially if you ever get to PoTime.  If you don't plan on being in a raiding guild, then I think you could skip the resists and go for stats.<br />
<br />
Before buying stat ones, you should get: all archetype AAs, all class AAs (except AM and Pet Disc.), all PoP Ability (except Suspended Minion and Hastened Rabidity) and all resist AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">most bang for your buck starting off is probably<br />
<br />
run3<br />
regen3<br />
mc3<br />
canni<br />
rc1<br />
vp1<br />
scm3<br />
scr3<br />
scrm<br />
<br />
pick and choose as you will after that<br />
<br />
oh add mgb somewhere in the middle there .. maybe after canni if you raid all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ughlei,<br />
<br />
I have do it in this order and has worked well for me.<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Wis 3 (was low on mana in my youth)<br />
MC 3<br />
Canni 5<br />
MGB<br />
VP 1<br />
SCR 3<br />
SCRM<br />
CA 3<br />
<br />
Working next on LR up to 3rd Rank.<br />
<br />
Canni 5 is the one you need and if you have Torpor they work so well together and will wonder what life was like before hand.<br />
<br />
MGB Nice to have and Have out of the way for those time you do use it. <br />
<br />
SCRM I really enjoy casting my buffs and then forgetting about them and when soloing Hasting my pet and myself it last much longer and Quie will heal me from a Canni 5.<br />
<br />
CA 3 For when slow does not stick or soloing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BubbaQuell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Forget Regen 3, the regen amount just does not make it worthwile.  I would get Metab 3.  High end food is pricey and horses eat, well, like horses.<br />
<br />
The ability not to worry about grocery shopping is worth the points in my opinion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">AAs are highly situational, depending on your play-style.<br />
<br />
I think most Shamans will agree with working on Canni V as soon as humanly ( or Barbarianly /Iksarly ) possible.<br />
<br />
Run 3 -&gt; Regen 3 -&gt;MC 3 -&gt;Canni V<br />
<br />
To improve your Hit Points, I would work on ND 3.  I did not do this until later in my AA Path, but I would have benefited more if I bought these AAs sooner.<br />
<br />
If you raid, I would invest into buying MGB.  Along with MGB, Radiant Cure is a life saver.  No priest class should go without it.  For encounters such as Grummus, you only need one rank to cure his AE.  <br />
<br />
To help with your buffs, SCR, SCRM and SCM.  Longer duration and mana preservation is good on raids.  There will be times on raids in which you may wipe and need to cast buffs on groups - which is a mega pain the arse.<br />
<br />
CA/LR - I did these AAs after I finished all my Buffing Enhanced AAs were completed.  I was tired of dying all the time when a slow was resisted in BoT.<br />
<br />
Quick Buff - having a 3.0 sec Qui with QB 3 ( 50% spell haste ) is awesome.  This is something you could save until you mem Qui.  Quick Buff is a big commitment ( 3,6 and 9 AAs ).<br />
<br />
If you solo, VP is a requirement.  Well, not a requirement, but it saves you a spell gem where root would have been -unless you have Scaled Avatar Pants.  Also, it is neat to see a mob being tossed back. :P  I do not solo that much anymore, and if I do, it is usually for farming.  I am sure Shaman who use this ability more can give a testiment to it's use.<br />
<br />
Healing AAs.  More and More I am seeing myself healing - raids, ldon and xp groups.  I never saw the power we hold with Qui and T. Mending.  Most people say we suck at healing, and to a point, I would agree, but with Healing AAs, we can close the gap a tiny bit - enough to fumble our way through most situations.  I worked on Healing Adept first ( I wanted the benefit of 10% ) to add with my Scaled Avatar Sleeves ( IH 4 ).  Finishing off with Healing Gift.<br />
<br />
CS/ID - I just started working on finishing my Defensive AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">CAN 5 AS SOON AS POSSIBLE!!<br />
<br />
Heed this!<br />
<br />
I'd highly recommend checking out the great advice by many vets in the AA thread in the medicine cabinet.<br />
<br />
Most shaman do things a little bit differently AFTER they have CanniV - but I think all shaman would agree that getting CanniV first is your highest priority.<br />
<br />
After CanniV I'd combine the advice of vets with your playstyle to determine an effective AA plan/path.  I also find it's good to really examine just how useful an AA will be to you...as there are many choices and there are some AA that will clearly help you immediately compared to some that are nice to have - and it depends on how you play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I got Run 1 then regen 1 then Alternated tween the two<br />
<br />
At archtype I got Crit nukes 1 first. (JBB Critted once before it was nerfed.... Grrrr)<br />
<br />
Then MC 3 and Canna 5<br />
<br />
Then I picked up a little of everything. Better to have lots of weak options fast than one or two strong options.<br />
<br />
(In my mind at least) Saving 9 AA almost killed me.<br />
<br />
For the most part other thank Canna 5 there is no game changing AA. Not over any of the other useful aa's It all boils down to play style and such. I prefered surviorabilty over many other things and choices in what I could do. So I got mutt 1 and RC 1 and All the other 1's (Just about, can skip Channeling focus for a bit) because in the end they are just incremental anyways.<br />
<br />
My 2 cents..<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy RABID bear  E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">STA is a useless AA unless you have AA to burn. Canni 5 &gt; SCM &gt; LR5 &gt; ALL.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">For a non-raiding shaman, I might be able to make an arguement for VP1 before Cann5, it's only 3 AAs and won't really slow you down that much on the long road to Canni5. It's a pretty useful skill to have along the way. Overall though, you can't go wrong with shotting for C5 first. <br />
<br />
After that, I really like getting SC1, VP1, RC1 before any of the others, they're extremely cheap for the flexibility that they add. After that, SCR, SCM or ND, it depends on your playstyle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">After that, I really like getting SC1, VP1, RC1 before any of the others, they're extremely cheap for the flexibility that they add.

<br />
Except for the SC, which is mainly a toy...I agree with this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So far I don't have 7th and I find MGB to be the biggest waste of AA that I have spent.  With 7th it would be better but even then not the end all.  There are always folks that will need to be buffed with the spell you used MGB on that will erode your mana and time savings. With Canni5 and Q getting mana back to keep buffing has never been a problem.<br />
<br />
Canni5 above all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Run 3<br />
regen 3<br />
MC3<br />
Can 5<br />
ND3<br />
<br />
Definatly go for Can 5 first no detours.  I have played just about all classes in EQ to higher lvls this is the single greatest aa in the game =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">CANNI 5 ... please please please go straight to this ... <br />
<br />
My path looks like this so far.<br />
<br />
Regen3<br />
Run3<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
MGB<br />
ND3<br />
SCM3<br />
VP1<br />
<br />
After I get VP1, I'm debating going to RC1 and then on to other AA's. I am trying to decide between that path, and finishing to VP3. Like a lot of folks have said, AA path is situational, and depends on your play style, guild needs, and character needs/desires.<br />
