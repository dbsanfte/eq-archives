<br />
A major research institution has recently announced the discovery of<br />
the heaviest element yet known to science. This new element has been<br />
tentatively named &quot;Administratium&quot;. Administratium has 1 neutron, 12<br />
assistant neutrons, 75 deputy neutrons, and 111 assistant deputy neutrons,<br />
giving it an atomic mass of 312.<br />
<br />
These 312 particles are held together by a force called morons, which<br />
are surrounded by vast quantities of lepton-like particles called peons.<br />
<br />
Since Administratium has no electrons, it is inert. However, it can be<br />
detected as it impedes every reaction with which it comes into contact.<br />
A minute amount of Administratium causes one reaction to take over 4 days<br />
to complete when it would normally take less than a second.<br />
<br />
Administratium has a normal half-life of 3 years; it does not decay but<br />
instead undergoes a reorganization, in which a portion of the assistant<br />
neutrons and deputy neutrons and assistant deputy neutrons exchange places.<br />
<br />
In fact, Administratium's mass will actually increase over time, since<br />
each reorganization causes some morons to become neutrons forming isodopes.<br />
This characteristic of moron-promotion leads some scientists<br />
to speculate that Administratium is formed whenever morons reach a certain<br />
quantity in concentration. This hypothetical quantity is referred to as<br />
&quot;Critical Morass.&quot;<br />
<br />
You will know it when you see it...</div></div><hr />

Nothing but headaches and increase in Motrin sales.</div></div><hr />

Haha, I wonder if it could be used to power my my television set... We must harness the power of Administratium! <br />
You could, but it would only work 5 hours a week, and you'd only get C-SPAN.</div></div><hr />
