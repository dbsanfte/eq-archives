<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ragz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is it just me or is this a little ironic?  Would it have been that hard to match shaman pets to bl pet graffics with SoL while giving them the same stats/pet spell level?  <br />
<br />
I just don't like the idea of having a dog pet as a cat from a rp perspective.<br />
<br />
/em ducks as the old guard flames the crap out of him for wanting a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yaz.  Same with Iksar Necros having human skellie pets, or all shaman races turning into bears.  Pre-Luclin, the official party line (at least for the Iksar necro thing) was that it would increase memory requirements to add the additional models to each zone and therefore cause longer load times, choppier performance, etc.  I haven't heard what the new excuse is, now that Luclin has forced people to upgrade their systems to address exactly those issues...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thalarctos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Think about it this way.  As a cat, I have no second thoughts about ordering my puppy to rush off to his death  =)<br />
<br />
From a rp perspective, how about the thought that you are summoning up the ghosts of dogs to do your bidding.  I've never heard of a fantasy system where ghosts liked to be summoned.  It's more like you're inslaving dead dogs or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From a roleplaying perspective I always believe that the Shaman pet was summoned from the spirit world. And the spirit companion takes the form of the wolf to aid the Oracle that has summoned it. <br />
So as far as a cat (Vah'Shir) making a dog pet, I see it as a Vah'Shir shaman summoning a spirit companion that takes the form of the wolf. So in essence its really not a wolf, its a spirit that takes a wolf's form. <br />
I don't know that just what I do from a RP standpoint. <br />
What would be cool though would be that if your pet could randomly take the form of many animals. Wolves, Bears, and other creatures of the like. That way you'd have some variety as to what spirit companion you summon. <br />
Just my 2cp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I get a mental image of Garfield and Odie standing on a table. Garfield throws a stick, and Odie goes after it - right off the edge of the table.<br />
<br />
Makes sense to me. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm...<br />
<br />
I guess it really depends on the perspective.  In *your* eyes, you may not like the idea of your &quot;cat&quot; (though the Vah Shir are so much more than that) associating with a &quot;dog&quot; (a spirit guardian, of sorts).<br />
<br />
But who are we to say that there is enmity between the Vah Shir and Wolves upon Norrath?  Is the logic here because that is how it is in &quot;our world&quot;?<br />
<br />
If so, then it really isn't an rp standpoint, is it? <br />
<br />
But hey...I'm a Barbarian.  I don't have the dilemma ;) <br />
<br />
Your call :)<br />

&quot;Cats and Dogs living together - AND enjoying it. Mass pandemonium.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've always thought that as we are spritually bears, we should have a bear pet, and not the wolf.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's not so bad.  Kitty gets to have a little pay back for years of being chased by Doggie.<br />
<br />
What I think is strange is this...the class that can turn into a bear has a wolf pet, and the class that can turn into a wolf has a bear pet.  Umm...hello...McFly!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Personally, I would have liked to see each of the various pet spells summon up a different totem spirit.  Would have made the global file a *lot* bigger, but life is full of little trade-offs ;)<br />
<br />
As shamans we call upon various totem spirits to lend us their virtues in the forms of buffs.  Wolf we call on to fight at our side as well as grant us his speed.  We call on Bear to lend us his form.<br />
<br />
Basically, we are all calling on the same totem spirits, regardless of race or which god we follow (or not, in the case of the Vah Shir, who evidently cut out the middle man.)  The difference lies in our relationship to the spirits - calling on them as equals, or bending them to our will, as befits our cultural background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dont know where people get it in their heads that dogs and cats are automatically enemies.   Its completely how they are raised.<br />
<br />
   My dog(german shephard/lab mix) absolutely loves playing with cats.    In fact she fights other dogs, but loves to play with cats.    Then again, she was raised in a house filled with cats, hence her name Josie.</div></div><hr />
