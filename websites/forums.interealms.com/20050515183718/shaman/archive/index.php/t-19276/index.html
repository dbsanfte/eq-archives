<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">why does it seem the majority of shaman want:<br />
<br />
a heal, a nuke, better dots?<br />
<br />
what the hell about our slow, personally i'd leave all the other crap alone and tell them to upgrade all 3 types of slow we get (disease, magic, AE).<br />
<br />
leave the healing to clerics, leave the nuking to wizards, our poison/magic dots although highly inefficent are good damage (504pts a tick max on bane with BAIV aug from ldon).<br />
<br />
bitching about healing, I friggin hate to heal and woudl rather leave that up to droods and clerics if it came down to it.<br />
<br />
Nuking, always been a joke for us, except late kunark era when the JBB started to surface but was soon marginalized after velious and definately made a joke during luclin.<br />
<br />
FOCUS people FOCUS on what we were the best at one day long ago back in the stone ages, but now everyone and their brother gets, even our bastard shaman/monk red headed step child will soon out power us on the slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ha, it's so hard to agree. I think our slow is fine, I don't mind that other classes can slow. Big nukes, baby, that's the ticket! BOOM BOOM!!! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Personally, I disagree with the idea that you can't worry about the other stuff.<br />
<br />
However, I wish that we got more slows in general, and am suprised we haven't.<br />
<br />
For Example.<br />
<br />
A slow against every resist type, ala fire and cold, a cold based slow makes a ton of lore sense.<br />
<br />
A unresistable but light slow, like 30% or something.<br />
<br />
A quick unmitagatable slow.<br />
<br />
A slow that the % starts at 0 and works up to almost 100, or starts at 100 and works down, like splurt kinda.<br />
<br />
Short duration, long duration, short casting, long casting, etc,etc, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">let's play devil's avocat:<br />
&quot;what's wrong with shaman slow? aren't shamans the best slower ever? why do you need a better slow??? stop whinning!&quot;<br />
<br />
so if all non-shaman are saying that as we can read in some forums then there is probably something else to upgrade before our slow..  :)<br />
<br />
and this is exactly what shamans are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I want a better heal because healing is one of my primary roles.  I enjoy being the one to keep my group alive through raids, and I enjoy being the primary healer in LDoN adventures.  It is a lot more fun than slowing each mob then just casting a nuke or two.<br />
<br />
As for better dots and nukes, I am not very concerned about it.  I'd like to have them, but I am not going to make a big deal of it.  Some shamans feel that their secondary role after debuffing is to do damage, whereas I feel it is to heal and ensure that the rest of your group/raid stays alive.<br />
<br />
As for better slows, I think turgur's is as powerful of a slow percentage-wise as we are going to get.  Slow is already extremely powerful, and even a 5% upgrade to turgur's would be a 20% increase in damage mitigation.  It would be unbalancing for the game in general if our slows got any more powerful.  What I have wanted for a long time, though, is a fast-casting slow with a resist check that can be used as a supplement to turgur's.  We are getting exactly that in GoD, so I'm a happy shaman.<br />
<br />
A disease-based slow with a bigger %-slowed would be good, but I hardly ever use grummus so I'm not overly worried about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think they wanna be druids.  I like that new slow with -40 resist check.  Would be perfect if it did a 65 - 70 % slow tho.  My main wish is to have an AE Malo.  That would make Tigirs more useful.  Icing on the cake would be to remove the # limit on amount of mobs that can be affected by the slow and make it 60%.  <br />
<br />
Some other nice changes I would like to see are:<br />
/tgb'able shrink and Blood of Nadox<br />
higher max dodge cap<br />
Longer buff duration on our main buffs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bottom Line:  Slow is overpowering and we're not likely to get an across the board upgrade to make us better at it.  We may (and probably will) get this new slow which will make us *faster* at it, and *more likely to land* it, but I do not think we will ever see an 80 percent slow.  It just unbalances the entire game too much.  <br />
<br />
With mobs improving as fast as they are, and our slow NOT improving, I think its reasonable to want to be improved in other areas to compensate for our growing weakness.  Basically, its time for a change of direction for shaman.  We're not the kings of slowing anymore -- other classes can do it almost as well, and in some limited situations they can actually do it better.  We need to grow in a new direction now, I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">*sigh*<br />
<br />
Newbies that thinks that they know what is best for the shaman class makes me incredibly sad.<br />
<br />
Getting a better slow would NOT solve any problems that the shaman class have atm, which is the crappy stacking for raids.<br />
<br />
I'd be extremely happy if they removed both the disease dot and the new slow and gave us an upgrade to Tnarg's Mending instead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">well said</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">thats another problem, some want to be better healers , but dont care that much. but about dps, while other want more dps and not that bothered about healing.<br />
<br />
i myself would like a small increase to our healing so its not such a pain in the neck, but with druid and cleric being the main healer , i perfer to go for more quick damage.<br />
<br />
a quick less resisted slow would also be nice, but at same 75%. and a quicker malo so that i can have time to heal better or damage better<br />
the reason both these come up is for grouping and raids so we have 2 options rather than none we have at moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think our DoTs are fine, and personally think that some of the time our heals are fine as well; key word is some of the time...playing main healer in a group and main slower can sometimes prove to be problematic, and I dont do it unless I know the people I am grouping with pretty well. I think that blast healing is, for the most part, our biggest weakness.<br />
I also really would love to see the Focus line upgraded to finally offer something useful other than some stackable hit points......most of the tanks I do groups with are near 255-280 in str/dex anyway and the pretty green in their Inventory only goes so far really.<br />
Granted I am not time enabled, nor am I likely to be unless I get granted access by some huge accident, but for the most part I think that most shaman are in my boat, not the Elemental flagged + boat.<br />
And dont get me started on slow :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The reason is pretty obvious if you think about it...healing and nuking are stackable, not game breaking, and not boring.<br />
<br />
If we heal better, it doesnt hurt the game at all...if we nuke better, again...same thing...it just gives us something worthwhile to do...something besides being a buff bot at a raid...etc<br />
<br />
Face it if your not the main slower...then your job is over pretty quick.<br />
Sure you can add a little damage (nuke/dot)...do a little patch healing..but we have lost so much ground relative to other casters, both priest and pure, in both those areas, that its just ridiculous...we shouldnt be contributing less to a raid than any other class just because we have the ability to slow...<br />
<br />
(see the Analysis of spell upgrades since Kunark thread by VeeshanMurtak)<br />
<br />
Slow is game-breaking...frankly, in my opinion, they went a little overboard with slow...and never should of had chanters and beastlords as close as they are to shaman on slowing...<br />
<br />
Chanters haste tops out at 70 percent...Shaman haste tops out at 60 percent...frankly if Shaman slow tops at 75 percent, chanters never should got better than a 65 percent slow.  And beasts...probably should of topped out around 60 percent max...they are just way to strong given their own melee/casting/pet abilities<br />
<br />
Problem with slow was they gave us the best slow too soon...and of course because of that they have been ignoring us/nerfing us on the new stuff ever since.<br />
<br />
Problem with the proposed slow in GoD is that it just isnt good enough to be our main slow...bst slow, slows more and casts about as fast...chanter slow slows more...It may be adequate for an LDoN romp...but thats about it.  If they made it a total lure slow...ie no chance of resist...unless mob is immune...then sure...heck they could even bump the mana cost and I would use it.  The minimal change they could make to have it worthwhile, would be to have the resist adjust be as low as Malosinia (-70) and up the slow rate to 65...putting up with 10 percent less slowing and a much shorter duration would probably be acceptable given the fact that it would be saving you the casting time of a malosinia and a turgurs...but the recast time would have to be cut to 4 or 5 as well...<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, they are highly unlikely to do anything to make slow more powerful...it hurts the game dynamics too much<br />
<br />
Other alternative solutions were also provided...<br />
<br />
AoE malosinia or something like it...after all why should enchanters be the only one with an AoE resist debuff...this would be fun...If I could AoE debuff...heck, I might even use Tigirs ocassionally.<br />
<br />
Buffing something besides relatively meaning less or capped stats...buffing beyond stat caps...all are viable possibilities...<br />
<br />
We dont need all of the changes...just a bone or two tossed our way...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We will not see a bigger slow (higher percentage) nor a much easier to land slow(not more then about -50) . Other resist type slows would make it necessary to revisit all old magic immune encounters and see if those are meant to be slowed - and still do nothing for shaman, powerwise, because lately magic immune MOBs have been very rare.<br />
This is fine. I would rather have a game with balanced and encounters and I would rather have mitigating and slow immune MOBs then magic immune MOBs or MOBs that do 4 times the amount of damage they should to account for slow.<br />
<br />
However that means we will not ever get much of an upgrade in this area. Hence heals, nukes, DoTs, buffs  :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Also, speaking for myself I prefer to be good in several areas to being extremely good at a single thing. I do not like to be a one-trick-pony. Even if I did only want better slows . . . well, see above.</div></div><hr />

a heal, a nuke, better dots?<br />
A long time ago Norrath was new, travel was dangerous and difficult, faction could be a problem and level 50 was the highest anyone could attain.  My wife started a barbarian warrior so I, of course, decided that I needed to be a priest to keep her healed.  Shaman being the only choice for a barbarian priest, I made a barbarian shaman.  If she would have picked human warrior I would be a cleric.  If she had picked a woodelf warrior I would have been (god forbid) a druid. My one and only concern was to be a healer.<br />
<br />
For the most part we are all EQ veterans.  We know which class does what, where different races can go and how to get there in 5 minutes or less.  We have min/maxed the game to the point that we know exactly how to get most return for the least amount of effort. But I still have this barbarian shaman created by a newbie some 5 years ago with the sole intention of keeping my wife's warrior alive.  I would still like to able accomplish this task.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The devs think slow is broken as is. It probably is. We aint gonna be bypassing mitigation. I dont like always being forced to get another healer to do anything worthwhile, and I should be able to keep a group trucking along in E PLanes or ldon hard just like any of the other 2 healers. Thats why our poor healing is my number 1 concern.</div></div><hr />

He stated that since Chanters and Beasts are so close in slowing ability and add more to a group that Shaman are a third choice.  Will better slows help this.  NO!  Not unless we are give an 100% slow which is not going to happen (nor would it be good for the game).<br />
<br />
What then do we need to make my friend want to put Shaman at the same level as Chanters and Beasts for grouping.  Yep, Better heal or better nukes or better dots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, personally, would really like to see a better heal to make me a better patch healer on raids, and something to help out my dps (Better pet, better dots (Not disease please, they take too long to do damage), or a better nuke (faster case/more damage).<br />
<br />
I agree with the assertion that Shaman are the jack of all trades in EQ, we're not masters at anything but are are good at a lot.<br />
<br />
I'm not as upset about BL's slowing because they don't get a good debuff, I'm more upset Chanters get a good debuff and slow together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Slow upgrades are limited.  SoE knows that 75% slow was too much to begin with and will never exceed that.  This leaves the only options for &quot;upgrades&quot; as: Resistability, # of targets, cast/recast.  All of these except the unlikely addition of PBAoE are not exactly earth shattering upgrades.  <br />
<br />
Heal and nuke upgrades would increase our utility in all situations and stackability on raids more effectively imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That means having a surperior slow (not necessarily more then 75%, there are other ways to improve as mentionen above), making cripple somewhat more useful och getting a drool inducing avatarish buff. Oh yeah, and make it all shm-stacking fiendly for raid purposes.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, i guess im just another shaman diagreeing with what upgrades we need :) Though, i would welcome any upgrades of cause.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read a few threads where you say you can already keep your group alive in PoT and many other situations.  Why do you need a better heal if you can already do this?  Not to mention that shaman should NOT be able to be the primary healer in all situations otherwise there'd be no need for clerics because shaman bring a lot more to a group than simply healing and clerics bring little else (they can rez - but ideally you don't need to do that regularly).  Cleric = specialized healing class = the best at healing.  Shaman = highly diverse class with the ability to heal = shouldn't be a fulltime substitute for clerics.<br />
<br />
Getting a better slow would NOT solve any problems that the shaman class have atm, which is the crappy stacking for raids.<br />
<br />
Perhaps raid issues are a problem for you and some others, but not everybody raids, not everybody who plays a shaman raids, and not everybody gives a flying monkee's butt about raids.  And shaman are not the only class that has stacking issues on raids.  There is more to EQ than raiding!  Check out the composition of a given raid.  You have a few leaders who tell everyone else what to do (or you have some people that have done raid X so many times they already know it inside and out - how exciting) and you have a few people with specified particular roles for the raid.  How is any tank other than the MT and maybe backup MT doing anything special?  Do you think the clerics in a cheal rotation are feeling special?  What about damage casters or pet classes - do they each have a special role?  Etc.  Most raid participants have a very limited amount of participation options.  At least the shaman class has the potential to do more than one thing and be adaptive.  Raids generally involve a lot of people and a lot of cooperation and not everybody in a raid is gonna have a special role.<br />
<br />
How could shaman be improved for raiding to compete with specialist melee classes, specialist nuking classes, specialist pet classes, specialist DoT classes, and/or specialist healing classes in a way that wouldn't distort the existing diversity of the shaman for raids and the rest of the game?<br />
<br />
I'm not against boosting or adding to the shaman class - I play a shaman and I'll take anything I'm given.  But I'm sick of illogical class comparisons, tired of jealousy considering other classes, tired of comparisons that involve particular game situations while ignoring the rest of the game, sick of ridiculous and unreasonable demands and suggestions, and most of all I'm sick of the whining and hostility that have been the norm around here since all of this stuff has built up steam.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree and one specific type of argument comes to mind here: when shm nukes are compared to hybrid nukes, but only by the max damage and cast time.  Nothing of the recast times, lack of hybrid specialization skill, or spell casting mastery, or easily attainable focus and flowing thought items, or self mana regen buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I've only read the first and second posts, so I don't know what else was said here. <br />
<br />
I look at it like this though.  90% of eq is about gaining experience, experince is gained by killing mobs.  You kill mobs by doing damage to them.  Every class should have some tools available to them that allow them to make a difference in the damage done to a mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">First, on difficult and highly resistant encounters, taking one shaman is NOT a good idea. Still, 3 are probably enough, and no way would you want more than 4 in a 72 person raid. Take almost any other class, and they can help during raid encounter with some continuing contribution during fight, so they stack. You could have 36 beastlords in a raid of 72. You could have 36 rogues in a raid of 72. You could have 36 necros in a raid of 72. ..... The point about raids is that every dps class is needed the entire fight. Every significant healing class can be used the entire fight. Many tanks are required, and contribute quite a bit to dps. The pet dps classes are useful the entire fight. Even druids and wizards can stack well. After the slow lands and is refreshed, a shaman's role is insignificant. With a very few other classes, this makes shaman less needed on large raids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I dread seeing this new slow being introduced in the game.

<br />
I struggle with spell slots as it is.  I'd hate to have a plethera of slow spells to choose from depending on the given situation.  I wouldn't mind an upgraded Tigir's or Grummus, but these are situational spells I often don't have memmed.<br />
<br />
There just is not much room to upgrade our most powerful spell. Whereas many of our other spells have fallen relatively behind other casters in the last four expansions and there is room for improvement.  I don't think we're asking to nuke like a wizard, heal like a druid, buff like a cleric, or have a pet that rivals a beastlord.  I'd just like an upgraded direct heal, a group heal, a faster casting or slightly beefed up nuke, and a pet that can kick the snot out of the SK one.<br />

Besides, what Jinheim says about damage mitigation and increased slows is very true.<br />

If we slowed for more percentage that Turgurs offer the whole game would have to be retuned to fit mobs that hit significantly less. And if Verant tried to retune that much we know that they would screw up to no ends  :p</div></div><hr />

Buffs - Screw buffs. Really. Just scrap all the Shaman buffs, and replace them with... Augmentations. +% to skill groups. Overhaste. Melee procs. Focus buffs. + damage buffs. Hell, I like the idea put on the Paladin board about &quot;Aura&quot; buffs a while back - Self buffs that pulse like bard songs. <br />
<br />
Debuffs - Again, screw these. We want curses, am i right? ;) Fizzle modifiers for mobs, reverse damage sheilds, hell, keep the Malo line. It's very nice<br />
<br />
Slows - We've all bitched and moaned about how little difference there is in practice between our slow and Enchanter / BST slows. So if we're only going to be marginally better, why not give us some Slow variety? Unlimited hit PBAoE? Snare + Slow? DoT + Slow? Cold based slow? Long-range low aggro pulling slow? What the heck?<br />
<br />
Damage - To heck with DoTs. We have enough. I don't know about you guys, but I just mem my two highest poisons if I mem any at all (Haven't bothered to gt Bane or Anathema yet). Fix rain spells to actually be targeted, rather than ranged area effect - Or at least let root last longer through them. Make our real nukes faster... I don't care about ratio, I just want my snowflakes to hit before the mob is being looted. Expand a little on us... Splatter a few fire and magic nukes in there for variety. If you can't do that, then for god's sake, increase our melee abilities! <br />
<br />
Heals - Just give us a non-detrimental HoT and some group heals. Don't care if they're cannibalize-efficient or MGB-able, I just want them to BE THERE. Also... New particle effect, the blazing halogen streaks at eye-level tick me off.<br />
<br />
Mana regen - Something lich-style. If you still need a timesink, make it just like lich and not stack with mana regen buffs. or make it cancel regen spells. Or SOMETHING. Hell, make it cost mana. Just don't make me feel like I brew for minotaur heroes for a living like the current version does. Also... Anyone else think it's a bit odd that our hybrid gets a mana / HP regen buff, and we have to cannidance?<br />
<br />
other stuff - TGB shrink, and move Tiny Terror to a more realisitic level for its effect. Say... 34? i mean, christ, Druids are slapping meaty HP on their groups at low levels, and we can't even shrink the bunch? Improved invis. Maybe borrow the first five beastlord pet procs. one every second level from 50 - 60. Hell, let us charm something, maybe? <br />
<br />
Just a few ideas, really. pointless rambling of an old coot in Alaska</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My question is why are we so afraid to ask for all our problems to be corrected?<br />
<br />
We should demand that everything be addressed.<br />
<br />
Heals - Poor and should be even with a druids.<br />
<br />
Nukes - Poor, Casting time should be around 5-6 seconds with damage being at least 1200.<br />
<br />
DoT - Disease just has to go thats all there is to it.  I can live with Poison line but the Disease line is useless.<br />
<br />
Pets - Waste of mana.  Our pet is a crappy version of a crappy tank (Warrior).<br />
<br />
Cannibalize - My fingers hurt.  Just give me 300 mana for 600 hp damnit!<br />
<br />
Slows - Give me something UBER.  Something you wont nerf with resist rates and mitigation!<br />
<br />
ALL of these fields need to be attended to, and I don't feel at all wrong or greedy demanding that all are fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">yes desease dots are a problem now, they went on the idea that desease are slow, but alot arnt and hit rapidly, sometimes faster that poisons. <br />
perhaps change desease to do half their damage as a nuke, then the rest as a dot that decreases.<br />
<br />
so for the new desease dot, which does about 3k, nuke for about 1400 (affect by dd aa) then then dot 400, 350, 300, 250, 200,100 (total 1600) and about 600 mana?<br />
<br />
or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Level 65 Shaman, about 77 AA's, raid about half the time. <br />
<br />
I don't forsee Sony makeing slows better. I see a lot of good <br />
suggestions here for minor tweaks, but would rather they not mess<br />
with it. <br />
<br />
Healing, I've adjusted to the fact that Shamans are third rate healers<br />
on a good day. Bringing us up to the level of Druids would be the thing<br />
to do, but then I guess the Druids would complain. <br />
<br />
Better bufs might be nice, but I'd rather see our damage output <br />
increased. <br />
<br />
Disease dot's are only useful to me on a raid. Even the poison dot's are<br />
too slow for grouping. Our nukes are weak. Most of the time, I use rains <br />
cause they can do more then 1K in a reasonable amount of time. <br />
Unfortunately, you have the whole AOE issue. <br />
<br />
I'd like to see single-target rains with a damage upgrade worth talking<br />
about. That, and undo the nerf to Cheatah where it refreshed on<br />
zoning. :D I used to LOVE Cheatah for getting from A to B!</div></div><hr />

What, you think I meant Turgurs + Highest level snare? Hell no. Either a weak slow and good snare or a good slow and weak snare.  Say a 50% reduction in movement and attack rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Joredor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">New AE slow would be nice. So would an AE Malo and AE Malosini</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">why does it seem the majority of shaman want:<br />
<br />
a heal, a nuke, better dots?<br />
<br />
Aren't the poll results interesting?   <br />
<br />
Besides, I thought one of our great strengths was versatility.  Not paralytic specialization in one area (slows).<br />
<br />
FOCUS people FOCUS on what we were the best at one day long ago back in the stone ages,<br />
You want us to go back to the stone ages?  <br />
<br />
Sorry nuzum - I disagree with improving our slows.  The dev's have made it pretty clear that 75% slow is already overpowering, and now mitigation is par for the course in a lot of zones.  Why would I want a 80% slow that would be mitigated to 20% instead of the normal 75% that gets mitigated to 18.75%?<br />
<br />
An AE debuff would be wonderful though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">IMO, Shamans have always been a melee's best friend.<br />
<br />
Slows I would like ot see a New Slow that sticks without having to cast Malos on the mob first.<br />
<br />
Nukes/DoTs, a better nuke would be nice but not needed.<br />
<br />
Heals, sure why not have a litttle better heal to mana cost.<br />
<br />
The new Ward thing? Should be something we cast on our pet so it moves with us and makes the AoE Endurance Regen useful on things like LDoN.<br />
<br />
Should have a New line of Endurance Buffs.<br />
<br />
At Lvl65 we should have a buff that combines FoS/Agi/Sta<br />
<br />
FA should Last Longer.<br />
<br />
Most Lvl65's have their prime stats max out and FoS/7 is only needed for the HP buff. We should have a Buff that is HP (and higher then FoS/7) with a ATK which stacks with  FA<br />
<br />
Another line of HP Buffs that Add Mana regen like Pot9 or Beast Crack.<br />
<br />
So you have HP Plus line one for Melees and one for Casters<br />
<br />
Things I know we will never see but just some of my thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">What some don t seem to see is that SoE has changed the game at higher levels with the last couple expansions. Mobs hit much harder but don t have as much hp. What this amounts too is on one side good for Shamans, slow is needed, and on the other side bad for Shamans, we can t keep up with the healing. I don t want to go into the effect of slow mitigation, that was a real bad decision imho.<br />
<br />
Time warp two? weeks ago: the new GoD spells and AA are discovered. And guess what, they really suck. The last couple expansions shamans have sat tight and hoped for SoE to fix the insufficient upgrades we recieved. Not on this expansion, its time to speak up!<br />
<br />
Since there already have been several positive changes to the probable lineup it was a good thing too. I am actually looking forward to GoD now and most likely will preorder as soon as I know which item I ll miss from the boxed version this time (/rude SoE ).<br />
<br />
Thank you all who brought about these improvements and everyone supporting the shaman class.</div></div><hr />
