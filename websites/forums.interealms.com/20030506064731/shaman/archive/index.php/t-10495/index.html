<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>newbie1234</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i want to use this 60 epic shaman to PL my 53 pally.  Where are some good places I could do this?  Would like to do this where there isnt too much of a crowd and where things dont have a ton of hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hey, i am a 57 shaman with a 52 paladin also.. the best place ive found to pl is Karnors basement.. all undead, low hp, dont hit for much, low resists, lots of fine steel to make plat, usually uncamped in my server, plus you can get him to 60 there.  have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">CoM (lower right hand area when you look at map - not sure what it is called - not too far from zone - watch out for hole in bridge - got me killed once) was good for me (or my pl druid) and then we moved to KC - I would pull to LC (Left Corner - take a left just before first bridge - back in corner - very secluded) from all over the place - it was a blast for a few days.<br />

CoM (lower right hand area when you look at map - not sure what it is called  <br />
<br />
It's usually called the temple or the church.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I've heard suggestions that the undead fear pathing in Howling Stones (Charasis) is a bit, ah, how shall I put this...in favor of the player?  Saw a necro - druid combo fear kiting 9 mobs at once down below the zone-in.</div></div><hr />
