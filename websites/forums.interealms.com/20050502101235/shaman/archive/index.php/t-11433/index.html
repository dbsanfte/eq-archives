YAY, I'm sOOoo glad I bought LoY. We get TONS I mean TONS of new zones . Awsome gay, I mean cool quests too!<br />

My druid’s armor finally matches and for the first time in his life he’s not dressed in brown leather.  My other characters are jealous of him and demanding that they get matching armor as well.<br />
<br />
All my characters have new slots that will some day help improve their stats, something they each desperately need.<br />
<br />
Am I glad I bought the LoY expansion?  Hell yes!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">/agree Calabar<br />
<br />
Some people can never seem to be pleased  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chiyu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LoY might not be the most featuresome of expansions, but it is cheap and worth it just for armour dyes and stoicism (if it works as advertised, i cant wait to get my paws on 'mini torpor' ;) )<br />
<br />
armour dyes are awesome - i'm finally getting that &quot;all silver&quot; look i've always wanted :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm happy with LoY.  I don't think it was ever intended to be a huge expansion, like the size PoP was.  It was just meant to be an add on with some nice tools, new features, zones, race, items and quests to keep us busy.  I'm having fun exploring the new zones :)  I made my way all around Dulak's Harbor yesterday and had a blast doing it, just too bad I forgot to map it while I was at it hehe.</div></div><hr />
