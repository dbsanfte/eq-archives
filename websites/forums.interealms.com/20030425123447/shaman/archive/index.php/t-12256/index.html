<br />
If you have not yet seen the new trailer then u should 2 two things. Slap yourself on the head hehe j/k and 2 head over to blizzard.com and see it :P<br />
<br />
My god no more bs this is actual game footage and fights from the game. MY god rangers shoot arrows that are actually made of fire and the fights look INCREDIBLE. OMG i watched it 3 times and my eyes were drooling.<br />
<br />
There is a huge gladiator arena and some incredible looking jungles and mountains... it's breathtaking and looks like a dream still. cartoony yet very very good.<br />
<br />
Sure go ahead and say &quot;hmm not impressed&quot;. The gaming GODS are gonna kill EQ mark my words.<br />
<br />
Sure there is NO way to stop cheating. In ANY game. Except maybe ban ppl en masse but it won't prevent cheats from being made etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Anythign a man can make another man can break&quot;<br />
<br />
Game may not be perfect but god i cannot wait for it.<br />
<br />
Download the trailer make sure u are downloadign the 2003 one. It's amazing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Definetly looks pretty, kinda like a high grade cartoon and with the imagination of blizzard im sure itll be great game. However, it takes more then a pretty backdrop and flashing spell effects to make a spectacular game, ive played muds that were more enthralling then some higher end games ( DAoC/DIablo2/etc ). The way blizzard works i think its going to be just like its name. When it first comes out itll be WoW check this game out its great, after a month or 2 you go back to a game with depth to it. Thats just blizzard track record speaking. Its definetly got looks going for it though, we need to wait and see how it plays now is all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stillwater</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have to agree with litgruv<br />
I have yet to find a game that has the depth or the addictiveness *sp* of EQ, There is alot that look neat in trailers but normally lack the luster, after a short time i have close to 600 dollars in cds and guess what game i am still playing hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, I for one feel that given time, WoW will be significantly better than EQ. (I am still annoyed at the HORRIBLE animations on the new models). While graphics aren't everything, I am willing to bet Blizzard gets this right.<br />
<br />
As for depth, Diablo has *never* been a game of depth ;-) Just a click and kill game... I will never understand why it was popular at all. One thing I am certain of is quality... Blizzard has always put out quality, and I am sure WoW will be no different.<br />
<br />
Besides, we have a year to wait (at least...another Blizzard certainty is how far back their software gets pushed), and that gives me plenty of time to get sick of EQ again.<br />
<br />
Ah well, until then....canni canni canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I for one cant wait for EQ to be deposed. The game looks crap, plays crap, and is completely unbalanced now.<br />
<br />
Having said that it is an extraordinary game in many other ways, and considering its age and the pace of change within the computer games market has survived astonishingly well. It is high time it was knocked out once and for all though.<br />
<br />
Dragon Empires looks fine, and includes some of the game play ideas I liked in Shadowbane and DAoC. Not sure why you want to blast Blizzard, hehe couldnt resist sorry, but I think they make solid games. Comparing with some of their past creations is unfair imho as they were not of the same genre. There is a difference between a hack and slash and a mmorpg and I am sure they know it.<br />
<br />
Roll on the second generation online extravaganza :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well its not a blast on blizzard, they make excellant games, big props them, but the lineage they have created is of games that arent that deep in content, EQ is a living breathing thing , its going 24/7 its a virtual world more then it is a game. Something will dethrone EQ in this respect at some point, i mean there was a time when ultima was the undisputed king. As with all things it has its time and it will pass. Over the next 5-10 years i think things are going to get really amazing in this field, this is where the future of gaming and communication lie. Just think about slapping on your VR glasses and imersing yourself in a world like EQ and going to the beach in hawaii or battling a dragon or meeting people in a cafe thats in a cyber world.  Anyone ever read &quot;Snow Crash&quot; ? Personaly i cant wait to experience step and game evolution  as we go ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I fail to see why a company like Verant that had made no other games (not that I know of anyway) before they made EQ should be much better at making a successful online-game than a company like Blizzard that has made almost nothing but huge successes. And they even have the advantage of seeing what is good and what is bad in EQ/DAoC/AO.<br />
<br />
I will be very surprised if WoW isnt a much better and more entertaining game than EQ.</div></div><hr />

The problem will be that Blizzard tend to &quot;please the masses&quot;, including younger players and folks who just want to play once in a while. They did this with most of their last products, which ended in click-and-go adventures. When Verant started EQ noone expected the huge commercial breakthrough it achieved later on.<br />
I really hope that WoW is more than a nice animated multiplayer game. But I have my doubts.<br />

<br />
Bliz knows it has a big challenge ahead of it. That's why they picked up a couple of endgame EQ players. Tigole wasn't afraid to tell Sony what was wrong, and I hope he does the same for Blizzard. I don't think EQ will truly die for some time (it's hard to kick established games out of a top spot-- look at Half-Life), I'm optimistic that WoW will at least be successful. While I don't neccisarily agree with the over-micromanagement in Warcraft 3, it's a much more complex method of design than a game with no army restrictions, and it's very well balanced. Diablo may have been terribly repetitious, but it was genuinely challenging in upper levels of difficulty, and it was still a very fun game, especially on a LAN. Then there was Starcraft, probably the best overall RTS game ever made. Every time I've gotten my hands on up a Blizzard game I've plowed through it in a week or so, then picked it up several months later and appreciated the intricate complexity of it. Use of hacks ruined these games more than anything for me, but for how little checking they do it's to be expected.<br />
I'll admit it, I have very high hopes and expectations for WoW, but Blizzard has yet to put out any title that sucked. I don't think their foray into MMOG will be any different, and the use of their precious Warcraft name makes me think they'll do it right. Even if they don't-- hell, WoW has a better established history than Norrath. /hopewishpray</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, that sounds like a terrible idea! We certainly cant have people log in for less than 6 hours and still have fun. LOL<br />
<br />
Much better to please kids, unemployed and others who can play 24-7. Much better to have classes that are WAY more powerful and useful than others. EQ is gonna be hard to beat hehe.<br />

The single most important thing EQ has going for it is all the damn days/years most of us has invested in our characters. Thats whats going to be hard to compete with not the actual game.</div></div><hr />

And we will.  20 years till the anti-aging drug/treatment is commonplace.  10 more long years till a vaccine for HIV is finally patented (so wear them jimihats).

1. I work 40-50 hours a week, but still have 2 chars 60+ and enjoying the game. And I know many more ... so much for your &quot;kids, unemployed&quot; statement.<br />
2. Yes, it would be nice to just log on for 1 hour, fight a bit, and then do something else. But it would make a totally different game. The main thing about EQ is: It's damn addictive cause investing more time gets you to see new places and doing new stuff.<br />
3. If you worry about the hours &quot;lost&quot;, why do you even play?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Walliss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What I think he means in &quot;pleasing the masses&quot; is like wc3 oversimplifying the game to &quot;dumb&quot; it down making the game pretty much shallow (wich WC3 is imo), Blizzards track record does not bode well for WoW but I will try a game out no matter the press on it. I like to see for myself instead of listening to people prattle on about good/bad points of a game.<br />
<br />
Most of the recent blizzard games have been shallow and lacking any what I like to call character, this is where EQ makes up. It may not look or play the best but has the most depth of any MMORPG to date, with all the pretenders trying to catch up to it.<br />
<br />
Working for a game review magazine you learn to ignore other &quot;reviews&quot; of a game and to sample it for yourself.  Other games that have been totaly slated by others may suit your style so best thing to do is try it out fer yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Pretty graphics are a nice feature but they won't make the game - AC2's graphics are far superior to EQ's and AC2 is no EQ-killer.<br />
<br />
WOW has a decent shot at unseating EQ, but EQ has survived AO, DAOC, AC and AC2, and lots of others.  Wait and see.</div></div><hr />

And even THAT isn't enough to keep some of us playing. <br />
<br />
I played since P4 and started new toons the day of release. Valgoth was born a couple of months later (May 1999), however, even considering how many real life days I have invested in the character, I'm 100% done with EQ. I've taken breaks before, but always knew I'd be back. Not this time. EQ isn't even installed on *any* of my machines any more. I tried coming back a couple of months ago. That only lasted about 4 weeks (enough time to level my Cleric to 45) before uber burn out set in again.<br />
<br />
Done. Through. Adios EQ.<br />
<br />
WoW, and to a lesser extent Horizons, promise more fun for the more casual player. I'm willing to give them a chance and am looking forward to both (really looking forward to trying my hand at playing a Dragon in Horizons :)).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">For those saying Blizzard games are shallow or lacking depth of design. Ask yourself this: How many of those games did you finish?<br />
<br />
Personally I have played every one through to the end, although after that point I never played much more. Starcraft, Diablo, Warcraft. They all have good story and character development in my opinion and they tie it all together well. <br />
They had just the right blend of addictiveness/story and great character animations without getting overly bogged down in complex details.<br />
<br />
There is VERY few other pc games I have purchased and actually played through to the end before moving on to something else.<br />
<br />
On an aside note:<br />
One other game that I know verant/989 studios was involved with pre-EQ was Tanarus. An online tank battle game. Rather fun in its day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I agree &#8211; the worst thing that one of these new games can do is to &#8220;dumb down&#8221; its use for the masses. I feel a lot of new games are throwing around a lot of eye-candy and graphic appeal, but when it comes down to it, they are trying to make the operation of the game simple enough for a 5-year-old. I&#8217;m sorry, but hitting auto-attack and sitting there for 5 minutes watching a meticulously rendered character execute a bunch of combat moves on a meticulously rendered giant without me doing anything during that time just doesn&#8217;t appeal to me. After the oooohs and aaaaahs of the graphics wear off, you are left with a game that isn&#8217;t fun or challenging to play. The gaming industry could learn a lesson from the movie industry &#8211; sure the canned summer &#8220;blockbusters&#8221; with tons of explosions and graphics and .01% plot and character development are going to score some cash on opening weekend but they&#8217;re going to have real problems keeping the movie in theaters and even bigger problems selling the DVDs.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m not saying that any of the games coming up are doing this &#8211; but it is definitely a possibility. I think WOW looks really nice and I am going to definitely check it out &#8211; I just hope they decide to develop plenty of content to go along with the graphics and don&#8217;t eliminate the numerical aspects of the games (I think as a general rule, people like to see stats, level, amount of XP etc. &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why game developers think we want them to hide or do away with all of that)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Starcraft is still getting patches, and its battle net is still going strong.<br />
<br />
And it predates EQ by 2 years.<br />
<br />
Strategy, build orders, micro, different maps, triggered maps.  All of these are very in depth game concepts that you don't have to go into too deep if you don't want to, but that doesn't mean the depth isn't there.  The cheating is similar to what you can see with Show EQ (though admittedly the information you get is far more crucial and can win you the game)  You can sit down and play for 30 mins, or you can play for hours upon hours.<br />
<br />
Diablo 2 is still getting patches (the next one scheduled is suposed to be a game changer, almost as big as a whole expansion) and battle net is certainly going strong.<br />
<br />
thousands of weapons, exciting story, PvP, dynamic world, and on realm, very little cheating.  Skill trees, item choices, horadric cube recipies, gambling, super uniques, socketing.  All of these are concepts with a lot of depth if you want to go into it that deep... but you don't have to to play the game well.  You can drop in, run through act one get a few items and quit, maybe level a bit.  People who play more and longer of course are more powerful.<br />
<br />
Warcraft 3 has been out less than a year, it was a HUGE battle net success.  its still getting patches (of course)<br />
<br />
Four races, each of them drastically different, a host of units, many heros for each race, each with their own skill trees and item choices, and strengths and weaknesses, troop choice, the depth of this game is incredible, you can do frame checking to figure out if a ghoul is really faster than a foot soldier, and compare weapon vs. armor types to identify the truly best counter to an opponents unit.  Gathering expansions, rush or tech, creeping, a VERY deep game if you want it to be, or it can just be an RTS.  I'm in the Beta... and, like other blizzard games, the expansion will change EVERYTHING again.  for the better, mass doesn't work anymore you have to do varied troop choices, ect.  switching strategies on a dime is possible and necessary, even more depth to the game.  You can jump in and play a game whenever you want.  Of course, the longer you play the better you are.<br />
<br />
If not all, most of Blizzards games were Game of the Year.  Have continual online support, and are generally, very balanced.  amazing considering the difference of a damage point in their games can make a creature useless or overpowered.  Bugs are fixed quick.  Last week there was a bug in beta that let you get nearly infinte tomes for your hero, playing was a pain if you didn't want to cheat, 3 or 4 days later it was fixed.  The team LISTENED when people yelled about the Huntress heavy armor nerf, and it was changed back, and the game was better for it.  Blizzard has obviously worked with verant, or are fans of their games, take a look at some unit names, and ability names and concepts.  Blizzard also works with WoTC (if you don't know them... just disregard the statment) which lends them to knowing a LOT about the jenre and being about to put huge amounts of depth in the game with just a bit of research and borrowing.<br />
<br />
the game will be continually delayed.  but it will be amazing.  you will be able to be a simpleton and play it, or you can calculate the exact timing of your canni-dance-like ability and figure out your DPS and your Mana to health best ratio and talk about your AA (skill trees) and argue about race choices.  the UI will be utterly gorgeous and easily used, and most liekly customizeable. and the game will look pretty with low system reqs.  Because that's what ALL blizzard games are.  Blizzard is all about attention to detail.  they wont put in a quest unless its solved. and while they may have bugs *every* game does, they will be fixed.  Balance will be messed with.  I don't see manastones just &quot;not dropping&quot; in game anymore, they will nerf the existing ones and make a suitable replacement.  If Cheal is too powerful, they will change it.  Will I play WoW? who knows, it depends on if I can find a class I really like (aka shaman hee hee) and if my friends play it, which is the only reason I still play EQ :-)<br />

Yea i remember that, they under estimated the client base they were going to have logging on on day 1 is all. I cant really hold that against them, it was frustrating , but a simple network setup error. The game was more popular then they thought was all. Personaly its a error i can forgive and it would be hard to not learn from that mistake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I too work 40 hours a week and have 2 characters that are 62 and I do still enjoy the game most of the time.<br />
<br />
The problem for a &quot;casual&quot; player like me is that my choices are getting more and more restricted and getting together more than one group of people in less than 30 minutes can be a real chore. And then there is the very real risk that the mob we are gathering to fight will be attacked by others before we get there.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that WoW somehow eliminates this possibility of complete strangers preventing me and my friends from doing things we have planned. Im hoping for spawnable parallel dungeons that are designed to be crawled through and not just with x number of camps where a named pops once in a week. And if you make it through then the next time you &quot;spawn&quot; the dungeon it will be more difficult/challenging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Zorshaaka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I have to agree with some here on the fact that Blizzard may be the ideal developers for the next generation game. Let me explain;<br />
<br />
I work, and work hard. My lvl 65 Shaman was a result of a lot of hard play, and a 6 month period of redundancy well spent :) I have been playing for 3 years or so. My question is this, would it really have been that bad if in that time I had been able to develop 2/3 characters of lvl 60+ in the same time? For my money it would not at all, especially if the &quot;gameplay&quot; was significantly better. It would give small to medium sized guilds more flexibility, and if there was more to do at the high end in terms of varied challenges and areas to explore would not lead to overcrowding.<br />
<br />
How many here relish the task of lvling another char in another game over the same time you have spent in EQ? I for one do not. What I am looking for in the next gen game is something that focuses more on gameplay and less on char development. That does not mean less depth, just less time to do it.<br />
<br />
Unreal Tournament has arguably a larger online comunity than EQ, (please dont flame that I do not have figures, it serves to illustrate a point). The focus in that game is immediate gratification based on &quot;skill&quot;. Now I do not think Unreal is that skilled, but it does undeniably have some. My dream is a game that in some way compliments both views. A game that can be picked up and provide an absorbing degree of char developnment with some fast paced action, and a whole raft of other rpg elments as well.<br />
<br />
Imagine a world where you can log in and head over to the arena for some varied, team based action against random and increasingly difficult foes. Or maybe you get a call saying your guilds armour merchant is being raided by your arch enemies, so off you dash to aid in the defence of your home town. Or perhaps the realm you play in has just managed to steal a major relic/artifact and you know that aint going to go down well. Better head to the rally point to see if you can secure it before &quot;they&quot; come to retrieve it. Or maybe you decide to go and see the fabled city of xxxxx, simply because it is so beautiful. Or decide to see if the Giant King is home in the hope he has dragged his flamming sword of whatever out of the armoury for the ceremony of whomever so he can die and let you loot it from his dismembered corpse, and when you wield it the flames lick along its blade and all around stare in awe at your new toy.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have a reputation for developing fast paced rpg games. I am hoping they will bring some of that experience to the WoW while not ignoring what has made EQ the no 1 mmorpg for the best part of 3 years.<br />
<br />
I can and do imagine a game just like that. Whats more the technology we posses today is easily capable of creating just such a world. All it takes is the imagination and commitment to do so. Truth is the only area anyone will spend the kind of money involved to get it done is an online persistent world with a steady revenue stream. So fingers crossed guys cause its coming. I can feel it :)<br />
<br />
Whether it is WoW or Dragon Realms or one of the other games in development today has yet to be seen.</div></div><hr />

2268 servers, 4241 players   <br />
<br />
online right now from gamespy , even if we multiply it 8 times taking into account that other programs are used and in game browser and such it still doesnt come close to the people that are on EQ at any given moment. Not a flame , just facts.<br />
<br />
Now comaring UT2k or Quake3 to EQ is difficult. Its to different styles of gameplay and ways of thinking in making the game. I do understand what you mean cause i to have been looking for a medium between the 2. A couple weeks ago i found http://planetside.station.sony.com/<br />
<br />
It seems like it is going to try to bridge the gap between the 2 worlds and looks very intresting. Check it out ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Half Life<br />
Players online: 62,781<br />
<br />
And this is just Gamespy's service, and it's not even noon EST yet. Half-Life makes EQ's numbers look chump.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Planetside looks like something I wouldnt touch with a ten foot pole:<br />
<br />
- A massively multiplayer FPS where the people you are fighting probably have accumulated tons of equipment and ranks.<br />
<br />
- And it has real-time weather and environmental factors. If there is something in EQ I wish I could turn off its the weather. Weather might be interesting the first time you see it but it very very soon gets to be nothing more than annoying.<br />
<br />
- And the zones are so big that you need a vehicle to be of any use at all.<br />
<br />
That looks like a whole lot of non-fun for most people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Actually, your points about Planetside are all wrong.<br />
<br />
#1 There is no persistent equipment to give anyone an advantage. You gain certificates that enable you to do extra things with your character, but you can only have a couple at a time. Aka, you give up the ability to drive a tank, in order to gain the ability to pilot a dropship. That's all the &quot;experience&quot; does for you. A brand new character is nearly equal to someone that will be playing for years. Everyone can shoot a gun.<br />
<br />
#2 Weather, shrug..personal opinion. Affecting equipment and abilities lends another level of strategy to the game of planetside. <br />
Eq weather IS pointless and just annoying to lower the field of view, eq mobs still see and aggro you at the same distance so weather just hinders the player.<br />
  <br />
#3 There is multiple ways to get around; vehicles are just one option. There is moveable &quot;spawn&quot; points so even after death you can be back in the thick of battle, and orbital drops, not to mention the standard ground/air vehicles.</div></div><hr />
