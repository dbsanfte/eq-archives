Ok, is it just me, or are the rest of you frustrated by people wanting to halt the group to get KEI, or a refresh on KEI, or who spend more than 5 minutes looking for KEI before they will start the group?<br />
<br />
Now, if I'm forming a group up, and someone who is to join us wants to get KEI first, fine.  As long as they aren't taking all day about it.<br />
<br />
The WORST is when someone's KEI runs out and they feel the need to disband and gate out to pok or wherever to find it, halting the group's progress.<br />
<br />
UGH!  Am I just totally insensitive?  This gets on my nerves like crazy! I love KEI just like anyone else but even without canning I can do my job without it.  SHEESH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is annoying, but the benefit over time is usually worth it unless the lengths they go to to get kei is just ridiculous.  Your caster DD's take a pretty big hit on their damage output without kei.  So, over time, you'll probably get more exp over time if you take a 5 minute break every 4 hours to refresh kei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No, you aren't insensitive. People needing KEI constantly is almost as bad as the people that need Spirit of the Wolf when they have RS3 or non-tanks that demand agility. The only difference is that KEI does something.<br />
<br />
What really kills me is when they take all the time to get KEI on their top buff slot then cry when it gets dispelled by the third mob in the dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was in an LDoN group last night that almost missed getting into the dungeon because of a Druid wanting to get KEI. We zoned in with 4 minutes left. I was annoyed.<br />
<br />
It isn't that I care if a person wants KEI or not, I don't. Grab your KEI, come on down. But don't come to the group, get the adventure and then decide &quot;hey, I think I want a KEI&quot;. It sucks.<br />
<br />
In the end, he didn't even need it. He wasn't blasting away, wasn't snaring, I actually don't know what he was doing beyond casting the 4 spot heals I asked him to and occasionally regenning people. But he sure needed that KEI :p Bleh, silly people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm a big fan of KEI and haven't encountered this situation yet...but I'm sure I'd find it a bit annoying.  However...if you're in a group where your grinding for that long then taking a little 10 minute or so break probably wouldn't hurt.  You know, rest your eyes, stretch a little, etc.  :)<br />
<br />
My pet KEI peeve is when I join an LDoN group and all 6 people finally show up and somebody says, &quot;brb, running to PoK to get KEI&quot; - that drives me nuts...be considerate of others and get your freaking KEI before you join the group or as soon as you find out you're in a group.<br />
<br />
I'll admit to being a major KEI addict.  I almost always group or duo and the pace is always very fast (usually LDoN or me and BL friend doing chain pulls) so even with carpal canni action I can still use all the mana I can get.<br />
<br />
Fortunately I seem to group with quite a few 60+ or soon to be KEI-enabled enchanters so chances are that if I'm doing extended nonLDoN grouping I'll have KEI with me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does any character have to have KEI to function?  Of course not.  But then we also don&#8217;t have to have port books or the bazaar.  Heck we don&#8217;t even need the extra bank space, much less shared bank and plat slots.  However, they make the game easier and/or more fun to play.  My regular group usually handles KEI as a group.  If our casters, including myself, and especially our cleric have KEI we can take on tougher mobs and kill them faster than we could without it.  Now days we usually do LDoN adventures and we obviously don&#8217;t stop for KEI if someone runs out, but it can slow down our adventure.  <br />
<br />
However, when or if to refresh KEI is very situational.  If pausing a group for a quick KEI refresh isn&#8217;t going to disrupt the group then its no big deal.  Heck, in some of the all day groups I&#8217;ve been in such breaks were looked forward to as they would also give us a chance to stretch our legs and take care of certain biological needs.  But if breaking for KEI is going to disrupt the group for some reason then it&#8217;s not worth messing with.  As long as the group is willing to take the slower manna regen into account and take things slower then everyone should be willing to continue on.  <br />
<br />
But I must say that after playing my shaman for so long I&#8217;m terribly spoiled.  For my first year in EQ I played a druid and a ranger, depending on my mood.  My druid is level 51 and I honestly don&#8217;t think I could stand returning to him as a main.  The idea of having to sit and wait for my manna to regenerate all by itself really turns me off.  So I tend to sympathize with any caster class that can&#8217;t regenerate their own manna in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I freely admit to getting KEI whenever I can.  More mana = more power, quite simply.<br />
<br />
However, I agree with you; if your KEI got dispelled, or you just died and got rezzed, or it ran out, then suck it up and deal.  At least, that what I do.  My only exception is under-geared clerics.  I would much rather wait for the cleric to go get KEI than have to do 1/2 of his job for him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">C4 and C5 are great.  But don't let them be a burden.  There are other ways to regen mana such as kei, it wouldn't hurt you to take advantage of it.  You may find out that you like doing damage instead of chain casting C4.  I will never understand the shamans reluctance to take advantage of mana regen spells and flowing thought items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I will never understand the shamans reluctance to take advantage of mana regen spells and flowing thought items.<br />
It's by no means a reluctance. It's a refusal to be bound to such things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I agree it's situational. The people who rely on KEI and only KEI for regen mostly need it to keep up with the pace.<br />
<br />
What's worse is when people start complaining about mana breaks and lack of buff refreshes then complain about KEI run's. Can't have it both ways, if your willing to slow down and wait for someone to regen mana then you have a good point.<br />
<br />
And typically this is a melee rant mostly, casters will have to wait for them to regen endurance pretty soon I'm betting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It's a refusal to be bound to such things. <br />
<br />
I hate being bound by my #8 hotkey.  Having kei reduces the number of times I have to push it.<br />
<br />
I know there is a certain amount of pleasure derived from being able to do things on your own, but isn't there anything else you can think of to do besides chain casting c4?  nuke? heal? pull? anything?<br />
<br />
I mean, do you always pick your ass first, then pick your nose?  No you normally go staight to pickin the nose.  Cut out the middleman, I say pick your nose more often!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">For me it has nothing to do with relying or not relying on something, it comes down to consideration. If I am heading to a group and I see &quot;selling KEI at...&quot; in the zone I'm in, I'll grab it. If I am heading out to solo and I see the same message, I'll grab it. <br />
<br />
I will not make people wait for it for me to grab it if all it will do is make things &quot;easier&quot; on me. If I am in a situation where canni'ing simply won't keep up then that's a different story and people either need to accept that things slow do or they wait. But, more often than not, that isn't the situation - like it wasn't for me and my group last night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol, something that did really bother me yesterday, had a cleric named Melleincleric as main healer in ldon group yesterday, now I dont mind anyone meleeing once in a while but this cleric was demanding haste and was still meleeing on more than once when the MT was at like 30% health, what a fricken moron and promply got added to /ignore right after the ldon lol. (we did win though which amazes me, since it was a hard adventure).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was in a group a couple weeks ago and we went into an adventure, started doing really good and about 30 mins in I used ToS near a chest.<br />
<br />
Now... nukes can't be casted on chests, but apparently AoEs can hit them. How was I to know? :(<br />
<br />
So the chest turns out to have a dispell trap, everyone in the dungeon gets hit with three waves and get nearly all their buffs removed. I already hear a few people cry about losing KEI and that maybe they should go back for a refresh.<br />
<br />
I just tell them, look, lets buff back up with what we have here and keep going, conserve mana as needed. <br />
<br />
We continued on and even got a few bad pulls and had to take on several mobs at once. Yet we still managed to finish the adventure with time to spare.<br />
<br />
Just goes to prove... if ya know how to play, KEI is not needed. :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never zone to get a clarity (okay, if a group member tells me to come over one zone, he is donating for a group clarity - done that twice so far)<br />
<br />
It takes me a few minutes to notice clarity has dropped.  when I have to wait for canni 5 to pop a couple of times in a rwo, I will look to see if clarity dropped, and adjust my nukage accordingly.<br />
<br />
Druids and clerics are clarity addicts, as a rule.  I shake my head after waiting 10 minutes for a cleric to go get clarity, and then they are meleeing cause they are bored waiting to cast a heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate that myself.  If I decide I want a KEI, I get it before I ever put up LFG.  I kinda expect people to do that themselves, not just wait until we have the adventure and decide oh I need KEI or I need virtue or whatever.  Ugh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're missing the point entirely. A lot of players, Shamans among them, believe that they MUST have KEI to do anything. It's not the case, and it's really aggrivating. In some cases it's actually detrimental to the group. KEI just makes things go more smoothly. I really wonder how many people have never completed an adventure without having some form of mana regen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i get c3 to help my group. i'm only slower ALOT and backup healer. i need mana to keep my group alive. slow=less dmg taken by MT=less mana used for healing=less downtime=more killing=more exp/loot. it's not just opinion, you MUST HAVE mana to slow. unless you have a click-effect item or proc weapon (mine for example, Di`Zok Oracle Shillelagh, but hardly ever procs at all) but those are rare. i've seen a wep that clicks slow, but it's No Drop (no Bazaar for it) and the only over thing that even has Slow as an effect is the wep i have.<br />
<br />
the very first part of that long paragraph is only my situation: i only have Canni1. never bothered to Canni2 quest cause when i found out, was already lvl 45 or so, and sounded hard/too long to be worth it. so i figured i'd just ride it out til 54, and Canni3. (3 more levels to go  :D)<br />
<br />

I can do fine without it (as I did from 1 - 44) but using it adds to my effectiveness.  And it doesn't matter how much mana regen I have - I still canni nonstop.  I can always find something to do with mana...and it kind of bothers me to be at full mana or full health if I'm doing anything in the way of adventuring/xping.  There's always a spell to cast!</div></div><hr />

Canni 1 + Stoicism is quite effective. It is what I use, I'm level 53. <br />
<br />
With my perma-group I am the tank, slower, resist debuffer etc. I've had KEI twice with that group since hitting 46. Even when fighting yellow/red cons hitting me for 195 I didn't need KEI to function. It would make things easier, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

Thats what KEI is ... a nice EXTRA ... When you have a chanter in your group should you expect KEI .. yes you should hes there .. have him cast it .. why shouldnt he ..<br />

<br />
Alot of shaman here have the idea stuck in their heads somehow that kei isn't worth the trouble to get, such as grimbear there, and perhaps yourself.<br />
<br />
You can play without any gear on and do your shamanly duties..that doesn't mean it isn't much better for yourself and your group to actually wear your equipment. Similarly, even though you can play without kei, it is much better for yourself and your group if you get it instead of &quot;well only if the enchanter is in my group&quot; or &quot;I don't need it, I have canni 5&quot;. <br />
<br />
There's a difference between being a capable shaman able to do without when you have to and being stupid and ignoring the benefits to be had out of an inflated ego.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's a difference between frustration/disgust with people acting as though they are unable to function without kei, which is what the person you quoted is talking about, and not looking a gift horse in the mouth, which is what you're arguing, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
And KEI is 'nice' for shaman,  That's it though.  140 (or 160 or whatever)  mana a minute is a big deal for medding classes, but it's just not as proportionally beneficial for shaman.  At least at 65 with Cannibalize AA, I have much more of a problem getting the mana out fast enough than I do generating it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Just too Clarify ...<br />
I do like KEI . I do think KEI is worth getting so long as you dont create hasstle or downtime too get it .<br />
KEI is a buff , a good buff ... BUT thats all it is ... a buff .. period .<br />
<br />
Every class in the game &quot;except beastlords&quot; once lived in a world without KEI . They still advanced too 60 with few problems . My problem is with people that act like KEI is a peice of gear , like the loss of it makes them useless .<br />
If I was in a group with a Melee that was fighting with 2 1hs weapons and he suddenly felt he needed too switch too a 2hs weapon but said he forgot it in his bank . Thusly the entire group must now STOP everything and wait while he runs too PoK too fetch his 2hs .. id feel the same way .</div></div><hr />

I get along without em, but they are nice to have. i don't really mind someone going to get kei when we getting started, but it does piss me off when they gotta leave in the middle of the group. The cleric who's constantly medding and having trouble with mana wants to go grab one though I have no problem with, I'll keep the group alive while he goes and it keeps the group going smoother.</div></div><hr />

Dude, before kei existed normal exp mobs couldn't 1 round a caster and they didnt have 64k hitpoints.  <br />
<br />
Not everyone sits in a 6 man group waiting for a cleric to pacify the surround mobs and have a tank pull, rinse and repeat.  <br />
<br />
I hate to spend time exping cause its so damn boring.  When I do exp I play EXTREME EQ (tm).  It always involves me pulling or tanking, we never have less than 1 charmed pet with mage items in the group, it always involves chain pulling and pacificing and feign death are not allowed.  I simply couldnt play to that level without kei, and I doubt many shaman could.  <br />
<br />
Sure I could sit around casting cann4 all day long, but if I'm doing that I can't be moving, and if I cant moving I'm not having fun.<br />
<br />
I want the maxium effectiveness out of my group members and myself, because I want to spend the least amount of time possible exping.  So yeah I insist people have kei.<br />
<br />
Then again if no one is around to cast it I can simply log in a chanter to cast it for me.  Maybe I'm spoiled.</div></div><hr />

Really? I have -never- been at a spot where I had more mana than I could use. Not even with canni5, CoM, VoQ, pot9, and SD. There is always something more to do.<br />

Completely illogical. You can not possibly be just as effective at X mana regen as at X+KEI. You or your group are operating at a subpar level. That's around a free quiesc every minute, a free nuke every 2 minutes, a free dot or rain every 3 minutes, an 11 dps drop in your potential damage capabilities.<br />
<br />
You are being lazy and a subpar shaman if you do not make the effort to keep kei up as much as possible. There are some situations where it does not pay(short term groups or ldon) to get a refresh as needed, but those are the (rare) exceptions to the rule.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Everyone has their own par level and I do not play the game to min/max, so we are talking about two entirely different games here. You wanna powergame, more power to you. Game is supposed to be fun, fun to me means that I'll take time to actually talk and socialize with the people I'm playing with. And since we're not usually a group that has 3-4 mobs in camp, that is why I'm able to sustain my role in the group without it. So you should say that if you are min/maxing your gaming experience, then someone is being a lazy subpar Shaman for not making an effort to keep KEI up, and your rule is only applicable to your playstyle, which is not everyone's<br />

Again I say .. I dont click off KEI ... its a nice tool ... But too say that im &quot;sub par&quot; becase I dont get a buff from some guy in PoK inbetween every adventure is nonsence .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I think some people need a reality check. Some people want to slice through at 50 mobs per minute with less than ideal group makeup and zero downtime. Get their 2% AA a second and or 46 Adventure points for 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Hey thats all and well, using whats available in game to get what you want accomplished is fine. KEI is a tool to be used as such, heck im lazy the less i have to canni the better, dont have canni5 yet. KEI lets me relax and enjoy the 'game'. Do I need it? of course not, do I want it? Yes.<br />
<br />
People will always come to differences in opinion about everything in this game, while I too wouldn't want to stop in the middle of a fight for a caster to go get KEI, if hes having a hard time keeping up with the pace we want to keep up with i say go for it, unless he needs a half hour to find one.<br />
<br />
I Think its true some have become dependant on KEI to play, only cause they have become accustomed to it. I dont think a druid is gonna be running around a zone quad kiting over and over for 2 hours without a KEI.<br />
<br />
It typical attitude these days, everyone want it now or faster, and the cheaper the better.</div></div><hr />

Either you are saying you don't need kei because you can regen enough mana without it to do your job to its fullest(which is false for the reasons stated above), or you want to talk and socialize more so you don't get a kei(which would lessen the need for canni and enable you to worry less about mana and more about chatting).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sure it does, since we're focusing on LDON right now, lets say for example I'm in a group with two wizards, a bstlord, a cleric who has a hefty desire to be some sort of wizard/pally combo, and a tank.  The mob usually drops before I can get much of a spell off (btw no this is not an unusual group for me at all the bstlord and cleric I've grouped with forever and they have some overwhelming desire to aquire mages and wizards for LDON groups.).  These guys are power gamers, not in elementals yet but give you an example the cleric when he came back after an aborted trip to Iraq was lvl 58 with run 3, one MONTH later lvl 65 with 142 aa.  Bstlord had a similar experience himself I've known these guys like I said forever they do tend towards the power gamer side.  In above typical group hell I usually only have time to heal and toss a nuke mobs dead.  If I'm doing canni like I usually do I'm getting about FT70 or so out of it between canIV and can5.  When I have to start inventing ways of using up the mana (yes chain rain spells would do it nicely but when your root parking in cramped quarters thats sometimes not ideal, but yes thats a tactic i've used), what is an extra ft 14 going to give me thats beyond game changing.  <br />
<br />
When I solo in tactics I dont go OOM, the mob typically drops in 5 minutes without KEI and within 10-15 secs as fast with.  Its not game changing for me in either scenario which I commonly find myself in.<br />
<br />
Most all of your arguments are totally valid the only thing I take exception to is when you tell me how much I suck because I dont pay some guy in pok 50pp.  When i get bane for root rotting in tactics which will cause me to use another dot sure KEI would  probably enhance my effectiveness, when I get spell Haste IV or better and I'm not waiting so long on cast time for velium strike and Blood of Saryn, sure i imagine KEI would show an appreciable gain in ability.  <br />
<br />
You see I do play 40+ hours a week on my shaman, and from my recent playing of my enchanter I know how bad most shaman seem to suck (lvl 55 range and none of which have ever visited this board it seems), so yes I take offense that I need KEI for every and all situations, I have it alot of course, I'll grab it if its there for safety buffer, I usually have it most times when I log in due to my guild leader casting it on a raid finishing up before he logs.<br />
<br />
But your painting with a broad sweeping brush a well hell the majority of the shaman population that reads this board and I can verify that the shamans who read this board regularly are not subpar in anyway shape or form, trust me I know when they do in a group or raid, and I typical verify this fact. Who do you think helps his group more the KEI addicted shaman who runs around and plays his class half assed never cans because he hasnt learned useful things like canni-dancing, root parking, actualy doing the stocism quest when they're in their mid 40's or the shaman that has done all this and read faithfully and worked on improving how they play the game but doesnt have KEI.  Tell me who sucks there and is a subpar shaman.<br />
<br />
Note, I'm not here to bag on you or redirect the claim back that you are a subpar shaman, I'm sure your an excellent one, but you lack a similar skill to &quot;historical imagination&quot; where people have a hard time understanding decisions made in the past because they fail to realize what applies to their needs may not have applied back then.  Much the same way you fail to realize that your statement is not nearly as cut and dry as you think it is.<br />
<br />
In summary, KEI great buff, like all outside buffs in a group solo situation not needed, and shaman who dont go to the ends of the earth every 4 hours to spend 50pp to get it are not lousy shamans (can4+5 &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;kei).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Really? I have -never- been at a spot where I had more mana than I could use. Not even with canni5, CoM, VoQ, pot9, and SD. There is always something more to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ldon.  Malo mob, slow mob, dot if it's gonna live for thirty seconds, then rain, or just rain if it's going down fast.  What else did you want to stick in there?<br />
<br />
KEI is equivilent to 2 extra casts of cann4 a minute.  Maybe it's just because I grew up without it, but that just screams &quot;BFD&quot; to me.  I can find the extra 4 second dead spot I need to cast cann4 twice without much trouble in most groups.<br />
<br />
Again, it's nice, but I'm hardly crippled without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Coccyx Oracle of Thule</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">had a cleric named Melleincleric as main healer in ldon group yesterday, now I dont mind anyone meleeing once in a while but this cleric was demanding haste and was still meleeing on more than once when the MT was at like 30% health, what a fricken moron and promply got added to /ignore right after the ldon lol. (we did win though which amazes me, since it was a hard adventure).<br />
<br />
So let me see if I have this right...<br />
<br />
The Cleric was able to<br />
<br />
1)Keep everyone alive<br />
2)Use Complete Heal efficiently<br />
3)Maintain sufficient mana while standing<br />
4)Add extra DPS<br />
<br />
So you put him on ignore. And HE is the moron? Have you parsed a cleric with that summoned hammer they get?<br />
<br />
From what I can tell, your group was at no time in any danger, so the Cleric decided to add some non-trivial DPS and you, for some odd reason, have a problem with hasting him.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should reevaluate your moron meter, it seems to be pointing in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Within my playstyle, I am doing all that is expected of me , and well enough to get comments from people I group with saying that they would like to add me to their friends list. This is generally because I have read this board for nearly the whole 2 years I have been playing EQ, and have used it's lessons wisely, something that pisses me off to no end when I see the Shaman I wind up grouped with when I play my Warrior not doing. You can easily tell who has read and learned from here and who has not. You can't seem to get your head around my style/pace of gameplay. You do not know my grouping demands, and again tell me that I am wrong based on YOUR gaming style. If you go back to my original post, I said that I do not leave my group at a standstill while I go run out and find a refresh, when I'm able to handle what is required perfectly well without it. I did not say that I never use it. In fact more often then not I will even make an attempt in PoK to grab one before joining a group. After that though, once it wears off or I die, then I just deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">kei isnt neccesary for shaman, for other classes thats a diferent story unless you want to slow down considerably.<br />
dont get me wrong, with VoQ+pot9+SD+bard song I am a happy little camper, but when my kie fades the group doesnt even skip a beat, when the cleric/druid/wizzy's kei falls things slow down. we are hardly the right class to even have the discussion, I agree with the rant though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">hell I usually only have time to heal and toss a nuke mobs dead<br />

<br />
<br />
but when your root parking in cramped quarters<br />
<br />
<br />
If there are root parked adds, I would say there are things for you do to past the nuke and heal on the engaged mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">i rarely get KEI cause its a show of class strength. Stupid as it is i not much gets a smile on my face when the KEI wizzy or cleric is OOM and i say  &quot; pull ill slow and heal &quot; with no KEI.<br />
<br />
Now if its cast on me im not going to click it off. But you will never catch me stopping a group ( especialy as a key class ) cause i need to get KEI. I just cant understand a shaman that would. Not a cut on them, i just dont get it.<br />
<br />
As the shaman in my group i find myslef keeping the group going while other members get KEI. I can tank and heal and do both at the same time in &quot;most&quot; situations effectivly enough to keep progress going while 1 or 2 or 3 people leave for kei or whatever.<br />
<br />
Thats how i deal with it i guess. I dont get frustrated, i  just take the reigns and keep on trucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">LOL i'm a KEI addict and I admit it, but I dont ever leave a group just to get KEI thats just silly, I get a fresh one whenever I go lfg.<br />

lol, something that did really bother me yesterday, had a cleric named Melleincleric as main healer in ldon group yesterday, now I dont mind anyone meleeing once in a while but this cleric was demanding haste and was still meleeing on more than once when the MT was at like 30% health, what a fricken moron and promply got added to /ignore right after the ldon lol. (we did win though which amazes me, since it was a hard adventure).<br />
<br />
Your example is one of the very reasons why I LOVE, absolutely LOVE Talisman of Alacrity. Let the cleric wave his lil hammer around, as long as he heals, he's automatically hasted along with everyone else and I don't have to hear about it. Trust me, my friend, you'll love this spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the kei question...<br />
I hate living without it. In fact, if I could I'd group with a druid &amp; bst and get my kei before group (before I trapse off!! I don't keep my group waiting if I can help it). Why? I can do more! True, dotting something to hell &amp; back gets you too much agro. But I like being able to Malo/slow/Anathema/Blood and not get whapped on (if it's an sk or pally MA of course) if I'm in BoT or just Malo/slow/anathema in Ldon. I contribute more. KEI FOREVER!! Just be considerate and come prepared. It's like some jerkwad coming to the group and asking &quot;Can I have some food &amp; water pls?&quot; Pisses me off!  I'm not your mama! /rant off :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">IMO any class that REFUSES to play because they dont have any single buff off another class should be taken out back and put down for their own sake and yours =p<br />
<br />
I dont have a prob if members of a group want to snag a c3, it's the folks that refuse to play without it that sicken me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">KEI is just another tool of convenience. I like it on when I choose to enjoy the tool. It is good to have in groups becuase it helps with mana regen and I work hard to keep buffs up on everyone as well as slow, root park, dot/nuke, etc. while keeping a nice &quot;emergency mana base&quot; for those unexpected moments of overpulling, resisted slows, aggro on the chanter/cleric times that happen.<br />
<br />
Do I need it? No, because I have also taken the time to work on how to keep my same level of ability (mana management) without it.<br />
<br />
Getting back to the original poster's question - I agree that getting a group together and then having group members take off for a few minutes in search of KEI stinks. It is rude to get to a group then rush off to do something that should of been done before getting to the group. Folks dependent upon KEI, or who even want for the convenience, need not inconvenience others through their oversite.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Maybe its time some of you admitted crack addicts revisited the, &quot;HP greater than all&quot; theory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">For the guy ranting on the melee cleric. We do nothing but hard adventures most nights my regular group is on. Between her flowing thought, self and other mana regen buffs, yaulp she litterally never needs to sit down even in fast paced LDoN. She melees pretty much the entire adventure. I'd suggest you be a little more open minded. The game isn't the same at 65 with good gear and buffs, clerics don't need to cast CH and sit down till the next CH anymore :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">What does hp have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
We're talking about taking advantage of free mana regen with no sacrifices at all vs not using all the tools available to you.<br />
<br />
Failing to use all the tools provided = not reaching your full potential<br />
<br />
It's a simple concept.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>blakhomer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">What does hp have to do with anything?<br />
<br />
Usually, nothing.  However in this case, the very same people who are addicted to the benefits of mana regen are the same people that belittle (maybe too strong a word) other's shaman choice of FT over HP gear.<br />
<br />
You said,<br />
<br />
Failing to use all the tools provided = not reaching your full potential<br />
<br />
and I agree.  However, I prefer Grafsha's<br />
<br />
Folks dependent upon KEI, or who even want for the convenience, need not inconvenience others through their oversite.<br />
<br />
The sacrifice being made here, in relation to the original poster's compaint, is the 5 people's time spent waiting on said, &quot;addict&quot;.  Its by no means &quot;free&quot; and there is plenty of &quot;sacrifice&quot; being imposed on the rest of the group.<br />
<br />
I hope that clarifies my position for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">I'm not addressing that complaint, my argument is with those shammies that disdain the use of kei or have the &quot;I do just as well without it&quot; attitude. <br />
<br />
Nowhere have I said I would drop a group to get it for myself(and I never have, although I have paid enchanters to come to my group and kei us all). On the other hand I'd rather the other members go get it instead of slowing the group down.<br />
<br />
As for the Ft vs HP, I've never argued that either...and most of the time Ft and HP come in the same package or with a rather small loss in hp(and it's more about focus effects than ft these days anyway, ft comes on its own).</div></div><hr />
