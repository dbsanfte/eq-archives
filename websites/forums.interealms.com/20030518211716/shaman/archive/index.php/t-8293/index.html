<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blaand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any good suggestions for where to hunt with my JBB at 45 ive been doing Bloodgills in LOIO which has netted decent exp, any suggestions woulod be nice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did Bloodgill Goblins till 46, just haste dogdog, slow both goblins on each spawn, and click away at the one dogdog is fighting.  With an icky Bp and Chloroplast on me, I could just circle the four towers killing constantly.  On the second lap, it's even easier, at i could get to the spawn point before they spawned, so could pull them one at a time.<br />
<br />
At 46, I went to OOT to kill seafuries.  My AC was just over 900 self buffed, so I could park dogdog on the shore, pull with slow,  Then just let it hit me whilst I click away, easy ! I could kill 5 or 6 on the trop before needing to sit down and regen some health/mana.  I just hasted the dogdog and gave him my clicky Jaundiced Bone buffs, and when you get to 49, you can let the dogdog taunt a couple of time to get agro, and then let him do the tanking whilst you click and you won't be able to get agro back.  Don't let then run too far on their death march, in case of adds, sometimes, it's best to root them when they march, but it depends on which part of the shore you pull to.<br />
<br />
People have complained about quad kiters training them, but I haven't seen this once on Antonious Bayle, the Furbies just don't live long enough for someone to collect four !<br />
<br />
Watch out for Qued, he casts a nasty mana drain spell, very annoying, and avoid the tainted seafurbie, as he spawn the corrupted one who is nasty.<br />
<br />
Also if you can get the Gornit camp, it's good XP, and great loot, I could also pull two furbies between his spawns, so was constantly killing, just skipping the odd one to regen a bit.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I did seafurbies at 45, while I did gornit, and I could pull 2 in between the gornit spawns. Then when I needed to med I would just pull one in between the Gornit spawn.  I still prefer DL over this, the gnashers there seem to have alittle bit less hp than the seafurbies.  Ill be back in OOT probably at 49 where I could eat through them alittle faster.<br />
