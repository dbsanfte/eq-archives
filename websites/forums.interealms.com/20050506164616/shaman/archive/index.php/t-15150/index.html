<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was reading the beastlord forums to expand my knowledge and ran accross this thread..<br />
<br />
Have you run into any problems when grouping with beastlords?<br />
<br />
Personally the beastlords I have come accross have been a great asset and they have never tried to push me from my job of slowing or tried to replace me with a DPS class.<br />
<br />
Makes me wonder how many people feel the way this guy does??<br />

&quot;&quot;NunyaBizz, Beastlord&quot;&quot;<br />
I find most people either have no idea that we can slow by 65% (which BTW i defy anyone to tell the dif between our slow and shaman slow, other than it last 1/2 as long)....OR wrongly believe that a Shamans slow is for some reason vastly superior. <br />
Not only can we slow, IMO we do it MUCH better than a Shaman on mobs that arent super high resist, where you must have Malo or whatever to have a prayer of landing anything...in which case id still prefer to have a Mage in the group for Malo.... <br />
<br />
Reason being is our slow is faster, and if we get aggro we dont drop like a rock like your average Shaman...we can take a beating and keep on ticking... <br />
<br />
For instance i helped to do the PON Hedge event not long ago, when there were like 5,6,7 mobs at once I outslowed the TWO Shamans by 2 to 1......Plus tanked a few that were trying to kill the Enchanters...AND did more damage than the TWO Shamans combined..... <br />
<br />
Shamans to me anymore are nothing but a PITA in my group....  <br />
They usually have some kinda Tude, will force Focus down your throat no matter how many times you say you dont want it, even though you have already slowed the Mob and did so dirrectly behind the MT, so for the brief instance you have aggro it doesnt matter because you havent &quot;Ping-Ponged&quot; the mob and the MT easily regains aggro quickly with taunt...thats assuming you arent the MT in the first place  <br />
<br />
Unlike the Shaman which for some reason most will cast slow from about as far away from the MT as they can possibly get, and keep casting it til it sticks even though its already slowed and everything is fine....DOH! <br />
<br />
As for grouping, I started my Beast the day Beastlords existed and for the most part i soloed 98% to lvl 61 because it was just easier and less hassle than dealing with groups...Not that it was ever hard to GET a group, but usually most groups wouldnt last/stay together long enough and we would be in a place killing Mobs that *required* a group, so i would end up wasting time rebuilding group, and or going back to my solo spots anyway. <br />
Since 61 ive grouped 90% of the time, and find that i have no problem getting a group ever.....I get a /tell everyday asking if im LFG even if i dont have /LFG *ON*.....and when i do, like setting up for a raid I usually get a /tell before i get grouped for raid.... <br />
<br />
Any group that wouldnt want a Beast is a group O fools.... <br />
<br />
We are in a single group situation basically a ShaWarrMonkE.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The attitude expressed by the person you quoted seems about on par with everyone who has leveled fast and soloed 99% of their existance.<br />

<br />
I especially like the fact that he compares the fact that he gets asked if he is LFG is akin to him being a good player, laughable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmm lets see, any pickup group with an open slot!<br />
----<br />
While his english is teh suck..the points are valid.<br />
I can't think of anything that the shaman can do that would distinguish him/her.  Exception of MalX, beastlords can buff a single player nearly equivalent (more slot consuming though and duration sucks).  Slows are about the same.  As mentioned, a bst with /disc protect can take a beating off heavy hitting mobs until agro is reestablished.  Damage avoidance and mitigation on a beastlord is superior and we will mention that the dps is a plus for the beastlord.   <br />
<br />
As Slurm stated though..Grouped you learn what you can do best, and what others can do to make life easier<br />
<br />
Both classes can support each other and compliment well when put together.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Generally speaking, anyone who posts something like that is trying to convince themselves they're superior, because they're obviously feeling inferior for whatever reason.<br />

BL's are nice in groups... Shamans are nice in groups.  We're nice in groups together.   :cool: <br />
<br />
On the slow front, he obviously doesn't realize that there's a pretty big difference in 65% vs 75%.  If you're fighting mobs that dish out, say 500dps (sorry if that's insanely high or low - haven't parsed anything in PoP really, just going by things that hit for 500-ish, this sounds reasonable to me).  Over the long run, the shaman slow saves 3000hp/min in damage over the BL one (tank taking 125dps vs 175dps).  To compensate for this, BL's obviously bring other things to the table that we don't...  It's called balance.   ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Beastlords have a 1.5 second cast 65% slow.<br />
<br />
For an xp group fighting stuff that doesn't resist much (i.e.  Most of the xp zones in PoP) that is exactly what is needed.<br />
<br />
Take slow away from a shaman, the shaman never gets a group.  Take everything but slow away from a shaman and replace it with a few stackable buffs, melee and a pet, and the surprise surprise, the shaman gets groups.<br />
<br />
As shaman, we spent a long time as the king of the slow + surviving game.  Now we share the crown.  Whatever, at least there is a reason to have beastlords around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just before everybody starts flaming about this read the post this was taken from, his own board has already pulled his comments apart.  Hes an idiot, not all beastlords are.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not my intention to point out one idiots comments and have people believe all Beastlords are like that. We all know better.<br />
<br />
My main concern was not that this guy was ignorant about what we have to offer to a group, but the fact that some of his points are right on the money.  (Although most are a bit far fetched)<br />
<br />
I can actually see where he may have gotten some of these ideas...<br />
<br />
- Our DPS is very low in comparison to other classes.<br />
- If your not on a raid and you have a willing beastlord he can buff you almost as well / or better than a shaman could. (Since you will have the room for the extra icons)<br />
- If you have a DPS class instead of a Shaman in the last slot would he be able to make up the difference between beastlord slow and shaman slow.<br />
- Do we really drop like flies when aggroed (j/k) I know I don't in experience groups and I am so non-uber it's not even funny ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
I realize we are the jack of all trades, but it seems that in each expansion our abilities are diluted further..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">wow, that guy almost makes me want to jihad the whole thread, <br />
<br />
i get really annoyed by people who comare shaman to other robe wearing casters who die after agro, somone needs to explain to them the diffrence between a shaman and a druman</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The slow sounds nice, but again... it's 10% less than a shaman's... and the BST needs to be 65 for that... it's enough not to use it if there is a shaman present.  Just like enchanter slows.<br />
<br />
Shaman DoTs are quite a bit better than BSTs.  BSTs don't get a 2000-heal, Torpor, or Malo, either.  And shaman buffs will always be better than a BSTs.<br />
<br />
BSTs pets are incredible when buffed, and BSTs get some very nice weapons and decent nukes and DoTs to compliment the pet.  They have some nice utility spells.  They're a slimmed down shaman with more DPS.<br />
<br />
I could see BST and shaman being considered interchangeable in xp groups, but I'd still give the SHM the upper hand in raid desirability.<br />
<br />
BSTs seem to be pretty strong right now, and how they got that way, I don't know... 'cause when they came out they were viewed as weak and pathetic... and overnight they became one of the most powerful classes in the game.  I've got a hunch Sony is about to wack 'em with the nerf stick, and not 'cause they need to be.. but 'cause whenever a class gets good and powerful, they get good and nerfed before long.  BSTs fit that description, IMO, right now.  But I've been wrong in the past... once or twice...<br />
<br />
I never have a prob grouping with BSTs though, although honestly I don't see many of them, and it's rather rare when I get to group with one.  Not many BSTs in my guild, and I usually stick to guild groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">omg this guy pisses me off so much.....&quot;We dont get aggro and drop like a rock like your average shaman&quot; Who the **** did he group with?!?!? Not once have i droped like a rock because i got aggro, i might get aggro here and there but i dont drop like a rock. Plus focus of the 7th beats any bst lord buffs by far, with better stats and duration much much much longer. We also get dots and are pet isnt that bad making are dps decent. Plus we have some CC unlike beastlords, we can root park an add, but the bstlord would have to tank it wasting the clerics mana. Are slow also is 10% better then ares (yes you can see the difference) And when do bstlords get there 65% slow? yea lvl 65 we get ours at 51. Plus not alot of beastlords have that slow, its very expensive, but all 51+ shamans have there slow. I would just LOVE to group with that guy and show him what we can do...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They get their own hastes, slows, regen spells that stack to get to replenishment levels, acumen, better disease cures than a druid(matching our own), their nukes do as much damage as ours until velium strike, and they have a more powerful pet than anyone but mages.<br />
<br />
Long overdue for nerfing actually...but who knows how long they will continue to be SOE's number one pet class?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I can actually see where he may have gotten some of these ideas...<br />
<br />
- Our DPS is very low in comparison to other classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Umm... my DPS is not that low.  In most fights I am contributing 100+dps.  At least in an exp group, on a raid I am busy doing other stuff.<br />
<br />
-Blood of Saryn is 54dps just by itself.<br />
-Vellium Strike is 925 pts every 10 secs if you chain cast it.. that is 92.5 dps!<br />
-puppy, when alphad with a pair of mage swords is scary.  Mine parses around 34 dps and I dont think the sword procs are counting correctly.<br />
<br />
In a normal exp mob fight I will use my pet, blood of saryn, and one cast of vellium strike... in a longer fight I will click on the epic dot and nuke multiple times.<br />
<br />
I know thats a lot less than my mage friends are contributing... their pet is a lot tougher than ours, and those 3-4k crits add up fast, but its more than a lot of tanks(War/SK/Pal) are contributing.  Rogues are quoting aroung 140-160dps, rangers 120-140 unless they are trueshotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">A) This guy is full of it<br />
<br />
B) BL's are godly though. My favorite group I've been in in a long time was Shm/Cle/Mag/Enc/BL/Rog in BoT. BL could tank even static tower spawns in the wings without a problem in low pop / high velious gear. We were clearing all of west wing before repop and had more dps then we could do anything with. If anything the BL slow makes them great tanks because they can pull with the slow and use it for rock solid agro.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I was feeling pretty good about myself. Tanking in Tactics pit area. Pulling. Healing. Crowd control.. Heck soloing sometimes too. I have gotten a few upgrades recently and some good spells. And 241 AA is certainly helping. <br />
<br />
Then along came the ex Chanter pet. With a mage helper. A frenzied Initiate. Two blades of Walnian a mask  a belt. And Speed of vallon.<br />
<br />
I Maloed on pull hopeing I could get a slow off. I knew what that beast was. (My hot box has built many of them, Level 65 Enchanter with 120 aa's)<br />
<br />
I didnt drop like a rock.  I was Shot from a cannon into the ground. Vindi didnt kill me that fast. I mean sheesh. <br />
<br />
That bastard killed me and the rest of my group so fast we all just laughed. It was simply funny. <br />
<br />
10 minutes later after getting back and rebuffing, dead Initiate. And I gave the weapons and mask and belt to puddles. (My Mutt)<br />
<br />
Beastlords are gods. So are shaman. So is any other class in the game when viewed with the right light. Viewed with the wrong light and comparing to another who has that light going strong at the same time... Well... If you belive all the hype then everyone would be playing bards cause they can solo whole zones.  Right?<br />
<br />
I thought not. Some people Shine as a shaman. For some it just fits. The bear skin is as comfortable as a good pair of jeans. Walk tall shaman And carry a very big stick. And do not sweat the beastlords and thier sandboxes. I mean most of em are cat people. And we all know that cat people and dog people dont get along.<br />

<br />
Oh please. BLs are not overpowered. In fact, we're probably the most balanced class in the game.  <br />
-You have to be 65 to get the 65% slow, even when a lower-level shaman has a 75% slow. That sounds right to me. <br />
-We don't get as good as buffs as Shamans. Sounds right to me.<br />
-Shamans have quite the use on raids. You don't need a BL on a raid, but the AA Paragon of Spirits/MGB makes a nice combo.<br />
<br />
If you have any reasons for beastlords to be nerfed, please list them here to show me &quot;what you think is wrong&quot;<br />

maybe because the fact of shaman beat him anywhere; people easily take shaman over beastlord for slow, and shaman &gt; beastlord for raid; beastlord is nothing but do bard's melee and won't allow use pet in raid most of time<br />

If your group needs malo or heals or some root CC, grab the shaman.  If your group doesn't, grab the beastlord because dps is what makes xp.  Sounds like a nice balance to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">My 2 cents:<br />
<br />
Groups:<br />
- Shaman CAN bring good DPS under the form of FA and Haste OR with DoTs if a good knight is tanking.<br />
- Beastlord brings great DPS to group, in some zones can slow just as good as shaman (if no Malo[s] is needed) and has some awesome AA and buffs.<br />
<br />
Raids:<br />
- Shamans still have stacking issues. DPS is crap. Utility can be dealt with an MGB Focus thrown by a bot.<br />
- Beastlords bring good DPS to raid, Ferocity and above all: Paragon of Spirit. The more beastlords on a raid with MGB, the easier mobs like Amy and Time gods with those nifty mana tap spells or insane AEs. Paragon of Spirit takes the pressure of clerics for MGB EE and it's better, because it pumps mana too. And of course in XP groups, it spees up downtime.<br />
<br />
Solo:<br />
- Shaman probably has a very good advantage here because of superior heals and root/dot if needed.<br />
<br />
Kiting:<br />
- With snare kite groups, both classes can be extremely useful but once again shaman having an advantage because pet + dots is bigger DPS than running constantly after a mob and BST pet.<br />
<br />
It boils down to simple things, if you have the core of a group already (Healer, Tank, CC/Manaregen) then you don't need a shaman, and BST is a MUCH better choice. If you lack a healer, CC or need shaman specific abilities then you better off with a a shaman, duh!</div></div><hr />

Hi Uggok, there's no flame in post, I've not seen you in game to bother lately....<br />

<br />
<br />
You are missing some important points. <br />
Beastlords don't get nearly as much innate AC. <br />
Beastlords have block and riposte capped much lower than monks. Beastlords wear the same armour as monks. <br />
Beastlords attack much less often than monks.<br />
Beastlords have no agro reduction.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? The only reason a Beastlord can tank better than a monk is the spells for agro, otherwise they take more damage/hits. That is exactly the same argument for SK/Pal being better tanks than warriors due to their agro spells.<br />
<br />
As for Beastlord vs Shaman, people who haven't played both just don't understand they are different classes. Just because a ranger can snare AND shoot arrows for great dps does not make them better than druids. Shamans and Beastlords share some utility but they are essentially different. Beastlord is a damage class with utility. Shaman is a utility class with some damage.<br />

I don't care who does what as long as we do it quickly, effeciently and to the best of our skills.  In an exp group last night, I let my beast friend slow in chardokb, I found the resists (without using malx) quite annoying for me so I said screw it, you do it.  She got less resists, but so what, I did a ton of dps.  In the end I was constantly canni'ing, constantly dotting and the group was constantly kicking ass.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Can a beastlord keep a group healed in TierIV?  The answer is a definitive &quot;NO!&quot;  <br />
Can a shaman keep a group healed in TierIV?  The answer is &quot;YES!&quot;  <br />
<br />
In fact, the shaman can also provide CC/slow for the group as well as provide healing, if they're good that is.  <br />
<br />
There's a large gap between your just-made-lvl61-where-is-my-uber-title shaman and your GOOD shaman.  At 65, shamans have tools like Q and Malos that make for healing power and control.  Beastlords have ZERO control, beyond their 65% slow.  That is the extent of their control.  No roots.  NO ROOT!  NO ROOT! NO ROOT!<br />
<br />
Did I mention they have no root spells at all?  Or snare (real snare, pet proc isn't even decent).  <br />
<br />
Would you give up your ability to root, lower a mob's resist, nice slow, nice DoTs (can do superior DPS than a beastlord + pet spank you very much!) for an ability to dual wield, higher attack rating, utility minor mana regen buff, and a stronger pet?  <br />
If your answer is &quot;yes&quot; then you should make a beastlord.  It's a perfectly valid class. <br />
If it's &quot;no&quot; then you should be happy with your shaman. <br />
<br />
The two are balanced in relation to each other at lvl 65 in the same era gear.  Except in PvP, the beastlord pet is bugged to use the same resist as its master in pvp . . where all other pets don't use master's resists in pvp.  Remove the pet, however, and the beastlord is laffably easy in pvp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Balance between bst's and their parent classes is not BAD, really.  A few tweaks and they'd balance quite nicely.  I always thought the 65% slow was a bit overmuch, as they shouldn't be quite that close to shammys.  The only reason I even say that is that slow is our 'thing'.  Everyone gets to be the best at something, and its bound to be irritating to loose groups to enchanters because they bring so much else to the table.  In the same vein, its undoubtedly bothersome to loose groups to beastlords because they add a lot of dps.<br />
The only other minor issue i've ever had with beastlords is simply that of avoidance/mitigation.  Most of what I've seen and read suggests that bsts get most of their monk parents' avoidance and mitigation abilities, but without the weight limitation.  Monks 'pay' a great deal in gear restrictions, etc, to get those skills.  Seemingly beastlords get them for free.  This is something that seems to be more of a balance issue for beastlords and their parent classes then the slow issue, really.<br />
Yes, a beastlord can tank anywhere a monk can, but usually a shaman can too.  Not that I LIKE to though :D<br />
This is VERY much the same issue shaman have with enchanters, warriors have with knights, clerics have with druids, etc, etc, etc....repeated ad nauseum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Mojarda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Beastlords are a great class, no doubt.  I've had the opportunity to group with and duo with several of them.  However, they can't hold a candle to a shaman when it comees to versatility.<br />
<br />
Case in point, I recently grouped in HOH NE camp.  The group was a 65 Pally, 65 Ranger, 65 Rogue, 63 Rogue, 65 Cleric and me, a 59 Shaman who dinged 60 while there with epic but not malo nor torpor; basically, very non-uber as evidenced by my magelo below.  <br />
<br />
After four hours of non-stop pulling the cleric had to camp.  Since we had done very well with no deaths and only few resists from me, the group (none of which I had met before, except the now-departed cleric) was comfortable to try a few pulls with me healing as well while we searched for a new cleric.  After 45 minutes of pulls at nearly the same rate as before, the group decided to forget the cleric-search and looked for another DPS.  We picked up a 64 Mage and kept it going for another 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see a 60 Beastie do that.<br />

BST are a awesome clas, but in no way can they replace us. I have never asked if someone needed me in a group and got &quot; No thnx we have a BST&quot;<br />
<br />
Great DPS, nice stackable buffs, i have nothing but respect for them. But BST cant touch our healing, the reality is that only a cleric is more effective, we just wokr hard for it and my DPS certainly does not suck with my 65 DoTs, alpha pup and epic all going, not to mention SC every 12 min and me stacking on a BoN. And as far as me dropping like a fly ? I might not be a uber shaman , but when i get aggro i toss a 3.3 second cast of Q on me and the damage mitigation i gain from that will flat out OWN all the defensive AA and AC a BST can get over me, i mean i can get LR5 also and that alone is a huge deal if you ask me. I mean even without a Q on me i defiently dont drop like a fly. I mean for FFS i have a taunt button my hotkey and a Offtank button i use daily.</div></div><hr />

   When I'm playing I am always happy to have a shaman in my group.  Because these two classes are so simular I like to believe we balance each other to make the group that much stronger. I really dont care who has the better slow I want the group to succeed in battle. Just like having a paladin/cleric or a druid/ranger both in group they make the group stronger because they complement each other so strongly.<br />

<br />
Can a beastlord replace a shaman, when it comes to slowing in a normal xp group? In my opinion yes with a few disadvantages like lesser slow, no secondary healer role, no noticable CC except offtanking.<br />
<br />
I have to disagree a bit with the sentiment, that the difference between 65 bst slow and shaman slow is sooo big in a normal xp group (with a dedicated healer). Theoretically yes, but let's face it, in a xp group you have regularly TOO MUCH healing available. So when some BST slows, you can do still fine without any big delays.<br />
<br />
To end this rambling, what is the problem about it? Beastlords are SUPPOSED to replace shaman as an alternative, when it comes to grouping, much like druids can heal instead of clerics. Every role should be filled by several classes.<br />
<br />
Am i happy with the decrease of shaman abilities (relative to other classes) during PoP? Hell no, but we are still a very nice class to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">FYI: visible AC is NOT the only thing that affects how much damage you take in melee; there is also a mitigation factor built into each class that also impacts overall damage.  Sony has stated this as a fact several times, most recently in the monk-nerf patch.<br />
<br />
Plate classes, monks, and BLs used to tank about the same.  Monks had higher block/dodge/etc. than BLs and some some plate classes but the mitigation of each hit was the same.  This was what made monks such good rampage tanks.<br />
<br />
After the nerf, however, monks now mitigate about the same as a druid, while BLs still use the same mitigation as a plate class.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">You want to know what's wrong with Beastlords ? Simple.<br />
<br />
It's their stupid and annoying slow spell. <br />
Overwriting their slow(which you often are forced to, since you lead with a debuff or watch your aggro) is buggy as hell and results in multiple resists for me more often than not(that's why many people believe the Bst slow is harder to resist) <br />
I haven't got around of testing this, so take it as a speculation of mine for now. <br />
I firmly believe, though, that the coding for slows is ****ed up. I can almost guarantee you that whenever a slow is on a mob, it is harder to &quot;replace&quot; that slow. Now, i am pretty sure that the level of the slow spell has a defining impact in this &quot;system&quot;. <br />
<br />
Turgur's is a level 51 spell, Forlorn(Enc) is a level 57 spell and Sha's(Bst) is a level 65 spell. <br />
I used to observe Enc slows being less resisted than Shaman slows all the time(yet when people playing both classes were asked they'd say they were noticing no difference in resist rates. Obviously because they were only slowing with one or the other), but no one really ever confirmed that rumor.<br />
Since Bst's got their level 65 slow i am more and more convinced of this theory. There's a kind of level check that takes place before the % check of the slow. Which results in a pain in the ass whenever somebody with a &quot;higher&quot; slow spell lands their slow before us. <br />
Especially when its a Bst, since their slow is 14 levels higher than the Enc's, which is only 6 levels higher.<br />
I am not sure if i can test this anytime soon, but my experience in exp and raid environments has convinced me that there is a sort of bug in that system and of course finding and eliminating that bug is a lot of work and we all know it won't happen.<br />
<br />
So if any designer reads this and is curious about this anomaly, do some tests and fix it by raising the level on the higher percentage slows somehow without screwing another aspect of them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">After painfully reading through this guy's posts, its truly amazing how stupid he is.  Firstly, let me start off by saying beastlords are a DPS class, with versitalities in the ways of buffs and slows that *could* be used in conjunction with, and/or replacing *some* of a shamans roles in an exp group.  You can tell, he has no clue what he is talking about, he uses references in PoN hedge, and PoI xana walk.  He is probably comparing himself to sub-57 shamans. In that case, God I hope he is better than them.  As you read down the thread, he also goes on saying he can tank fine at only 5700Hps. I sit at 5.4k hp buffed with mostly velious gear (yet we drop like a rock).<br />
<br />
Our mana regen is 10x thiers, our buffs get done quicker are longer duration, I dont know any beastlord that can slow in a group and keep everybody ferocity'd, our haste is better, our slow is more efficent, our crowd control is far superior, and scrm quiesence &gt; anything they will ever have.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are a great class, good dps, not the most useful class on raids, but mgb PoS is nice.  They have to remember, they are a hybrid class and their spells will never be what shamans are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Welp some things.<br />
<br />
   As far as I can tell a BL tanks _about_ as well as a more or less equivalently equipped shaman.   They are a leather class, we are chain.  They have higher defensive skills, we have higher ac on our gear (really).<br />
<br />
   They have SLIGHTLY more hp than us, at least by what I see on eqrankings.<br />
<br />
   They have higher dps (for sure).  They can buff attack with 50% haste and savagery and SV.  They can buff mana regen stuff.<br />
<br />
   We get Bih'li... +20 attack that stacks with all other attack and hp buffs.  Our haste is 10% more than theirs (translates to a direct increase in dps for melee int he group) and our buffs last longer... sometimes a LOT longer.  This particularly matters for Ferine Avatar, I can easily keep it up on a group of 5 melee + me.  It is unlikely that a beastlord can do this.<br />
<br />
   Our PERSONAL mana regen is far superior to a beastlord and SCM3 saves us a lot of mana.  On the other hand beastlord have that aa skill that feeds mana to the group - you gotta like that.<br />
<br />
   We debuff better than a beastlord by a lot.  Casters in particular do appreciate malo.<br />
<br />
   We heal far far far better than a beastlord.  Period.  It is COMPLETELY feasible to duo with a shaman and a well equipped chain melee class in tier 4 planes of water earth or fire (or a less well equipped plate melee class).<br />
<br />
   Hell, I've healed for single groups without a cleric in the first castle of fire.<br />
<br />
   If you had no earthly idea (in advance) about what you were doing a shaman would be the better pick.  There is nothing a beastlord can do (that is REQUIRED for a situation) that a shaman cannot also do (sometimes not as well, sometimes better).  Even melee (blasphemy I know!).<br />
<br />
   But a shaman can heal to keep a group alive in situations where a beastlord cannot.<br />
<br />
   On the other hand if you are killing trash mobs where healing is irrelevant, debuffing is trivial and all you care about is killing mobs ASAP... get a wizard or a necro or a mage, not a BL or shaman.   :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">You are missing some important points. <br />
Am I? Responses below.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords don't get nearly as much innate AC. <br />
<br />
Innate AC means as much as charisma to a monk, maybe less. Monks are the ONLY class in the game w/ an AC mitigation penalty- during the height of the nerf, the displayed AC was guesstimated to be off by roughly 200 points of AC according to Monkly Business, now it's probably &quot;only&quot; off by 150.  When another poster said monks now mitigate like druids, he was dead on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords have block and riposte capped much lower than monks. <br />
<br />
Monk block/dodge: 230/230  BST block/dodge: 200/155.  Be happy they're that good, block &gt; parry as is and BST avoidance skills are not shabby.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords wear the same armour as monks. <br />
<br />
BST wear same armor but (surprise, surprise!) do not have the ridiculous weight restriction of monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords attack much less often than monks.<br />
<br />
Yet BST can buy an AA to give them double attack- do monks get an AA that lets them buy heal/slow/buffs/pet?  Before you point out that it's much less than a monk's double attack, let me again say- what BST ability can a monk buy w/ AA?<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords have no agro reduction.<br />
<br />
They share monks' best discipline, stonestance, which greatly enhances their survivability when they get aggro.  But basically BST don't get FD, which is surprising, they got pretty much everything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Am I missing something? The only reason a Beastlord can tank better than a monk is the spells for agro, otherwise they take more damage/hits.<br />
Yes, you're missing quite a bit.  BST can tank better than monks for the following reasons:<br />
- no mitigation AC penalty<br />
- slow<br />
- pet can tank at any time<br />
<br />
BST seem immune to nerfing due to their relatively low numbers- I highly encourage BST to start rampage tanking mobs and taking over tank spots in groups, then bragging repeatedly about how &quot;shaman and tanks are no longer required&quot;.  Do this again and again on every class board until everyone believes and takes as gospel that BST are uber and overpowered.<br />
<br />
You saw how well it worked out for monks...<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Some of you seem to be forgetting why we have classes in Everquest.  It is so that characters are different, rather than the same.  Can a beastlord be the primary slower in a group?  Yes.  Do they do it as well as a shaman does?  No, of course not.  Anyone that thinks that BST slows as well as a shaman is a fool.  It is like a shaman healing.  Can a shaman be the primary healer in an exp group?  Damn right he can.  Is he as good at it as a cleric is?  No, of course not.  We are not the best at healing, but we are good enough to get by in an exp group.  Beastlords are not the best slowers, but 65% slow is good enough for an exp group to do well, assuming competent healers and tanks.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to have the best of everything in your group, your group would look something like this:<br />
<br />
Warrior - best tanking (don't argue, just play along)<br />
Shaman  - best slowing<br />
Cleric - best healing<br />
Enchanter - best CC, mana regen, and haste<br />
Bard - best stackable mana regen and haste<br />
1 extra person.<br />
<br />
This group will never, ever wipe or have downtime.  However, their DPS will also be pretty crappy unless the chanter is charming (in which case you need a druid or ranger as the 6th).  You could replace the shaman with a beastlord here and have no problem at all.  In fact, beastlord would be preferable here because they'd add needed DPS.  With all of these other utility classes, we aren't needed and in all honesty I'd be very bored.<br />
<br />
This is a slightly less conventional group:<br />
<br />
Paladin - can tank and rezz if needed.<br />
Ranger - uber dps and atk buffs<br />
Rogue - uber dps when given ranger, shaman, and bard atk buffs<br />
Mage - retarded dps, especially with rizlona's and manasong.<br />
Bard - huge increase in group effectiveness<br />
Shaman - heals, slows, maybe even pulls.<br />
<br />
Can you replace the shaman with a beastlord here and have a functioning group?  No.  1 chain of resists could likely wipe the whole group.  Could you replace one of the DD's with a druid, and then the shaman with a beastlord?  Yes.  Druid heals can usually keep everyone alive if something goes wrong, and 65% slow is enough that druid heals and paladin self-elixer can keep you going indefinately.  Mage's mala would insure that the bst doesn't get many resists.<br />
<br />
Classes are about options.  There is no perfect group, and there is no class that is always superior to others.  In some groups, I know that I really don't need to be there.  I am slowing, doing a little healing, a little dotting, a little nuking.  Occasionally I root an add.  If I went afk or LD, they wouldn't stop pulling.  In situations like these, you can replace us with a beastlord and you'll do fine.  Sometimes, I know that I am the only thing keeping a group functional.  These are those groups where the shaman is pulling 3 at a time, rooting the adds before they get to camp, and delivering one slowed mob at a time to his group, then healing his tank while debuffing and laying dots on the rooted mobs.  This is, obviously, my favorite kind of group.  If I were to go afk or LD, pulls would stop until I got back.  A beastlord just does not have the ability to sub in during situations like this.<br />
<br />
The bottomline is this:<br />
<br />
Shamans are a support class.  We make things possible that were not possible before.  I feel that we do this better than any other class in the game.  A powerful slow, decent heals, and endless mana makes just about any group configuration possible.  As someone said earlier, we have almost complete control over any situation.<br />
<br />
Beastlords... I cannot really define.  They are more or less a damage class with a few support abilities.  Their slow may or may not be good enough, depending on what other classes there are, but either waythey simply do not create as many possibilities as a shaman does.  They make up for this by having great DPS and better tanking abilities.<br />
<br />
Both are very powerful classes, they are just suited to different needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Monks are the ONLY class in the game w/ an AC mitigation penalty- during the height of the nerf, the displayed AC was guesstimated to be off by roughly 200 points of AC according to Monkly Business, now it's probably &quot;only&quot; off by 150.  When another poster said monks now mitigate like druids, he was dead on.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me clarify this just a bit.<br />
<br />
To quote SOE, &quot;wizards do not mitigate damage the same way as warriors&quot; - see first monk nerf message.  Variations on this have also been stated in other official annoucements.<br />
<br />
More specifically, there were at least 2 classes of mitigation: cloth and everyone else.  At least, this is what SOE has suggested--parses have actually suggested that there are probably 3: cloth, leather, and chain/plate.  Post-nerf, there are offically at least cloth, monks, and plate, although most parses suggest that SOE simply moved monks from the plate table to the leather table (after a temporary trip onto the cloth table) and called it good.<br />
<br />
Thus, a wizard with 1000 AC will take more damage from most mobs than a warrior with 1000 AC, even if block/parry/etc. are abstracted out.  This can be proven by parsing mob DPS with a character that has its back to the mob (thus negating extra defense skills.)<br />
<br />
More importantly, the rate of damage will also be more 'streaky', in that you will see more hits for minimum or maximum, with a cloth/leather class.  This makes it more difficult to guage when to CHeal.  This is one of the reason that current monks are still pissed off, and the main reason that my shammie is now 6 levels over my monk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beastlords wear the same armour as monks.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, they don't.<br />
<br />
Well, not generally, anyway.  While both classes are nominally leather classes, the stat and weight priorities for BLs are sufficiently different from monks that you don't generally see much equipment overlap.  In fact, most BLs would probably share more gear with druids than they would monks, although that would depend on the playstyle of the BL (e.g. are they pet medics or tanking BLs).</div></div><hr />

The question is NOT what's best in a group, Shaman or Beastlord. <br />
<br />
The question is: If the group already has a 65 Beastlord (with the 65% Slow), what does a Shaman bring?<br />
<br />
Malo Debuffs?<br />
Backup Heals?<br />
<br />
Although I think the Beastlord that posted these comments is an idiot, I'd have to agree with some of his thinking.<br />
<br />
If I were that BL (level 65 w/ 65% slow) and I was in an exp group as primary slower I'd rather have a Mage for debuffs with all the DPS he brings, or a Druid as a backup healer.<br />
<br />
The Shaman just doesn't bring enough to a group that already has a 65 or 70% Slow IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>msatchmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">The problem all of you are completely forgetting is that almost all mobs in PoP need a malo/malos first to land that damn slow.  I don't care how uber BL think they are at tanking when you are in BoT and **** starts wailing on you after your slow fails don't whine as I laugh at you while you wait for your rez.<br />
<br />
We had a decent BL in our deep south BoT group last night she did pretty well but ended up dieing once or twice because she got agro too fast and got plow'd.   Guess they arn't as uber of a tank as they think they are.<br />
<br />
Malo'ing (unresistable mind you...mages don't have that!) and then slowing the mob is the only really safe way to do it tier 2+    Also in elementals I think BL are gonna get their asses handed to them.   I'm sorry but their pet nor their tanking will hack it there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They work really well together, the The beastlord truly is a powerful class, but it is simply NOT a replacement for a Shaman.   Was never meant to be, never will be.<br />
<br />
Yes, they get a 65% slow.. at 65.  IF they're lucky enough to buy/loot it.<br />
<br />
EVERY Shaman past 51 Can slow properly.   Guaranteed, Every Time.<br />
<br />
Yes, the BST Slow has a better cast time and a better Resistance Check, that's true.   But they have nothing in the vein of Malo/Tash/Resist Reducer line spells.     The places I group, other classes DEPEND on Malos to allow others to land spells too.     What good is the BST poking in a 65% slow when the Nukers are still have half their spells land for half damage?<br />
<br />
Yes, Beastlords are powerful, as a 6th slot DPS assist they are amazing.   But seriously, I've NEVER lost a spot in a group to a Beastlord.    It just doesn't happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I think the origional ranting BL makes some good points, but two things are left out.  Shaman have superior mana regen and heals, of those two items, mana regen being more important.  Even doing a mundane FG-shroom camp, I'm pulling while the BL is OOM (I like to pull 4-7 at a time), gobbie camp in PoN and another BL is medding while I'm so full of mana that I'm slowing, dotting and even burning.  A BL's mana pool is shallower than a shaman's and we regen it faster with a broader choice of spells and abilities.  Both have a place in a group, they make a great duo team, but before someone rants about how obsolete shaman when BLs are around, better not be parking their ass to med or leaving the group to get KEI while I'm ready for a pull and kicking butt.<br />
<br />
In the group I usually play with, when we do HoHo, there is NO way a BL can replace me.  If the cleric folds, goes OOM, or goes AFK (recently stuck with pickup clerics, we get all kinds) the the pulls continue and I heal and slow.  No way a BL can keep my guys alive and still be ready for another pull (ranger, SK, cleric, me, rogue, and one of bard/ranger/rogue/wizard in the last spot).<br />
<br />
I like BLs, in many ways they are superior, but they can't replace me and I can't replace them.  I'd sooner have a BL in a trials group, but having a solid BU healer who is almost always FoM is fantastic for steady pulls.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference is, ench can tash, thus land with less resists.<br />
Shamen Malo and such, land more often<br />
Beastlords use the brute force method, we cast it till it lands thats it.<br />
<br />
The main thing you see with beastlords is the fact ours is a faster cast time, and since we have no tash or malo to cast, our slow is the first thing we cast, heck we pull with it. In general we can get 2 or more casts off before you get one, and many times our slow may land the first try.<br />
<br />
So all in all, with our 1.9sec slow, we have 2 attempts to your 1.<br />

<br />
Resistance Check: Fire<br />
Resistance Level: -50 (Moderate)<br />
Base Difficulty: 25%<br />
=============================<br />
<br />
Notice how this spell has a resistance level of -50. Non of the 3 slow spells have such a mod, they are all standard resistance level, and all magic based.<br />
<br />
Also keeo in mind that at 50-59 beastlords only have a 30% slow. Which is pretty crappy. 60-64 we have to live with our 50% slow, which has a long cast time.<br />
<br />
At 65, if we are rich or lucky with a rune we will get our 65% slow. Once we get it naturally it is a powerful spell, and all us beastlords love it. To think that some of you get all up in arms just because at 65, if we are lucky iwth runes, we have a slow that can be used to allow us to be the main slower in groups here and there, after you have had virtually no competition for 65 levels! I mean even the enchanters didnt like to slow since they die easy.<br />
<br />
Both sides of this post sounds an argument between warriors and paladins trying to prove who si the better tank. Listen, beastlords are a unique class, similar to bards, we both have many abilties and utility. As a matter of a fact bards are VERY powerful, and I dont ever hear anyone complaining about them, they have been around for years. Shoot the only complaint I have about them is they can instantly kill my pet in duels through a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">Well, the fact that Sha's Advantage is a 65 and a rune means nothing to me.<br />

Not really a point if you've been around awhile... Same old arguments for many classes... Bards vs Chanters(CC), Druids vs Clerics(healing dept), Pally vs War, SK vs Monk(pulling), and now Shamns vs Beast..<br />
<br />
ONLY safe class at this moment is SoS lock-picking rogues.. (i think)<br />
<br />
If they don't want a shaman, no biggie, find another group or solo... Shouldn't feel like you need to bring something to replace, or to feel better than another class...<br />
<br />
The one thing that does get me is his comment about shamans slowing at distance causing &quot;ping-pong&quot;.  A real shaman knows where his/her bear nose should be.. up the MT's butt (or under dragon's belly).  Sounds like he grouped with either lazy shamans or those still new to the finer touches of our class..<br />
<br />
Just because the level says 65, doesn't mean they know how to play a class...</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Shaman just doesn't bring enough to a group that already has a 65 or 70% Slow IMHO.<br />
<br />
In exp groups, I don't give a **** who slows as long as it gets slowed.  If the bst can do it with less resists, let him.  That simply means that I can do dps as soon as the fight starts.  If you think shaman can't do dps your flat out wrong.  With bst slowing, I maintain BoS and BoN on BoT mobs all the time.  Do I draw aggro? Hell ya, but when I'm standing right with the tank and keep myself Q'd the only thing that is noticed is the fact that the mobs die faster.<br />
<br />
In raid situation would I expect the beast to slow or me to dps? No :)<br />
<br />
Don't get stuck in a rut thinking that shaman can only buff/debuff.  If that is all you are doing and you have full or nearly full mana all the time, you need to look deeper in the old spell book :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never said they were shabby. As you point out they are less than monks. We are comparing monk and beastlord tanking skills here.<br />
<br />
BST wear same armor but (surprise, surprise!) do not have the ridiculous weight restriction of monks.<br />
<br />
Yes and Beastlords don't get the innate ac bonus therefore they don't have the weight restriction. If the innate ac bonus does not work then take that up with Sony rather than calling for nerfs on other classes.<br />
<br />
Yet BST can buy an AA to give them double attack- do monks get an AA that lets them buy heal/slow/buffs/pet?  Before you point out that it's much less than a monk's double attack, let me again say- what BST ability can a monk buy w/ AA?<br />
<br />
Bards get exactly the same double attack aa that Beastlords do. Does that mean you should get bard aa's as well as beastlord ones? It is not a monk aa, it is a melee aa. Now if Beastlords got an AA for mend or FD then I would think you have due cause for complaint. However, Beastlords don't.<br />
<br />
Yes, you're missing quite a bit.  BST can tank better than monks for the following reasons:<br />
- no mitigation AC penalty<br />
- slow<br />
- pet can tank at any time<br />
<br />
This shows you have never ever played a Beastlord. I get smacked about just as much as monks. I have no idea where you got this idea that we mitigate beter than monks. Go post this on the Beastlord forum and get laughed out of there. As far as I can tell I get hit the same as the druids and monks. Only thing that enables me to tank in PoP is ID 5, LR 5 and my block skill. Monks get the same boosts from those aa too.<br />
<br />
How did slow come into this? Any group you have in PoP will likely have a slower. You were comparing monk tanking vs Beastlord tanking. As for the pet tanking at any time? put me and another melee against a mob and please show me how the pet can tank. <br />
<br />
I tell you what. Come back to me with parses or some other evidence that clearly show that monks mitigate worse than Beastlords and I'll agree with you. Until then stop spouting guesses just because you are a disgruntled monk.<br />

Not only can we slow, IMO we do it MUCH better than a Shaman .<br />

Now, I dunno about y'all but to me, this pretty much says it all...  I'd much rather have the longer slow (even if it is same percentage) than the shorter.

<br />
Secondly, you people calling specifically for a beastlord nerf saying &quot;OMG OVERNIGHT THEY GOT SO POWERFUL OMG!!!!11oneoneonE&quot; are absolutely clueless about where beastlords came from.<br />
<br />
Before I retired my beastlord, I had played him from the release of luclin putting up with a weak, incomplete, entirely broken class that had no upsides and only downsides.  Pets were buggy and very inconsistent.  The beastlords ourselves, we had no good spells, no offensive power to speak of, and incredible bugginess.  No one wanted us for groups.  Our DPS sucked until higher levels.  Our only recourse was to solo our way up to the mid 50s, as I did.  <br />
<br />
Finally some time before the release of Planes of Power, sony finally listened to the articulate, well-reasoned complaints of the beastlord community (*wave* DiosT, Makani, and others) and slowly began to tune the class.  If anything Beastlords should be held up as a model of how to balance a class quite well.  Shaman are up there as well.  Shaman have a few more fine tuning issues, but Sony has done, inarguably, an excellent job tuning the class.  <br />
<br />
You people whining and crying for a nerf, quite simply, have penis envy.  Beastlords fill a niche that Shaman used to fill solely, albeit not as well.  You people should be embracing Beastlords as a class that brings everything to a group that its class should bring at nearly every level.<br />

Is a 65% slow too much?  Seems awfully good, but hey, good for them.  I'm not being turned down because people have BSTs to slow.  Heck, groups with slowing enchanters often ask me to group, largely at the request of the enchanter.<br />

So they're a DPS class that can fill the role of slower or possibly tank at a lower efficiency?  Cool.  I'm a slower class that can fill the role of healer or possibly DPS at lower efficiency.  Works for me.</div></div><hr />

seems to me like the Shamans on this board have either misread/misinterpeted or just plain did'nt comprehend what this Nunya person was saying though he did seem bit full of himself, hmmm but like none of you here dont? pot calling the kettle black.<br />
<br />
I agree with about everything he said, maybe i just understand what he is saying..<br />
Only time he mentioned a Beast could &quot;replace&quot; a Shaman was in a single group pulling mobs hitting for under 1000hps.<br />
<br />
Um well yeah, a Beastlord can very easily replace a Shaman in that group, so why is everybody raising hell about that? and calling for beastlord nerf? Beast seem to me about the most ballanced class in the game currently.<br />
your making yourselves sound rather petty...<br />
<br />
So can most any other class replace one another, as in a Druid or Shaman can easily replace a Cleric in various groups..<br />
I dont here Clerics crying about it.<br />
Verant /SOE rightfully made it so a single class under &quot;most&quot; circumstances are not absolutely needed, hence CHs for other classes, decent slows for Beastlords &amp; Enchanters, good tanking abilty for Pallys/SKs, Pally/Necro rezzes, and so on.    Shamans are NOT &quot;absolutely&quot; needed in every group or raid, just like no other class is.  If you think you are, then you need to pop your fathead.<br />
<br />
He has like i would think most of us here grouped with some idiots that dont know how to slow a Mob correctly, in which case he again is right on the money. Although i must say that from my experience its been Enchanters pulling that ping pong trick more than Shamans, but i certainly understand where he coming from, and i have seen my share of shamans doing exactly that =/<br />
<br />
I group regularly with a friend of mine that is a 65 Beast, and once again he is correct on that a Beast can certainly take that bum rush beating especially if that first slow is resisted one hell of alot better than i can, you guys here must have some kind of death wish, or just too stupid to realize that having a beastlord preslow the mob first is a great help and in no way belittles the Shaman in anyway.<br />

Ill gladdly take a beast into my group anyday and have many times when looking for a replacement included a Beastlord as a replacement option and other than a few idiots that dont know much about Beastlords ive had no complaints.<br />
<br />
Some of you here said even the other Beast on the board disagreed with him and were cutting him down.  Hmmm, seemed to me they all pretty much agreed, except that a few kept trying to force the 40% more damage taken issue between our 75% over the Beast 65% slow,<br />
of course just like you guys here, seems as though his fellow Beast arent all that good at comprehending what they reading either...<br />
<br />
What i got was that with mobs hitting for under 700 in your average experince group where you are killing mobs in like 45sec to a min or so, and that since a Beastlord will usually have a mob slowed prior to the MT even getting hit then there is never a sec where Mob is UNslowed and is dead quick enough where that 40% more damage is really irrelevant.<br />
Once again, taken in the context of how he stated it, i find he is correct there also.<br />
Ive been MH for that group with a Beast preslowing many times, i quite normally cease bothering to plant my slow over my friends because i really dont see much difference either, and since im the healer i would know. If the MT takes maybe an extra 100-200hps of damage over that less than min fight, i still am only casting ONE CH on him regardless, the damage difference is meaningless.<br />
As he said yes if the Mob is hitting for over 1000+ and the fight is some Uber raid Mob with 300,000Hps yes, then please slow it 75%, not only that but ours last twice as long....<br />
But in the CONTEXT of his statement he is right.<br />
<br />
Be great if everyone on both boards would simple be able to comprehend what they are reading and keep it in context...<br />
<br />
Of course im sure 1/2 everyone reading this post right now are going to do exactly the opposite and take what im saying out of context, because you misinterpet what im saying, oh well...</div></div><hr />

Who called for a nerf?  Nobody on this thread.  Feeling a bit nervous? Or just stupid?  <br />
Go bang your head against the wall a few times.<br />
<br />
Ummm maybe you should read over all the post again, I think I counted a few calling a nerf to the Beastlord class (at least 3).<br />
<br />
So if anyone feels stupid right now it should be you for not reading before replying with the above quote.<br />
<br />
And let me tell you guys something, I retired my shaman to play a Beastlord awhile back, some of you may remember me.  One of the main reasons I retired my Shaman to try a different class was because all the negativity posted on these boards, and yes, that much negativity from someone that use to read the boards religously can do that, especially someone that use to look up to many of you.<br />
<br />
One thing I can say about the Beastlord community is that it has a positive effect, it makes you feel good about playing your class when your not in game, a lot of positivity. Oppose to this board that makes you feel bad about playing your class, a lot of negativity.<br />
<br />
I still do play the Shaman class now and then as an alt, and when I need tips and help I sure don't come here.  I only came here today after seeing the Link from the Beastlord board.<br />
<br />
Oh well, didn't think I would ever post here again. /shrug</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Read the Cleric board sometime. They ARE complaining about being replaced in groups by Shamans/Druids. More so Druids I think because most Shamans I know would rather have a Cleric in the group because of all the other things we could/would rather be doing. They have a somewhat valid point too because they can't just go out and easily solo stuff for 6-18% of an AA point like a Shaman can if they can't get into a group. But I guess I am hijacking this thread a bit....<br />
<br />
Shamans are needed at raids, at least one is. Sometimes you are just a buffho but there it is. As are Clerics and Warriors. If there is any class not needed it is Beastlords. So pop your own fathead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u86"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p86">Read the Cleric board sometime. They ARE complaining about being replaced in groups by Shamans/Druids.<br />
If you read the cleric boards, they bitch anytime a group doesn't need a cleric.  If you read the druid boards, they bitch when groups don't want druids because they would rather have a cleric.  Read the ranger boards, they complain if anyone says their dps isnt as high as they claim it is.  Read the monk boards, well they whine about anything now since the defense nerf.  Most of the class boards have specific gripes.  Most of them arent from the community, but a select few who just speak louder than others.  I know the clerics/druids/monks/rangers/etc that I know in game, never complain about the major things complained about on the class boards.  Most of their opinions are &quot;who cares&quot;.  Most of its just over-dramatization created by attention seekers, and drama queens.<br />
<br />
I think most beastlords would rather not have the attention drawn to them like the select few idiots have done.  They aren't overpowered.  If a bst can be used in place of a shaman/chanter in a group for slows, more power to them.  It won't become commonplace, and will usually not be the prefered way to go either.  How often do you see on raids where the shaman is not asked to slow, because the chanter's slow is good enough?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>ShammEdavis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">knew it wouldnt take long, like i said COMPREHEND and keep in CONTEXT, and threads like this wouldnt exist or at least wouldnt be so full of BS..<br />
<br />
&quot;rightfully made it so a single class under &quot;most&quot; circumstances <br />
<br />
&quot;Shamans are NOT &quot;absolutely&quot; needed in every group or raid<br />
<br />
&quot;some&quot; raids sure, big raids with 7,8+ groups yep, be tough without a Shaman though NOT impossible by any means.<br />
<br />
Case in point, my friend thats a 65 Beast, his guild just raided BOT towers 2 nights ago, took out 3 of the 4 towers in 1 1/2 hours, for first 2 towers there wasnt a Shaman amongst them.<br />
Was 42 people so 7 groups, they had 3 Beastlords, couple mages, couple enchanters. The Beastlords slowed,&lt;---Yep Beastlords were the ONLY slow on all mobs the Enchanters and Mages debuffed, and the Beastlords each took a couple groups each and buffed whom &quot;needed&quot; to be buffed, was no problem whatsoever. All 3 of them have MGB one did SD, other did SV, one saved his just in case for Paragon.<br />
Then each took the classes that needed Kragg/IOS/DEX/Sta whatever and indivually buffed what was needed.  Slight PITA, but doable, they were all buffed and ready to go in no time.<br />
I know this because my friend is also my RL friend that live right next door, i was looking over his shoulder at the time.<br />
<br />
Now are Beastlords &quot;needed&quot; at every raid hell no, neither are Shamans.  there are certain classes in certain raids that ARE absolutely needed.<br />
Like maybe a Uber Warrior in elementals tanking Mobs smacking for 2-3K a round, etc.....<br />
Pretty hard to do without Clerics also, druids and Shamans make good BU healers, and in many cases MHs, but usually your going to want/need a Cleric, although technically if you have a Necro or Pally you have some rez ability but still, hard to replace a good cleric....<br />
<br />
so this statement im taking it IN CONTEXT, <br />
<br />
Shamans are needed at raids, at least one is<br />
<br />
NO they are NOT, very nice to have yes, preferable yes, &quot;needed absolutely&quot; or there is no raid? NOPE...as long as you have another class to take up the slack....<br />
Mage/Beast/Ench and enough of them....<br />
<br />
same goes for most any class under &quot;most&quot; conditions<br />
<br />
Oh and BTW Clerics can solo just fine every bit as good a my Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">This guy is an idiot. He is 61 so I dont think he is in position to even make comparisons for 65 vs 75 percentage slow until he has it and tests it. I like the BL class I think they bring a good amount to the table but I do not feel threatened in the slightest by their presence. They argue they can slow almost as good as us and bring dps. Ok their slow is totally dependent on either someone else magic debuffing or making sure they slow in low MR zones ours is not at all, so there argument at least hinges on a condition not to mention there slow is a rune turn in. We slow when we want where we want on whatever mobs we want. Secondly, we can mold ourselves to what the group needs. I can heal fine in tier 2 and tactics I might have to work harder than a cleric but I can do it. I can haste the group I can ghetto CC with root if thats whats needed of me, I can dot to add dps. A BL cant heal in xp groups as main healer he cant CC with root. So if you want dps with a restricted slow take the dps. If you want a slower/healer/CCer with buffs who is capable of saving your ass when it hits the fan take me. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u89"><b>Mhason</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p89">I guess my inexperience in posting has unintentionally caused some sort of war/flame festival between us and beastlords.<br />
<br />
I suppose this question should have formed differently and please accept my appology for starting this mess.  I have read many discussions on what beastlords have to offer in comparison to shamans and realize we did not need another post on this subject. <br />
<br />
I was not my intention to beat a dead horse as someone put it.<br />
<br />
Most groups are not perfect and one class can usually substitute for another.  I don't want to call for a nerf of any class, I just like to know that the class I have spent countless hours playing will not be useless as soon as another class joins the group.<br />
<br />
Before this discussion it just seemed to me that the person I quoted (although he had a very rough way of putting it) had several valid points.<br />
<br />
Although classes are interchangeable you will not see many classes that will be made useless if another class joins.  I wanted to know if that is the case with us and beastlords.  Are we just anchors weighing the group down once a beastlord join.  <br />
(After some of the things people have pointed out I feel it's fair to say that we have other abilities that still keep us wanted)<br />

There is not a single class that isnt usefull in a group or raid situation, and no a Beastlord in no way will ever make a Shaman useless in anyway shape form or fashion, just like Shaman will not make a Beastlord useless in anyway.<br />
Played well, the 2 classes complement each other nicely actually.<br />
<br />
Its just the misunderstandings and lack of comprehension in many forum boards...this board being one the worst ive ever seen btw, that starts crap like this...<br />
<br />
Only reason i even came to this board was after my friend showing me the thread on the Beastlord board, and thought i was going to be all up in arms about it. I read it, looked at him, and said yeah so, sounds bout right to me on most of it.<br />
So i came here to see what all the hoopla was about and now i see.<br />
<br />
the usual forum BS where at best 1/2 anybody knows what the hell they are talking about, the other 1/2 didnt comprehend a single thing they read and starts spreading crap that was never said or intended in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u92"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p92">Hey Shammedavis, sure situationally you can come up with any situation when no class is strictly needed. But raids have been and will continue to be cancelled or delayed because certain classes are not there, and that includes a Shaman. No raid that I am aware of has ever been cancelled or even delayed because a Beastlord wasn't there. <br />
<br />
And either you are extremely poor at soloing or the only clerics you know have extremely high end toys or some combination of the two if Clerics can solo as well as you can. I can and have done stuff at 60, easily, that even the most well equipped Clerics at 65 have trouble duplicating and I by no means am as skilled as some of the Shamans out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u93"><b>ShammEdavis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p93">well only raid ive had cancelled was because we didnt have an enchanter.<br />
<br />
So yes &quot;situationally&quot; you can also come up with raids that DO &quot;need&quot; a Shaman, just like any other class.<br />
<br />
I dont solo all that much anymore so maybe i am.<br />
<br />
But i do know several Clerics that regularly solo in Tier 2 &amp; 3 all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">~~raptorjb007~~ says.... The main thing you see with beastlords is the fact ours is a faster cast time, and since we have no tash or malo to cast, our slow is the first thing we cast, heck we pull with it. In general we can get 2 or more casts off before you get one, and many times our slow may land the first try. So all in all, with our 1.9sec slow, we have 2 attempts to your 1.<br />
<br />
LUCY says that BST best slow is 3.5 sec...which is .5 slower than our cast...<br />

<br />
Cry me a river.<br />
<br />
BST is SoE's lil pet project class, has been for a long time. I realizes this the day their rare drop spells were made vendor buyable and NONE of our or anyone elses were even looked at. Im not that upset that i would want a class nerfed, but there is a few things i dont understand.<br />
<br />
#1 How can a leather class mitigate better then a chain and as good as a plate class. <br />
<br />
#2 How can a this hybrid class duck all the restrictions on its monk brothers. No weight restrictions and now nerf that the monks got hit with. I was rather suprised to learn that one cause they are a direct split from a shaman/monk.<br />
<br />
But for me it really is coming down to the attitude fo the class. I know alot of nice BST's but i see alot more &quot;IM UBAH&quot; people poping up and slaming shaman, making hotkeys like &quot; Incoming group torpor with no crappy negitive effects&quot; for paragon, going out of their way to taunt other classes. That was is &quot;earning&quot; them a place on my ****list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>ShammEdavis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">#1. they dont mitigate better, they avoid better and dodge/block, plus /Disc protective.<br />
They &quot;can&quot; mitigate fair only if they spend 27 AAs on CS3/ID5.<br />
They mitigate about the same as a druid.<br />
<br />
#2.because they dont have the advantages of thier Monk brothers, they dont get the AC bonus in the first place. they also cant wear 1/2 of the killer Monk gear with insanely high AC for leather such as Flayed Barbarian Skin leggings. Beastlords dont get any gear worth a damn until the elemental planes.<br />
<br />
and even being a Shaman, ive seen many more Shaman giving that same holier than thou attitude to Beastlords than the other way around.<br />
<br />
with here is a real slow 75%  here is a real buff Focus not that Infusion crap etc.<br />
considering Shamans out number Beast by 50 to 1 at least, id say most of the tude you have seen from Beastlords is in dirrect retalitaion of Shamans acting like an ass.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">Well, arguments like this is what seperates those who know Shaman well and those who just think they do.<br />
<br />
The real role of a shaman is to always have mana. We're not buffers, debuffers, nor damage dealers. We're the guys who have the mana to do those things long after everyone else is out of steam. We are the glue that holds the group down, filling in the gaps that show when the stress hits.<br />
<br />
Anyone that argues for or against the Shaman based on slows just doesn't get the big picture. And if they bring up buffs, I just have to laugh.<br />
<br />
And I don't mean just in the high end game. If I run out of mana at any time level 24 and beyond, there is something seriously wrong in that situation. That either means too much demand is being placed for buffs, or the pulls are being done wrong. And in the last few levels of the game, you've got to be ****ing kidding me. There's no way to run out of mana if the encounter is played right.</div></div><hr />

They were purposely made that powerful because SOE noticed no one wanted to play this new crappy class they thought up. Solution? Make them overpowered.<br />
<br />
They get their own hastes, slows, regen spells that stack to get to replenishment levels, acumen, better disease cures than a druid(matching our own), their nukes do as much damage as ours until velium strike, and they have a more powerful pet than anyone but mages.<br />
<br />
Long overdue for nerfing actually...<br />
<br />
He's certainly right that Beastlords are overdue for a nerf. That's not a consequence of his skill, but simply that Beastlords are overpowered.<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, Litgruv, Beastlords were one of the (if not the) last hybrids to get any of their level 60 spells placed on vendors.  Observe the following, copied and pasted from the Ranger's Glade:<br />
<br />
60 Warders Protection |PoK Spell Vendor | Luclin Drop SoL Lvl 60+ Mobs <br />
60 Call of the Predator | Velious Drop Zone WW, SS, SG, POG <br />
60 Thorncoat | Phillip Aghiisews WL | Raciel Sanherb FV | Tisiana LV <br />
60 Enveloping Roots | Ellona BB | Weinna Oakchild WL | Raciel Sanherb FV <br />
<br />
WP, along with Paladin, Shadow Knight, and Bard formerly-drop-only spells were on the PoK vendor, iirc, nearly synchronous with the release of pop, if not on the vendor upon release.<br />
<br />
Yeah Call of the Predator is still drop only, but it's not dropping from THO, Rhags in Ssra, Grieg, and other stupid mobs that were dropping Savagery and Sha's Lethargy.  And incidentally, Savagery is about as useful as Avatar, and still costs the peridot component. <br />
<br />
And Beastlords avoided the hybrid nerfs because they 1). weren't around when the hybrids were originally nerfed or 2).  they were still broken and/or incomplete when the hybrids were nerfed.<br />
<br />

I stand corrected on the mitigation. and better understand a few things from your post, thank you.<br />
<br />
though i dont know about the retalitation. Maybe im just not seeing it cause i am a shaman but this isnt a standard of practice in my experience that you see any slow messages of &quot; Slowing 75% which is better then a BST or Enchanter &quot;.  Maybe its hard to see cause me and my guild shaman dont act like that and its not exactly every day you have 2 shaman and a BST in the group.<br />

these are the true juveniles that play the game.  Not everyone flaunts his/her &quot;spear&quot; like that, most of us play a class we like and try to have a good time doing it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">Haagen apparently subscribes to the principle that it is completely taboo to even mention balancing different classes in a game.  <br />
<br />
I think that's a stupid principle.  <br />
<br />
If the game is going to retain purpose and a sense of fairness, then absolutely the developers will need to constantly assess how classes function in relation to another.  If there's an inbalance, they need to act upon it.  <br />
<br />
That's called a nerf, and contrary to the stupid whining, it's a good thing.  Kind of like pulling weeds from a garden, not much fun but necessary to keep a nice garden.  <br />
<br />
So, it's not taboo to utter the word &quot;nerf&quot; and it's completely appropriate to discuss what is or is not unbalanced on bulletin boards created for discussing aspects of that game.  <br />
<br />
Or, we can sit around and compare &quot;spears&quot; or which classes make the best 2-bot combinations.  <br />
<br />
The original poster (the one quoted) sounded like a tool.  I thought it was reasonable to note that it's not his skill but the power of his class which permits him to carry on that way.  <br />
<br />
Yes, Beastlords probably are overpowered these days - and that's why everyone and their grandmother is rolling one up.  In the long run, you will look back and think, &quot;hmm, there's way too many of us now, maybe that should change....&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not suggesting Shaman are adversely effected really, because there's too many shaman too.  I've thought that for a while.  <br />
<br />
Not every class can and should be represented in exactly equal numbers.  That's not necessary to a functioning game, and perhaps not even desireable.  Each class is, however, viable at this time.  Each class can't be designed with the same level of stackability, and classes that are less stackable need to have reasons why yet still be potent.  I'd imagine that's a tough line to walk.  Or, make every class alike, but that's not a good option.  <br />
<br />
There's some tuning that is required for some classes, notably warriors and maybe monks/rogues (I'm not sure about them), and probably some tuning due for beastlords.  I think they are too desireable now for a lot of reasons.  <br />

<br />
Too desireable?  Seems like if they're &quot;too desireable&quot; then perhaps we should scale the rest of the classes up to that level, not a &quot;too desireable&quot; class down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">SAY IT ISNT SO!!!!  I've been buffing with infusion, please forgive me.  Of course I also prefer to group with clerics, like enchanters and one of my friends is a bst, so I'm definately CERTIFIABLE :D<br />
The issue with enchanter/beastlord/shaman slow is much more of an indictment of high level shaman slows than any real problem with the others' slow.  It does seem a little odd that our class definining ability is a level 51, vendor bought, kunark spell :ROLLEYES  A less resistable version of turgurs at level 61 would have been an appropriate addition to pop.<br />
Again, from what I've seen, bsts getting the majority of monks' mitigation and avoidance without any of the monks' restriction is unbalanced.  Not that it needs to be nerfed, but it certainly makes monks less desirable in comparison.  Of course, shaman have our own balance issues.  It never seemed quite kosher to me that, as a shaman, I can go toe to toe with mobs that I simply couldn't touch when I was a paladin.  On the other hand, it doesn't feel quite right somehow that an enchanter can be within 5% of my very best slow, and its pretty much an accessory spell to them.<br />
The continual dilution of class abilities is both a boon and a bane.  You can have some pretty unusual group makeups and do quite well.  This is great and adds a lot of diversity.  However, the specialists have a bit of a problem, in that someone else can come along and offer most of what you do, and add much more in the bargain.  Clerics and warriors probably have the most constrained roles and are absolutely required many places, yet cross-class abilities make them somewhat less desirable, and in many ways boring by comparison.<br />
Its something that most specialist classes must deal with now.  The bright side for shaman is that, at least for now, we still are desirable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Naah don't nerf Bl's - nerf idiots.<br />
<br />
Anyway.  Onto something Giac alluded to re - spells being resisted based on level of the spell as opposed to caster.<br />
<br />
Remember when Bards were up in arms about their songs getting resisted? Level 50 Bards were getting resisted by Orc Pawns for cryign out loud.<br />
<br />
Stick with me on this one.<br />
<br />
Well ol ester &quot; the idiot tester &quot; did some of her infamous 1337 in-house diagnostics and proclaimed &quot;Bards were ok.&quot;  She then released the text and iirc some other info.<br />
<br />
What was quickly pointed out (By people infinitely more knowledgeable than brad's squeeze) was that ester was testing the level of the SONG and not the level of the BARD.<br />
<br />
She backpedaled more than mj on the 'Thriller' tour and the coding was fixed. (Or so I heard - maybe Bards moved onto other problems).<br />
<br />
So there is precedent for your theory Giac.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u109"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p109">Yes and Beastlords don't get the innate ac bonus therefore they don't have the weight restriction. If the innate ac bonus does not work then take that up with Sony rather than calling for nerfs on other classes.<br />
<br />
Are you referring to the innate monk avoidance bonus? Correct, BST do not get that, but nor do they get the innate monk mitigation penalty which hurts far worse than the avoidance helps.  See the million threads on Monkly Business for the information/parses you desire.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bards get exactly the same double attack aa that Beastlords do. Does that mean you should get bard aa's as well as beastlord ones? It is not a monk aa, it is a melee aa. Now if Beastlords got an AA for mend or FD then I would think you have due cause for complaint. However, Beastlords don't.<br />
<br />
Yes, and bards also get an AA &quot;Fading Memories&quot; which does something a monk can't even do: 100% mem wipe FD.  My point is simply that you can buy things that make you more &quot;monk like&quot;, whereas a monk cannot buy things in turn to make them more &quot;beastlord like&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
This shows you have never ever played a Beastlord. I get smacked about just as much as monks. I have no idea where you got this idea that we mitigate beter than monks. Go post this on the Beastlord forum and get laughed out of there. As far as I can tell I get hit the same as the druids and monks. Only thing that enables me to tank in PoP is ID 5, LR 5 and my block skill. Monks get the same boosts from those aa too.<br />
<br />
How did slow come into this? Any group you have in PoP will likely have a slower. You were comparing monk tanking vs Beastlord tanking. As for the pet tanking at any time? put me and another melee against a mob and please show me how the pet can tank. <br />
<br />
I tell you what. Come back to me with parses or some other evidence that clearly show that monks mitigate worse than Beastlords and I'll agree with you. Until then stop spouting guesses just because you are a disgruntled monk.<br />
<br />
You are 100% correct, I have never played a BST.  An equally geared BST will outtank a monk for the reasons I've already stated. I'm not comparing extraneous factors such as who else is in the group, I'm talking: go pull a mob solo and see who tanks better.  It will be the BST, pure and simple for the reasons already stated.  Again, see Monkly Business for the parses/posts on the subject.<br />
<br />
As for being a disgrunted monk, I rerolled an sk and haven't looked back, but I feel pity for monk class as they're bottom of the heap at the moment.  I'm not calling for a nerf on BSTs, I couldn't care less if BST 100% replace shamans, tanks, monks, druids, bards, whatever.  I never group outside my circle of friends or 2 boxing so it would have zero effect on me.  Just pointing out a few things vis a vis BST/MNK and how stupidly broken pure melee are right now.<br />
<br />
But again: keep bragging on how you CAN replace shaman, monk, tank, etc... and be sure to make Furor aware that you tank better than warriors on raids. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">that guy is just dumb. There is an overlapping of skills between shaman and beastlord, and in a few cases, the beastlord might be a superior replacement in exp groups. Hardly in the majority of the time however, and in raids? fat chance. Blords for some reason think thier 65% slow has some resist modifier that makes it better than turgurs. Not true.<br />
<br />
edit: lol, I stopped reading after the first 2 paragraphs, but the last 2 are far more amusing. I can clearly tell in the last paragraph that this is simple a rant from someone frustrated by class envy... Beastlords suffer from the same kind of disease bards have (except bards are a bit cooler of a class imo) they are a jack of all trades, master of none. They have buffs easily outdone by other hybrid classes, pets worse than mages and necromancers, DPS lower than rogues, and debuffing abilities below shamans and enchanters. On top of that, and again just like bards, very few people understand exactly what the class is capable of.<br />
<br />
Having read the last 2 paragraph's I'd have to guess the post was brought about by some form of rejection in favor of a shaman.</div></div><hr />

I was in the Plane of Nightmare the other day.  I being a lvl 56 shaman was the only healer in the group.  With Superior healing doing 583hp heals and Chloroblast for quick 428hp heals.  I had two, I repeat TWO beastlords in my group.  58 and a 53 vah shirs.  Anyway, we had no Cleric.  An awesome 55 wizard with 51aa.  A Mage, and an Enchanter. And I believe we had a 57 Monk pulling/tanking.  Even with the low hp heals.  I would malosi the pull as soon as it got in my casting range, then by the time I got slow off immediately after malosi the monk already had argo.  Then I would just canaibize a few times and heal the monk.  We grouped for 3 hours with no cleric and no deaths.  <br />
<br />
At one point we tried to let the 55 enchanter slow, but she sucked so bad at I I had to take over again.  She got constant resist and if she tashed it then slowed the monk was taken too much of a beating.  <br />
Whats good here is the DPS was awesome.  The wizard would crit in the 1000's several times on each pull, the two bst were dishing out dmg.  My pet was in there too.  <br />
<br />
On top of that, the 58 Bst would cast a 300hp heal on me everyonce in a while to help with my Canablizing for mana.  A few times we had bad pulls and the chanter was getting beaten for trying to mez so I had to Crowd Control with root and heal 2 or 3 different people.  <br />
<br />
My Kei wore out early on.  Even at 56 as a Barbarian shaman in bearform without kei I had 253 wisdom.  I stayed around 70% mana the whole time and several people in the group commented on how this was the best group they had been in for a long time.  The whole point here is the person behind the keyboard knew what they were doing and let all the classes do their job as well as doing the traditional role of the shaman.<br />
<br />
Before we ended that day the BST hit 59 and 3 people including me dinged the aa bar =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u117"><b>ShammEdavis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p117">Yes, Beastlords probably are overpowered these days - and that's why everyone and their grandmother is rolling one up<br />
<br />
Hmmm well im not quite sure how the people that think Beastlords are so overpowered come to that conclusion myself.<br />
<br />
If anything once in the Elemental planes i feel they need a boost.<br />
<br />
Let me preface this by saying im not a Beastlord, BUT my RL friend and next door neighbor is a lvl 65 Beast with 152AAs.<br />
He and I get together regularly have a few beers and not surprizingly EQ makes it into our conversations frequently.<br />
Once he gets a couple beers in him he wont **** sometimes, so i've gotten an earfull many times.<br />
So he has enlightened me greatly on the trials and tribulations, strengths and weaknesses of a Beastlord.<br />
I must say, he knows his char well.<br />
<br />
They put out good DPS yes, but about 1/2 the DPS of a Elemental equiped Wizard. So does that mean a Wizard thats nicely equiped is also overpowered?<br />
Most of you here while beating your own chest state that you think a Shaman can outdamage a Beastlord also. (ive yet to outdamage him myself so i'll pass those comments off as just bravado)<br />
So i guess to some of you we too must be overpowered?<br />
<br />
Ive personally seen an Enchanter SOLO a lvl 66 mini boss in BOT, *and more than once*.<br />
 that was &quot;after&quot; the so called charm nerf.<br />
I know a Necro that slowly rot rooted a high lvl Mob that has like 200,000HPs SOLO, took him like 3 hours but none the less did it.<br />
<br />
Talk about &quot;overpowered&quot;.<br />
<br />
A Beastlord has a pet that after lvl 62 does approx 50-90DPS depending on buffs &amp; Mage weapons and resistance &amp; lvl of Mob.<br />
Thats totally in line with other pet classes, and not even remotely close to Charmed pets.<br />
A Beastlords spells are rather lackluster, they have 1 decent dot that does approx 36DPS, they have 2 DD both cold based for 675 &amp; 430 i think, (unaltered by ID IV) so if a Mob is highly cold resistant are all but useless..<br />
Weapon wise your average Beastlord only has 2 choices that are really viable, H2H &amp; 2HB.<br />
H2H will primarily be the weapon most use since they can get a Waning light Katar &amp; maybe a Kasheks Katar or other simular droppable weapons reasonably easy/cheaply and is their one and only weapon skill thats maxed at 250, unlike a Monk whom has i believe 3 weapon skills H2H/2HB/1HB all at 250.<br />
A Beastlord has to pay for an 80% Double Attack at lvl 61 for 10AAs.<br />
<br />
For whatever reason &quot;most&quot; guilds seem to regard Monks higher on the H2H weapon list than Beastlords, even though a 2HB weapon for monks is superior, that puts a high lvl Beast of which at least on my server there are only like maybe 10-18 lvl 65s or something like that on the whole server at a severe disadvantage trying to obtain very nice H2H weapons which are ALL No Drop and 98% of them unfortunately for them Monk usable which out number Beastlords 50 -1.<br />
<br />
A very good 2HB for a Beast can be a good choice but only if its one of the top 5-6 2HBs in the game.<br />
ie: a Caens Bo Staff of Fury will easily outdamage any H2H combo thats less than maybe Battlefist + Waning Light Katar, and you wont have to sacrafice much if anything on stats either.<br />
But just what are the odds of a Beast getting that CBoF when there are any Monks present?, highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
The very best Beastlord weapons in game are ALL Monk usable and almost without exception goes to the Monk first. *guild dependant of course, but generally true*<br />
<br />
Beastlords are at a distinct disadvantage in the equipment dept also, they are a Melee wearing leather and without all the advantages a Monk gets, dont get the same AC bonus, most all of the best leather gear is Monk ONLY and not Beast useable, and they have less Dodge/Block to boot. for the most part they share Druid gear, except that even druids get very good and very easily obtainable druid only armor such as Elysian, ever look at the Beast only armor? its pure crap. If droppable would be VT, and its not even all that easy to get. LOL they get hosed on armor<br />
<br />
The few items of leather armor that a Beast can wear that is remotely good, is also shared by Monks like The Wi****ll Tunic of the Void *rare*<br />
and odds are very high a Monk would get it if it on the unlikely event it dropped, Ornate leather Tunic pattern drops off i think 6 mobs, 5 of which are in Tower of Solusek ro. 1 simi rare drop off Auliffe in BOT.<br />
Now that Ornate drops have been increased dramatically this is at least a possibilty. Although id bet SOE will &quot;stealth nerf&quot; those drops shortly.<br />
<br />
He is still wearing a PSC, and he has been lvl 65 for i think about 9-10 months seems like.<br />
<br />
Only Beastlord wearable gear thats really worth a damn is in the Elemental Planes, that means there are maybe on average about 3-6 Beastlords per server that have a chance at nice armor and good stats, and thats only after every Monk gets thier fill.<br />
Thats a fairly generalized statement though in that &quot;context&quot; is quite accurite.<br />
<br />
So they have a good pet, not nearly the best.<br />
<br />
They have fair damage spells, no where even remotely the best.<br />
<br />
They &quot;can&quot; with lvl 65 &amp; about 50+ AAs into offence do very acceptable damage with H2H weapons and a few top 2HBs, ALL of which they have to beg borrow or steal before they can pry it out of a Monks cold dead hands.<br />
<br />
Their top damage comes from a culmination of Pet/Spells/H2H<br />
each representing approx 1/3 of their output.<br />
Under absolute ideal conditions, can use pet/mob isnt highly cold resistant/they have been blessed with a pair of hard to get H2H weapons, have 100+AAs.<br />
Yes, a Beastlord can lay out some serious damage well into the 250+ DPS range. Under less than ideal conditions your average Beast is doing around 140-160DPS, not bad, certainly not overpowering by any means<br />
<br />
and you know what? good for them.<br />
They worked their damn ass off to get it.<br />
<br />
I for one am glad to have a Beastlord in any group/raid.<br />
<br />
As this Nunya person said albeit not very tactfully, still he was dead on like or not.<br />
A Beastlord properly geared and AA'ed can very easily take over both Tank &amp; main slower role in a single group fast pulling exp grind with Mobs that dont quad for something insane.<br />
I know this to be factual because ive been in that group many many times.<br />
<br />
My friend tanks just fine under those specific conditions, many times im the MH &amp; he tanks AND slows &amp; i very rarely bother to slap my slow over his, only time i might is if its just us Duoing thus taking alot longer to kill.<br />
He needs his slow for aggro and leads with it then follows with Incapacitate then Scorpion Venom and begins Melee once in awhile he will cast flash of light as sort of a cheap mana fast cast ghetto taunt.<br />
/shrug, works.<br />
<br />
Only class i think that can even touch a Beastlord in this type of group is an SK and to slightly lesser degree pally, BUT that is only if that group has a Shaman or Enchanter to slow.<br />
I have no problem being the buffho and healer when he is MT/Slower, suites me just fine, does'nt threaten my Shamanhood in the slightest.<br />
<br />
He gets aggro fast, keeps aggro very well even with over nuking Wizards &amp; high damage Rogues jumping right in immediately, and as the healer i very rarely ever have to hit him with more than 2 heals, and many times nothing but Q.<br />
Frankly there is'nt a Warrior that i know that can touch him &quot;in this kind of group&quot;<br />
Please if you cant comprehend what your reading or twist it all out of context, then just keep it to yourself.<br />

  ShammEdavis... you made this account just yesterday, for the sole purpose of posting in THIS thread (the location of all 6 of your posts thus far... I predict a 7th shortly).   Your posts are usually only seperated by a single post by other individuals.<br />
<br />
  First off, the lack of posts anywhere else, and recent creation of the post make it exceedingly suspicious that this &quot;friend&quot; who is a BL is really YOU and that you were probably posting in this thread earlier and losing the argument, so you started up an account to give yourself support.   I am not sure on that point though as I have not bothered to read every post in here...   Quite frankly, who cares?<br />
<br />
<br />
  You are seeking to pick a fight over which class is better etc...  BOTH classes are quite nice in and of themselves.  If you are happy with your own class, then who cares about other classes?   Nobody.<br />
<br />
  I love how your last post ended with a diatribe about how foolish it is to attack someone for the fact their drivel is completely unreadable... cause your post IS completely impossible to comprehend.<br />
<br />
<br />
  You want to think that you &quot;won&quot; this arguement.  You want it BAD.   Well, I'll say now.. GRATZ!  YOU WIN!   Cause nobody is going to change their minds based off this junk of a thread ;)   So please, pretend you won and realize that the only people who care about this topic are people who:<br />
<br />
A) Wish it would quit getting bumped to the top (I am in this group)<br />
<br />
B) Are really quite inept at playing ANY class because they are stuck in class envy anytime someone else accomplishes something.  (here's a hint to those people.... get off the boards, and go accomplish something with ANY class... all of em do reallly neat stuff)</div></div><hr />

This is kind of funny actually.  Because high level monks over at Monkly Business(I'm a monk first, shaman very close second) bitch about exactly the opposite problem.  These weapons being tagged Beastlord and the drops going to BST instead of MNK and wishing Sony would remove the BST tag from the weapons so they'd have a chance at getting them.  I'm not a very high level monk, so I haven't seen this first hand, but these two arguments together tell me that something is(and has been) plain wrong with the itemization for PoP.  I still don't see how Sony is going to dig themselves out of the trap of just making weapons and armor better and better and thus trivilizing their current content more and more(older content already is).  It's a balance issue that can only end in nerfs and everyone pissed.</div></div><hr />

The main thing you see with beastlords is the fact ours is a faster cast time, and since we have no tash or malo to cast, our slow is the first thing we cast, heck we pull with it. In general we can get 2 or more casts off before you get one, and many times our slow may land the first try. So all in all, with our 1.9sec slow, we have 2 attempts to your 1.<br />
<br />
LUCY says that BST best slow is 3.5 sec...which is .5 slower than our cast...<br />

I am sorry, I forgot to mnetion hy our slow cast in 1.9sec innatly. All hybrids get an innate detrimental spell haste, this includes dots, slows, debuffs, nukes, Any spell considered harmful.<br />
<br />
At lvl65 we have our max innate detrimental spell haste, and it brings our slow to 1.9sec w/o any buffs or focus.<br />
<br />
Our nukes cast in 1.8sec as well.<br />
<br />
This is the reason we slow so fast, also every hybrid has it, rangers/pal/sk etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u124"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p124">&quot;I&quot; can replace enchanter,cleric,beastlord,druid in a group and handle all the support myself.  No other class can do that.  <br />
I can do that in groups up to and including Sol Ro Tower.  And I have recently. <br />
<br />
However, I control an advanced character with some decent gear and quite a few AAs.  In addition, I really know how to play quite well.  <br />
<br />
That said, a beastlord can't hope to duplicate my above claim.  They are a DPS class with a few support options.  That's cool.  So are rangers.  SKs and Pallies infringe FAR more on the duties of warriors than beastlords infringe on the duties of shamans.  <br />
<br />
Thank you and kindly shut up all of u.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u125"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p125">To answer the thread title.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
Beastlords are an excellent dps class.  Have good buffs.  But they are not a total replacement for the shaman class.  Even SOE isn't that mentally challenged.<br />
<br />
Note: I only read the thread title, not all 4 pages.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Quanchi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">I am a 65 bst and am going to start a shaman twink, after reading these posts I am kinda suprised to see just stupid comments. Such as asking a Beastlord to be a main healer in the group. Thats like those Kentucy Fried Chicken commercials where he goes to a drive thru at McDonalds and ask for mashed potatoes, of course a BST will not be main healer in a grp.<br />
<br />
As a Beastlord, Shamans CAN out dps a bst with ease...yes, it would require the use of mana which a bst doesnt always need to use extensively to dish out dps. An UBER bst can dish out close to 200dps w/ their pet by their side. I can only dish out close to 130-150 /cry. I'm sure many shamans are capable up keeping a good mana pool in addition to dishing out dps.<br />
<br />
Usually in my exp grp with friends, its a War, Bst, Ench, Sham, Cle, Rogue in Tactics piglet room. FAIRLY normal grp (kinda like a standard family &gt;&lt;) but as a bst in this group, I could easily be replaced by dps, same w/ the shaman. The Ench usually doesnt wanna deal w/ slowing and possibly mezzing/charming. So the group gets another slower. Be it a bst, or shaman. I know Shamans can take a beating but i feel I can take one better. And as someone stated before shaman buffs will only add a close 100-150 more hp compares to bst' stacking theirs (but 150 hp could mean differnece between wipe at this point ^_^) This group does very well b/c alot of classes compliment ech other. <br />
<br />
If Cleric afk, shaman can back up heal<br />
If Shaman afk, I can slow<br />
If Ench afk with add on pull...ill usually pull one off w/ a slow early on and shaman can root mez while i take a beating. <br />
If War afk, I CAN tank (hell anyone can tank if they needed to) while they are afk and that requires me to use mana (its like the paladin/sk thing again)<br />
<br />
A shaman's soloing capabilities are far better then bst' in higher end imo b/c they can lay out ALL their DoT's for massive dmg on the run. I have to rely on my pet (w/o SoW in some zones, pet snare aa isint as helpful as you may thing) with a nuke and some weak ass DoT's.<br />
<br />
Also if you want something to flame me on, flame me on the fact that imo this thread is to long so i only read the first page~. Im sorry if i made anyone in those other pages mad &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />
