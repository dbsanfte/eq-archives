<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We talk about this constantly . . . <br />
I don't remember what the agreed-upon most impressive kill to date was . . . <br />
It's nothing special I'm sure in comparison to what enchanters have already done using PoP charms . . . <br />
<br />
A few months ago I was bored and decided to solo dragons in WW.  I did a few and found them too easy, so I moved to ToV entr area and started pulling the nesting ones there.  Those were a bit harder but not really a challenge either.  I killed em all cept for Ionat who silences and I was afraid of that . . . maybe I'm a pussay tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've been working on Va'Dyn lately, plan to do Rumble soon as I get some nice elemental Hps on me.   Either will be insanely hard, and so far I haven't worked out how I will get them single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Rumblecrush?  Easy, run up and Malo him.  This will agro all the guards also, but RC outruns his guards.  Just keep RC in agro range.  By the time you get to the ME entrance, the guards have all turned back, and RC is single pulled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hrm, I would of course need to avoid any mobs on the way back, but if it is really that easy then I am quite pleased :)    Va'Dyn sadly does NOT outrun his guards, and getting back to entrance without other aggro is nearly impossible :(<br />
<br />
<br />
  I need more DPS to clear his guards fast enough... maybe with LDoN I can have a chance.</div></div><hr />
