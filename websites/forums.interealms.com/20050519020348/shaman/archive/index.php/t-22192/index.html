<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guchu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Firstly let me apologize for what follows is basically spam.  I am very excited about this guild, though, and would truly like to see it succeed.<br />
<br />
We are a new guild forming, tentatively named The Old World, with goals focused on that exactly, exploring EverQuest as it was in the old world.  I am one of the many seasoned EverQuest players to look back longingly on the days of old when camping the FBSS was a rush, and seeing a pair of GEBS drop was a dream.  This goal is forming with intent to step back in time, and explore EverQuest as it was when it was new.<br />
<br />
This guild will have many self imposed limitations, which are required of every member.  To begin with, we will live in the &quot;Classic Era.&quot;  This means that we play the game as if we were at a point in which Kunkark had not yet been released.  We will be limited to level 50, and will wear only equipment available before the release of Kunark.  We will adventure in any and all of the old world zones, including and especially the exciting dungeons.  We will aspire to vanquish dragons and to conquer planes.<br />
<br />
If this is something you would like to be a part of, then we would love to have you as a part of our family.  Please visit our boards at http://theoldworld.kicks-ass.net/boards/ .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">can i join? im a 65 shaman with time gear.. since you guys are all 50 with old school armor i could probably be the best tank !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">what was the reason for that last post tikoko? I think it's a great idea, even though the ability to go to the bazaar and use port books are still there, good for them if they are trying to start up something like this. Good luck, too bad im not on lanys or I would join ya.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what was the reason for any of my posts?<br />
<br />
BTW.. there are emulated servers that have only original EQ running if your guild wants to check it out.. probably be easier than just 'ignoring' every other expansion</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I like the idea with a pure old world guild. Im not sure how easy it would be to create one on a regular server though.</div></div><hr />
