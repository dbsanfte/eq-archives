<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a bit confused, and perhaps that's because I haven't had much caffiene yet. <br />
<br />
Just logged on and made my Scaled Avatar Sleeves (Improved Healing 4). Equipped them, then hit Tnarg's to see what kind of a heal I got. I was still down to around 45% (damn POK library elevator). I got a 1586 heal. Now, I have HA and AHA 3 ... so according to Samanna's Reference Desk (I love you Samanna, and I mean that) I should be getting a total 1807 heal from Tnarg's ... right? When I fell off the elevator, I had plenty of health missing to fit the full 1807 heal in, so it wasn't an overheal issue ... Am I a misguided shaman who needs to reread something somewhere?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks. :)<br />
<br />
And yes, it's a range. That's why the Ref Desk (http://morelight.org/samanna/gear_focus.html#blast) lists average and maximum values. And there's also the Notes: at the top:<br />
1. NO Focus Effects or Alternate Abilities modify Kragg's Mending in any way.<br />
2. Only modifiers to all spell levels up to 65 will be listed.<br />
3. Focus Effects of a kind (i.e., Mana Pres) will not stack; the best will work.<br />
4. AAs will stack with the best Focus Effect - up to a cap if indicated.<br />
5. Focus effects are actually a range up to the published percentage.<br />
5.a Buff Duration effects and all AAs function at listed values, not ranges.<br />
5.b Saryn's Torment and Saryn's Venom are fixed at listed values, not ranges.<br />
1807 is the maximum possible with a Tnarg's (1300) with Improved Healing IV focus (up to 20% bonus), Advanced Healing Adept 3 (19% bonus), and no crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohhhhh, okay. It was explained to me to be a flat +20% adjustment. Thanks guys, I was completely befuddled there. :) No surprise, I'm a barbarian.<br />

Well Im certain thats wrong. I trained the first level of Healing Adept, and my Kraggs healing value increased. When I log in, ill check the amout.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cleric CH is affected by AA's, but not by focuses.  I have not casted Kraggs since I got Tnarg's, but I can give this a test next time I log on, and see if Kragg's is in the same boat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AAs but not focuses? So, like a crit Kragg's is possible? Or are there certain AAs that will and won't affect Kragg's?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not crits, just Adept.  At least, this is what I heard from several when browsing the Cleric forums on EQ Live boards after reading the &quot;I was shocked&quot; post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Healing Adept = Effects Kragg<br />
Healing Gift = Doesnt effect Kragg<br />
Focuses = Dont effect Kragg</div></div><hr />
