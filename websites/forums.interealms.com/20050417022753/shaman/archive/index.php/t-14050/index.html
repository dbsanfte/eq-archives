<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've read about solo'ing Fay guards for their loot, and have killed quite a few HHK guards and paineel guards in my day.  At this point, however, the Fay guards have been nerfed down to 20 minute spawns, and both heretics and HHK are only good for loot.<br />
<br />
So, my question: anyone have experience hunting other guards?  I am 56, with about 1050 AC/3k HPs, fungi, horse, no JBB.<br />
<br />
I was thinking of East Cabilis and Neriak, since I am a barbarian, but other suggestions are welcome--I'm not worried about ganking a worthless faction if it means a couple of easy levels.<br />
<br />
Also, FWIW, guards frequently make for good hunting for several reasons:<br />
<br />
1) usually old-world mobs means low HPs, low hits, low resists;<br />
<br />
2) many cities give the same exp bonus as newbie yards (+25%), which adds up fast;<br />
<br />
3) guards are usually warrior-type mobs with static spawns, which means easy pulls and a very predictable exp-grind camp;<br />
<br />
4) guards often drop a FS item on every kill, which adds up to ok cash after a while;<br />
<br />
5) its a shameless ego boost when you kill them in front of newbies.<br />
<br />
So, any suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cabilis is out of the question. those guards are insane, just dont even think about it lol. <br />
<br />
I remember doing this, just looking around towns for prey hehe. most towns just have too many NPCs that are KoS (or soon will be) or the guards are packed too tightly.<br />
<br />
Neriak commons is a good place for guards though. they are 1% aa a kill when they are still dark blue, and they drop a sword that sells for 11 plat everytime along with a shield that sells for 1-2 plat. only problem is that they have some strange resists. even though they are light blue malise sometimes wont stick at all, and even after malise slow wont stick until a few casts. hit for 120s if I remember right, and dont have too much hp. you cant reallly run out of them. once in awhile you'll get an SK gaurd that oddly duel wields =P. the corprals are pretty straight foward but resist more.<br />
<br />
from what I recall, most *gate* guards were redone with the release of kunark, I guess with the level cap gone people could kill them pretty easy, which kinda sucks for newbies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">OK, faced with a challenge like 'its out of the question', I just had to give it a try.  Here's the rundown.<br />
<br />
The troopers (warriors) and crusaders (SKs) both hit for a max of 187; the SKs HT for a max of 701. About 5-6k HPs it seemed.<br />
<br />
Neither of these are all that bad, except that they spawn equipped with 2 swords (troopers) or a hammer and shield (SKs), which means that they DW like crazy; it was almost as though they were hasted.  I tried creating a newb and handing them a 2hander, but they just gave it back.<br />
<br />
The biggest challenge I found was their aggro transfer range.  Although the aggro range itself was reasonable for level 50 mobs, they would transfer aggro to their friends across what seemed like 1/2 the zone.<br />
<br />
However, at one of the entrances (WW if I remember), there are only 2 warrior spawns and a wandering SK.  By using the cazic-thule trick (root 1, wait for other, root it at the zone, then zone out and back in), I could break the spawn and hold it.  Of course, thats only 3 mobs, and the next location in is another 2-spawn that has to be broken the same way, which is hasslesome.<br />
<br />
I could probably also have just slowed one, and sic'ed muttmutt on the other to keep it busy while I slowed it too, but those five spawns are all there are at that entrance. I didn't stick around that long, but I am guessing they are on a 20-minute timer, which means a fair bit of waiting for spawns if you have a horse to med on.<br />
<br />
So, overall: doable, but probably not worth it.  <br />
<br />
I looked around farther in, and there are a couple of lone guards scattered around East Cab near the necro guild, but again, there are only a couple of campable ones.<br />
<br />
One other thing: with all of the canals and bridges, east cab has more pathing bugs and potential exploits than any other zone I have ever seen (except maybe CoM).<br />
<br />
Using lev, I was even able to find a cool little abandoned firepit and lean-to in a scout crevice high up in the rocks.  And yes, I was able to cast from there and not get hit (although that requires another trick, since you can't see them below you), but thats all the detail that is fit to print, cause I think thats lame.  (Its also really, really obvious to anyone in the area what you are doing).<br />
<br />
Maybe I'll give the inkies a taste of the Soulstripper tomorrow. ;-)<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Update:  I went back and tried the guards outside of the city in WW last night just to see how it would work out...and it didn't; I got turned into a bearskin rug.<br />
<br />
All the troopers run at faster than sow speed, and after a slow resist and 3 root resists (and the bonus add from the insane aggro transfer range), I got skinned.<br />
<br />
Inside was a little easier, since you can just hop to the zone, but if you wanna try this in the surrounding zones, keep cheetah up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One other thing that I forgot:  I was fighting the guards --inside-- the city, not the ones protecting newbs outside.<br />
<br />
The newbie guards in most cities were beefed up a long time ago and are now severe undercons.  Try the paineel guards out in the newbie area to see what I mean; they are green at level 35 or so, but hit and take damage as if they are about 20 levels higher.<br />
<br />
The guards inside of a city, however, don't seem to ever get much of a workout (too many donuts, I guess), so they are frequently push-overs that make for good hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">felwithe guards are duable at lvl 55 ish but are a pain as they loh and heal thenselves!  i think it be worth researching this more fully, as hhk is such a good camp - if we could find another one similar to this id be mucho happpy )<br />
<br />
Better if its an outdoor zone too- so i can use a mount....however if the exp is worth the effort then ill just have to lump it!!<br />
<br />
what about arkanon? its a big city- gotta be something theer to hunt<br />
erudin seems to be a no- too many healer types or lvl 60 mobs to agro (<br />
<br />
qeynos??<br />
<br />
research time....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tilanali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">eheh, right up there with canni'ing myself to death is this.  I was bored Monday night with xp grinding, so I thought I'd try something new...  <br />
<br />
Went to Neriak and discovered, to my glee, that the guards there were blue to me.  &quot;Why not?&quot;, I ask myself, &quot;lets see how long their respawn time is&quot;.  <br />
<br />
LOL, respawn time??? eheh, I never got that far. I had no idea that their magic resistances were so high, should'a figured...<br />
<br />
Oh, and slow doesn't single pull them like it does so many other things...<br />
<br />
and they hit hard...<br />
<br />
and fast...<br />
<br />
I zoned with half a bub of health. LOL<br />
<br />
So, moral of this story? Don't try the guards in Neriak LOL</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">So, moral of this story? Don't try the guards in Neriak LOL<br />
<br />
I tried them at 50 - they did have high resists, but not that bad. Plus, I can take a pounding for a while - I've got AC over 900 self buffed (my hps aren't that great, but slowly getting higher).<br />
<br />
Shaben</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've been scouting around too...here is what I have been looking for.<br />
<br />
1) should be a zone that includes newbie mobs.  This is key, since its the newbie yard bonus (+25% exp) that makes it worthwhile, and I'm not sure that this is present in mob-less cities like Erudin or non-newbie zones like shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
2) indoor/outdoor not really a factor, since you should get the dungeon exp bonus (10%) indoors, although no horse.<br />
<br />
3) ideal location would be someplace buried in the back of the zone, since fewer people to bother you, and usually fewer wanderers and guild leaders.<br />
<br />
4) preferably old-world, since mobs are easier.<br />
<br />
5) preferably on a worthless faction, since that will undoubtably get hosed.<br />
<br />
So far, the cities that make this cut include: paineel, akanon, cabilis, neriak, grobb, and maybe oggok (it was redone, so mobs may be too tough, but I haven't been there).<br />
<br />
Paineel is good, although the mobs green out by about 35-ish.<br />
<br />
Cabilis is doable (at 56/3k HP/1k AC, anyway), but not likely to be efficient unless you are willing to exploit the many pathing issues there, and I am not.<br />
<br />
Neriak has been reported on, and looks to be similar to cabilis; doable, but likely not worth the hassle.<br />
<br />
Akanon looks promising (I hunted there with my necro long ago), particularly since mobs are usually spread out, and there is a nice opposing faction to work with.<br />
<br />
Guess I am headed to ogguk next.  ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was going to say Grobb till you put that in the last message... What about Shar Val? I know you preferred old world, but there is a newbie zone right inside the city, so you are guarenteed the newb bonus. Seemed like there were lots of guards around. I know its outside your preference, but I would be curious to know how they stack up in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>starlite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">afreeman your analysis was good...but flawed.<br />
<br />
Theres no nuuby area inside akanon, grobb oggok, gukta, neriak or rivervale.<br />
<br />
I think we need to look for 2 thinsg;  targets inside cities in antonica/faydwer and npcs in the nuuby area adjacent.<br />
<br />
paineel and kelethin seem most promising atmo.<br />
<br />
other?  north qeynos  west and east fp.<br />
<br />
thats 5 to explore  seems enough work for the moment.....<br />
<br />
<br />
btw where in akanon did u hunt with ya necro?  the mechanics?<br />
<br />
really were looking for mobs 41 to 44 in lvl if this is a post hhk spot ...  right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Psycotika</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well I was talking about the city guards in the newbie zones =P no idea on the ones inside.<br />
<br />
neriak is easy once you get the hang of it. just pull out of the gate into the commons area, all on 10 minute respawn if i remember right. also a little know about place is the 3rd gate. its hard to diescribe where, its the area with the two wizards. plus there is 1 guard and 1 necro. its pretty good for low 50s but at 54 Id say its no good anymore. spawn time is decent so you wont have to wait too long for mobs to pop. <br />
<br />
yet another neriak place you may want to try is the arena in the forigen quater. there are 4-5 (I believe) mobs that are high 40s. your camp spot will be a small store in the back. because they are merchant you will not be kos. breaking the spawn is fun =D you will get 2 at a time until they are broken. exp was ok solo in the mmid 50s I was getting better duoing with a RL friend eariler though<br />
<br />
GL and have fun</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I tried the Golems in the outpost...at the overthere...what a huge waste of mana..all I have to say is thank the heavens for the Pok book!  Lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Theres no nuuby area inside akanon, grobb oggok, gukta, neriak or rivervale.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, there are mobs for newbies to fight (e.g. rats, spiders, etc.) inside all those cities; in fact, I leveled a DE necro up to about 4 or 5 just fighting stuff inside Neriak, and later leveled him inside akanon on the mechanic spawn.  Since Oggok and Grobb (well, Grobb used to; havent checked lately) also have similar newbie mobs, it stands to reason that they also have the same exp bonus.<br />
<br />
In truth, I really don't know for sure about the other cities, but I do know that Akanon, Neriak, HHK, and Paineel all have the 25% bonus, and also all have mobs that newbs can kill, so its seems likely that this applies to these other cities too.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm with ya there, although I think you get the newbie yard bonus both inside and just outside most cities; I know for sure on akanon, neriak, and paineel.  Not sure on the rest, but seems likely.<br />
<br />
<br />
really were looking for mobs 41 to 44 in lvl if this is a post hhk spot ...  right?<br />
<br />
Yep, was looking for a 55-60 spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, I checked out Ogguk, and it looks fairly good...for a high 40s character.<br />
<br />
The guards are nicely spaced out, no wandering trainers or anything, and the merchants are fairly easy to avoid even without Invis.  There is a long 'boulevard' where you can easily pick off the solo guard and pull to one of several obvious safe spots, and the drop at least a sword and shield.<br />
<br />
However, they are all very green to a 56 shaman.  I Bane'ed one of them, and it dropped before it ran out, so guards are probably about mid-30s at most.<br />
<br />
Probably would be a nice camp for a lower level shaman.<br />
<br />
Next up are Akanon and Neriak...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I know for a fact that the guards in North Qeynos are not a good choice. They are either green, or insanely uber. There are big areas and safe spots to kill them. I do smithing in there on occasion, and often have to kill 2 or 3 of them hanging around, so i can sit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Halfling guards in misty drop 10pp spears and are light blue and green at 43, there is 1 named budo that is 100% magic resistant though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Anyone have any information/strategy for the guards in Sactus Seru?  They con dark blue at lvl 58 but seem to have a ton of hp and frequest adds.  I think it is doable tho if you can kill them fast.  Any information would be helpful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I was about to mention Sanctus Seru.<br />
<br />
Mobs range from 35-65 in Sanctus Seru. XP bonus is only 13% but if you plan on doing Katta quest, Seru is a great place to get faction. Actualy its the only place to get certain factions.<br />
<br />
I've seen 15pp drop off lvl 35 mobs and over 30 pp of lvl 60 mobs. There are several safe spots to pull to both inside buildings and outside. Some of the trainers and guards in the central buildings see invis though so be on your toes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Apache Soulhealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I was trying to solo in the observation deck, any success there?

Watch out though because some rooms are not empty and sometimes the residents see invis. Outside most retraining walls have a safe spot to pull to.</div></div><hr />
