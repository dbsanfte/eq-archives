<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are you going to buy the new expansion?<br />
<br />
For the first time, I am probably NOT going to preorder the new expansion.  This is for two reasons - first, I didn't get any use out of GoD at all, except the leadership AA's, and that wasn't worth it.  Second, I am not that happy in EQ any more... it's still ok, but I'm looking, and some other game may come along and pull me away.  (So far CoH hasn't grabbed my wife, or I'd probably be gone over there at least for a while).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">being in a raidguild (and even with puny 175 aas) i won't have much of a choice here.<br />
and anyways, those few bucks aren't the problem, i mean, going out and drinking with friends costs more on one evening, hehe (i just dont want to grind 400 aas to be no lowlevel any more, hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Playing the waiting game...seemed to work in my favor with GoD  :D <br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yay! Finally there is a poll about the new expansion with a logical choice for me!!  Even if I was still playing EQ, I almost certainly wouldn't have bought this expansion.  I think the majority of people that end up buying it will buy it for level 70 and/or to keep up with their guild/friends.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Voted no because i play FFXI right now :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, some interesting results on this.  64% of people said they either don't have an EQ account, won't buy the expansion, or will wait and see but will probably not buy it.  That's a lot.  About half of the people WITH active accounts will probably not buy it.<br />
<br />
GoD burned a lot of people, and it's showing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Still enjoying EQ and the low end of GoD (completed trials 1-5 so far, but most of guild isnt interested yet).  As long as Im having fun, the new expansions will have something to offer, $30 is nothing even for my 2 accounts and the wifes one account.<br />
<br />
Level 70?  New spells and items and more places to go?  Im there.  Raising the level cap alone will make most people buy it that still play and I think a lot will come back because of that too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I won't pre-order.  I bought GoD, and haven't even zoned in, yet.  Given how there was nothing but crap for the Shaman, and I also play an SK, where GoD totally screwed knights, I won't order another one until I see it's worth it.<br />
<br />
I don't raid, not elemental flagged.  I love dungeons, though. <br />
<br />
Unless there's something worthwile, in addition to more levels, I'm not going to bother.  I am in the process of leveling my 3rd character to 65 (wiz), as part of a 3-box team, which is more than worthwhile for now.<br />
<br />
So, I'll wait and let those that have to have it decide if it's worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only going to get it if my guild requires it.<br />
<br />
But I will break down and whore myself to SOE for $120 for all 7 expansions and 12 month sub. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've happily gone to the store and plunked down my cash for every expansion on the day of release.  Not this time. I felt ripped off by GoD and the next one's not getting picked up unless there are some glowing reviews and zones I can actually venture into.<br />
<br />
It took me since Kunark to hit level 58. I'm in no hurry to have to ablility to level to 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, No!, and HELL NO!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If the Guild buys it, then i buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">being in a raidguild (and even with puny 175 aas) i won't have much of a choice here.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ditto. Won't preorder it though.</div></div><hr />
