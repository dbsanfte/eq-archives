<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eliaas_Demens</div><div class="date">10-22-2002, 09:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">During some exploration in the plane of Justice today, an Elvish speaking ranger tells a story of his crime.  Aparently he was told his wife was dead at the hands of a paladin, so he has a centaur make an uber arrow and kills the paladin just before he discovers his wife is alive and well.  The centaur that made the arrow is a few cells down.  When speaking to him, he mentions the materials used to make the arrow.<br />
<br />
   The arrow of course.  Mundane materials would not have been sufficient to hold the enchantments necessary to get this bow to perform as he requested.  I had Rhionn gather the materials needed,  the claw of a black drake, feathers from a Spiroc Lord, and a dracholich bone for the shaft I had no idea what he would [use it for].<br />
<br />
Might be worth persuing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wonder if this was why they nerfed fletching? Good luck all it persuing this, hope those with PoP access keep us informed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do:<br />
Parsing out all the time stamps<br />
Go back and get locs for more of the pc's<br />
<br />
<br />
Brief rundown of Plane of Justice:<br />
-Lot of mobs in cells<br />
-Some of them talk some of them glare<br />
-If you go one way you enter imprisoned mortal type beings, which are indifferent to apprehensive. If you go the other there are imprisoned diety type beings that are glares and quickly become KOS as you walk further back. The glares npc's will attack you once you hail them, so I stopped after one or two.<br />
<br />
Thanks also to Rezer of the Nameless who helped me with this.<br />

Tue Oct 22 05:09:48 2002] You say, 'Hail, Norlta Zamish'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:09:50 2002] Norlta Zamish says 'Hmm, is someone there? I've been [wrongfully imprisoned] I'm waiting for appeal, but its been a long time. Where, in the name of Brell, is my appeal?'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:09:52 2002] a festering rat begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:04 2002] You say, 'What wrongfully imprisoned'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:07 2002] Norlta Zamish says 'They have me here for a little [white lie], how can that be justice? What is this, the Plane of Injustice? The Plane of Unfarity?'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:15 2002] You say, 'What white lie'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:16 2002] a festering rat begins to cast a spell.<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:18 2002] Norlta Zamish blushes. 'Well maybe a little more than a little white lie, but I still don't deserve to be here with murderers and crazy people, and the like. You look like a fair person, why don't you tell me if you think I should be here, want to [know what happened]?'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:32 2002] You say, 'I want to know what happened'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:34 2002] Norlta Zamish says 'I was an apprentice for Varkon Theardor in Ak'Anon, and he sent me to scout the minotaur caves, to make sure the hero wasn't out and about. Well I made it out to Steamfont, and it was one of the most beautiful days I'd ever seen, halfway to the caves I set down to watch some clouds go by. Next thing I know it was hours later, I didn't rightly have time to make it to the caves and back, so I went to [Varkon] and told him the hero wasn't around.'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:54 2002] You say, 'Who is varkon'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:10:56 2002] Norlta Zamish says 'Well little did I know, Varkon was planning a trip to the caves, I guess I should have figured it, but I just wasn't thinking. Hours passed, until finally word came that the minotaur hero had squished poor Varkon. When news reached Larkon, Varkon's brother, that I was responsible for Varkon's death he asked that I be set before the Tribunal.'<br />

[Tue Oct 22 05:11:51 2002] Shaldyn Thunderhoof looks up at you with a curious gleam in his eyes. 'Ahh, a visitor. Is there something you need or are you here for a story?'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:03 2002] You say, 'I need a story'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:04 2002] Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'Well I'll tell you my story then. I was once a master fletcher, my arrows flew straighter and farther than any made before and any that have come since. I was a master of my craft; a bowman with a quiver of my arrows and one of my bows could drop a griffon at 20 paces with a single shot. One day a [ranger] came with a special order, one that I couldn't let pass.'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:08 2002] You say, 'what ranger'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:08 2002] Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'His name was Rhionn Leafsblade, I believe he resides here with me as well. He wanted a magical arrow, a single arrow able to pierce even the strongest mithril breastplate. I had done work with Rhionn before, and believed him an honorable man, and the [challenge] was not one that I could pass up.'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:11 2002] You say, 'what challenge'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:12 2002] Shaldyn Thunderhoof smiles. 'The arrow of course. Mundane materials would not have been sufficient to hold the enchantments necessary to get this bow to perform as he requested. I had Rhionn gather the materials I needed, the claw of a black drake, feathers from the Spiroc Lord, and a dracolich bone for the shaft. I had no idea what he would [use it for].<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:15 2002] You say, 'What use for it'<br />
[Tue Oct 22 05:12:15 2002] Shaldyn Thunderhoof says 'He used it for murder. Cold blooded murder. In my trade sect we were held responsible for the actions of our weapons. When the sect council found what my arrow was used for, they sent me before the Tribunal. I was found guilty for assisting in the murder of an innocent, and now I am here.'<br />
