<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was talking to my friend and he came up with a good idea.<br />
<br />
He agree that the new slow sucks. but one way to maybe make it a little better is everyone did a Feedback in game and said that the spell needs to last longer. say 5 mins? it might be some what useful?<br />
<br />
I dont know if anything will happen or not if we do it? but I think it might be worth a try.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The short duration is one problem with the spell, yes, but the real problem with it is that it slows for less % than the beastlord slow.  Maybe it will become obvious to me once I actually start playing GoD, but right now, I just can't understand why they wouldn't make it 75%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know that the time and percent are both a problem. But we are stuck with it now.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of it doing is in game Feedback and saying this spell needs to be fixed. <br />
<br />
If all shamans slam the Feedback they just might listen? if we dont doing anything then we know knowing will happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The idea of a consistent feedback is good.<br />
<br />
I am not particularly worried about the duration, though.  I woul rather feedback on the percentage of slow that is provided.  the resist is a possiblility, I suppose, but as long as the percentage slowed is 60% ... why not Malos and Turgur's instead? <br />
<br />
If the mob lives 90 seconds, I will be applying a 75% slow long before the Nihil from the other shaman (why would I have cast it?) wears off.  I will malos and slow 75% if I am the main slower.<br />
<br />
I think that I can &quot;heal&quot; a lot more damage by slowing another 15% than by casting 10 seconds faster overall.<br />
<br />
Maybe some parsing will show that I can mitigate more damage by pre-slowing with nihil, then malos, then turgurs.  I wouldn't bet on it, though.<br />
<br />
<br />
This does not appear to be an everday spell, part of my normal line-up.  It may become my second slow for LDoN, in which case the duration is not the problem.  It may become a pre-slow in raiding - in which case the duration is not the problem.<br />
<br />
Whatever use we find for Nihil, the duration has to be long enough to land Malos and Turgurs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am wondering - mobs that hit so hard you have to slow them faster than malos and then turgurs?  yet have so few hp's that they die within 90 secs or less to an exp group?</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why BL slow costs them 150 mana and us so much more? I mean please explain it to me, the logic.... they get the fast cast time (with hybred bonus), the 65% and 3.5 min duration. <br />

If we are the parent class wouldn't it cost less for us to cast or the same? Seems like we are paying for having canni and a bigger <br />

Because we are dealing with a legacy where we are perceived as being overpowered during the Luclin and early PoP period.  In effect this is punishment for being too good two years ago.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's a good spell.  Lower aggro than turgur's, better innate resist check than turgur's.  The real power of the spell is that it almost always slows the mob (literally 1 in 100 resists when I cast it in Beta).  The stuff you can't see from looking in Lucy.<br />
<br />
I've tried to explain how good this spell is, but it seems to be falling on deaf ears.<br />

We should all be feedbacking about that useless disease dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zigmund</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Chifari,<br />
<br />
Actually I agree 100% I like the spell, but like I said I dont like being penalized mana cost (BL slow is 150 mana) because of our canni ability.<br />
<br />
But here is my spell line up at 65<br />
<br />
Canni 4<br />
Slow 75%<br />
Malos<br />
Q<br />
Root<br />
Dot<br />
Malicous Decay - so VP doesnt get resisted<br />
<br />
that's 7 gems<br />
<br />
that leaves one spell gem for a dot or dd or the new slow or I suppose I toss malos when not raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone use VP3 that doesn't use Malicious Decay? I suppose I could give that one up. I just hate to get resisted on a VP cast because of the long refresh time.</div></div><hr />

By your own admission you've speculated an explaination for how the spell might work.  You've actually offered no evidence other than personal experience which by your own admission may be coincidence.  I'm also interested in seeing what mobs you actually slowed with it.<br />
<br />
I won't discount your experience, but I will say that on this board is a parse test (although partially inconclusive) that indicates there are no resist differences between BL slow and ours.  They simply can chain cast and get slow to stick faster and therefore it appears to resist less because it still lands before ours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems to me that personal experience is a lot better thing to base a judgement on than looking at the spell on paper and deciding it sucks without ever having tried it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Chifari <br />
yes it may land more often but what is the point it landing more often when it gets overridden by 1 beastlords, 2 chanters, 3 by our level 51 spell ... now if it had the same (or longer) duration of turgurs, minium recast time, and the same slow as ENC and BST it would be an upgrade but the way it stands this is a preslow (which bst do quite well) ... that wont be used execpt in LDoN and only if there is no bst in the group ... now if they upped the spell slots to 10 it would have a place on my spell bar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Related comment and question.  Common sense tells me that this spell may actually land more reliably than the -40 MR check would indicate due to the fact that it is a level 65 spell vs. 51.  I have been of the opinion for a while that the BST spell may actually land more reliably than ours due to this same reason.  <br />
<br />
I am wondering if anyone knows for a fact if spell level plays a part in whether a spell lands or not.  Again, common sense dictates that it does, however I know of a lot of low level spells, root/snare, etc., that seem to land at all levels.  Does anyone know for sure if spell level is a factor?<br />

It'd be particularly handy in groups where I'm the slower and primary healer...faster slowing equals more time to pick my nose...err I mean DoT, nuke, and toss that occasional Q.<br />
<br />
Beyond that it'd seem that most other places I fight I'd want maximum slowing and in many cases, the pain of casting malo(s) before the slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">It's an amazing spell.  Trust me.  I've cast it.<br />
<br />
It is sha's (or close) with 5% less slow and a neg 40 resist adjustment.<br />
<br />
In case that isn't clear, or hasn't sunk in yet, NIHIL BY ITSELF is more likely to slow the mob than a TURGUR'S CAST AFTER MALOS.  No joke.  Nihil at -40 is BETTER than Turgur's at -55, due to Nihil using the base resist of something close to Sha's, not the high base resist chance of Turgur's.<br />
<br />
It's a great spell, and when someone comes here and tells me they walked right up to Gaukr Sandstorm, cast nihil without debuff, and slowed him right off, I'll feel vindicated.<br />
<br />
Sha's does *NOT* have a neg resist adjustment.  Look it up in Lucy.  Nihil is not Turgur's with 15% less slow and a neg 40 resist adjusment; it is SHA'S with 5% less slow and a neg 40 resist adjustment. <br />
<br />
If people can't see how good that is, I'm done trying to explain.  <br />
<br />
I've already wished I had the spell like 10 times today; it would have made that big a difference.<br />
<br />
Chifari<br />
<br />
p.s. And no I am not certain of this... and can't back it up except intuitively... based on ~100 casts on mobs in Beta (that I am now struggling to slow with just Turgur's and still get decent resists after Malos on Turgur's) with only *1* resist the entire time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm slightly biased, as I've grouped once with Chifari (insane dps frog shaman), and he's always been very knowledgable when he posts.<br />
We generally don't move in the same circles...<br />
<br />
I'd love to see where it drops and decide for myself whether Chif is right or wrong after I've cast it 100 times.  If we haven't cast it, who are we to say that someone who HAS is wrong?<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I'd love to see where it drops and decide for myself whether Chif is right or wrong after I've cast it 100 times.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly.  This is the approach I wish more people would take.. keeping an open mind until they actually have the spell, cast it, and can evaluate it.<br />
<br />
I may be totally wrong about the spell, too.  My sample size is small.  Maybe the mobs had worse resists than I thought... or I got a lucky streak with no resists... or any number of reasons.  Maybe Nihil actually has a base resist chance somewhere in between the Bst and Shm slow, and the -40 doesn't do much.  Maybe I am overestimating it by saying it's a guaranteed slow.<br />
<br />
Instead of focusing on the 5% difference in the slow between Bst and Shm (which is irrelevant, unless you're grouping with one), I wish more people would look at the -40 and really think about how good a debuff that is.  Unlike the Bst slow, which says, &quot;a mob is inc, here is a fast cast, I have decent chance of slowing it&quot;, Nihil says &quot;2 mobs are inc, one is going to be slow RIGHT NOW guaranteed...&quot;  <br />
<br />
Instead of malos/slow, malos/slow, you just nihil one... it's slowed, guaranteed... now you have plenty of time to malos/slow the other mob... in a situation almost devoid of danger.  It addresses most of the primary problems of the shaman class, by making it so the shaman doesn't ever fall into the &quot;crap I can't slow the mob and now I have to chain tnargs&quot; cycle.  <br />
<br />
I also think it has lower aggro than Turgur's by a significant margin, but this is hard to tell with Time-geared tanks' great aggro.<br />
<br />
Chif</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Actually we had an incident today while raiding (we usually raid on expansion days). On one of the targets a miscommunication on the pull resulted in the mob coming in from an unexpected angle, with a subsequent rapid loss of most of the clerics and debuffers. We managed to recover well but eventually lost the fight because the lone remaining slower (a shaman) was unable to get the mob slowed, until the very end, when it was too late.<br />
<br />
The point is that this is the sort of situation were Nihil is going to be very important. When you need to slow something and need to slow it fast, this will be the spell to use. If it is subsequently overwritten by a higher level spell, who cares, it would have served it's intended purpose ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The problem isnt that the spell isnt fairly decent, its that its COMPLETELY situational. I have so many spells in my book like this, already, whats one more. Mal Decay, RGC, Cloud of Grumm, etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
I suppose the spell would be OK vs mobs that mitigate slow. I suppose it might be useful on fast-killed mobs that I sometimes don't even bother slowing. But honestly, I cannot think of many situations where I wouldnt want to cast Malos ANYWAY just for the nukers benefit. <br />
<br />
I guess the big test will be - Can it replace Malos in my spell lineup for LDoN or EP aaxp sessions? If not, then I just don't see myself getting excited. <br />
<br />
Sigh, I hope the zones and encounters in Gates are fun, I am thoroughly disapointed by the spells and AAs that they gave us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Thornebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">My biggest complaint would be the duration of the spell. The way I normally play right now. Is when more then one mob comes in  I slow all of them at the start. <br />

Now with a 1.5 duration I can no longer do this. and I have to change the way I play now. <br />

2ed grip is the %.<br />

3rd is Mana Cost compaired to the % of this to the Bst Mana Cost for %.<br />
<br />
I go with the Duration the most because if a Mob is slowed its slowed. but if we have to sit there with a timer in our hand its worthless.<br />
<br />
I play a lot of LDoN without any crowd control and its up to me to park-root them. Our War brings in about 3 at a time. I like this for the Quick slowing of the mobs. but I will be casting it at least twice on the Adds. And to me that do not work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly.  Honestly, I rarely have trouble slowing mobs with our current level 51 spell.  If I need a pre slow, I throw the disease one on.  Usually, if I can't get it slowed with the 51 slow, it CAN'T be slowed.  <br />
<br />
The time is a real pain in the ass too.  If this is the only slow that can be landed on a mob - which I doubt, then you will have to cast it multiple times.  On normal mobs, you don't NEED this spell because the 51 one sticks.  On raid mobs, the time on this one will require multiple slows...  All in all, good idead with the -resist checks.  Bad implementation with the mana, cast time and % slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It’s pretty simple to me.  I look at 2 lvl 65 spells and see:<br />

a 3.3 minute 65% slow for 150 mana vs. a 1.5 minute 60% slow for 225 mana.<br />
<br />
Both are very close in cast/recast time.  Neg 40 resist is huge, sure. But is it enough?  I dunno.</div></div><hr />

With mobs like these you wan't them slowed as quickly possible. Ok mob is slow 65% - you breathe a sigh of releif while casting your long lasting 75% or otherwise. MT Lives, you live - phat loots for all!<br />

<br />
<br />
Slowing too early can = dead shaman.  Most hitting 1k+ and fast, even 60% slowed can = dead shaman if you get agro.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I'm more than happy to malos on incoming and then slow after that. Helps me keep track of my agro and not slow too soon.  <br />
<br />
Maybe my understanding of resists are off, but a spell that uses base resists -40 is the same as a -40 debuff to the mob and then a spell based on (0) resists right?  So a -55 to resists and a base spell would be better on resists than a -40 spell?  Am I missing something.  I could be, just wondering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have not gotten this spell yet, I have not gotten my TA yet, but When a fast slow is needed I will be attempting this slow first.  When I know a mob resists Turgur's even with Sinia and Tash on but IS slowable, I will use this slow.  If mobs will not live longer than 1.5 minutes, I will use this slow first on the mob MA is on then Turgur's the rest.  This spell may be situational, but there are a LOT of situations.<br />
<br />
Think outside the bun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Go try the Tipt and Vxed trials and you'll be loving this spell.  If you don't have an enchanter in the group for Tash (which I didn't for the last 5 Vxed/Tipt trials I did with guildmates) even with Malos AND Malosini (I have Malosini Pendant) I would get resists on Turgur's.   That is a lot of time for a mob that hits for 1100 to be going unslowed.   Every mob died in under 1.5 mins anyway, so the duration arguement is pretty pointless in this situation.  If its a boss mob or adds that are parked/mezzed, you can always hit them with Turgur's after if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Chifari, I don't care personally how &quot;fast&quot; it can be cast or whatever. The fact is, we get lvl 65 spell, which is being overwritten by HYBRID spell, which still sucks when compared to hybrid spell, spell which even doesn't have higher slowing percentage then hybrid spell has. And costs more mana, and lasts less. This spell is no upgrade of any kind, this is a downgrade. I would be OK with the shorter duration time, if the slowed percentage would be also 75% at least, and mana cost would also be lower then that. Our mana regen ability is no excuse to make this spell cost more mana, anyone nowadays can regen mana fast. So these only bonuses what the spell has - little negative magic resist check and fast casting time - do not make the spell good in my eyes, considering how everything else related to this spell plainly sucks, and that in the end, it's still inferior when compared to slows of others. Quite some &quot;upgrade&quot; indeed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">So what about the raids past Vxed and Tipt, where they use a shaman for the yard trash, then drop you and add druid/ cleric for the heals?  Cause the bosses are unslowable, and put out MAJOR dps.  Still excited?<br />
<br />
Or the more likely senario of taking a bard/ beast/ enchanter instead? (Bard is 55 percent slow, plus mezzing and other goodies... beast for the dps and 65 slow... enchanter for the mezzing , occasional charm pet, and 70 percent slow).<br />

I still feel like I was kicked in the groin with this expansion, and the throbbing only gets worse the further I progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting reasons:<br />
<br />
&quot;Bard is 55 percent slow, plus mezzing and other goodies.&quot;   Didn't you just say mobs were unslowable?   Oh, they are also unmezzable currently in zones past Kod`Taz.<br />
<br />
&quot;beast for the dps and 65 slow.&quot;   Again, didn't you just say they were unslowable?   Dps?  Better off with a second warrior.<br />
<br />
&quot;enchanter for the mezzing , occasional charm pet, and 70 percent slow&quot;.  Again, unslowable.   Charm... oops can't charm in Yxxta and beyond right now either.  Mez... oops can't mez in Yxxta and beyond either.<br />
<br />
So why would they take a bard/beast/enchanter again?</div></div><hr />

In Vxed for example I've had few resists after Malos, and only twice have I had mob resist turgur's two times in a row.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Is the fundamental issue here that beastlords overwrite or that you all spend too much time worrying about beastlords?<br />
<br />
Does every xp group you enter have a beastlord overwriting this slow that most of us probably don't have yet?<br />
<br />
Raiding... well, I am not staring up Quarms nostrils yet but I am raiding elemental mobs and my opinion is that the quicker mobs are slowed the better. I don't care if I slow with this new slow, then the beast overwrites it, followed by the chanter, followed by me with Turgurs. I just want the mob slowed, and the raid to succeed.<br />
<br />
Yeah, yeah, I'm a noob and until I have solo'd the rathe I'm a know nothing fool putting roadblocks in the way of Shaman progression, but I just don't want to complain and /feedback every day based on theoretical arguments. I'll wait until I get the spell and take a look see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">In LDoN I usually stick slow first try with no debuff. Since this spell is far les resistable I see it replacing Turgur's in my spellbook soon. Of course this will be trivial when I have Time's Antithesis but that's beside the point!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Granted, I'm not 65 yet, so things might change for me, but for now this slow looks good.  YES, it is only a situational spell, but it's a spell that addresses those situations that shaman have been complaining about (tnarg cycle when turgurs bounces, Time delay on slowing boss mobs, and no being as effective a slowing as a chanter, because they can tash+slow before we can Malos+slow -- an issue that we blatantly ignored the % slowed and instead said they were better because of the Time spent slowing)<br />
<br />
So I run most LDoN's with no other caster classes.  Unless I'm lucky enough to get a bard I'm running Heals and CC.  I don't have VP yet, but even if i did, I would do this when I got 3 or more mobs:  I keep torgors and turgurs memed, and chain between the two so I don't have to worry bout the recast time should I get a resist.  I slow an add, pull it back, root, then go back and slow another, etc.<br />
<br />
So here's my problem...  I don't know which one to slow first.  If I slow the add, I'm pulling one whole mob off the MT, but leaving an unslowed mob on him till I can root, return, and recast slow.  If I slow the MT's mob, then he's getting hit my a slowed mob and an unslowed mob till I can slow again.  Neither will drop him usually, but since I have to heal him, both are gonna hurt my mana pool.  Now if a Slow bounces (especially the first one) I am in a world of hurt.<br />
<br />
With this lower-agro higher resist slow, I can /assist, cast it on inc and have it land as the mob hits camp.  Then I switch targets and slow with turgurs.  Since the new slow is lower agro the MT will have taken agro back by the time I pull agro on the add with turgurs landing, and I can just run and park it.<br />
<br />
If turgurs bounces, I don't really care, because Nihil is back up, and I'm only taking unslowed damage for 1.5 seconds...  Plus I know my MT is taking a very manageable amount of damamge, so I will have some time before i have to heal them, and can heal me when I get the bugger parked.<br />
<br />
For 3 mobs it's all the better, as I need to pull agro FAST off the adds, so I'll have to be chaining slows, one slow on the first ad, on slow on the second.  Nihil might only be a little faster than Turgurs but it's a LOT faster than torgors, giving me alot faster agro-pulling tool, along with the added bonus that the mob's slowed to help me channel in a root.  When they are both slowed, I have time to nihil the Mt's mob, heal him, and re-slow the add with nihil before I even have to think about re-applying root.<br />
<br />
I LDoN ALOT, and this would honestly change the game for me... for the better.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm not uber, or 65, so my opinion probably means dirt to most of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Might actually have more of a factual opinion if I could ever get the spell ;)<br />
48+ hours personally clocked in different zones in GoD so far and I have only seen 1 spell drop during a raid. Was a BL spell.<br />
<br />
Only heard of 3 spells drops total (2 BL 1 Enc) from my guild.<br />
One of which rotted because it dropped after a trial win.<br />
There was no Enchanter present and you cant change people out after a win.<br />
<br />
Lots of clocked hours both exping and raiding and not many spells in tier 1 of GoD so far :(<br />
<br />
Considering they are no drop they could make them drop a bit more in tier1....<br />
<br />
No idea what the drops are like beyond tier1 yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">So what about the raids past Vxed and Tipt, where they use a shaman for the yard trash, then drop you and add druid/ cleric for the heals?

<br />
To quote myself (above quote)...<br />
<br />
Did you just ignore that part?  The yard trash is slowable, the boss is not.  Hence using a shaman for slows till boss, then replacing.  Hence, better off taking a beast/bard/ chanter (for the SLOWS, on the yard trash), and the mezzing (yes, mezzing for the adds the boss spawn), or the dps.<br />
<br />
Reading comprehension is your friend.  Or else dont ignore the beginning of the post.<br />
<br />
