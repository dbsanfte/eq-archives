Get yourself some Cha stiens, they cost like 50p each at most. Then look for any Kunark armor (Donal's, Singing Steel, Jaundiced Bone, Deepwater, etc) UNDER 300p, the lower the better (Duh, lol). Then goto a vendor, and sell.<br />
<br />
With 173 cha I would get 307p and some change for something I bought for under 300p. Aint much profit, but sometimes you can make like 50p or so.<br />
<br />
I figure I share one of my secrets cuz, well, its hard to find Kunark armor under 300, Good Luck.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roophus Gunthar</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here's my guide:<br />
<br />
Look for someone who's constantly in bazaar (the millionaires that wont share their secrets...they are very obvious because you can see them in the same spots over and over), look as what they are selling, buy what they are selling when you see it cheap (from other people), then resell it for the same price as the millionaire.  This is probably the quickest way to start making money in bazaar.  <br />
<br />
If you see someone sitting in bazaar 24/7, chances are they are doing it for a reason and for a very good reason.  If they are there 24/7 they are probably making killer money.  Just look at their items for sale and start buying/selling those items a few gold cheaper than them.  It'll make em very mad too!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erlanthir</div><div class="date">01-21-2003, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alot of millionares farm items via multi-boxing then sell em cheap and fast (I.e. have 4 accnts, 1 in baz always and other 3 farm stuff they can like Ikky BPs, Illusion Masks, PoP spells and Seb stuff)<br />
<br />
I think Seb. is the best place for this as ODS, Book of Obulus, Lammys and lots of other nice stuff drops there and it an be easily done with small groups.<br />
<br />
Also I know some ppl on Torvo who have farmed Jade Reavers and sell em, they do sell....<br />
<br />
Basically buy/sell items is the baz only way but the rich people farm nice gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vindikael</div><div class="date">01-23-2003, 10:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I once wrote a guide on buying and selling the bazaar for my guild that was over 10 pages long (Word doc, 12pt single space) .. but really in a nutshell I could sum up the whole thing. <br />
<br />
You have to be at the right place at the right time.<br />
<br />
For proof I have been moderatly successful take a look at my magelo profile. My main is a level 51 Druid (whom is equally twinked) and the most expensive badass peice ive ever looted was a Griffon Fang earring.... sold for 600pp. By that account I should be poor right? ... right</div></div><hr />
