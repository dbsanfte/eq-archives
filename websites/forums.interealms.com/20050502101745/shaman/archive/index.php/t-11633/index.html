<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>artmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">(for all im wondering around 50 to 60 this is what takes the most time)<br />
<br />
Shaman, Wizard: hmm, this is what i was thinking but i really really do not know if a shaman and wizard could team and get exp in the 49 to 60 range....in this i would most likely play the shaman pull with slow, tank while the wizard burn thee things to crisp <br />
<br />
Shaman, Magician: interesting but healing power to heal pet might be a bit too much so i should play magician and chain pet while the shaman only root and cast dot or dd? or what...this seems interesting but will the put stocism in game someday?<br />
<br />
Shaman, Cleric: Well this im afraid would miss some damage if slow stack dot on mob and heal the shaman with the cleric. maybe go hard on DD and canibalize after fight. this one would be interesting not sure if it is even possible....to kill something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hadd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">get the shm mage combo , mages can add healing on their pet , and yes stoicism is in game .<br />
but truely its all about what you want to play :)<br />
<br />
Hadd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urnti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SK + Shammy &gt; all IMO...that being said out of your three Mage + Shammy is your best bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sk and Shaman combo rocks imho. This comes from someone that duo's a 63sk and 62shm though, so I'm a little biased :D .<br />
<br />
We can duo mobs all the way up to and including BoT. Only zone I haven't tried yet is plane of tactics. I know there are mobs there I could duo in the arena (if I managed to avoid adds in a corner) - not sure about zone in mobs though (I've only been once so far).<br />
<br />
I originally started PL'ing my SK with my Shm when the shammy was lvl 57. Now 2 1/2 aa's from Canni V it's funny to see my SK breeze on past my shaman in exp. Playing an SK over any other melee char opens up alot of areas for hunting do to their utility spells (fd etc.). Over all it's a great combo, and lots of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Runja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally, I duo-box a wizard.  (65 shm and 52 wiz)  He isn't the best companion for hunting, but the wiz is certainly not bad and fits my play style perfectly.  The mana regen is sometimes a problem, but that has been minimized with a horse for him and KEI whenever I can get it.  The main reason I like the wiz are for the ports (mainly evac) and translocate.  He acts as my emergency backup when I solo.  Things get too hairy... evac.  If you get creative, translocate boxes can be used in interesting ways to provide for some, um, fun experiments.  :)<br />
<br />
For DPS and high xp gain, the wiz isn't the top choice, but he isn't bad by any means.  For utility, he's top notch and a lot of fun to have.</div></div><hr />
