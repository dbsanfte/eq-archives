<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok - either Dev's don't know what mobs had slow migation on them ... or they didn't get the message off the mob.  <br />
<br />
Boss in PoN which stands next to Hobgoblin Anguish Lord is called A Fearsome Bat.    I've done him 3 times now and gotten the &quot;your target is mostly slowed&quot; every time.   <br />
<br />
Didn't we get nicely written update from Scott Hartsman saying that the dozen or so mobs that had this slow message was removed from game?   But why am I surprised.   Like my GL tells me sometimes ... don't care what the problem is ... just fix it.  Why is this still in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Mostly slowed is a good thing.  They fixed mobs  that had the message of &quot; your spell didn't have the intended effect&quot; or something like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh - nevermind then - but it's still BS that it's mostly slowed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So you'd rather it be slow immune?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kargen Krimsonwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">He said mobs that were taking slow as haste were fixed, read the message carefully next time.</div></div><hr />
