<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OH GOD!<br />
<br />
WHERE WILL MY CHILDREN LIVE!?!?<br />
<br />
*Sigh*....<br />
<br />
It all started when I wanted something better than the default UI...<br />
<br />
Then something went horribly wrong..<br />
<br />
within minutes of logging in, I get this new error that shuts down EQ automatically, something about an illegal action.<br />
<br />
These UIs kick ass... but if I can't use em... =p<br />
<br />
Anyone have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
I put all the default files into a new folder, then added things to spice it up... am I doing something wrong?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good rule of thumb...<br />
Log in, tab over.  Add one new UI file.  Tab back, loadskin.  All good?  Tab over, add another UI file, tab back - loadskin.  rinse.  repeat.</div></div><hr />

With my UI, you don't need any files other than what is in the main zip file and the update. Of course in its own folder.<br />
<br />
As far as the error you are getting, that's a vague description. Look at UIErrors.txt in the Everquest directory and see if there is a line that says Error anywhere, don't worry about the warnings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You shouldn't need to put files from the default ui into your ui directory unless you are changing them.<br />
<br />
You will see errors in uierrors.txt saying that its using default ones for any you don't have in the directory though, but that's okay.<br />
<br />
Look for the other errors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Okotona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Its a windows error that kills EQ automatically.. I usually just place those error windows off the screen and continue doing whatever =p.<br />
<br />
Eqgame has done an illegal action and must be closed... yadda yadda yadda.<br />

Thanks for the advice! Sounds like good stuff.<br />
<br />
Gotta love those Warcraft spell gems... yum yum yum...</div></div><hr />
