<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have started to take notice of a trend that seems to be affecting the late night gamers on the Drinal server.. It may even be EQ wide, but for now I can only comment on mine.  I have a 63 Shaman, working on I think his 30+ AA, anyways, I have never refused a to buff someone, not once!  I may be in a hurry and tell the prospective buff'ee to make it quick Im on the move, but I allways buff them, exspecially the lower level folks who are scratching and clawing theyre way to the top..<br />
     Lately Ive been playing two new toons, one has allready hit 41, my necro and my other a lvl 19 Monk is on his way.  For the past three weeks, its been like pulling teeth to get buffs, and nothing spectacular just run of the mill buffage, exspecially from my fellow shaman.. At time I will give them say 50 plat and say hit me with your best.. Now usually Its a lvl 65 or higher I ask, in the hopes he has done his homework and has extended buffs.. 9 times out of ten I have gotten HoS/STA/HASTE!  IM thinking if thats your best you suck as a shaman!  I even drop hints like..Oh, my main is a shaman in the hopes I may get better exspecially when I ask for the works.<br />
     I think that there are a few things you should do as the buffer when someone comes to YOU for buffs.<br />
1. If your not going to buff them, atleast answer them. The whole ignore game is rude, incredibly rude.  I sent severl tells to other shaman asking for buffs and got no response..So, I logged my 63 shaman and sent them a tell and whaddya know...They answered...That boils my blood quick.<br />
2. When they donate to you, and donate well and ask for the works, GIVE THEM YOUR BEST! <br />
<br />
3. Keep in mind they are new for the most part and trying to level just as hard as you did.  When you ignore them or give them mediocure buffs, your making us all look horrible.  When I see a bunch of folks running around pok asking politely for buffs wheather they are donating or not I log my Shaman and do my best to help them.  Those who dont just make us look bad in the long run.  <br />
<br />
     Well, thats my two coppers worth, if anyone else has noticed this trend, feel free to comment.. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

If someone is offering to sell buffs thats a different story, but if someone just sends me a tell for buffage generally they are going to be ignored unless I'm in a good mood and they are in /rt range. The second part is really important because I can't count how many  times someone has asked me for a buff and I mem it only to be standing in the same spot 5 min later with them never showing up. <br />

As far as just gett hos/sta/haste the only buff you're missing that matters one bit is bhali' what else do you want?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have all my buffs extended by AA, plus by device.. It depends on the class that asks for the buffs..<br />
<br />
1) Melee type- I give the IOS+ALTUNA+STR+DEX+AGL+STA+Primal Essance+Bin'La+Regen+Haste.  Is that too much to ask..I think not!<br />
<br />
2) Caster type- HoS+STA+AGL+Bin'Li+regen+haste.<br />
<br />
     If they want any special resist buffs I gladly throw them in and then wish them well.  I would not ignore them, but then again Im not a rude person to say the least.  Also, Ive never been afraid to ask to donate for buffs to anyone reguardless of level, its only a game and theres no harm in asking.  I havent forgotten what it was like when I was a low level toon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">heck, the people that are most upset i ignore them; are the beggars i have already put on /ignore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For a second I was confused by why you would cast Altuna, Dex, and Str rather than HoS on the melee types, but then I saw that Infusion doesn't stack with HoS and it does stack with Tuna.  I guess you learn something new every day.  (I don't have infusion, but I may have to try and get it from the BL turnin guy a few more times after learning this.;))  I am guessing this also means that Kragg's will stack with IoS, and this makes me feel like I have been slacking :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wonderin what do you expect? Your highest alt is 41 you said? If I remember correctly, Focus of Soul will not take at that level yet which means Focus of Spirit. How many shaman even bother with getting focus of spirit anymore, with focus of soul only two levels away. It seems focus of spirit has become obsolete. Also when you ask for buffs most would memorize level 62 focus and get the &quot;this char is to low&quot; message, so I would think the next thing that comes to mind is H<br />
oS. If you dont like what someone buffs you with tell them what you want. If you arent going to be specific then dont complain about it. Just because someone chooses to play a buffing class doesnt mean he has to buff everyone and thier alts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That IS too much to ask.  Way too much.<br />
<br />
how much do you pay/donate for all those buffs?<br />
<br />
Its not worth 1000 plat for me to sit there and cast that many buffs on a stranger.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">When I was levelling up, there was no one higher to buff me. True story.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Brothur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was under the impression that IoS and Taslisman were level restricted buffs.  Before I got to level 60 and FoS, that is what I would buff people with all the time, if I had the time... btw, you missed the AC buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have to agree with EQOracle here. I have a spell set for PoK that includes Focus/Boar/Diaku/SoW for whoever is high-enough and HoS/Stamina/Strength/SoW for the rest. I always refuse donations, so whatever I cast on you is more than you had, and it didn't cost you anything.<br />
<br />
Buffing strangers in PoK takes away from my limited playtime, and it certainly hasn't improved my character in any way. I usually run in roleplaying mode for the exact reason that Ghost states:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Now usually Its a lvl 65 or higher I ask, in the hopes he has done his homework and has extended buffs..</div></div><hr />

Here is some homework for you, stop bothering random people you don't know for buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. My highest alt inst 41, its just one of the newer ones Im playing now, and I never complained about FoS in the least... Also, I never stated it was the responisbility of Every shaman to buff every alt, I said atleast have the comon courtesy to tell them no, and not just sit there and ignore them, how hard is that?..<br />
     For Gloriana, if you hate buffing people you know, why did you make a shaman?  For the pets??<br />
     For the record, when I ask for buffs, I usually state my lvl (to avoid the this spell is to powerfull message) and what Im looking for..<br />
     I find it hard to believe that some of you find it that much of an inconvience to tell someone no, or to even be bothered by a stranger asking the &quot;king of Buffs&quot; if they have time to cast a few buffs for donation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Sorry, the sheer volume of requests has worn me to my wits end.   Unless I'm offering in public to buff, if you send me a tell out of the blue, you are at best ignored.  <br />
<br />
If I forget to turn anon on when I'm in pok, jeebus, I get so many damn tells its frustrating.  Here I am, trying to carry on a conversation with friends, and I have 5-10 LAZY players that want a couple hundred more hp so they can level easier.  <br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, its the random tells for buffs that are the rude ones.  <br />
<br />
Every night, when I'm done raiding, I go to pok and mgb focus.  Every time I'm in a zone and I see a group struggling, I fo7, regen, haste them, and go on my way.  I help people when I see them.  <br />
<br />
But come on: how many of you live in big cities? Do you give 5 dollars to every homeless person you see on the streets, every day, every night, without fail?  Those 5-10 folks begging for 200-540hp buffs are exactly the same in my eyes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Haha, I thought you were being sarcastic, then I realized you were seriously angry at people for not buffing you.  My guess is the reason people aren't telling you that they won't buff you is because they automatically added you to /ignore (this was my response to beggers).<br />
<br />
I'm also sort of curious what you define &quot;donate well&quot; as (as an aside to this, I never accepted money to buff people because if I was buffing you it was because I either a) knew you or b) had the buff you wanted already memmed).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Its not that Im angry at not being able to get buffs for just myself.  It just pains me a bit to see eight or nine shaman in pok and a bunch of folks asking for buffs out loud.  I dont fault those who dont buff, for whatever reasons it may be, to me its just a bit disapointing.  All in all Id rather just be flatly told no, I dont buff then to be auto ignored.  I dont spam or beg outloud, I try to be descriet and I only ask once, I wont lower myself to hounding people over and over again.  Also I dont think I could compare people asking for a buff in a game to people begging for money on the streets.<br />
<br />
I guess what it boils down to Is I havent become as jaded as some of you, that and I dont conscider a person asking to donate for a buff to be begging.  Its just a person asking another person for help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">i don't buff strangers normally.  If you send a tell to me out of the blue and you don't say you are some that i should at least maybe know, unless i'm grinding TS's you won't get buffed.  I'm not in pok to be a buff but, i'm not in pok long, i don't have time to stop and buff everyone.  If you are a friend or a guildies alt, heck, i'll even wait for FA to pop if you want it.<br />
<br />
That being said, i made a sham to buff MY GROUP, to slow mobs, and to make a good impact on the group, not to sit in pok and be a buff bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">On a side note, the person who neg bumped me with this message... &quot;I HATE PEOPLE WHO THINK THEY ARE SO DAMN SPECIAL I NEED TO SPEND ANY EFFORT AT ALL ON THEM&quot; Two words for you.. Thats sad.  Im glad my guild is, for the most part ,a small guild of helpfully and friendly people.  Besides, obviously you must be so very important that you are far to important to help anyone else.  Remember your words the next time you need a corpse summoned or a rez..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think for me, one of the major reasons I do buff is that you never know when someone else is going to remember your act of random kindness.  I play for fun, and dont mind helping others have some fun... Im not saying that all shaman should be buff bots, or hell, you dont have to buff anyone if thats your stance on buffing.  This was just something that I found to be irritating and thought Id voice my opinion on it.  But rest assured, if your on Drinal, playing an alt, and ask me for a buff, you wont be turned at away.</div></div><hr />

     I find it hard to believe that some of you find it that much of an inconvience to tell someone no, or to even be bothered by a stranger asking the &quot;king of Buffs&quot; if they have time to cast a few buffs for donation.<br />
<br />
Why do I ignore buff requests? And not even bother with a &quot;no&quot; response?<br />
<br />
Why it was all the A Holes that when I did say &quot;no&quot; would then try to rip on me for not running to them and taking my time and mana to buff them. One too many &quot;Well why did you make a buffing class then you retard&quot; comments to EVER be nice about it again.<br />
<br />
I MGB 7 in pok all the time, or MGB SD when on my bst. If you want more find someone OFFERING to buff for platinum. There have been days where I spent hours buffing, even setup hot keys with my /ooc messages offering them. Used to do that every milestone I got, each lvl or new piece of gear. My way to celebrate. Heck just the other day I spent an hour in POK casting temp to celebrate finishing the 7th shawl on my clr. When I'm NOT offering, bugger off!<br />
<br />
I choose a shm when I got some cool buffs from a kind stranger in EF, I wanted to be able to cast them, so I made a toon to be able to do that. Like others have said, I wouldnt have DREAMED of asking someone 10-30 lvls higher than me for ANYTHING much less buffs. I earned everything I have, either farmed it myself, or farmed the cash to buy it. I 2 box since I dont like to depend on anyone for anything.<br />
<br />
The whole mindset of &quot;I cant do anything without: temp/hos/sow/regen/DS/C/SL/etc and so on&quot; drives me nuts.<br />
<br />
Most low lvl toons I run across these days have better gear on their alts than on my main (shrug) why would I want to help them? On those RARE occasions I do find a REAL newbie, I help, sometimes hang with them to show them things about EQ. I cant remember the last time I found a real newbie.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the ramble, just some stuff that drives me nuts.<br />

I do admit to being one of those people who if no friends are near I'll send the random tell &quot;may I don for an HoS, Sta, SoW and regen please?&quot;...if I get ignored I move on, if I get a no I say 'thank you anyway, have a nice day' and move on...I harbor no anger.  I don't like being bothered when im on the move for random buffs from people (hence the always /role)...but when asked I do usualy buff them.  I too am a ninja Fo7, Sta, Regen and Haste person if I run by a group who looks like they could use it.  <br />
<br />
Ignoring people is rude if they are polite in how they ask, that I agree with...but being upset when people don't buff you just seems kind of petty.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah is what i say to that. I dont expect anyone to answer an unexpected tell from me ever. <br />
<br />
I'm always temtped to just ignore someone asking for buffs if i cant see them. I hate people who think just because you see i am in the zone with you its okie to send me a tell asking for buffs even if you offer to donate. I give a darn about your money doesnt make it okie. <br />
<br />
If i can see you.....as in you can see i'm not busy and not just runnign through the zone than i'm one to usually buff but i still dont see how i am obligated to answer a tell with a no. Do you know how many people cant take a no?? Maybe you havent been berated by an ungrateful &quot;newb&quot; yet. I have so remember that next time someone doesnt answer you they might have a reason. Heck ive even been hassled by someone when i was afk with my sign up. Come back to some yahoo telling &quot;I know you're there&quot;. I new buffz plz lololol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Rules of thumb<br />
<br />
If I'm not busy, and you're close enough to ask in /say, politely, you'll probably get haste, regen, sta, bih li, focus. If it's good enough to raid, it's good enough to level. Exceptionally if I'm also bored I'll keep buffing till your head pops off. <br />
<br />
If you're not close enough to ask in /say then you're not getting buffed.<br />
<br />
If you're in Frontier mountains and I'm in Pot when you send me a tell asking me to drop by and buff you, I might decide to find you and kill you but don't count on getting buffs. (yeah, this really happened)<br />
<br />
If I'm on the move, I won't be buffing anyone... Nothing says bite me like getting 5 tells for buffs just running through a low level zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>KurthMcdonough</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">dude, drinal has like 20 high lvl shaman .... spread over 12+ guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
*** do you expect, im on drinal, its a god damn graveyard, most of the high lvl shaman good left when GoD came out.<br />
the guys who stayed were the people botting a shaman.<br />
do you think they can see your tells when putting thier bot on /follow and just running through going to some other zone?<br />
<br />
if you want buffs, bug someone in your guild, don't point fingers and say &quot;im lvl 63 woopty dee, and expect people to side with you on gicing buffs.<br />
<br />
i get over 50+ tells when i hit PoK, Nexus, and PoTranq, those zones alone hit me with just 50.<br />
its gross, i want to be left alone sometimes, or go camp something witout getting 40 newbs saying &quot;gimme that spell with the letter &quot;o&quot; in it !&quot;<br />
<br />
drinal is empty and the people left just want to be left alone, seriously go pick on a damn beastlord if you want shaman buffs.</div></div><hr />

I dont care how much people have played or who the hell their main is. a HP buff should be enough well maybe haste if needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Bleh. I levelled up without a single higher level buff on me, only buffs I got were my own and those from the people in my groups. Nowaday newbies have it all given to them out on a silver plate - buffs, items, whatever. Most common /ooc in PoK or anywhere is &quot;I was away for 1/2/3/X years and came back, where's a good spot to get some gear for [insert class here]. Note that I am naked and have no money!&quot; or &quot;Hi, I am new to this game, my husband made me this char and told me to ask for cash and gear here, so do you have anything to give away?&quot;. Bloody hell!<br />
<br />
Not to mention that I have other things to do then run around or sit around and buff people I don't know and never will know. If I have time and someone normally and politely asks for a buff(s), I'll give the buff. I don't give it for free, though I never set a price either. If people think that as a chanter or cleric it is OK to ask/pay for their buffs, what on earth would give them the notion that it's not OK to pay to shaman for his/her buffs? What, our mana or time costs less or is free, opposite to chanters and clerics? I do expect, though, that the person who is asking for the buffs knows what he/she wants. And also that if they do donate, they don't make a joke out of it. Giving 5pp and asking a whole range of buffs to buff them from toes till head will result in cancelled trade and no buffs.<br />
<br />
Of course, I do have my 'benevolent' moments, when running through some zones and seeing newbies fighting a losing battle with some mob(s). I usually heal them up, buff them up, ask/take nothing for it and move on. But begging for items/buffs from me results in that name landing on /ignore  very fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you recall im one of you fellow drinal Shaman . Infact after chatting with you on the SoE boards and Here on the crucible you and I even had the occasion too Group together once .<br />
I very rarely buff strangers , when I do they .. if they are less than 46 get HoS , sta , Bhi'li and maybe haste and thats it .. too much trouble too buff more than that unless im just bored and doing nothing . However if I know the person Ill buff them with whatever they request .<br />
<br />
Heres a tip , If you ever ask me for buffs ... Make sure you add &quot;This is Gustov's alt BTW&quot; in the tell ... by so doing Ill most likely give you Agi as well .... As far as those old Talisman spells go .. I cant help you there .. They dont exist im my spellbook ... I simply have no need for them so they were deleted ... HoS still exists for the soul purpous of buffing lower level buddies .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Ryam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">If you are not happy with HoS + Sta + Haste and want the whole list you specified, then just &quot;/tell shaman_001 IOS+ALTUNA+STR+DEX+AGL+STA+Primal Essance+Bin'La+Regen+Haste please, will donate.&quot; instead of just asking for buffs so they know what you expect. Don't make a hotkey, or scroll back to earlier tells if you get refused, just write the whole list manually every time. If it is annoying to write, it is even more annoying to mem and cast (10 buffs, will not even fit a single spell set if the shammy has one for low level buffs).<br />
<br />
My guess is that you will rarely see even a HoS after that. I usually buff people who ask for free, but there is such a thing as too much...</div></div><hr />

if i get a nice tell and they come to me, i have np, buffing them a bit, though your list is really too long imo (as ryam said, always type it, that might help :))<br />
and on top of that, i once destroyed most for me useless lowlevel buffs, think the only buffs i have for chars &lt; 46 is hos, altuna and haste, maybe i forgot removing chloro.<br />
<br />

I almost always buff people that ask, even tho I am never happy about doing it. When I'm not in the mood, I'll ignore the tell...<br />

Generally its just HoS, STA and SoW...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tidykat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Myself, I skipped alot of the thread as it's late here and I'm tired, but I'll add my ramble anywho.<br />
<br />
When I was growing up, I didn't ever ever go to PoK for buffs. my friend here in town got me into the game, and he'd buff me with everything his lvl 11 shaman had until I got those spells.  the only buff I ever looked for was c3 somewhere around level25 or so.  But it wasn't a demand, if I got it cool, if not cool.<br />
<br />
Nowadays, when I buff folks, if they are (i think) 44 and under, they ALL get sow, IOS, guardian, str, dex, agi, sta, regen, haste, and tuna (theres 1 more I wanna say).  if they are between the point of not able to get focus, but CAN have Kragg, I'll give them kragg instead of tuna.<br />
<br />
46+ folks get FoSoul, Fortitue/Boar(based on lvl), Wrulan/Spirit of Sense(as per level), replenishment, SLTW(for melee), sow, diaku, and possible 1 more (again im tired, i forget).  Give them ancestral guard, if they want it.<br />
<br />
And I will ignore some buff tells. Generally the ones who demand buffs are either ignored or they get this: ..|..<br />
Generally ignored.  depending on what I'm doing, andmy mood, If someone asks for buffs, I'll buff them,hecki'll even go to them(in pok), if im not busy.  Donations are a funny thing.  I used to accept them, but I ahrdly ever do nowadays, since I dont have much need for plat, asideof twinking alts and/or doing tradeskills.  now if a level 1 asks me for all my buffs... I ignore him. I figure at level 1, and usually a twink, you dont need many buffs to get my.. my twinks get by with sow.. if that.<br />
<br />
Much of who I buff and when, is based on my mood.  Friends and guildmates I will always buff, their alts too.  I get used toit on raids, and I'm getting 20 tells for focus, or tribunal, or fortitude, or agi, or spirit of sense, or something else. Some raids I just wanna pull my fur out :)</div></div><hr />

Buffs take time and effort and when your heading someplace im sorry but you will just have to make do with what EQ gives you.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">I don't even have low level buffs in my spell book. Everytime an expansion came out, I was already at the max level from the previous expansion, which means I never bought spells like Harnessing of Spirit because I already had better versions. I also deleted lower level buffs when possible (still stuck with Kunark dropped spells like Talisman of the Serpent in my book, though).<br />
<br />
As for expecting all these buffs for donating well, the only time I ever ask for buffs from strangers is KEI (almost always in PoK where they are there already doing it for &quot;donations&quot;) and I usually donate 35 to 50 plat for it. One buff, that's it. How many buffs are you expecting for your payment, and how much is your payment?<br />
<br />
I'll usually buff people when they ask me and I'm not busy, but if it's some low level person I can't help them as I have nothing that will land on them that some shaman of their level doesn't already.</div></div><hr />

I always refused cash, I had little need for it (you're a shaman, with a little knowledge and some effort you could mint your own coin in trivial content).  I will admit, some people made it to my ignore list and some people I just screwed with, but they deserved it.  One guy asks me with all the plz, l33t and dude words and I grudgingly agree to buff him AFTER he asks and I had zoned.  I zone back, don't see him (was travelling unbuffed except for sow and he was invisible ...).  Finally I get to the loc he was at, cast acumen cause I still don't see him, I shoot him a tell and he says he got the buff he was looking for a few minutes ago and took off ... he went on ignore.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I only started playing in December 2002, but as it was a freebie disc on a gaming magazine I didn't have access to PoK (or anything other than the old world for that matter).<br />
<br />
There was an influx around that time on Venril Sathir, with Everfrost and Blackburrow buzzing with newcomers like myself - I still remember being told to work on piercing (for an &quot;epic&quot;, whatever that was!) and I felt invulnerable in Blackburrow when a friendly shaman cast the L24 regeneration spell on me. <br />
<br />
I learned that people liked trading &quot;buffs&quot;, so happily cast AGI, STR and the rest in exchange for advise or other buffs. Once or twice I ran across a high level player who would cast spells like HoS on me - but I never once asked for them, it was more a &quot;drive by&quot; buffing.<br />
<br />
Remembering that, once I finally ordered the other expansions (in the 20s, after spending hours in Splitpaw - that place was heaving), I made a point of drive by buffing people. I still do it today, as I remember how much fun it was to have new and strange spells cast on me back then.<br />
<br />
So, I don't mind casting newbie buffs, however I don't like people out of the blue asking for buffs. Just because I'm in PoK doesn't make me a free buff dispenser, so I usually answer with &quot;If you're quick and meet me at the (soandso) stone I'll buff you&quot; - if they're not there within a minute I'll zone and that's the end of that.<br />
<br />
Worse than that are the few times I've had tells from people (while in PoK, mind) along the lines of &quot;hey dood, can u come buff my grp in bb plz&quot; - yuck! On the other hand, if I'm in a group waiting for others to show up, I'll have no qualms about tossing a Fo7 or STA on a neighbouring group, and many a time our group's gained a Virtue or Bot9 in exchange.</div></div><hr />

I play for ME to have fun.  Spending 1 second longer than necessary in PoK isnt fun for me.  Spending 5 minutes buffing a person, and dropping about 1K mana  in the process isnt fun for me, especially when they try and put 15 plat in the trade window.  Id rather take that 1K mana and go kill something and get a drop I can sell for 5K plat, thanks.<br />
<br />
I do have times when Im not in the middle of something and will stop and buff people if they ask nicely.  Sending me the tell /t Thorzion HoS/STa/Regen/haste/sow kthanks  is the fastest way to get put in my ignore list.  Unless you tell me EXACTLY how much you are going to give me for my time and mana you get what I want to give you.  <br />
<br />
Like many others that started playing in 2000, buff beggers annoy the **** outta me.  You get no sympathy from me because you only have 1K hp unbuffed at level 10; boo ****ing hoo.  I didnt have 1K hp untill I was level 35, my game life was harder and I guess I secretly hate you because you have it easier than I did.</div></div><hr />

Whenever I see a shaman selling buffs in PoK, I /shout out that I'm doing an MGB.  Don't drag our class down into the Enchanter/Cleric ranks of people pimping their mana... it's insulting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Edit: forgot to mention: another reason I don't buffs noobs is that it might steel a groupspot from another shaman... however I will travel long miles to buff a group if they kick the beastlord or chanter out  ;)  JK<br />
<br />
When people are ooc'ing that they are buffing for donations in PoK or wherever, that would be the time to go get buffs. When I am heading to a raid or a group, that would NOT be the time to give me a tell begging. If you get pissy when I ignore you, you will be put on my list of people to train and train again, right before I quit the game.<br />
<br />
Here's a list of stupid stuff that pisses me off when people beg:<br />
<br />
1. Not being polite... if you say something like &quot;buff me at nex stn&quot; you can kiss my big barbarian arse.<br />
<br />
2. Abreviations... complete sentences please, I am not an English major, but things like &quot;can u plz buff me&quot;  show that you are lazy and good for nothing but use as a speedbump.<br />
<br />
3. Not offering to donate. If I just spent 10 minutes finding you, memming buffs, and casting them, compensate me for my time. Generally I will not accept, but it's the polite thing to do.<br />
<br />
4. Acting like I owe you something, or acting like me not buffing you is the end of your misserable little life. &quot;Plz, I need buffs bad! I need them to fight OK!&quot; or &quot;I asked u 4 buffs! HELLO!&quot; (these are both real examples) means you have no respect at all for me, yourself, and whatever invite-anyone-noobie-guild you might be a member of.<br />
<br />
That is all :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>katashi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Afraid I'm totally with Sciek on this one.<br />
<br />
As a class, we want to be valued in groups.  The last thing we really want is to let folks know that they can do without us by heading to PoK and getting our buffs for a few plat.  <br />
<br />
Yes, being polite is always cool.  /role stops most of the tells.  Rarely get any static back from someone I say &quot;I'd rather encourage you to group with a Shaman&quot; ... and if I do, I'm just as glad I didn't buff'm anyway.<br />
<br />
Yes, I'm the first to admit that I break my own &quot;rule&quot; when someone asks nice.  And yes, I'm notorious for my drive-by buffing (especially in Shadeweaver Thicket ... in bear-form ... flying from tree-top to tree-top).  ONLY ONCE, in response to a newbie's &quot;/say thanks whoever you are&quot; did I ever /shout ... &quot;OMIGOD ... it's the BEAR OF DEATH ... RUN!!&quot;  and swoop down ... I swear ... ONLY ONCE!)<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Kenneth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I really think that if you are in a crowded zone, looking for buffs, you should use ooc.  Ask once or twice, and if nobody answers, go on your merry way.  Or, go to a zone where someone might be selling their buffs already.  But, don't just pick /who shaman and send them a random tell.  If they did not answer your ooc, they didn't want to buff you.<br />
<br />
The only time the random tell thing doesn't tick me off (aside from when it comes from someone I know), is when I am clearly only one of a few shaman around, the person is clearly already close to me, and they ask very politely (i.e. using an entire sentence -- not just &quot;buff my grp plz&quot;).  In this case, I'll hit you up for free with all I got, but in PoK or the like, I'm giving you a &quot;sorry, I'm busy&quot; or &quot;sorry, I'm otm&quot; all day.<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. If you are going to use the Tuna/IoS combo, you should use it on casters too... HoS does not stack with their personal shields.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I took it off a while ago after joining a guild on their raid. I forgot to put it back on after gating to PoK and within a minute I was already getting tells from people nowhere close to me if I'd go buff them.<br />
<br />
If you're not in /target range of me. You're not getting it. Period. People need to learn that if they're sending tells across zones for buffs, others are too and that it's rude to expect people to run to or wait for you. What irks me even more is getting asked for buffs while another Shaman is offering buffs in ooc at the bank.<br />
<br />
You want buffs from me? Be next to me. Ask nicely. Say please and spell it right. Tell me what you want but don't expect me to sit there and pile buffs on you. Focus and Stamina is good enough. <br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for low levels who think it's our job to buff them. I play a 47 monk alt and buffs certainly do make a huge difference but I never ever asked a class for buffs unless they're offering them for donations. I'd never think twice to send a tell to someone I didn't know to buff me, let alone ask someone who's not even in front of me.</div></div><hr />

For example: You buff some lowbie with HoS, regen, sow, and some cleric gives him temp, hes already got more than 1000 hp than he should. He can go kill content like that and I don't know about your servers, but on Stromm, people arent the brightest, even at 65+. <br />

If someone is offering to sell buffs thats a different story, but if someone just sends me a tell for buffage generally they are going to be ignored unless I'm in a good mood and they are in /rt range. The second part is really important because I can't count how many  times someone has asked me for a buff and I mem it only to be standing in the same spot 5 min later with them never showing up. <br />
<br />
As far as just gett hos/sta/haste the only buff you're missing that matters one bit is bhali' what else do you want?<br />
<br />
how about Maniacle strength and deleriously nimble, and even your 58 Dexterity buff. All these stack with hos, which I prefer to give IOS and Kraggs since they benefit from and extra 150hps over HOS.thats if they con blue or better to you. Greens get ios AND Altuna since I can stack a <br />
a dex and strength buff with it..A magic resist never hurts as well as regrowth..as well as BinLih or sow. we have 2 long poison and disease resist buffs(Talismans) also that I throw in if they need..I always ask real quick where they are going.It is because when I was 28, a high level stacked on the works for me that lasted through 2 levels..I always remembered that and rather think that the buffee's will also..I get free C3 and Virtue from 2 clerics and an Enchanter that I constantly went out of my way to buff them when they were young..now that they have reached 65, they remember also..goes around comes around..hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">While I would never send people random tells for buffs for any of my alts (or for my main for that matter), I generally will give people buffs when asked.  If I'm not in the mood, I try to use /anon to avoid tells in the first place.<br />
<br />
I have 3 of my spellsets dedicated to buffing:<br />
 * Buffs - single<br />
 * Buffs - group<br />
 * Buffs - newbie<br />
<br />
If somene asks for a specific buff, I usually just give them what they ask for.  If they just ask something generic like &quot;shaman buffs please&quot;, they get the buffs on my spellset.  I must admit that Infusion of Spirit is not on that spellset.  Never even occured to me to mem it, though I'd probably cast it if asked.  Honestly though, it's kind of obnoxious to insist on infusion + stats rather than HoS.  I'd cast it, but I'd think the requestor was kind of a jackass unless they understood that they were making an unusual request and either asked very nicely or offered to donate nicely.  As long as they recognize that they are asking for more than is generally given freely.<br />
<br />
By the way, feel free to ask me for buffs for your alts if you see me on Drinal.  I'd be very entertained to get a /tell saying you remember my name from the crucible.<br />
<br />
Actually, chances are good that you'll get buffs from whichever of my druid or cleric I have logged onto the second account as an added bonus....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u63"><b>Flogg Lheggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p63">Buff Beggars have forced me to go /role all the time. I really don't like going /role but it's incredibly annoying to spend anymore than 5 mins in PoK with it off. <br />
<br />
I took it off a while ago after joining a guild on their raid. I forgot to put it back on after gating to PoK and within a minute I was already getting tells from people nowhere close to me if I'd go buff them.<br />
<br />
If you're not in /target range of me. You're not getting it. Period. People need to learn that if they're sending tells across zones for buffs, others are too and that it's rude to expect people to run to or wait for you. What irks me even more is getting asked for buffs while another Shaman is offering buffs in ooc at the bank.<br />
<br />
You want buffs from me? Be next to me. Ask nicely. Say please and spell it right. Tell me what you want but don't expect me to sit there and pile buffs on you. Focus and Stamina is good enough. <br />
<br />
I have no sympathy for low levels who think it's our job to buff them. I play a 47 monk alt and buffs certainly do make a huge difference but I never ever asked a class for buffs unless they're offering them for donations. I'd never think twice to send a tell to someone I didn't know to buff me, let alone ask someone who's not even in front of me.<br />
<br />
Just curious and I can understand where you are coming from, but does your shaman never need C3 or Virtue in it's travels? If Clerics and enchanters applied the same rules, going without would be the order of the day 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Dewya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">Man there's alot of negativity here. <br />
I enjoy my class thoroughly, including the buffing others part (hence the name Dewya Needabuff). I can't recall ever refusing to buff anyone, no matter how busy I was. That's just me though, I play the game because I like to roleplay. I feel shaman are supposed to help others. If I'm in the middle of something important, I'll at least send a tell to let them know it might be a few minutes before they get their buff. I don't ask for donations and most times refuse them. I buff what I can, mana permitting. Sharing the Shammy love is just part of the game for me and I like it that way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u65"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p65">if I am in PoK and not /afk I usually buff people who ask. Now, below 46 get HoS, Sta, Regen and Haste (even though I recommend seeing a chanter for that).  Above 46 FoS and the rest is the same. If someone has heard of the spell Primal Essence and asks for it they get that too.<br />
<br />
Donations are fine, I do not run around with a set of buffs memmed , so I feel like I may take a little shiny Thank You.<br />
<br />
All this other crap, IoS, Agi, Altuna, come on, I do not even use that on my twinks. And for SoW? Ask a druid, they always have it loaded (do they still?) and its faster (SoE).<br />
<br />
So, if you only get HoS, Sta, Regen, thats a decent set of buffs that can last a long time. Btw. get some levels, 63 with 30 AA sounds like someone not doing their homework to me, Gustov.</div></div><hr />

So when i get sent a tell i just say i do not have that spell anymore. Most say your lose then. I do alot of mgb in Pok and give a 5 min timer on it. So dependding on the mood and if they know where i am (nothing like a fellow 65 toon not knowing where the brew barrel is) if i will do the buff but 80 pct of the time i will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can always get V and KEI easily. If I have no friends or anyone in group to cast it on me it's easy to find someone in PoK casting for donations.<br />
<br />
Even then I rarely do, MGB's are going off all the time in PoK. I very often throw in Fo7 into the mix. <br />
<br />
I never asked anyone I don't know for a buff though. If no one is casting for donations or no MGB's are going off, I just go without it.</div></div><hr />

However, if someone asks me politely, and offers to DONATE up front, I will be more than happy to buff them (if I'm not in a hurry).  And I don't accept the donation...it's just that they are willing to offer.  <br />
<br />
Also, every time I run through POK, I will usually MGB 7 if I'm not headed to a raid.  I like helping the little guys out.</div></div><hr />

For years people have gotten use to donating for c, temp/virtue etc. However when it came to shaman buffs they got the attitude somwhere that we owed it to them.<br />
<br />
I don't take donations for buffs, however I like having it offered. When I request buffs for my alts, I never send the person a tell. I do an ooc &quot;Donating for such and such buff&quot;. If I get somone to respond in a couple mins I always offer a donation. The principal is the offer of the donation to me not the donation itself.</div></div><hr />

I guess you learn something new every day.  (I don't have infusion, but I may have to try and get it from the BL turnin guy a few more times after learning this.;))  I am guessing this also means that Kragg's will stack with IoS, and this makes me feel like I have been slacking :(<br />

Yes..IOS stacks with Altuna and Kraggs..giving from a 100hp to 250hp more than HOS</div></div><hr />

Yeah, 100 hp at the expense of 3 buff slots and pissing off a Shaman who doesnt feel he should have to mem 4 spells instead of 1, cause they created a combo-buff JUST for this purpose. <br />
<br />
The only people I will ever cast IoS on are Clerics who want to keep their self-buff and Casters who want to keep their Shieldings. Thats it. Period. People who ask me for IoS, Kraggs, STR and DEX get HoS casted on them. They can keep it or click it off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Okay....<br />

Yes, I buff people when I see them shouting OOC for shaman buffs, If i'm in the mood, i'll send them a tell saying i'll buff them and where they can meet me. <br />
<br />
Yes, I accept donations for the buffs, sometimes I dont, depends on my mood. <br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes I ignore tells when someone see's me run past them and they /tell me for some buffage (Note: Key word is run, I'm running to get someplace so I do ignore buff tells when I have people waiting on me). Also the possiblity that I'm trying to pay close attention to an important guild/group discussion, so I dont have time to respond to every Tom, Dick and Harry that sends me a tell begging for buffs.<br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes I respond to that /tell and say that I dont have time. <br />
<br />
Yes, sometimes I do respond to that /tell and have them meet me for buffs.<br />
<br />
Yes, I have gotten griped out for saying I'm not going to buff them. <br />
<br />
Yes, I do sometimes actually buff them.. provided I'm sitting there and they are standing right infront of me. <br />
<br />
Yes, I've gotten offered groups, and when I got there as soon as I could, &quot;Oops, we filled the spot, could you buff us, pls?&quot;... guess what my answer to that was? heh. <br />
<br />
When running through a newbie zone, and I'm on my own time instead of my group/guild's time, I'll load my &quot;newbie buffing&quot; set and give em the full load, but only when I actually see someone fighting something, not standing around begging for buffs in POK. Before I log at night in POK, I'll MGB Fo7 at the bank, or when I see someone else MGBing Virtue or KEI. <br />
<br />
I have alot of alts, NEVER have I ONCE sent someone a tell asking for buffs. I'll sometimes OOC for sow, that is the only thing I ever ask for. I'll buy Virtue and KEI from people shouting they are selling it. I dont expect people to buff me, nor do I feel as if I owe anyone buffs, unless they are friends and guildies, or a previous group that had been playing my alt in and I wanted to do something nice for them by running my main 65 shaman over to buff them before I logged off for the night.  This is MY play style, I dont think it's right that you should get mad at others for theirs.<br />
<br />
And yes.. I have gotten frustrated from not getting sows when I myself have given sow out to people who were shouting in POK asking for it. But you know what I do, I suck it up and start running without it. It's their choice if they are going to spend their time to buff you or not. But kudos to you for being so generous as to take your time to buff others. Sometimes kindness does go a long way.</div></div><hr />

One person usualy anounces they will MGB ____ at the nexus stone in 3-5 minutes, everyone who can pitches in and half of PoK gets raid quality buffing.  I feel my *buffing strangers* dues are paid so to speak. If you ask me for a sow or something and your right there, I wont hesitate to mem it and cast it for ya.. Maybe you will get to here the old shaman joke of */em dosn't have any pigs to give you* 5+ years (or whatever its been now) of getting tells for buffs from people you dont know leaves you kind of jaded. I play the game to have fun too, not to wait around for people to figure out where the alchemy vendors in PoK are.<br />
<br />
Tells for buffs from across the zone.. from people i dont know forget it, you will be ignored.  (if your standing in front of me with a sad puppy dog look on your face.. ok... maybe) Being ignored is what you should expect though. Shaman numbers are dwindling.. people in pok are usualy afk.. and your not the only person sending me tells to &quot;gime uber shamy boofs&quot;. &lt;-- something my friends new monk told me from 5 zones away as a joke.<br />

 I guess the only thing I was guilty of was sending tells for ports and sometimes rezes back in the day.. Bothering a stranger to save myself a 3 hour run/boat ride was always worth it :).</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, like darkpaw, I would never have dreamed of sending tells to high levels for buffs when I was levelling up. I would never have thought to bother people and send them tells for buffs, it's just not something I can or would do.<br />
<br />
So I end up buffing random players for free then I get on my alt and walk off to the hunting grounds with no focus myself because I just can't bring myself to be the type as to send tells to high levels asking for buffs.<br />
<br />
I really wish badly that the developers would give us a group harnessing of the spirit. It would not only help me buff strangers with mgbs of it, but would also let me have a chance of getting shaman buffs myself when I play a melee, because like I said I'm not going to be sending tells to shamans begging.</div></div><hr />

I do not buff people who OOC for shaman buffs because I generally have OOC and Shout turned off in the POK. Keeps the idiocy level to a minimum.<br />
<br />
I will buff people who send me a polite tell asking for buffs. Yes, I accept donations. Why not? I donate to others for KEI and Virtue when I cannot get it from a guildmate.<br />
<br />
Yes, I ignore tells if I am:<br />
a) Not in the mood for buffing<br />
b) Headed to a group<br />
<br />
Sometimes I put up an /afk message: &quot;Not casting buffs at the moment.&quot; It's generally up the entire time I'm in the POK.<br />
<br />
I frequently MGB FO7 when I'm told another is MGB'ing KEI or HOV. A lot of times, I'll walk away from public MGB's with raid buffs.<br />
<br />
I never once have felt I owe anybody buffs, or are required to buff people. Sorry, no. When I was leveling Tordail, I never EVER bothered higher-level players for buffs. I got by on what I had in my spell book and the buffs others were casting publicly. Bothering folks is just rude to me. In the rare instance I got a drive-by buffing from someone, I would thank them profusely and offer to donate to them. <br />
<br />
People get so addicted to buffs when they're leveling up, it's amazing. It's like people forgot how to play the class they rolled and just want to level. I have a level 19 necromancer, and the only buffs he gets are what potions I can make him to jaunt around with. *shrug* I don't see the point of getting mad at people for not buffing. People pay their $13 a month, let them play as they wish.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u87"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p87">After reading all the above, and sifting through usefull and useless posts I felt the need to clarify a few things..  I feel there is a big difference between begging..ie...can you spare a sow, or hos or what not, and offering to donate ie..Hey, if you not busy is there any chance I could donate for such and such..<br />
     Secondly, I dont think its every shamans job to buff everyone and anyone.  I should have clarified and stated what annoyed me was when your polite..notice I said polite, and offered one time...Only once, not pestered someone with tells, to donate for a buff.  That was the biggest issue I had.<br />
     So, after a bit of debate I did a survey on my server over a four day period and at different times and asked 40 different shaman ranging from lvl 55 and up what they thought of people asking to donate for buffs... I specified donate..<br />
74% stated they didnt mind buffing for donation as long as the person came to then, was polite and didnt pester them.<br />
20% said they didnt buff anyone except guildies and group members.<br />
6% Didnt care either way and it depended on what they were doing.<br />
     The majority didnt conscider it to be begging when a person sent them a tell and politely asked to donate for a buff.. Whats the worst thing that could happen..They say no?  Or they say yes... Either way its only a game and I believe I made the impression that I was that overly excited when all it really boiled down to was that I was disapointed is all..  I stand by my earlier statement that not responding to a polite request is rude, and that If you need buffs and ask me I will gladly buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thinking of beggars, I got bored the other night and was doing some shopping in the bazaar.  Some lv 14 necro sent me a tell saying he was new and if he could bum 5pp for spells.  I figured why not and gave it to him, then to have a bit of fun, I swapped from my warr to my shm and waited.<br />
<br />
Sure enough, a few min later &quot;Hi, could I ask you for 5pp for my spells?&quot;  My response was &quot;~chuckles~ You just hit up my warrior.&quot;<br />
<br />
By the time I was no longer bored, and was done playing with the guy, my response was &quot;~chuckles~ you just hit up my warrior, shaman, necro, cleric, beast, rogue, druid, wizard, monk, sk, pally, beast no.2, and ranger.&quot;  The ranger was a lv 1 that I made, just to see if I could torment the guy one last time and had him on /anon.<br />
<br />
~laughs~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">I stand by my earlier statement that not responding to a polite request is rude, and that If you need buffs and ask me I will gladly buff. <br />
<br />
I am sorry, but you sending me a tell, DOES NOT obligate me to respond.  If you think its rude not to, then thats your problem.<br />
<br />
NAME THE BUFFS YOU WANT, or don't bother me.<br />
<br />
&quot;Give me your best&quot; go to hell.  Tell me what buffs you friggin want, you are already wasting my time by having me answer you.<br />
<br />
Here is a new flash for you!:<br />
<br />
I DONT GO TO POK TO BUFF PEOPLES</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">It greatly depends on my mood and time constraints.  A lot of times I am running through PoK to get to other zones.  <br />
<br />
A typical run through PoK is this:<br />
<br />
I zone in and almost instantly I get:<br />
<br />
soandso tells you, &quot;buffs plz&quot;<br />
<br />
I run two feet, 2 FEET!<br />
<br />
soandso2 tells you, &quot;focus plz&quot;<br />
<br />
I run to the bank.<br />
<br />
soandso3 says, &quot;SOW! plz&quot;<br />
<br />
Which creates a chain of tells and says to me.<br />
<br />
Now, for the most part, I just go role if I am going to be running through PoK.  It really puts me into a crappy mood if I get hammered with tells for buffs.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean I do not buff people.  If I am tradeskilling or relaxing, I have no issues with buffing people.  OR, I would tell people meet me at xyz asap.  I did this last night as I was running to speak to an npc in Shade.  I never take donations.  I am not a chanter or cleric and pimp my spells.<br />
<br />
One time I logged in for the first time for the night, and there was already tells queued in my tell box as PoK came into view.  I haven't even been in the game 30secs before I get slammed with requests - which is a nice way to make me very grumpy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">This happened to me today<br />
<br />
While fighting a mob I just happened to have my slow resisted and get eaten by the mob.<br />
<br />
Upon dying the first thing that i saw was 3 requests for buffs from random strangers. Sorry but I hadn't even had a chance to sit down and remem my spells.<br />
<br />
What gives people automatic rights for a shaman to drop everything and buff them. The problem isn't the fact that people ask for buffs its that they expect you to buff them as there GOD GIVEN RIGHT and to drop everything in the process. I have stopped responding to people who do this because one or 2 people have been rude to me when i have said no. You don't need high level buffs to move up the game ladder.<br />
<br />
This is one of the reasons that now i use the roll command a when ever i have to pass though PoK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">always buff people who become annoying.<br />
<br />
  You get my level 1 through 9 versions of fire , cold, magic, poison and disease resists, str, agi, dex, sta, sow, EB, LEV, single target acumen, group acumen, and primal essence.  Overall, it takes me about 3 minutes, takes up all your buff slots and does jack squat for ya.<br />
<br />
<br />
  Of course, if a person doesn't prove annoying, then it completely depends on what I am doing at the time.  People are in PoK for numerous reasons.  AFK, waiting on rez, forming up a group, chatting with friends, spamming tradeskills, learning languages, doing a quest, trying to figure out how to fix their flags, travelling and numerous others would ALL precipitate buffing anyone else.  In fact, the only people I can see taking the time to buff you randomly are the ones that are in the zone doing /ooc that they are doing buffs.  Everyone else is logged on for a VERY good reason and that holds their interest at the time.<br />
<br />
  And honestly, 50pp is NOT &quot;donating very well.&quot;  Whenever I would bother to ask for any assistance, which of course means a rez in my cases, I would never offer under 300p.  50p means nothing to me personally, hasn't since level 14.  I even feel pretty guilty about only offering 300p, not too much you can do with that little.<br />
<br />
  And as far as cleric and chanter buffs go, if you sit down and think about how much faster you are able to exp with them, and how long it takes you to get them, the majority of players would find that overall the time seeking the buffs outwieghs the time saved by having them.  Heck, the same reasoning has led me to quit buffing myself for the most part when I solo.  Mana and time is better spent on a heal or a DoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Angilia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">For me its not that big a deal to buff someone I have a saved spellset called littlebuff that loads the lower level buffs I can use on them.<br />
<br />
I usually cast HOS, STA and SOW If they try to donate I also provide regen and haste.<br />
I look at it this was its karma. I like when my alts get buffed. Its not only lazy people its people that dont like the game's downtime.<br />
<br />
I fight a good few fights get real low in health and then sit and go grab a drink and such. Let the new sit regen take effect and save me alot of time. I like the excitement of the new spells and the level till about half way then it becomes tedious killing the same critters and the fun gets lost quick. guess I am impatient.<br />
<br />
As alts I dont hunt in the usual zones I leveled up in for my main. I use other odd zones that no one goes to to explore and enjoy. Its much easier for me to grab a few good buffs and explore then try and convince a group to leave the EXP orgasm of Paludal caverns for example.<br />
<br />
I guess its only mana and if I am in pok by the time I get to hunting ground kei will have made most that mana up.<br />
<br />
I ask for KEI's and Virtues at 64?<br />
Why is it wrong for a lowby to ask for a hos?<br />
Whats the difference cause they are low level?<br />
Sounds like elistist BS to me<br />
<br />
Side note for me its all in the way the person asks for the buffs.<br />
example<br />
&quot;Dude will you hook me up with buffs&quot;<br />
I usually respond with My apologies lad but in a hurry to meet a hunting party&quot;<br />
<br />
If I get a tell that has either the word Please or Pardon Me I will buff them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">Ghostofrommel, you must accept one very basic fact...<br />
<br />
just because other people play shamans, doesnt mean they have to play the same way as you or have the same standards and ethics as you.  i know this, because i had a hard time grouping with shamans after i leveled my up into the 60's.  i'd be like, why is this shaman taking so much aggro, why are they not clocking their buffs properly, why? why? why?... then i made the sudden realization, &quot;they weren't me!&quot;.<br />
<br />
if you see 10939238420349 shamans in a zone, and none of them are buffing.... shux.. they just dont feel like buffing, they're busy or afk or tradeskilling or whatever.  it's their ~$14.00 a month, they can play however they want.  relax, and just go play.<br />
<br />
&lt;soapbox&gt;<br />
and anyway, if you're beggaring around PoK for buffs, you're a gimp.  i just restarted playing after selling my acct almost a year ago, and in fact, i'm rebuilding a troll shaman again.  and since my server (like many others) are over populated by 65+ toons, i'm stuck soloing 95% of the time, and i do this on the power of my own buffs (and a sprinkling of twinkage from old friends, but nothing over the top, hell i still have a studded leather belt i tailored myself :P   jeje )<br />
<br />
if you can find buffs, thats great, but dont beef if you dont, just go play like we all did, back before buffs lasted several hours a pop and you could merely take a book to a zone full of peeps selling buffage.  sheesh<br />
&lt;/soapbox&gt;<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Ghorharth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">well even if i wanted to buff them i could not do it never got HoS or such and if i had them some years ago i already deleted them from the spellbook only keeping spells that i need in groups or raid rest will be thrown out if possible<br />
<br />
<br />
and when i was lvling up we were like OMG this guy is lvl 50 and we would not even dare to bother him with begging for buffs or such if we did not know him<br />
<br />
i for my part think it is a pain in the ass nower days who am i that i can spend an houre to travel threw pok just cause 20 guys i did not even know want to get buffed and they are not asking like ''could i pls get a buff from ya'' it is more like ''buff me!''<br />
<br />
when i log in i want to make some aa before i have to go to the raid for the rest of the day and then i can't spend 2 houres just for the move to riftseekers or anywhere else<br />
<br />
time is money and i for my part think 5 minutes of my time are not worth the 50 pp or what you get for it</div></div><hr />
