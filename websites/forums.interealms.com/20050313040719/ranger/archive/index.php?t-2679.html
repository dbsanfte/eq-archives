<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Seriana</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Did you guys hear that to determine skill raises Fletching uses the higher of Wis, Int or DEX !!!!  Just read an interview with Yakatizma on Casters Realm, where he said that is the case with Fletching and Jewelry, and will be for Tailoring soon (maybe this patch?).<br />
<br />
Gee I wish they would have told me this sooner, 'cause I can get my dex to 159, but can get my Wis only to 120 something using all my Wis gear.<br />
<br />
Sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yendor</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I thought it was DEX that plays a part in the success check for the actual fletching attempt, and the higher of WIS/INT plays a part in the success check for a fletching skill increase?  Was this ever the case or did I just read something wrong way back when?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Giland</div><div class="date">05-09-2002, 01:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was the rumor way back when, however, I read the same interview Seriana did and it does state that it is the higher of the 3.<br />
For smithing it is the higher of Int/wis/str<br />
<br />
And for the record, that makes sense to me. It allows a melee who is not going to concentrate on int/wis to compete against a caster who is, thereby leveling the playing field between casters and melee.</div></div><hr />
