<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">there seem to be a large number of shamans that are offended by this term<br />
just wonderin why<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people don't like being addressed as a car drying implement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shammy=item used to shine a car.<br />
Shammy!=7 foot tall ass kicking shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I had no idea that people used 'shammy' for 'chamois' until I heard people here complaining about that.<br />
<br />
That's about the most illiterate thing I've seen today.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with being called a Shammy, btw.  In my mind it's just like calling a wizard a wizzy, a necromancer a necro, or a druid a dr00d.<br />
<br />
(OK, maybe that last one is in a different category).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I prefer the more formal shamma-lamma-ding-dong myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>dcfix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I usually refer to myself as the sthuper sthammy (lisping intentional)<br />
<br />
As far as people telling me to wash their car... I reply &quot;ok, gimme yours keys and I'll be back in a few hours.&quot; <br />
<br />
That usually shuts them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would consider both shammy and wizzy terms little kids in Bastion of Dreadlands would use.  A lot like the people running around saying &quot;bling!&quot; whenever they get an AA.<br />
<br />
And dr00d is the correct term for a druid :D<br />
<br />
dcfix,<br />

You've got car wax on yer cloak, it looks kind of gross, might want to clean that up  :cool:</div></div><hr />
