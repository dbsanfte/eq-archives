<p class="largefont">Click here for full thread: <a href="http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=13534">Question about Subscribing to Threads</a></p>
<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there any way to set my forum preferences so that I automatically subscribe to any thread I post in?  The reason I want to be able to do this is because I have a bad habit of posting something in a thread, and then forgeting about it until that thread comes up to the top again.  If it doesn't come back to the top again, I typically won't check it again, and so I miss if someone responded to one of my posts.  Subscirptions seem like the right sort of way to avoid this, but if anyone has a better suggestion I'd welcome it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">P.S.  I do know about this:<br />
<br />
 &quot;Use 'Email Notification' by default?<br />
Using this option emails you whenever someone replies to a thread that you have participated in.&quot;<br />
<br />
in the options section.  However, I like to keep my Crucible experience as web-based as possible, so this won't help me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found this in the vBulletin FAQ:<br />
<br />
What is email notification? <br />
If you post a new thread, or reply to an existing thread, you can choose to be notified by email when someone else replies to that thread. You can also choose to receive email notifications of new posts in a thread without posting in that thread, by clicking the 'Receive updates to this thread' link displayed in the thread page.<br />
<br />
If you choose to stop receiving email notifications from a thread, you can turn off the option by either editing your post, or by unsubscribing from the thread here.<br />
<br />
Only registered users may receive email notification, and they can set whether they want to receive email notification by default by editing their options.<br />
<br />
Email notification is also referred to as 'Thread Subscription'.&quot;<br />
<br />
For those of you who are wondering, I did read the FAQ before posting this whole thread, I just missed this particular entry because I was looking for &quot;subscriptions&quot; and the FAQ called it &quot;email notification&quot;.  I guess this is vBulletin's fault, and not anyone here, but do we really need two terms for this? &quot; Subscription&quot; seems to be mainly used in the web interface itself (you see it at the bottom of this page &quot;subscribe to this thread&quot;), while &quot;email notification&quot; seems to be mainly in the documentation (and in that &quot;Use 'Email Notification' by default?&quot; option in the User CP).  I like to think I'm technically-literate, as I use things like search engines and Ctrl+F (Find), and things like this really mess up those types of searches.<br />
<br />
But getting back to the point, I guess what I'm looking for is a Moderator or anyone else who knows vBulletin well enough to explain what (if anything) I can do to get the functionality of &quot;Use 'Email Notification' by default?&quot;  but have it be web-based and not email based.<br />
<br />
P.S. Lest you all imagine me as some paranoid schizophrenic who hates email, I just wanted to explain why I'm going through all this trouble.  This really happened, I swear ;) .  I tried sending SOE a bug report, and received (at last count) 75 replies from their buggy computer-based response system thingee.  In all fairness, I sort of encouraged it after the first eight or so by sending them another email asking them to please stop.  In retrospect I probably shouldn't have done that.  Anyhow,  I know the people who make the Crucible are way more competent than SOE, but still the whole experience just happened yesterday, and I'm still kinda wary of web-based email stuff ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I'm at it (and because no one seems to be responding) I feel compelled to ask:<br />
<br />
Am I the only one who uses subscriptions?  Or am I just too used to the fast pace of this board, and am forgetting that sometiems it takes more than the 6 or so hours for people to respond?<br />
<br />
Either way, I promise this will be the last post of me responding to myself.  If only I didn't have so much downtime to spend on these forums when I am on CRs due to poor pathing...  /rude VI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I use &quot;Email notifcation by default&quot; to send me email for threads I've posted on here.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure this is what you're after, but it does seem that you can subscribe to a thread without it emailing you. Then you could view the list in your User Control Panel to see which ones have been replied to recently. I can't see a way to set this by default though - I'm not sure if simply replying on a thread is enough to make you subscribe if you don't have the &quot;Email notifcation by default&quot; option ticked. Maybe you could experiment with this.<br />
<br />
I will say that email notification seems to work pretty well. You only get one email per thread, until you visit the board again, so you don't get like 50 emails if it's a very busy thread and you're away for a couple of days.<br />
<br />
I also have hotmail, and sometimes have MSN up, which gives me a notification when I get email.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
