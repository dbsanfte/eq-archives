<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So maybe Sony did us a favor and made the BST class our replacement buff ho's.  The first useful tip was the clicky shrink boots (woot, so much for having to shrink mounted casters all raid long!).  I'm trying to figure out the rest of the stacking issues, though, for future reference.  I just don't SEE a lot of bst's around, so when one shows up and said &quot;screw that focus crap, the tanks want my buffs&quot;, I'm kind of at a loss.  <br />

infusion           50str 55dex 45sta<br />
spirit vigor       40atk 225hps<br />
talisman kragg  365 hps<br />
<br />
Focus Spirit    405hps 67str 60dex<br />
<br />
Since our sta buff line stacks with everything (yes?) I'll ignore that one.  But obviously, the sta score of the people in question is going to matter a lot.  My self-buffed sta is 255, so it looks like the bst alternative is only going to screw me - as well as any tank who's concentrated on sta gear.  *cough*<br />
<br />
My questions then, are:<br />
Does spiritual vigor stack with focus?  <br />
Then, are the only stacking issues Focus vs. Fusion+kragg?<br />
<br />
Or maybe I should say:  could someone give the lowdown on how to buff with a bst around, please?  The ones I've met all seem to have this hostility issue towards shamans.  I'm sure there may be other stacking issues that I'm not even thinking of here.  Thanks for any input.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">heh.. well if they want to go around and single target buff every tank in the raid.. more power to them I guess.... not exactly my idea of fun =p</div></div><hr />
