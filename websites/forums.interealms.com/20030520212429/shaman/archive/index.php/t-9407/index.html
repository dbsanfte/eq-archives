<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I've just moved two chars to KB to be with some lower level friends and generally have room to breathe after some time on AB.<br />
<br />
Sadly I'm naked, and will remain so unless Stormhammer to KB transfers are allowed in the near future.<br />
<br />
Resources at my disposal are dual boxed:<br />
<br />
Naked 57 Shaman<br />
Naked 60 Monk<br />
<br />
The monk will more or less stay naked, but I want to get a very basic set of chain for my lovely troll.<br />
<br />
I've thought of Ry'Gorr and Jarsath so far.  Are there any other options which wouldn't require farming or near death experiences to get?<br />
<br />
Usually I'd get stuck into the typical 60-ish cash-loot zones of Chardok, Seb and Velks but in my current form of ~1200 HPs and ~650 AC I don't tend to survive very long :)<br />
<br />
Any suggestions for where to hunt to re-equip myself in the shortest time would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe farm HGs and buy Ry'gorr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably pretty easy to kill some hq's for cash and buy a set of banded.  Then run around and do the smaller pieces of totemic quests, should be easy to finish at 60.<br />
<br />
If you've done your epic steps, you can just hail the spirit in WK and say the right phrase and get a free shield.<br />
<br />
JB armor is also dirt cheap in the bazaar, usually selling right around vendor costs (350-500pp a piece other than bp/legs).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On a lot of servers it doesnt even cost that much for JB stuff and it will help you out a fair chunk.<br />
<br />
I would go with the theory of doing some HG's for a bit.  They are v easy, especially if you use the monk as well.  Get some cash, buy some JB and Ry'gorr stuff then look for the bigger cash camps like in Seb (that on AB at least, since PoP has come out is totally dead) to buy some nicer stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>siden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses.<br />
<br />
I ended up camping the Ry'Gorr fort and got 3 x chain BPs and legs, plus arms coif and other stuff - including 14 orc fang earrings :D<br />
<br />
Well on the way now.  Completely forgot about JB, which starts at ~400pp on KB so that's the next step I guess.  The chain will then be passed to my twink ranger :)</div></div><hr />

Jarsath legs and helm are easy to get and heck, I'm still wearing mine. <br />
<br />
Sadly trolls can't wear Jarsath.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">D'oh!   Color me stupid.  Kromrif Military Legs are an option, you could also get the arms.</div></div><hr />
