<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">since my post got canned earlier on the wipe..REPOST TIME!<br />
<br />
has anyone noticed if Arch Lich, Sontolak are now Immune??<br />
There was a update to those zones Sunday morning and a rumor flying around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Odd question coming from the king of the one-line, &quot;Try for yourself noob&quot; retort to mob info requests... Anyhow, they're both flagged &quot;immune to changes in...blahahblah&quot; now.  Sontalak is still very doable, but I can't for the life of me figure out how the Arch Lich is going to be done now without seamless healing on the main tank and people taking his rampages, not to mention the insane DPS he's going to require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Go try it yourself noob!<br />
<br />
Seriously though, Arch Lich has already been killed on some servers since being made unslowable. If it makes him a ton harder, think they will make his loot a ton better? Yeah, me either.<br />
<br />
Won't make too much difference on Sontalak I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">that would of been funny had I not killed AL 4359345903845 times prior ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even prior to the counters being added to slow spells, the AL was much easier 'cause you'd just stack a ton of debuffs on him and drop the slow way in the back.  Along with what I was saying, he obviously killable, but I just think the encounter is kinda ruined for guilds that can't field the pretty insane resources that he'll now require.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">that would of been funny had I not killed AL 4359345903845 times prior ;p<br />
<br />
Sentiment appreciated Widaar.<br />
<br />
The sentiment is fairly true too, just takes the sting out of it when the deliberate exageration makes you look frivolous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Runak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, Sontalak is immune, and has been buffed.  His AE does 650 now and may be harder to resist.  Not sure of other changes to him, that's just what we noticed during the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zugugg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Great... now Plague of Insects or slow-proccing melees are no longer even options for these fights.<br />
<br />
No thanks Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea, the AL is quite a bit harder now since he rampages like mad without slow.  You just need a lot more healing and tank power but he's still do-able.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hmmm, our slowable list is getting shorter and shorter.<br />
<br />
Starting to feel like an actor that headlined broadway and now doing off broadway shows on stages in middle-schools with twenty people watching.   Thanks Verant.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Excuse me, but what's the point of making Sontalak harder? He doesn't drop any cool items other than maybe a Matchless BP 1 in 30 kills. What's next, make Klandicar unslowable and hit for 900?<br />
<br />
Most servers have retards that woke the sleeper already, so more ST keys entering the game isn't that big a deal now that warders are mostly extinct.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I was thinking pretty much the same thing, Jing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've never been able to slow Klandicar ever since the change several months back.  Nor any other shaman in my guild.<br />
Don't believe getting immune messages, just the standard resist message,  but feel like they might as well flag it immune.<br />
I wonder if they changed Zlandicar...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Last summer we see hints of Lure of Insects; a 25% lure based slow.  Shaman get excited.  Sure it's only 25%, but at least we can do *something* to previously unslowable mobs. <br />
<br />
In the fall, many mobs have their MR tweaked to permit other classes to cast on them easier and the Immune to Slow flag was introduced.  Where we had a Hail-Mary's chance of slowing some mobs, now we have none.  Ever fight a guard in Icewell Keep?  Unslowable coupled with insane cold, poison, and disease resist = shaman need not apply.  This change in game mechanics makes Lure of Insects undoable.<br />
<br />
Luclin ships and we get Plague of Insects instead -- disease based, not a lure, yet still a mere 25%.  It becomes a frustrating niche spell.  Often you need to cast Insidious Killme to get it to land and, honestly, the 25% you slowed that glimmer drake isn't worth the mana the cleric just spent trying to keep you alive, not to mention the ping pong match you started.   Luclin is the first expansion ever that provided no damage spells at all to the shaman class when two DD's are pulled from the spell lineup.<br />
<br />
Recently, Verant added disease counters to slow and we got excited about being able to stick one of mobs like Sontalak.  But  Verant makes him flat out unslowable.  Apparently, adding quite a bit of aggro to the spell as well.<br />
<br />
Unslowable is a nerf.  Slowing is the shaman's thing and Verant is taking it away.  When we face an unslowable mob I don't feel like a member of the team, more like a vendor hocking AGI in the grandstands.  What if they go bonkers with unslowable in Planes of Power? If a level 48 coldain guard can be unslowable, what about gods?<br />
<br />
Sorry, ranting buff monkey here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've never been able to slow Klandicar ever since the change several months back. Nor any other shaman in my guild<br />
<br />
You guys doing the whole debuff shebang? (malo, malosini, tash, bard song?) We fight Klandi A LOT and we have always slowed him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Snacko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">too answer a question above, why make sontalak harder?  Well what happened is they made slows give +disease counters now, so any mob that cast dispell on himself was not getting rid of slow anymore.<br />
<br />
So things like the Arch Lich and Sontalak only required 1 slow and you were set.  Well apparently VI didn't like that, which is why they are both immune now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gresgoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well, I can confirm that they made the Sontalak encounter quite a bit more difficult. Although, as Jing said, I can't imagine why. Why make a sleeper's key that much more difficult to obtain? IMO, the best thing he drops are spells, so wtg on making a primarily a spell dropping mob [u]too difficult[\u].<br />
<br />
However, I felt that after the Turgur's change, it did trivilaize the Arch Lich encounter and it should have been modified to correct this imbalance.<br />
<br />
Recap: After Turgur's change--<br />
Arch Lich flagged as unslowable (but not otherwise changed)<br />
Sontalak flagged as unslowable (beefed up considerably. /boggle)<br />
<br />
--Gresgoth of Fennin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Snacko, you missed my point. I know all about slow spells having disease counters. My point was why is Sontalak hard in the first place? His loot is complete crap mostly. They could just leave the undispellable slow tactic on Sont and his reward would be balanced with his risk. This change just puts his risk way higher than his reward.<br />
<br />
Ramhorn, &lt;b&gt;every&lt;/b&gt; time we fight Klandicar he is slowed. Same thing with Zlandicar.<br />
<br />
How to slow Klandicar/Zlandicar:<br />
1) Malo<br />
2) Occlusion of Sound<br />
3) Tash<br />
4) Malosini<br />
5) Bard tash procs from Orb of Tishan and Journeymans Walking Stick (must be bard proc, no other class can stack it)<br />
6) Turgur's<br />
<br />
Use that list and Zland/Kland will be slowed everytime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Seriously though, Arch Lich has already been killed on some servers since being made unslowable.<br />
<br />
Just curious, who has done this?  We've pretty much put him into the &quot;unkillable unless by some miracle we have 80 people online&quot; catagory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.clubfu.com&quot;&gt;Club Fu&lt;/a&gt; killed unslowable Arch Lich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Ashen Vendetta on Innoruuk killed the unslowable Arch Lich on the first try no less..  Was a little surprised.<br />
<br />
Cripple seems to help ease the rampages a bit I've noticed.  Definetly worth throwing in there if you don't use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'm not sure if he does...but I see him there often...<br />
Doesn't Sontalak pretty much guard ToV entrance when he pops?<br />
<br />
If so, maybe he was beefed to make it harder to farm.  Of course Harmony does the trick ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>baddwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">We kill Sontalak 2 times this week.  First time we got him right away.  Not much change on the fight, you need to dish alot of dmg in a very short time as before.  Second try last nite, Lag owned us but we prevail on the 3 times with less lag and no LD, God make someone at VI look this issue -&gt; Lag.  Resist is not to hard or u get partial resist and low dmg.  The change was to put back Sonta as it was before and &quot;It is working as intended&quot; gee i like this 5 word's one, make me think of a saler telling you &quot;Trust me!&quot;.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">we kill al in the new form, took quite abit of an adjustment :) but do him (almost) without deaths now.<br />
<br />
and erm, does anyone actually use disease slow? i think i tried it once in tov, then retired it to the back of my spellbook :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>NandoTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">unslowable arch-lich has been killed by kupo flux on tholuxe paells<br />
<br />
and i use disease slow on glimmer drakes in tov</div></div><hr />
