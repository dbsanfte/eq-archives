<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jorgurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok,  So here I am, thinking of what a waste my 12 points into SCF3 is, lamenting that I only really have 3 spells that this is useful for, and I rarely even cast those three spells unless we have so many shamans, I'm just trying to use mana (Ice strike, Blast of Poison, and Torrent).  Forget the fact that those are heavily resisted on large targets anyways.<br />
<br />
I got the 3 points to SCF back when it still worked on the JBB.  It wasnt unbalancing, in my eyes, for items that were right clik to be affected by SCF at all in my experience.  It was flashy, saved me maybe a half minute if soloing, but at least it was something.  Now it's almost nothing and I, and many others, were duped with the &quot;bait and switch&quot; by Verant (we're not the only ones affected by this, however, likely, we'd be the ones who'd not put points into SCF if not for JBB crits).<br />
<br />
So here's my idea.  We DO cast a spell over and over that does DD that is a spell from our spellbook, not an item.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cannibalize!<br />
<br />
Why shouldnt Cannibalize give crits?  Double damage, double mana.  Same ratio, no advance in that, but it gives a Shaman a reason to put any points into SCF.  It's not like it's not doing Direct Damage..  I see the 148 damage I take every time I hit that Canni button.  My view is that it would save approximately the same amount of time as the JBB crits in fights would save, but you'd be able to use it on buffing and such too.  Not like I much use the JBB any more..  DoTting and Canni seem to be much faster if I solo.  And dont tell me &quot;oh, but now shamans will crit kill themselves.&quot;  Like hell we dont kill ourselves now anyways with Cann5 and such.  Canni-suicide is part of a shaman's life.<br />
<br />
<br />
So... thoughts?  Too unbalancing?  Bad Idea?  Great Idea?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If it retains the same ratio, it's kind of worthless.  I like knowing that canni will only take 148 each time.  I don't really want it to take more than that.  If I wanted 396hp for however much mana, I'd just cannibalize twice.<br />
<br />
It wouldn't really be much of a timesaver unless you were in a situation where you're oom and you are canning like mad, and even then it wouldn't be of much use.<br />
<br />
I think they should just let people that put points in to SCF before the nerf petition and get their points back.  That really sucks.</div></div><hr />
