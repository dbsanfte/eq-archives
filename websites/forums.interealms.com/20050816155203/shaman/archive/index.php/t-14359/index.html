<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently fell victim to an account scam, i gave someone my PW/SN to log me on to get flags when im not on with the guild, needless to say today i tried to log on and pw was changed. Anyway I can get it back? I have the original cd keys, and all of the original registration info. Please no flames i know what i did wrong, just trying to get out of the pickle.</div></div><hr />

You can find the # on the website somewhere. All they need is a bit of info from you. The original cc# and all that jazz.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Admit to NO WRONGDOING. If you even HINT that you gave out your PW, then your account is as lost as a cookie in Etheopia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that could help, assuming you updated your current email with the LoY release<br />
<br />
i think if a incorrect password is entered &quot;X&quot; amount of times it resets the account, and generates a new password.  That happened to me a while back, thankfully my email was updated when i bought the LoY prerelease.</div></div><hr />
