<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, I have read a few topics and responses about which race combo to choose and why. I still can't decide which race combo is best suited for me. So, here is what I am looking for.<br />
<br />
I know the pro's and con's of the races (not all), I do not care all that much about a JBB. Faction also isn't that big of a deal, If you can out run a villager with a guard tagging along then keep running until you can die some where close to a portal.<br />
<br />
Ok, I want to play mostly solo (for those times when no one is LFG). Good base stats, because they can always be changed with gear. I want to be able to live or at least /sigh when confronted with an in eht face combatant and survive with only 1hp left. Something with enough starting mana to not leave me needing to med every 2sec (altough up until lvl 20 were more melee, I think). Ugliness isn't a factor it's why my wife married me. Something that can make money fairly easy when starting with no gear. <br />
<br />
Second toon first is a 12 monk, so this will be a non-twiked non uber newb. <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Njorls</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All the factors you're looking for are too subtle, there really isn't that much difference across races besides the equipment ones you already know about.<br />
<br />
My advice: play whatever you think looks the coolest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd go for a Troll, nice regen, can shrink self after 19 so that kind of negates the large size factor. No place I need to go that my faction is really a problem. I'd personally choose Innoruuk as a god (wish I'd know this way back when) for the snare necklace. Should help a ton if you're gonna solo alot. Snare/DoT/DoT/DoT/DoT = dead mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Id go with Troll as well.<br />
<br />
I wish I could change now ;(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh yeah....Shaman's don't med much after 24 and Canabilize, so that's not often a factor. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Personally, I chose a troll for the regen and JBB.  If JBB isnt a big deal to you though, I'd actually suggest an Iksar.  Regen is same as a troll, wis is a bit higher I believe and the AC bonus will be most beneficial since you are going totally untwinked.  <br />
<br />
Tavokk is right though, even more importantly than race is make sure you choose Innorukk as your diety.  I picked Cazic and thought about rerolling all the way into my mid 50s.  Then I found an undead fear exploit and was satisfied with Cazic finally. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm an Ogre I love Ogres, But I think what you want by your description is a Troll the snare clicky item and regen are realy nice. There are things you just cant do without snare in dungeons without it being very very stressfull also regen=less down timel.<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Worship Inny so you can get the snare item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Whats is it called? How easy is it to obtain?<br />
<br />
I have my choices narrowed down to troll and iksar but now it's stuck at that. <br />
<br />
Either way I can have my regen and eat it too! Size doesn't matter much after &lt;shrink&gt;, Iksar have natural AC bonus. Both have EXP penalty iksar have 20% troll is 15% I believe. Troll can't be stunned or is that ogre only? Starting stats I think troll have the advantage melee stat wise and iksar priest stat wise. Leveling shouldn't be to much of a problem I can get about 6-7 levels a day till I hit 24. Then things slow down a little for me. I don't have a WOW that looks cool preference, I am more of a number geek.<br />
<br />
How do these two fair in eht face combat?<br />
<br />
Personal opinions, would help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The snare necklace is an Inky Quest. (Easier for Trolls to start now that they're in Neriak) It's the Regent Symbol of Innoruuk. It's the 3rd tier in a series of quests for Innoruuk Symbols (I believe it's Initiate, Disciple, Regent). Casts the low end necro/sk snare (Ensnaring Darkness I think). 6 second cast time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Go Barbarian/ogre/iksar (most wis) IMO. I have heard that the troll exp penalty i prett hard to get past when in your 40's so that why i don't think him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">barbarians all the way !<br />
<br />
go us .. go us :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">go for what i your mind completes the image of a shaman and what will be the most FUN to role play. Race only matters very low in the game , the only class with any advantage is a ogre cause of the no frintal stun , but they arent as sexeh as a barb ( like me ;) )<br />
<br />
To me i picked a barb cause when i think of a shaman , i think of a tribal medicine man and the bard just fit the indian/nomadic/tribal feeling for me. Im still happy , at 65 and dont look to be changing. Frogs are coming though , so that alone might be alot of fun ;)<br />
<br />
choice is yours , there is not BEST really</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its only ogres that can't be stunned.  I played IN TEH FACE for most of my troll career and at 59 still do quite a bit when soloing in pre-pop or even in groups in PoP.  I heavily considered both troll and iksar when making mine originally as I considered regen an essential.  The final breaker for me was the JBB.  AC and higher wis can be made up for in gear eventually, but nothing is gonna make my second favorite clicky iksar wearable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If your choice is coming down to either troll or iksar, go troll. The AC bonus on an iksar just isn't worth as much as the potential to use a JBB. You're already accepting the big exp penalty in exchange for the regeneration. You might as well get the full joy and go with a troll for the JBB eventually. They are not as hard to buy as they used to be (witness the recent thread about all the L 65 shamans selling their JBB's because they aren't much use at that level). <br />
<br />
I say this because you say you want to be able to solo. Being able to use a JBB will make a huge difference in your soloability in the high 40's and low-mid 50's (assuming you can manage to buy one by then, of course). Once you get togor's at L 39 your AC (the iksar's only advantage over troll) just isn't worth very much when solo'ing. The mob will be slowed and hardly hurting you faster than you are regen'ing anyway. <br />
<br />
JBB and a horse is just FAR too fun a combination to miss out on -no downtime solo'ing makes playing a shaman fun!</div></div><hr />

The Cazic Thule Fear necklace from Paineel is still nothing to scoff at. At least it's better than Yaulp or the lowbie Cleric hammer. :p<br />
