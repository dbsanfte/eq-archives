<br />
3 words.... Big, Green, Mean. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>shakoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just a heads up, as a troll shaman, Im earning 2-3 blues per my cleric friend's full yellow AAxp. If you choose troll, you betta do it because you love the race and nothing else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Poll not withstanding, ogres overall make the best shaman in the long term.   Troll regen is NOT huge by any means, and in every other way Ogres have them beat.  :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I wanna be troll cause they look freaking awesome man!<br />
<br />
I hated trolls at the beginning but now I would love to be one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Pros:<br />
........................Regen<br />
........................Ability to use the JBB<br />
........................Ability to use the snare necklace<br />
........................Decent stats<br />
........................Night sight<br />
<br />
Cons:<br />
........................Faction<br />
........................Experience penalty<br />
<br />
With faction increasingly unimportant (expansion cities are largely racial-faction neutral) trolls looks pretty good!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">&quot;Just a heads up, as a troll shaman, Im earning 2-3 blues per my cleric friend's full yellow AAxp.&quot;<br />
<br />
That doesn't make sense. Its a 20% penalty, unless your friend is a halfling cleric you would be making 4 blues to his 1 yellow. My understanding is that exp penalties don't even apply to AAxp (but I don't know, never played a heavy penalty race past 50).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">pros--CUZ I LIKE IT<br />
cons--I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE IT<br />
<br />
nothing else counts.<br />
<br />
and the poll shows trolls are sexiest.k thx la~</div></div><hr />

I think that pretty much sums it up <br />
<br />
It depends on everyone, I chose troll just because I think they are the best looking. It's the barbarian that I personally think look like &quot;ass&quot;. Would I put that as a con, no. Everyone has their own opinion, so you can't put that as a pro or con, it's not a fact.<br />
<br />
And faction is a pro to me also. I can gain faction in good cities, but you can't gain faction in bad cities. I can go to every city on Antonica (minus Halas) and Kunark, and the other expansions are the same for everyone.<br />
<br />
:D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Another pro (according to some) is that they are more rare than barbs.  Although, on my server at least, I see a lot of troll shamans also.  <br />
And, to tell the truth, the whole &quot;being unique&quot; argument doesn't have much weight anymore becuase there are just so many people playing EQ now.  The only way to truly be unique in EQ is to develop your own personality and play style.<br />
<br />
Heh, sorry, went off on a tangent there . . .<br />
<br />
Anyway, pretty much what everyone else is saying:  regen, snare symbol, night vision are the main goodies.  Bad faction, low WIS, high EXP penalty being the bad.<br />
<br />
Aselus, you mentioned being evil as a pro.  Why do you consider it such?  If anything, it's a hinderance.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  I must throw in, tho, that no one race is superior to another (regardless of what some may say).  All shaman races are equally-viable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Would have to agree with Kaz that troll faction really is not a hinderance and I love the way the old troll models look.  Most places I am KOS in are places I really have no interest in factioning or places where elfs live.<br />
<br />
With all the JBB/snare necklace/regen roxxorz j00 articles I expect trolls to eventually outnumber Barbs on my server.  Ogres seem to be the forgotten minority now and I can only count a few L60 ogre shamans on Xeg.  Is it just me or were ogre shammys the &quot;best race&quot; a year or so ago? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">So i guess Ill be an extremelly useful troll shamy.  Oh and btw someone said that all races are in a way equal a bit back.  I can disprove that.  My first character was a wood elf WARRIOR!!!! Now I hit fast and crited once a fight, but rangers outdamaged me.  There you go, disprooved.:cool:</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hrrm. .  you don't wanna use that sledge mallet if yer KoS in outpost tho.  The port in point is inside a wrecked ship with a bunch of skellies guarding it, I think they're bout lvl 30?  I dunno.  I had to rescue a barb warrior lvl 60 and get his body back with my monkie once.  He had NToV gear too and kick ass weapons.  <br />
<br />
Any other info bout that Glori?  i'm sure I could swing a puppet strings click if I thought it would be useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">You don't need to worry about using the sledgemallet if you're KOS in Outpost. You'd have to have some TERRIBLE TERRIBLE bad luck to die there at level 60. <br />
<br />
Generally, you're only close to ONE kos mob when you TP in via mallet, and that one is green to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Being KOS in OT is no hindrance to using the mallet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Puppet strings(4 charges) is an item dropped from Cazic Thule You can use it to charm the quest giver in OT. <br />
<br />
When an enchanter charms a mob, its indifferent to you, but IF yourself do it, you will become amiably(just as your dog is). <br />
<br />
This way you can gain the hammer, even if you are KOS to OT(or so I believe).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Actually, I saw a puppet strings looted from Fright the last time my guild did demis.  Now if I can just remember who walked away with them . . . i might be able to negotiate the use of a charge . . .<br />
or maybe buy a strings or something.  <br />
<br />
Good to know that the hammer is usable even if KoS.  One additional question . . . what is the trick to getting out of the ship?</div></div><hr />
