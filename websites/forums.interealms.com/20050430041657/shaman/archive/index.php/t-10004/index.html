<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Summary: A shaman that maxes out his healing AA (healing adept3, advanced healing adept3, healing gift3, advanced healing gift3) will NEVER achieve a Tnarg's Mending mana-to-hp heal ratio that matches the mana-to-hp heal ratio of Kragg's Mending.  This is a bit of a bummer. <br />
<br />
By default, Tnarg's heals 1300 hp for 450 mana. This is a ratio of 2.889 hp per mana spent. In comparison, Kragg's ALWAYS heals at a ratio of 4.875 hp per mana spent (assuming each of the spells hits for full).<br />
<br />
With maximum AA points in healing abilities, a shaman can improve the ratio of Tnarg's heals to 3.988 hp per mana, not shabby... just don't compare it to a cleric or druid with healing AA maxed.<br />
<br />
&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scienceofwar.net/resources/tnarg_kragg_v01.xls&quot;&gt;calculations here&lt;/a&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not totally accurate.  Mana preservation items DO work on Tnarg's, but do NOT work on Kragg's.  Also, heal enchancing focus items DO work on Tnarg's but again NOT on Kragg's.<br />
<br />
Now do the math.  Maxed with Advanced Healing Adept 3 you're cranking out 1547 point Tnarg's.  Add a Healing 4 item (as i understand it, random between 1% and 20%, we'll say 10 for the sake of arguement) and you're up to an average of 1677 a heal.  Now factor in critting 19% of the time and you average 1995 a shot.  Factor in a mana pres 4 item and your mana/heal ratio shot up to 4.93.  The same shaman is kicking out Kragg's for 400 mana at 2320 a pop, or 5.8 mana/heal ratio.<br />
<br />
Really looking at max potential?  Add a preservation item like the Aten mask (18%), shaman elemental sleeves (25% healing bonus) and your ratio jumps to 5.51 (2034 healed for 369 mana).  Throw in the cleric haste buff and nightcaller's leggings and you're casting time is down to 2.4 seconds.<br />
<br />
What it comes down to is this.  Without any AA or focus items, Kragg's mending is a good choice for efficiency, and Tnarg's is a good choice for speed.  But as you get healing AA and items, Tnarg's gets a lot better while Kragg's changes little.  As you become more powerful you'll find yourself using Tnarg's more and more until you no longer have Kragg's memmed, ever.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My guess about a couple of these things...<br />
<br />
Percentage of shamans that have maxed healing AAs: &lt; 2<br />
Percentage of shamans that have Aten mask + elemental sleeves : &lt; 1<br />
Percentage chance that your guild would ever notice the difference if you suddenly didnt have those AA skills and items: 0<br />
<br />
Being able to heal is nice but I sure dont want to be able to compete with clerics in healing. I like the fact that I can heal some if I have to but that clerics are much better at it even without AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Coralie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">dont forget max range of<br />
Tnarg is 200<br />
Kragg is 100<br />
<br />
Tnarg + focus range item and you can patch out range of many AE</div></div><hr />

<br />
Er, and when my cleric goes splat, I'll be glad I can at very least keep people alive and in some cases, replace a cleric completely for reasonable periods.<br />
<br />
With maxed Healing Adept/Aha but only HG1 I still find myself whipping out Kraggs, although tbh the main reason I used KM in preference in the past was purely down to the fact that it didnt generate any real amount of hate, once I get my crits up to speed and see a healing 4 item I'd actually wear, that'll probably change, its just a shame Khuras mending was removed, whilst its ratio was nothing interesting, it would make healing a bit less stressful imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gikk, take the spreadsheet and add in your mana preservation items and stuff. Go for it. I simply didn't take the calculation into the realm of worn effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah spiritblood, I don't know about your guild, but in mine they normally notice that they are dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wuddaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">range + cast time &gt; mana ratio for me.<br />
My direct heal is an emergency heal and in that case I need fast heal, not mana ratio effective heal.<br />
I don't play main healer in XP group in PoP zone I m xping in (can't beat mob dps).. <br />
And outside PoP zone I don't use Kragg if I m main healer.. Mob dps where I can be main healer is so low that quiescence + tnarg is enough usually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I maxxed out my healing AA, and have an Improved Healing IV face item.<br />
<br />
For me, Kragg's is a waste primarily because of the cast time and also because the healing AA doesn't do squat with it.<br />
<br />
I would guess an average heal of around 1700ish with Tnarg's. I also notice quite a few crit's, most of them for 3100+, with max being around 3385.<br />
<br />
I never really did any number crunching, but I suppose I could keep a log for a few days then go through it to get some hard numbers.<br />
<br />
For me Tnarg's &gt; Kragg's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Belor Pyle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">One more thing to think about is casting time.  I dont have any numbers but the extra 5-6 seconds needed to cast kraggs is time spent not cannoing/torporing which probably adds up to an extra 50 or so mana you loose from the extra seconds spent casting the bigger heal.  I dont have any numbers as Im to lazy but I hadnt seen the shorter casting time mentioned as of yet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On the flip side, once you get SCRM, torpor's 2100 hp for 200 mana.... :)<br />
<br />
Although this is only for casters who are not currently having the snot beaten out of them. I do torpor people who are getting aggo who shouldn't, as a warning to tone it down. Especially after I've asked them not to get aggro for the 3rd time.<br />
<br />
Some tanks dont understand the idea that assist does not mean ks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Kragg's mending is permenantly in the back of the book for me, has been ever since I hit 62 and scribed Tnarg's.<br />
<br />
I've taken it out ONCE since then...for a Grieg fight when we only had 1 cleric, I was doing a LOT of patch healing, and needed the efficiency (for myself if nobody else.../rude grieg AE that prevents torpor from landing). Now that I have some better AA, and the TT mask, Kragg's is permenantly un-memmed. The cast time, and inability to work with my focus/AA effects just isn't worth it.</div></div><hr />
