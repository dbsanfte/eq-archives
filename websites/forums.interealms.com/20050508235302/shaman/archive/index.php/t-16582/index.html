<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Let me first say I really like ldon. <br />
<br />
But being of the RL enforced casual gammer mold, these huge AP costs are a killer. <br />
<br />
Its going to take me a year to collect 1000 AP's in one camp, much less these people's suggestions that max faction in several camps won't be that hard.<br />
<br />
A huge difference to the casual gammer would have been 3 man dungeons and decent drops in the dungeon and longer running missions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, it doesn't supply the casual gamer with results immediately, but it does allow you to realistically expect to see armor that is of VT level without having to do the HoT --&gt; VT steps, which are quite extensive and would probably take a casual gamer (in a guild that somehow only worked while he was online) far longer to get to.<br />
<br />
<br />
   True, you won't get to be of incredible power anytime soon, but you will see some 100+hp slots in your gear one day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the idea is the casual gamer doesn't mind doing the work to get the stuff even if it takes a long time, usually the complaint was I don't have lots of time to play, which is addressed, and when I do have lots of time, the really good loot camps are always taken, which is addressed too.. <br />
<br />
Me thinks definetly lesser manned missions would be better for the casual, but their hardware can't handle it atm from what I hear, but longer time for missions would mean the missions are designed for longer play which would mean the causal gamer couldn't in their 2 hour block do it. <br />
<br />
Small guilds have benefited a lot from this expansion from what I've seen. At least with my guild, where we used to raid small targets all the time cause of nothing better to do before real raid time, we now play ldon, so that leaves a lot of targets up that normally would get slaughtered...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think a slightly longer mission would give the casual gammer more grouped time. To often I could have gotten in two missions but the re-assemble re-group between missions burned up my time.<br />
<br />
5 hours in a Public Tov = one nice piece of armor.<br />
<br />
180 (succesful) hours in ldon = one nice piece of armor.<br />
<br />
This does not benefit the casual gammer one bit. This reward situation is totally pointed at the Power gamer.<br />
<br />
I've heard that power gamers are complaining that casual players will get the same reward they get for Pot or VT. I can tell them have no fear Pot is no more out of reach for me than 1400 AP's are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ToV armor is more equal to the 760 armor.  Not the 1492 armor, which is better than ornate (minus effects).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Since when are you guaranteed to win a piece of armor during a 5 hour public ToV raid?<br />
<br />
If you are a casual gamer, your chance of getting VT or Elemental caliber loot was basically nil.   The chance of getting a nice piece of gear with perhaps regen 3 or FT 3 or a nice focus effect is now possible.<br />
<br />
Casual gamers have now gone from a nil to possible situation, sounds like an improvement to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How much XP would you expect for 5 hours in ToV though?  Doing an assasinate mission, normal difficulty, yielded about 10% of real xp @ 64 for me, with a group of 5.  Had a nice cloak drop also.   Add this to the fact that we didn't have to wait for the camp to open up, or worry about what everyone else in the zone was doing, and that all = happy casual gamer.<br />
<br />
There is also the fact that you APs don't go anywhere after you have earned them.  So at least everytime you do an adventure, it is going towards the day when you can save up enough to buy this stuff.  Sure it might take a while, but at least you don't have to get flagged, or spend a large amount of time at boring camps trying to get the pieces for a key to get there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">there is always somebody whining.  wah i wont ever get 1400 AP that is completly untrue.  I dont know what you want to just log online and have loot just magically appear in your inventory.  Are you the type of person who sits at home in front of the TV all day and expects money to materialize into your bank account?  You have to work for it, omg what a concept.  Things that are easy to get have no value.  Would you still be playing this game if in 3 months you could have all the loot you wanted, the aa skills, etc?  I would say not.  Because things that are too easy are boring.<br />
<br />
Casual players want to have good items too that are attainable without putting huge time into raiding, which requires playing 4-5 hours a night on average.  People want access to nice things that they can do in smaller guilds or simply because their guild cannot do to other guilds blocking or just being quicker to raid targets.  However this shouldnt be easy, if raid quality items are available then its going to take time to aquire those.  If you dont play very much or limited then its going to take even longer.  Deal with it.<br />
<br />
Sorry if that sounds overly harsh that is the way it is.<br />
<br />
You cannot argue that LDoN is perfect for small guilds and people who just like grouping.  You can do all the adventure missions with almost any combination of classes (except the hard missions, which require certain classes to be sucessful) and thet can be done in most cases in an hour or less.  There is no camp checks, get a mission you want you go to the dungeon.  No trains except those you do to yourself, no OOC or shouts from retarded spazes, just you your group and a variety of pretty interesting looking dungeons and resonable difficulty.  That sounds perfect for people who just have time for a quick session.  Ofcourse there are downsides, you cant leave in hte middle of an adventure or join late, but this is offset by them being short so either way you dont have to stay to much longer or wait to long to join up with friends already in one.  But honestly what Multiplayer game is?  If you have to get up every 10 minutes for whatever reasons then this kind of game probably isnt for you anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>NinthSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think they said somewhere that hard missions were going to be changed to 150 pts.. so  normal til you can attempt and maybe accomplish hard. 150x10 adventures = 1 new piece of armor for 6 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grunx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think LDoN great for the casual player. Yes it will take sometime to get to the good stuff. But consider the timesinks that raiding guilds had to go through to get to Emp/VT and the elementals. Seems pretty balanced to me.<br />
<br />
As a casual player I know I can log on at around 8pm do an adventure with guildies and/or friends have some fun and log off around 11pm after we are done.<br />
<br />
Add to that the 'glass ceiling' of what quality gear I could get, and what my very small offpeak guild could do became somewhat higher.<br />
<br />
It will take time to get all the LDoN upgrades I would like, but as long as I am having fun in adventures, I don't really care. The points will eventually take care of themselves.<br />
<br />
The 'timesinks' to the loot in LDoN is alot more fun than having to farming for VT shards in Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As a casual gamer who plays in the Aest(Australia est) evenings (translates to 4-5am USA time) this is a great expansion.<br />
I would never be able to raid for something that drops a 1500 point equivalent item, but now its just a matter of time.<br />
Sure I wont get it tomorrow, but I'm a patient person... I'll get it eventually (and have some fun and get some exp along the way).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">All depends on your definition of casul dont it, for me its 2 hours max, for you its more than that s a longer mission would screw me over as a 'casual gamer'<br />
<br />
As for it taking too long to get AP for a single camp, phooey, why would mediocre gamer ( &gt; casual &amp;&amp; &lt; Ubah) bother campign anywhere BUT ldon if getting items was that easy..<br />
What else do you want for free?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm guessing you are a casual gamer therefore the 5 hour camp in TOV is not acheivable for you anyway. So how can you compare, previously you had no chance of seeing this kind of loot, now you have a chance even playing only 2 hours at a time.<br />
<br />
I hate whiners, LDON is the best expansion yet.</div></div><hr />

LDoN is designed for the casual gamer and non-raiders in a sense that you can make progress without having to invest a large amount of time in one session.<br />
<br />
Designed for the casual gamer does not equal easy loot with little time.<br />
<br />
Even with dungeons having around 1 to 2 nameds up on average, there is some quite nice loot in there from drops alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to disagree. Outside of LDoN you can spend large amounts of time and still not get anything, due to bad luck or rude players. With LDoN you are guarenteed an item if you have the points, which is a huge improvement. I think after people get used to it, obtaining pts will not be as difficult as it is made out to be for casual players. <br />
<br />
They did, however, keep the time investment necessary so all is not for free. <br />

People in high level guilds with 16 hours a day to play EQ have exactly the same list of items to spend their APs on as the guy who plays 5 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

For the time it takes to get some of the LDoN gear someone in a decent raid guild would get much better much faster. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying raiding guilds shouldn't get good gear faster, 'cause I think they should.   It's just that this expansion is not what SoE led us to believe.   Hell,  I played the beta for a few weeks and didn't think it'd be like this.<br />
<br />
To me time spent for gear is time spent for gear.  I don't care if it's raiding or single grouping.  (As long as the raid gear is better than the single group, which from what I can tell it is)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The powergamer gets a choice of 3 games: relaxed play on 'normal mode', challenging play on 'hard mode', and uber play on 'raid mode'.<br />
<br />
The casual gamer gets 1 game choice: challenging on 'normal' mode.<br />
<br />
It seems  to me that LDoN was designed for the same set of players that SOE has always pandered to, and the casual gamer just got thrown another bone.<br />
<br />
Having said that, if it weren't for the timer I'd be pretty happy with LDoN.  It allows me to get away from the idiots and lowlife that infest my server.  Believe it or not there are lots of people in EQ who are pretty ghastly.  Admittedly most of them are just immature and rather moronic: the sort of people who characterise anyone expressing a complaint they disagree with as a 'whiner' or 'crybaby'.  I'm 45 years old: I can do without listening to playground taunts.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying really hard here not to say something like &quot;well, DUH!&quot;  People who play more and have a large pool of competent players to form group with consistently will progress faster.<br />
<br />
I can't even CONCEIVE of a system working any other way that doesn't completely trivialize achievements.  Before LDoN, a raiding player would get a lot more out of 40 hours played than a casual player (regardless of how much RW time passed.  In LDoN, if you both put in the same 40 hours, you're going to end up with the same reward -- something worth about 1000 points.</div></div><hr />

Wanna propose a situation that doesn't leave the Raid-Guild player with more options than the casual player?<br />
<br />
Can you come up with one, other than having SoE make a list of all raid-guilds and then blocking their members (both current and former to stop people from detaging long enough to play) for doing the content?<br />

Just one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This part isn't exactly true since the person with the top end raid gear will get 2-3x as many adventures done in that same 40 hours as the casual player will. I think almost everyone in the top 10 or so on my server is a current or former member of the top raiding guild. The better gear just lets them slice through the adventures and complete many more of them.</div></div><hr />

Well if you don't have the imagination:<br />
<br />
As it was for the casual player the first two options implemented should have been for casual player:<br />
<br />
Challenging play.<br />
Easy (casual play)<br />
<br />
Which would have given the uber player<br />
<br />
Easy play<br />
Very easy play.<br />
<br />
Which in effect would have given the uber player very little at all.  But then this expansion wasn't designed for him: it was designed for the majority of players in EQ (which isnt the same as the majority of posters on this board).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suggest you reconsider.  That would work out very well for me actually.  I could churn out adventure points much faster and AA points much faster and buy that kick ass LDoN loot much faster.<br />
<br />
Then people like you would complain that the LDoN expansion was made for powergamers not casual players ... oh wait that is what you are already doing.<br />
<br />
Not so easy to come up with a solution is it?<br />
<br />
I suppose they could let you play for a max of 2 hours a day in LDon but then of course the people that play for under 2 hours would complain or they would complain that the &quot;Uber&quot; people could do more missions than they could in the 2 hours ...<br />
<br />
Fact is the majority of EQ players will likely never do a &quot;Raid&quot; level mission and will likely never do a &quot;Hard&quot; mission.  In either case, it will definately not become the norm for the majority of EQ players.<br />
<br />
Like any expansion this was released to appeal to everyone ... the difference is they actually came even closer to succeeding in that goal this time :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Ok, more, but not THREE TIMES more by any means.  Even if you slice through things like a hot knife through butter, you're looking at at least a half hour in the dungeon at best.  I think the fastest I've ever done one was with 52 minutes left on the clock (assassinates can be the fastest with a well-placed boss near where you happen to be, or down a mostly-cleared path).  The travel time to the dungeon, from it, and to get everyone together can be the same.<br />
<br />
So people with existing better stuff kill faster?  Again... err, what kind of system can you conceive of where this ISN'T true?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I will still qualify, I like this expansion, I love the concept.<br />
<br />
The people giving me crap are power gamers no doubt, they're racing towards the big ticket items.<br />
<br />
But the fact of the matter is yes, I do want more reward with less time. I mean why do things have to take so much time? I sure as hell wouldn't go to work for 6 months before I got my first pay check.<br />
<br />
People saying they're patient I will get the new stuff in time, I say no you won't. You get one pieces thats it, then you'll be out of points and have to start all over again.<br />
<br />
Beating my original example to death but,<br />
Over the next 15 weeks, one night a week I will have a full set of ToV.<br />
If I spent that same amount of time in Ldon I would still be about 400 points away from buying my first piece.<br />
<br />
SoE's always had us grinding for xp, now we get to grind hard for loot too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now I'm getting real pessimistic but here's another prediction, <br />
<br />
All us casual gamers (all 10 of us) will be on our merry way with 600 AP's 3 or 5 months from now. And the power gamers will be done with Ldon and moved on and the huge glut of groups flying out of the adventure camps will be gone and we'll be stuck LFG with 600 worthless AP's, and people will inspect our level 65 toons and say man you have crapy gear, and we'll say thats cause I spend my 50's and 60s in ldon. hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">So, go to ToV and get your full set of wolfcaller's.  Heaven forbid that a casual gamer should have OPTIONS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i guess if you're the only chain wearer, or you're lucky with rolls you'll end up with a full set in 15 sessions...<br />
<br />
As for LDoN... i've played basically 3-4 hours a night (2 - 3 adventures depending on how fast we move), and I have 1150 points in just over a week... good enough for me... and I consider myself a slightly above casual player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wanna propose a situation that doesn't leave the Raid-Guild player with more options than the casual player? <br />
Incredibly easy: non-raid named mobs (e.g. BoT named)  in current expansion drops loot frequently that is just as good as the gear off the raid boss mobs of the previous expansion. Ez pz.  Ubers get the best gear 1 expansion ahead of the rest of the pack, not 3 years ahead of those who still can't get even NToV quality items.  <br />

I don't sweat my gear as I think my play makes up for it somewhat and I don't try to play above my capabilities. I have had more fun in this expansion than I have had in a long time.

And the power gamers will be done with Ldon and moved on and the huge glut of groups flying out of the adventure camps will be gone and we'll be stuck LFG with 600 worthless AP's, and people will inspect our level 65 toons and say man you have crapy gear, and we'll say thats cause I spend my 50's and 60s in ldon. hehe<br />
<br />
I think you're grossly overestimating the percentage of the population that is powergamers.  I think that's a relatively small percentage...I think most people (myself included) are casual gamers.  Of course, casual for one person is power gaming to another.  For me it's about 10 hours/wk.  <br />
<br />
Also, how many power gamers do you group with now?  For me the total is 1, and that's pretty rare because he's normally off on some guild thing.  Let's face it, you don't become a power gamer by playing with less experienced (although not necessarily newb) gamers.  Power gamers group with power gamers.  So, when they leave ldon you haven't lost any of you available groupies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Winteris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I'm a casual gamer -- two, three nights a week, two to four hours tops. (If I'm broke or have a quiet week I might stay home and play a little more.) <br />
<br />
LDON is giving me what I really needed to enjoy the game. I can go into a dungeon, have a set time limit, no nasty corpse runs (although I was lost in epic proportions running around Lesser Fay the other night after a wipe) make just fantastic experience for my level range (my shaman is only 24 right now, and in a group of 4 or 5 I can make 1/3 to 1/2 a level on a successful mission with some play-hunting afterwards). <br />
<br />
The drops have been sparse (five missions so far, three unimpressive magic items have dropped outside of the vendor stuff, plus two really basic augmentations) but after we ML and split, I've walked away with 40 to 100 pp a mission. That's great spell money at my level, and it's also great for picking up some very basic gear too (I was still using fungal fiend stuff on my back and shoulders until last night, did a mission, was able to pick up 50 HP's worth of items for those two spots in the bazaar afterwards). <br />
<br />
I'm not looking to be super-equipped (although I wouldn't complain one bit if I was). I'm really just looking to be an efficient group member, have a good time, and meet some good people. Now that folks are getting into the groove of grouping in LDON that hefty set-up time is shrinking and I'm having a blast. Before this expansion I was really just hanging on to EQ because of my friends. Now I truly enjoy playing again.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">I am somewhat surprised that people think it will take a long time to accumulate points in one camp (ie: &quot;a year&quot;).<br />
<br />
The maximum item value is currently ~1500 points.  At 51 points per success, that is 30 victories.  Now let's assume that you have very bad luck and only win half your adventures; that would mean it would take you 1 month if you do two adventures a day.  Or 2 months if you do one adventure a day.  That is definitely some work, but hardly an obscene amount considering the reward. <br />
<br />
In actuality, once people get better at the dungeons you can assume you will probably win more often than not and so the time required to accumulate the points will become lower.<br />
<br />
Most players are less casual than that (without being hardcore).  You might win once a night, on weekdays, then 6 times on saturday/sunday.  In 3 weeks, you could have your first piece of armour.   <br />
<br />
It has to be a tough thing to balance.  If they make the item values too low, then people like me would get their items very quickly.  I play alot; I win 2-3 times a night on weeknights, and expect to win around 12 times on weekends.  (No, I do not define myself as a casual player -- but heh, I also don't play 24/7.)  That would be around 1500 points in a week, if I decide to do it.  That isn't exacly the longest lasting expansion.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I suggest you reconsider. That would work out very well for me actually.

Then people like you would complain that the LDoN expansion was made for powergamers not casual players ... oh wait that is what you are already doing.<br />
<br />
Not so easy to come up with a solution is it?<br />
<br />
Nope: with my scheme ubers get two choices of things to do (instead of 3), I get two choices of things to do (instead of 1), seems like I now get a fair deal. Plus instead of expending effort on the (ubers only) raid feature, more effort is available to make 'normal' adventures more varied. They could even add a new adventure type - dungeon crawl - in which the instance stays open for double the normal length and you get adventure points per area cleared instead of by timer.<br />
<br />
I find it odd that you think my scheme would have worked out so well for yourself. I'd have thought it rather worse than what you actually got. But as you assure meThat would work out very well for me actually<br />
<br />
that makes it all the more unreasonable that SOE didn't choose somthing like my solution rather than their own - obviously uber-orientated - one.</div></div><hr />

The people giving me crap are power gamers no doubt, they're racing towards the big ticket items.<br />

<br />
You people knocking the thread starter aren't seeing ithe the same way obviously because you're probably in a decent raiding guild already. <br />
<br />
Believe or not some of us aren't powergamers or raiders.  Some of us appreciate the time investment required compared to the raiding counterparts.  While I haven't really raided consistently before, I am certainly aware that there is a huge amount of time involved to get to say Vex Thall, not only in the keying but in the progression in general from starting at the very bottom in raiding at Kunark and working your way up there.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't enjoy being lumped into a category of &quot;Casual gamers want everything easier and with less time&quot; which I seem to see to frequently of late.  Thus, I feel the need to speak my voice.<br />
<br />
LDoN gives those of us who choose not to raid whether because we do not like raiding or we can not commit the time involved another option, which many of us are grateful for.<br />
<br />
If you think ToV quest armor is just as good as LDoN armor, then by all means go back to that, especially if you think you can get hold of a piece once every 5 hours.</div></div><hr />

KEI generation has nothing to do with it seeing as how I leveled one shaman to 60 before luclin and a 2nd shaman (I quit EQ and came back when luclin came out) to 45 or so before I even knew what kei was.<br />
<br />
The only flaw in this game in my opinion is that powergamer = time put in the game and not necessarily skill involved.    A great guild isn't necessarily full of the most skilled players.  They're full of the people willing to spend the most time.  Need a great guild leader/raid leader/etc. but other than that ya need people who know how to read (follow directions).  I can verify this just by PKing, I've seen some really stupid people with much better gear than me go down from their own mistakes.<br />
<br />
What is so bad about people who know what they're doing being able to get nice gear (not as nice as raid gear) in about the same amount of time as a raider would get?   I haven't done any EP/VT or greater raids, but I've done everything below EPs/VT and I know using DKP people will see better gear than LDoN gear much sooner.    If a guild spends a couple months in VT they'll get 60 people a lot of nice gear, if a group spends a couple months in LDoN they'll get one to three people a piece of gear or two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Point(tm) that you 100% continue to evade, is that for many &quot;Casual&quot; players, 60 man raiding is not an option, and for them VT or HoT or ANY gear that is available to RAID crows is not now, and will NEVER be an option for them. Glass Ceiling. Period.<br />
<br />
Now they have an option, that supports the playstyle of a couple hours at a time, in odd time zones, or odd play hours. Those people for whom raiding is not a choice, can still look forward to a 100hps/mana breastplate.. (or more with some augs in it).<br />
<br />
Those same people before LDoN could look forward Tae Ew gear as the best they would ever wear. Now they can xp, and progress without the TIME INVESTMENT(YES the man hour investment and 8 hour stretch VT raids with 60 people). Yes they must invest time, NO they do not need to invest it in huge chunks, they can chip away at it gradually, in a more sanely managable way for a casual player.<br />
<br />
Many casual players understand and accept this. Then there is the flip side, &quot;Im a casual gamer so I should have all my gear handed to me on a silver platter types.&quot; They arent really casual games, they are time constrained power gamers. There is a huge difference.</div></div><hr />

If a person has the time to do 2 or 3 adventures a day (as some of you say is &quot;all  you have to do&quot;) they would surely have the time to do a raid or two a day.  I'm one of these people.  I could go back to my guild if I wanted to, but I like solo'ing or one grouping more.

My most uber item is a CT belt, most of the rest is TOV quest armor or bought from the bazaar.  My gear is actually pretty substandard, but what i have i worked hard for.  Yet when I group with those time or elemental enabled people, all I hear is: &quot;damn you are a good sham&quot;.  My message is this:  learn your class, read boards, incorporate ideas that you see. You WILL become better.  People will toss you on their friends list, and you will be put into those smooth sailing groups.

Unfortunately many people are missing the point, and it follows what Gloriana mentioned: options. Casual gamers, and those that refused to join uber guilds, had no options to get anything decent. Fine. Now they have the option to get really nice stuff, they are just going to have to invest more time than uber guild members. <br />
<br />
Is this fair? I believe so, because if you dont want to spend say 4hrs a night raiding, or wake up at random hours to whack something then you really are cut out of some of the best gear in the game. With LDoN you are guaranteed _something_ it is just going to cost you more time. I dont see the problem here.<br />
<br />
If you want a set of 180hp items, spend a few months in PoTime. Dont want to do that, spend 1yr xping in LDoN. Dont want to do that, get a good group and pharm HoT. Options.....<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT&gt; I should point out the fallacy here is thinking everyone will go for the 1500pt armor, that would be dumb. It would be like skipping HoT\VT and going for elemental because Elemental is 'the best.' If I were starting over I would balance 750pt armor with HoT\Bazaar armor. You will increase your classes power much quicker than outfitting in 1500pt armor with augments.<br />

No, I'm not &quot;uber,&quot; I'm not in a high end raiding guild. I hear lots of whining about how ubers get this and that. Well, bottom line is, they earned it. They sit in front of that monitor for hours every day, 5-7 days a week to get what they have. They have a high-powered guild behind them getting all the &quot;phat lewt&quot; because they all spend the time. Frankly, I'd be mad as hell if I put that kind of time in to get matched by some 5 hour a week toon. If you want the same gear, put in the same time, show the dedication they do. Its not for me, and maybe I won't see tier 2 before I quit, but I don't hold a grudge against those that push for the high end either. They pay just as much as I do to play, get what you want out of it.<br />

LOL, this made me laugh a lot.     WHY SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEND 10x MORE TIME FOR LDON GEAR?   Why?   Why?  Why?   There is no good, reasonable, sane answer.   This goes for the uberest of powergamers to the most casual 1 hour a week player.  It doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Are you really saying that it's ok to have to spend so much time doing LDoN if you don't want to sit at your desk for 5 hours straight raiding or getting up at 5am or some odd hour to catch a rare spawn?

<br />
...Except that that would favor the powergamer over the casual player far more than the current system does, as the powergamers would both get more points per mission and be able to complete more missions in a given span of time.  <br />

I have yet to hear one valid, logical complaint about the system itself.  You think that just because you (or someone) pays the same 12.95 a month that I do, you should have the same gear?

Im in a raiding guild so I guess I am a powergamer.  I think that you are misrepresenting the time needed to invest to get to these &quot;uber loot&quot; places,  VT, Elementals, Potime.<br />
<br />
I joined my current guild in December. Before this i was in a fairly mid-level guild.  But since the release of PoP when I became an app, we starting doing heaving raiding for the ultimate goal of gaining access to PoTime which we achieved in June.  This required 4-5 hours a day of raiding, up to 7 days a week.  I didnt attend every raid but I was at a good portion of them.  During this time peroid I have recieved on average 1 loot item per month.  We are on DKP, I have been in Loot Council guild too and I am pretty sure it was about the same then too, maybe a little less, more like 1 loot every 6 weeks.  Its just easier to check using a DKP system.  So if we figure the following:<br />
<br />
4 Hours a day over an average of 30 days in a month  =  120 hours for 1 piece of loot<br />
<br />
Now take the casual gamer in LDoN, or as you call yourself the borderline hardcore gamer.  Im not sure what that means.  How much does that mean you play?  Does a borderline hardcore player win 2 missions a night on average?  I am only going to figure for people who are 65.  It isnt all that hard to get level 65.  So I am going to account for 51 points a win.  Now alot of the augments and nice armor ive seen has all been around 1400 APs to purchase.  A normal adventure takes roughly an hour to finish.  I know alot of people who are not hardcore who play more than an hour, I dont think its a stretch for someone to win atleast 1 adventure a day.  So....<br />
<br />
1 Adventure Victory a day at 51 points in an average 30 day month = 1530 APs.<br />
<br />
Lets say you have to do 2 Adventures to get one victory.  Average of 1 hour per, thats  60 hours over the month.  I want everyone to think about their play time if you consider yourself a casual or non hardcore gamer.  It is way easy for you to be playing alot more than you think you are.<br />
<br />
So basically you can get 1 loot a month (same as me in my uber guild) with half the time invested in the same time peroid.  Now the loot is not as good as what I am getting, which is as it should be imo.  There has to be rewards for doing the really hard raid level mobs.  Also since you can get loot with less time invested in a raid it shouldnt be as good either.  You can say what you want about LDoN but it is NOT that difficult.  A normal mission doing assinate or rescue or slaughter can be very easy, depending on the dungeon you get.  <br />
<br />
If you are a heavy player but you just dont like to raid, your guild is blocked by lots of other guilds ahead of you, or whatever reason you could get addition loots or augments to make those items close to raid level items with the same time investment.<br />
<br />
I just dont see the problem here.  It appears to me that your basically on the same footing with raid people in regards to getting a good loot item, over the same time peroid.  A lower leveled person is goign to take even longer to get those items, IMO thats not a bad thing either.  Gloriana put is well, now you have more options.  You can raid and you have a group option.  This is unfair how exactly?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">I saw this ridiculious comment after I had just posted.<br />
<br />
 If a guild spends a couple months in VT they'll get 60 people a lot of nice gear, if a group spends a couple months in LDoN they'll get one to three people a piece of gear or two. <br />
<br />
2 months would probably net those 60 people 2-3 items each.  Assuming they had no competition for spawns and did a full spawn each week.  <br />
<br />
A group, investing the same time as it would to clear VT over that period could get the same number of items from APs.  The entire group!    There is a reason why raiding will net you so much loot, because raiding requires alot of people who require rewards for the time they are putting into the game too.  Everyone on that group is getting the same number of points (assuming they are same level or close to it)  So EVERYONE could get themselves the same number of items because they all have the APs to buy them.  That statement is so completly false to be downright ignorant.</div></div><hr />

You now have the chance to obtain Elemental level gear, choose your own focus effects to put in it, and all you have to do is put in time, at your own pace, without benefit of any guild, key, raid, or flag. What is is EXACTLY you are complaining about? <br />
<br />
Not only that, but this is the expansion that has finally brought SKILL back into the game. Maybe your problem is you suck at playing a SHaman, and word is getting around, and you cant find groups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u64"><b>Zorarian Kly`Lin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p64">LOL, this made me laugh a lot.     WHY SHOULD PEOPLE HAVE TO SPEND 10x MORE TIME FOR LDON GEAR?   Why?   Why?  Why?   There is no good, reasonable, sane answer.   This goes for the uberest of powergamers to the most casual 1 hour a week player.  It doesn't make any sense.<br />
<br />
Are you really saying that it's ok to have to spend so much time doing LDoN if you don't want to sit at your desk for 5 hours straight raiding or getting up at 5am or some odd hour to catch a rare spawn?  You don't see how weird your logic is?   If not, you've got more issues than I'll dare say on this board.<br />
<br />
If you can get a full suit of 1492pt armor with augments in similar time as a full visible suit of PoTime gear then there wouldnt be much reward for the time and risk of actually getting up to PoTime, or elementals. I am saying if you want the easy road, which LDoN definately is, expect a longer trip to the end game.<br />
<br />
Someone quoted 720ish wins on normal to get a full suit with augments of 1492 gear and thus take a year or so of 2 games a night. Perhaps this is way excessive on that extent (VI has never been good on making palatable time sinks) but it is a definate change from before, where you had no chance as a casual gamer of getting +100hp gear. <br />
<br />
Besides, if your focus in this game is to get a full suit of LDoN gear then you are twisted. There are easier ways without joining an uberguild to acquire great items with little effort.<br />
<br />
What is so hard to understand?<br />

There may be still another tier or so to be discovered on the adventure merchants, but it is looking increasingly unlikely based on peoples reports.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">When you raid, it takes much less time to obtain items.<br />
It's also much riskier.<br />
Farming points on normal mode is a joke in LDoN.<br />
It's way too easy.<br />
The fastest way to really good gear is by raiding.<br />
It always has been and probably always will be.<br />
But, until now, casual gamers haven't ever been able to even acquire the top of the line gear.<br />
Casual gamers have never had the chance to do stuff like go to PoTime or the elemental planes.<br />
Now, by just doing 2 adventures a day for a year (that's about 3-4 hours a day playing) they can get a full visible suit of elemental plane/vt quality gear.<br />
Never before has gear of that quality even been an OPTION for casual gamers.<br />
This expansion seems tailor made for the casual gamer.<br />
<br />
-short adventures from group makeup to completion.  Adventures take about 60 minutes on average to complete with about 30 minutes of forming a group and buffing and travel time.  If you can't handle being logged in for 90 minutes as a casual gamer, just why are you playing EQ again?<br />
-advancement given for doing what you would be doing anyway.  I remember xping for hours in Karnors, Seb, Akheva, The Deep, etc.  That was just dungeon crawling for xp.  Now you get to do the exact same thing (dungeon crawling) but not only do you get xp, you also get points to buy huge gear upgrades.<br />
-easy to see how soon until your next gear upgrade.  When you raid, you never know when or what item you will win next.  When you spend points and acquire points in LDON, you know exactly how many more successes you'll need before you can afford to buy something.  You know exactly how much effort you need for your rewards.  It's basicly DKP for xping as opposed to raiding.<br />
-gear being available that's never been available ever to casual gamers.  How many casual gamers are there with Elemental Plane and Time loot?  There aren't any unless they have friends in very high places.  You just don't see people going &quot;/ooc Elemental Silk arms rotting in PoFire.  Send tell to get raided in to loot it&quot; in PoK and PoTranq.  The best that really casual gamers can hope to get is stuff like Vindy gear and Velious Royalty gear and epics and possibly something from Ssra.  Now they can get equipment with +120 hp or +120 mana mods on it and very good stats in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't consider playing 3-4 hours a day as being casual... that is 1/6th of my day and when you consider most people sleep 6-8 hours a night that means its even more then 1/6th... more like 1/4th... I wish I had that kind of time to play, but i don't... My wife would kill me if I played that much.  Maybe when my son gets older and addicted to EQ(and if he's anything like his dad he will be) then I might have that kind of time to play.  I would consider casual gaming as 1-2 hours 3 to 4 days a week.  Put in those terms LDoN is not for the casual gamer.  However if they made it that easy for the casual gamer to get armor equivalent to VT(which I know I will never see in my lifetime) then Raiding would become extinct and that can't happen because of all the time and energy the uber-gamers have put into it.  <br />
<br />
I remember back to the days of Kunark when it took me(again this is 1-2 hours a day 3 to 4 days a week) 2 weeks to gain a level, and now I have gone from 35-45 in a month (my main is at 49 and half way thru his epic at the momment).  In my opinion EQ has already come a long way to equalizing the playing field between the &quot;casual gamer&quot; and the uber-gamer, but it will never be equal or even close to equal.  For me EQ is great now.  I was very frustrated before because I didn't feel like I was getting anywhere, and now I can see the progress bar inching along.  I have no complaints about the way EQ is set up, I only wish I could play more, but in the end RL is far more important then EQ and thus Fanedan will always creep a long at a snails pace while the rest of the EQ world fly's by him... and for me that is OK</div></div><hr />

Do you honestly think that if nobody on this board didn't take this seriously that this board would even exist? Why bother sifting through thousands of threads, some people here with a few thousand posts themselves, for something they really don't give a damn about? <br />
<br />
People generally don't like listening to whiners. One of the biggest things I hate about EQ is that so many whiners continue to play it even when they say it sucks, its unbalanced, Sony/Verant blows, this is bugged, I got whacked with the nerfbat, I want I want I want.<br />
<br />
The problem is, you're a hater. You're jealous. You want what they have, and you feel entitled to it. You pay 12.95 a month just like they do, right? Well, some of them pay for two or three or four accounts. <br />
<br />
Think of the 13 bucks as an entry fee at an amusement park. You pay to get in, what you do is up to you. Sony only operates the rides, they won't make you get on it though. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm no powergamer, nowhere near &quot;uber.&quot; I have my fun though, just like they have theirs. I'm certainly not envious of the time required for them to have their fun either. Just like in RL, it is ingame as well, you get what you work for and to insert my favorite quote from this board to date, &quot;but thou shall not b1tch.&quot; You will get exactly what you earn, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

That doesnt look anywhere near the same quality. Yet you have the silly idea that is ok that it should take a year to get even if you play 3-4 hours each and every day. No casual gamer in their right mind would do that and if in a year you can show me even one casual gamer that got this I owe you a beer :P<br />
<br />
If this latest expansion was supposed to be the ultimate casual-player-expansion I think SoE will see that it failed miserably in a few months. Any upgrades that are even remotely useful to a casual level 65 player will still take eons to get. I'm just hoping it can keep my interest in EQ until WoW gets released.

<br />
I dont know if this was intended but its actually a very essential observation. What if I got a full suit of elemental armor? Would I actually be able to do anything else than what I am doing now? Maybe - maybe not. The current high-end of EQ is so focused on huge masses of people raiding one specific mob that no amount of super-duper equipment will allow anyone else to succeed against that. So at some point in EQ you reach a point where you can still marginally improve your gear but it wont really matter since you wont be able to succeed against the next level mobs if you are a casual single-group player. So in my opinion LDoN is certainly not as rosy a future for casual players as some of you like to make it out to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Shrug ... nothing is a rosy future for the &quot;casual gamer&quot; because the fact of the matter is that if you play the game more you get more out of it ... that is the way games work.<br />
<br />
If you play the game casually then you get less out of it ... that is the way games work.<br />
<br />
Nothing can be done that will allow the &quot;casual gamer&quot; to do as well as a powergamer in ANY game because anything challenging is set up to reward people that put in more time.  The powergamer will ALWAYS get more out of a game than the casual gamer with respect to &quot;loot&quot;<br />
<br />
In LDoN you can purchase VexThal level equipment by playing casually.  The largest arguement has been:<br />
<br />
I will put in the same amount of hours as a powergamer but in smaller blocks and I want the same reward and LDoN has implemented this.<br />
<br />
People think uber raiding guilds gain equipment like rain and the fact of the matter is that if you join an endgame guild then your equipment will get upgraded quickly because you will gain a bunch of equipment you are not in competition with anyone for and yet is still an upgrade for you.<br />
<br />
However those people established in a raiding guild average 1 piece of decent equipment every month UNLESS they play insane hours.  Even in an Uber guild there are tiers of players.  Taking the 10 people on a server that rake in the loot because they play EQ 16 hours a day and saying you should have access to that level of equipment for equal effort is stupid because you cannot EVER match their level of effort.<br />
<br />
Realistically your &quot;average&quot; uber guild member will get an upgrade every 1 to 1.5 months.  Will you get it faster than this from older content?  Yes ... basically because it is older content and thus easier now.<br />
<br />
Will you get equipment slower than this from new content?  Yes ... basically because you have to learn the newer content and jump thru the timesink hoops to get the end game loot.<br />
<br />
What you fail to realize is that &quot;uber guilds&quot; go through cycles like everyone else.<br />
<br />
When a new expansion is released you stop farming the previous expansion and gear up for the new expansion.  For the next 6+ months you bleed and die reducing encounters to farmable ... you do not actually stick around and farm them because you are fighting to reach the top of the expansion.  Loot is scare because you are focusing on beating the next boss rather than farming the last.  You die in droves daily.<br />
<br />
Eventually you break the end game zone open then you bleed and die for another month to beat it.<br />
<br />
Finally after investing a huge amount of time bleeding an dying to accomplish all of the necessary tasks you reduce the latest expansion to farm status and loot starts rolling out faster.<br />
<br />
Of course with the &quot;grass is always green&quot; mentality you only see the &quot;golden&quot; times when uber guilds are farming and fail to account for all the time it takes to farm VexThal keys for your entire guild while 6 other guilds are fighting you for those same key pieces or dying for a month on the Emp of Ssra until you finally manage to take him down.  Or dying in VexThal for 2 months until you finally make it to Atan Ha Ra and reduce the zone to farm status.<br />
<br />
You completely discount the 6 months it takes to get to the end game zone and reduce it to farming status.  The countless hours farming keys or backflagging members of your guild in POP or fighting with other guilds for content.  You automatically wish to compare yourselves with the dozen or so people on each server that actually get access to all the things you claim everyone has access to.<br />
<br />
The average raiding guild member is not fully decked in time gear ... the high play raiding guild members are not even all decked in time gear.  The amount of time it takes to get a full set of elemental is staggering once you include all of the previous actions it takes to even get there let alone the drop rate of the rarer pieces.<br />
<br />
Then you complain that you cannot accomplish the same thing with your equipment as the people that play 16 hours a day with your mere 2 hours a day and claim it is unfair.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is ... EVERY player of Everquest has access to the same content ... EVERY SINGLE ONE ... if you choose to play 2 hours a day then so be it, that is your choice.  I could care less about why you play 2 hours a day ... it is your choice to do so.  Just as it is the choice of the people to play 16 hours a day.<br />

<br />
There is no need to justify this, because it is so untrue as to be laughable.<br />
<br />
Casual gamers do not spend 8+ hours a day doing adventures. The 97 adventures PER PIECE that a maximized LDoN armor piece requires, represents MONTHS of real life time for an actual casual player.<br />
<br />
If you want to get all upset about unguilded/small guilded powergamers getting this gear without a raid, well T_T for joo!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">First off, unlike many who have responded, I like this thread. :) It's an opportunity to see many different perspectives (which is what message boards are made for, yes?). We see a casual gamer explain what parts of the expansion's design he doesn't like and then we see other casual gamers (as well as some so-called &quot;hardcore&quot; or &quot;uber&quot; players) state why they disagree.<br />
<br />
Gloriana, I don't see anything unusual about Doleck's claim regarding armor drops in ToV. Think about it. Back when it was new (and heck, even when I was doing it 18 months ago), you didn't kill as many mobs as quickly as folks can do now. More mobs killed = potentially more armor drops. Plus, nowadays HoT is done with like 1-2 groups. Add more folks and you can set up in many parts of the area (not just at the door) and pull even more mobs or crawl it easily from both sides. heh I've even heard of Dozekar being duoed (SK+cleric).<br />
<br />
Rorgg, travel time is not a problem since everyone in the group DOES NOT have to be at the camp to get the adventure (or have they changed that since release day?). If everyone's at the dungeon entrance and you send a gate-capable person to get the adventure (Wizard or druid works best for Rujarkian adventures at the burrow in SRo, btw), all they have to do is get back to the group and you can chain-farm adventure points. So if folks want to farm adventure points, there's always a way to do so. I'm told a Ranger with a Tolan's BP works great in concert with a wizard for Mistmoore adventures (bind at BB camp, do MM adventure, TL ranger back to get new adventure, click BP...).<br />
<br />
Trezl, drop rates in ToV changed long ago. I remember when my guild at the time was farming there (18 months ago). We saw 3 chain BPs in one day (Kaison got the first, I got the second, and a ranger got the third). Didn't seem all that rare though I will admit it seemed to go in spurts (one trip you'd get crap drops, one trip armor would rain from the sky, etc). Nowadays with 5 more levels + 1 year of PoP xp + 2 expansions worth of AAs, even if the drop rates weren't increased, the increase in kill rate would make more armor drop. 15 weeks for a full set? I got mine (minus the gaunts and bracers since I didn't want them) in less time than that, a year and a half ago.<br />
<br />
I agree with Abynormal to an extent. Yes, casual gamers far exceed powergamers in sheer numbers. However, EQ's powergamers are free marketing for Sony. They keep (alot of) players playing to chase the carrots that they see posted on various guild sites. If it came to a moment of truth where Sony had to definitively decide who they're targeting EverQuest towards, you better believe the powergamers would be left out in the cold (since Sony, as a company, is going to go after the market segment that's more likely to feed them the most profit). But they don't have to do that since they have the best of both worlds right now. Be kind to your powergamers though.

<br />
I'm a casual gamer -- two, three nights a week, two to four hours tops. (If I'm broke or have a quiet week I might stay home and play a little more.) <br />
<br />
LDON is giving me what I really needed to enjoy the game. I can go into a dungeon, have a set time limit, no nasty corpse runs (although I was lost in epic proportions running around Lesser Fay the other night after a wipe) make just fantastic experience for my level range (my shaman is only 24 right now, and in a group of 4 or 5 I can make 1/3 to 1/2 a level on a successful mission with some play-hunting afterwards). <br />
<br />
The drops have been sparse (five missions so far, three unimpressive magic items have dropped outside of the vendor stuff, plus two really basic augmentations) but after we ML and split, I've walked away with 40 to 100 pp a mission. That's great spell money at my level, and it's also great for picking up some very basic gear too (I was still using fungal fiend stuff on my back and shoulders until last night, did a mission, was able to pick up 50 HP's worth of items for those two spots in the bazaar afterwards). <br />
<br />
I'm not looking to be super-equipped (although I wouldn't complain one bit if I was). I'm really just looking to be an efficient group member, have a good time, and meet some good people. Now that folks are getting into the groove of grouping in LDON that hefty set-up time is shrinking and I'm having a blast. Before this expansion I was really just hanging on to EQ because of my friends. Now I truly enjoy playing again.<br />
<br />
And this is exactly why I'm going to (finally) get LDoN for Amorae's account. I can't play as much as I have in the past (YAY 120+ hr work weeks) and I can't sleep any less than I currently am (which is where about a third of my EQ playtime came from) so when I log in, I want to get as much done as I possibly can. Right now, that means levelling Amorae as quickly as possible (since my xp bar IS my fun meter now whereas raiding was before). I've never worried much about loot, I just wanna kill stuff :p From what I've read and been told by friends, this is the expansion that would allow me to do that. Given the gear available from merchants, this means I won't have to worry about what my DKP balance is or will be after X amount of time. I won't have to worry about who's hoarding points looking to get an item I'm interested in. That I like :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u78"><b>Zanithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p78">Actually, powergamers drive the game.  The top 2% of the people playing EQ are catered to because if they leave others will follow.<br />
<br />
It has been that way in the 14 years I have been playing online games.  Once the powergamers leave to pursue something different and do not return your game is at phase one of death.  Over time more and more people will trickle out until nothing is left.<br />
<br />
It is not that people &quot;need&quot; powergamers, although there is a little of that as well, powergamers are the ones who find the new games and the new challenges.  If you can keep your &quot;powergamers&quot; happy and in your &quot;world&quot; then it is a great indicator that others will stay as well.<br />
<br />
If your powergamers all vanish to a new game then that game is a better game that EQ and will spell its death.<br />
<br />
So as long as SOE can keep the powergamer interested (2% of the player base) they have a clear indicator of the health of their game.<br />
<br />
It is essentially a focus group, why do you think high end guilds get specific invitations to betas, not only in EQ but in other games as well.<br />

<br />
Just to restate, there is no guarantee that anyone will receive a drop in ToV in 5 hours.  First the item has to drop, then the player has to win it (in my experience, the other shaman, rogues and rangers don't graciously step aside just because you expect to win an item every 5 hours).  If you earn points in adventures, you are guaranteed the opportunity to buy the item of your choice.<br />
<br />
Options.  You can choose to raid ToV, you can choose to accrue points (while at the same time getting decent exp and some nice cash drops).</div></div><hr />

And I want whiners like you to get a clue.  Why do you deserve the same items with none of the same effort as people who spend the time for raiding?  This arguement I pay the same per month as you uber people do holds no water.  Thats like saying I have a job and I should make the same money as you do, even though you work part time and I am working 100 hour weeks.

<br />
Pretty sure I never said this, and if I implied it, my apologies. The whole point here is that now casual players can get VERY good loot simply by continuing to do what they have been doing, playing EQ. LDoN is basically a time = equiptment system that is much more defined than the &quot;raid&quot; time = equiptment one. You play, you will earn gear. The more you play, the more you will earn. The less you play, the slower it will come. Sounds completely fair and logical to me.<br />
<br />
So at some point in EQ you reach a point where you can still marginally improve your gear but it wont really matter since you wont be able to succeed against the next level mobs if you are a casual single-group player. So in my opinion LDoN is certainly not as rosy a future for casual players as some of you like to make it out to be.<br />
<br />
Um, where was the casual gamer headed BEFORE LDoN? No where, and fast. Ornate they could buy by farming mass quantities of pp or getting lucky on a roll. I ask again, man, WHAT DO YOU WANT! My gosh, if the game is burned out for you, then find a new game. Don't sit here and whine because you can't obtain EP or Time level stuff without dedicating huge chunks of your life to the game. Buy yourself an 1100 BP and stick a couple 760 augs in it and smile and be happy. Either that, or look on eBay. I bet a couple grand can get you an account with a lot of the gear you want. Either way, I don't care, I just hope your not expecting to see SUPER high end loot dropping off Moss Snakes any time soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont think I said anywhere that I thought I should get Elemental or Time equipment. I'm just noting that for casual gamers this expansion loot-wise isnt gonna empower them to do things they couldnt do before.<br />
<br />
It might still be a good expansion for a while since it is exciting to crawl through a dungeon within a timelimit and the exp seems ok too. But the few pieces of loot that would be a considerable upgrade for a level 65 with otherwise decent equipment seem far too expensive timewise for me. The only thing I have seen so far that looks OK is a Spell Haste IV augment. That would definately help but on the other hand it would probably be easier/faster to set up some raids on the PoP mobs that drop items with this effect.<br />
<br />
if the game is burned out for you, then find a new game<br />
<br />
You are certainly right that I reached that stage where I dont really care anymore. So I am very much looking for a new game. Im hoping WoW will be good - atleast it will be hard pressed to be worse than EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Zorarian Kly`Lin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">The elemental suit was also listed without effects. Let me list the ones on the shaman elemental armor too and you tell me if it looks even remotely the same quality:<br />
<br />
Boots: Preservation of Xegony - Decrease Spell Mana Cost by 15%<br />
Bracer (x2): Flowing Thought IIX - Increase Mana by 8 per tick<br />

The one difference Elemental armor and Time armor will always have over anything LDoN offers will be the focus\innate effects. LDoN offers some nice ones, but nothing close to those you listed. I was speaking more to the raw hps\mana, which is well above what was previously available outside of raiding.<br />
<br />
I still think it is silly to make your goal of acquiring a full suit of high end LDoN armor with augments. It is better to get a few pieces and fill the rest of your inventory with easier items that are widely available.<br />

  Isn't that just you all being incredibly myopic: the fact that it suits a playing style that is certainly not casual is a pretty good clue here.<br />
It also seems to suit a playing style that is casual.  Do you not see tons of casual players in the dungeons, looking for ldon groups and talking about how much fun it is?  Go take a look at all the other zones that used to be chock full of players, casual and hardcore alike, at all hours of the day.  OMGZ!  There's nobody there, is there?  But whereever could they be?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">Finally someone has made some SOLID casual gamer points on this thread. Thanks Crusty. I will try to address them for you as I see it. <br />
<br />
I think that when SOE tells us that an expansion is orientated towards casual players it should be - orientated towards casual players. <br />
<br />
While I agree that not all of LDoN is oriented toward the casual player, the main core of the expansion most absolutely is. Hard level and Raids are most certainly aimed at the powergamer crowd. However, there is still a large portion of the expansion that caters to the casual guy. Normal adventures are ridiculously easy for people with raid-quality gear, but they are also not too hard for moderately equipted folks either, as long as they have skill in their classes. SOE had to make concessions to the high end players in this expansion. The whole flag thing in PoP is somewhat of a disaster at the Elemental level, with most servers having 1 or 2 guilds in Time and then 3 or 4 fighting for spawns and molds in the Ele planes. Its a massive bottleneck, to say the least. LDoN attempts to alliviate some of this with the Hard level adventure and the Raid feature. <br />
<br />
Explain to me how why there's a raid option for uber guild players, but no mini dungeon option for soloers.<br />
<br />
I cannot argue with you one bit. I agree 100% that the expansion should have a solo, duo, and tri-player feature. A lot of casual gamers are mostly soloers. Some even 2 and 3 box (yes, you can 3 box and be considered &quot;casual&quot;, instant group when you can grab an hour to play). Solid point, and I personally have feedbacked this myself. I fully expect to see &quot;solo&quot; adventures. <br />
<br />
Explain to me why there's no relaxed (ie. not this mind-numbingly dull dps race) option, but there's a 'hard' option that certainly is not for casual players.<br />
<br />
The mind numbing pace you mention is a factor I have also feedbacked, but if you analyze it, its not a HUGE deal. A moderately equipted group of good, solid, skilled players can complete 90% of the missions well within the set limit. Most adventures I go on are done in less than an hour, and some are even done in less than half an hour. This is because WE SET A MIND NUMBING PACE for ourselves. In fact, we joke about it during adventures, i.e. &quot;Better hustle, 10 to kill and only 45 minutes to find em&quot; kind of stuff. I honestly think that a steady pace through the dungeon will chalk up a win. No need for super rushing on all the adventures. <br />
<br />

<br />
My playstyle is a mix of casual and raid. I didnt hit 65 til March of this year. I didn't get my first piece of &quot;Uber&quot; loot til May. Even then, it was only a few hours a night committment, with the occasional 6-8 hour run mixed in. Lots of &quot;casual&quot; time farming VT shards and Emp key stuff, which was done at my own pace. <br />
<br />
The fact that this expansion is being enjoyed by both the casual and the power gamer is a testement to its design. I have many many casual player friends who are loving life right now. There is actually a light at the end of the tunnel for them. I couldnt tell you how many tells I have gotten saying &quot;Wow, did you see this UBER WIDGET OF SNAKE SKINNING, only 510 points, I can almost buy that now!&quot; from folks. Even the dropped gear in the dungeons is solid for casual gamers. People who dont have 20K for a Cloak of Pern can get a decent similar item inside the MM zones. I personally am wearing an Earring that dropped in LDoN. It replaced my Skull Charm. Look at my maeglo (new earring not there yet) and you will see I am HARDLY uber. I enjoy raiding and casual play, and fortunately life has dealt me cards that allow both (recovering from back surgery). My physical condition only permits me a couple hours in a row playing. I have to take large doses of drugs to do a 6 hour VT run, but since we only go once every 2 weeks, I go for it. <br />
<br />
Sorry, rambling now. Good post Crusty. As for you Spiritblood, I feel your pain. I can relate to your situation. But look at the bright side. If you decide to play less EQ, that is your choice. But the times you DO feel like playing, you will have something to do. Rather than stand in BoT LFG for an hour getting discouraged you can build a group and hit an Adventure. A few points here, a few points there. 50 hp Life tap only 340 in MM. lvl 64 DOT only 650 in EC. My 65 spells cost me upwards of 100K. Gonna buy this one, though, and have a blast doing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've really enjoyed it so far.  <br />
<br />
I do see Loid's point however.  If it takes 1-2 real life years to get one piece of meaningful loot, that's not very accessible for something designed to be mor accessible.  It's a legitimate point, and he shouldn't be tarred and feather for &quot;whining&quot; for having an opinion.  <br />
<br />
I don't know if I agree or not frankly.  I've only been able to win 10 adventures (1 loss plus the 2 losses I managed before I downloaded LDoN lol) so far, and have scattered them about, so at my current pace it's going to be a very long time before I buy something.  <br />

The idea is good, and the implementation is good.  I do wonder if some tuning might not help, but that's probably the frustrated power gamer in me just dying for some phat loots!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know what kind of you life you have to be living to do this but I do know I am not living it.<br />
<br />
I go to work, I cook my own food most of the time, I do laundry from time to time, I have friends and family that I try to spend time with on weekends. Oh, and on top of that I have other interests besides EQ.<br />
<br />
Based on all these things my estimation of getting points enough for one piece of &quot;top notch&quot; armor would be around 2 months. Excuse me but thats just not compelling enough for me to get all dizzy about how casual-friendly this expansion is.<br />
<br />
Dont get me wrong I could care less if you PoT-guys kill a bazillion Quarms but I just dont think the casual end of the game is nearly as great as you try to make it out to be.<br />
<br />
And again dont get me wrong - LDoN is enjoyable. It is always intersting to see new areas and monsters. But if the loot is not really that impressive and it takes forever to get and the exp not the best then doing 100s or maybe even 1000s of adventures to get substantial upgrades (that actually wont do much for you after all if you're a casual no-raiding player) the LDoN zones will loose their luster soonish.<br />
<br />
There are so many things they could have done better in LDoN but instead they opted for some new zones that can only be done with one group.<br />

I have a strong suspicion that SoE is holding back on a lot of stuff that is intended for EQ2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
99% for your average 65 is a completely overstatment. I lost one mission yesterday because we couldn't find 21 items in collection even with the extra half an hour. 40 minutes in we had 4 items drop after clearing about half the dungeon. We never had any break and had been non stop killing since we zoned in. I absoluetly hate Ruj because the only things the bastard ever seems to give out is collections and rescues the two mission types that no body seems to like. <br />
<br />
You always can have LD's, crappy lucky, someone that has to go half way through, or just get one real moron and completely screw your chances. Right now I'm 10-2, and a few of those wins we really really close. Some of them we also had 50 minutes left when we got done (pretty much any of the MM ones). I personally think that some balancing needs to be done between the different themes more then anything else. Everyone wants to do MM because they are way easier, no body wants to do Ruj because the dungeons are a lot bigger and the mobs take longer to kill (clerics and shamans blah).</div></div><hr />

Which is my take on LDoN. PoP for me is worthless since I dont play enough to get all the flags nor able to sustain the mind numbing simplicity to XPing in tier2\tier3 planes. I just hate it.  At least with LDoN I can get some xp\AAs, money, and a couple pieces of loot. I dont want a full suit, but if I can get legs\bp in a couple months then so much the better.<br />

How is four hours a night casual? In fact, that's exactly the opposite of casual.  I'm lucky to get 4-5 hours a WEEK. That's casual.  2 missions a week (If I do nothing else), which may or may not succeed since it will be a pick up group (many casual gamers don't have skilled guild members/friends that they can consistently group with).  That means 1 or 2 completed missions a week, or 15+ weeks for 1 piece of equipment.  You can't say a casual gamer can be successful in LDON by doing things that a casual gamer would never do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Fine, Spiritblood, it takes you two months to see the best armor you'll wear for an expansion. So tell me, how long did it take you to get your first piece of VT loot? How about your Time loot?<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm far from uber: I haven't even been guilded since Velious, when I was pulled out of the game by work, and just returned this past March. I've done a lot of catching up from being level 60 with no AAs and being in full Kael quest armor, but I'm still behind the curve. I fall under the same time contraints as you, but once you get used to LDoN it takes closer to two hours than four to burn down two adventures. I'm definitely looking forward to getting my first piece of LDoN endgear, as it will be an upgrade for me, no matter what slot I purchase first. <br />
<br />
If you take the maximum allowable time for each adventure, you'll spend 45 hours for a piece of gear, 15 AAs, and the plat I mentioned earlier. As your groups get better this time decreases. having been in a raiding guild, let me say that 45 hours was 7 to 10 days worth of raiding... and I damned sure didn't average an item a week back then. If anything, I receieve better reward/time in LDoN than I ever did raiding ToV back when it was a true raid level zone.<br />
<br />
Darkpaw, very good point. I should have added a third caveat:<br />
3) Don't do collections.<br />
If you're looking to maximize your reward/time ratio, collections are abysmal, as you might have to kill the first 25 mobs you see... or completely clean out the dungeon. Provided that you adhere to my second prerequisite, the higher the random factor in mission completion, the worse off you are.</div></div><hr />

I submit that no matter what you do, if you only put in four hours a week you'll never advance as far as someone willing to spend more time. The comparison you need to make is how much in-game time it took you to obtain your gear and how much in-game time it took a raiding player to get their gear. I don't think it's at all out of line to expect those times to be commensurate. As with most things, you get out of EQ what you put into it.<br />
<br />
LDoN didn't implement Gear On Demand, it did let those of us who play in smaller blocks of time, or with fewer people, eventually acquire much better gear than would otherwise be available to us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u99"><b>Skadi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p99">IExplain to me how why there's a raid option for uber guild players, but no mini dungeon option for soloers.<br />
<br />
Thats pretty easy to explain.  Everquest is a social game.  You are encouraged to group with others, soloing is almost penalized.  Look at all the XP changes that have been made over the last year, all to limit the amount of XP recieved solo or in small groups and expand the xp recieved in full groups.  There is almost no content in the game that is soloable at the level the encounter is intended to be attempted at.  Its always been this way, where have you been?<br />
<br />
Solo'ers are a small minority, the vast majority of players group.  They arent holding out any leet supersecret zones for solo'ers in EQ2.  Nope dont expect any zones that cater to the 2 box crowd either.  Sorry.  I dont think you should expect or even demand solo content from Sony.  TT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Khalle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Khalle, 4-5 hours a week is not casual, its a joke. You cannot possibly expect anyone to care that you will retire before you can purchase an augment. There is nothing wrong with playing that amount of time, except that there is no reason at all that you should get anything decent. Why do you need Elemental gear anyway? By the time you get anywhere near the elemental planes EQ16 will be releasing at a store near you.<br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't mean to say that I expect high level gear quickly (or easily).  I actually like LDoN because it gives me a chance for some very good gear that normally I wouldn't have a prayer of getting.  I don't even mind the amount of time it will take me to get a piece, that's fine with me.  It gives me something realistic to work towards.  I just meant that I think it's wrong to say that LDoN is geared towards casual gamers, or that casual gamers will have an easy time getting loot.  While it does give us some opportunities that we didn't have before, that is not the same as being specifically geared towards casual gamers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u101"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p101">Let's analyze what it really takes to get the high end LDoN armor. 1492 points. 30 successful normal difficulty L 65 adventures.  We'll assume 2 hours per adventure, which is substantially more than the actual adventure takes, to allow for failures, group gathering, travel, etc... <br />
<br />
So... 30 adventures. 60 hours. And you get one piece of extremely good gear, better than a &quot;casual&quot; player had any HOPE of getting before LDoN. BUT - that's just looking at it from your perspective. Look at it from the group of 6 perspective. You're all earning points, not just one person.  You're not earning one uber item in that time, you're earning 6. 60 hours of 6-man adventuring for SIX very high quality items. That's one per 10 hours of 6-man exp'ing. Plus, while you're doing it, you're earning exp, cash, and item drops. You're getting everything you could have in other zones (exp, cash, item drops), PLUS the uber gear from adventure points - one high-end-raid quality item for someone in the group every ten hours.  That's phenomenal. And that was with two hours per adventure. Speedy people with regular groups (not necessarily uber gear, just competent players and not a lot of /lfg time), will do it in 60-90 minutes per, maybe closer to 90 due to wasted time and an occasional failure. So it could be as low as one uber item for the group for every FIVE HOURS of adventure time. That's fast. It just seems slow while doing the initial climb. <br />
<br />
Take 60 hours for a six man group. So, 60 play-hours for a great item. Most raids do not give that good a return. Most PoP flag raids/gods take 40-60 people, depending on the mob, and whether it's trivial for the guild's capabilities/experience or not. Suppose a raid takes 50 people two hours, and they get 2 drops from it. That's 100 hours, and 2 drops. 50 hours per item.  And you may get bad drops, that aren't very good. Most raid mobs have some lweaker stuff on their drop tables, as well as the good stuff. <br />
<br />
So, my estimates are 50 man-hours per raid drop, 60 per uber armor purchase from LDoN. Obviously those are vague estimates that you can poke holes in all day long if you want. But the fact is - they're the same order of magnitude. <br />
<br />
No, they didn't make LDoN a way for casual players to get uber gear in a small fraction of the time it takes raiders to get it. But they DID make it A WAY for &quot;casual&quot; players who don't raid to get good gear. And we're not even going to TALK about the amount of fun involved in LDoN adventures to earn gear compared to the horror that is keying/flagging for raid zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">they can get a full visible suit of elemental plane/vt quality gear<br />
I think you are pretty far off saying LDoN gear is equal to Elemental and PoT gear.<br />
<br />
I think you need a lesson in reading comprehension.<br />
First off, I never said Plane of Time.<br />
Secondly, I never said it was equal to.  I said it's of the same quality.  Stuff that goes into the quality of gear is AC, HP, Mana, Resists, various stats, focus effects, worn effects, right click effects, procs, and all other effects that might exist.  From what I've read on safehouse, the BP that chain users can acquire is 80hp 80mana.  You can buy 40hp and 40mana augments.  You still have room for a 3rd augment of whatever you want.  Looking at AHR priest BP for example, http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=26782, it's got 125 hp 125 mana, which is only 5 points higher than you can augment with only 2 of your slots.  That's the same quality gear as VT gear for the most part, and that BP is one of the best pieces of gear there is from VT.  If you look at some of the earlier mobs in VT, they drop stuff with 75-100 hp and mana.  That's the same amounts you can buy from vendors with and sometimes without augments.<br />
<br />
The stuff is similar quality gear.  This can't be argued except by the stupid or the ignorant.  No, it's not as quite good as elemental plane mold armor for shaman.  It's closethough, which, by definition, means it's similar quality, which is what I said in the first place.  Also, there's other gear from the ele planes off lots and lots of mini named mobs which only have about 100hp 100mana on them, which is definately worse than you can get in LDON.<br />
<br />
Also, have you ever stopped to consider that other classes might actually get something really outstanding from LDON even more than shaman might?  The warriors in my guild are upgrading to elemental plane armor, but for now mostly they are wearing VT gear.  This means every slot they have is at most 125hp of those VT pieces.  With 2 40hp augments on a crappy 40hp piece of LDON gear, you have the same HP as VT gear.  As for the int casters, take a look some time to see what kind of robes are out there from ANY zone (including Plane of Time), and then compare it to making a robe with a grand total of +230 mana on it (+110 mana robe with 3 +40 mana augments).  LDON robes makes the robes that drop off AHR look like mid level gear in comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">A few prerequisites:<br />
1) You and your group are 65. If you aren't yet, you will be soon enough, and if you're not 65 yet, you can't really expect to be racking up high end equipment.<br />
2) You don't suck. Any decent level 65 group should beat 99% of their missions. LDoN is rough on low level pickup groups, but almost impossible to fail on normal at 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
Four hours a night. Two completed missions. 102 points. <br />
<br />
This means it will take 15 days to get your first piece of top notch armor. Everyone in your group will have gotten one piece of end game armor in just over two weeks. Oh, you'll have picked up about 15 AAs while you were at it, and made a few thousand plat too. <br />
<br />
Any way you look at it, that's tons better than a casual gamer will find anywhere else in Norrath.<br />
<br />
You're missing what I've been saying, that it won't be 2 weeks for everyone to get a piece of gear doing 2 missions a day.   Only one person will and that's only if the same group did the same camp every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">You're missing what I've been saying, that it won't be 2 weeks for everyone to get a piece of gear doing 2 missions a day.

<br />
Warador, maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but it seems to me you're saying &quot;I want what the other guy has, but I don't want to put forth the same effort.&quot;  Well... :rolleyes: .  I play 5 to 10 hours/wk and it's going to take months (years??) to get the stuff I want in ldon - and that's only including what I know about today...it doesn't include the things I don't know about or what they'll be adding in the future.  On the other hand, someone on my server already has 90+ wins (i.e.;  4500+ pts.) and they can get tons of stuff now...so what?  They earned it!<br />
<br />
If SOE made ldon so easy that a casual gamer could complete it in 6 months, the game would lose interest and die in no time.  As it is, Sony has decided to make the game so large, time consuming, and complex that 99.9% of the population has no hope of ever &quot;completing&quot; it.  Therefore, for people like us, it's basically a never ending game where the finish line is unatainable but it's worthwhile (emotionally) to continue playing.  <br />
<br />
If you don't get satisfaction out of playing EQ, then don't play it.  <br />
<br />
If you want what everyone else has, then put forth the same effort they do.  If you're not willing to put forth the same effort, don't expect the same results.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">I just want to point out that the best armor for point purchase take 30 adventures. Assuming you do 1.5 per session, that will take you about 20 sessions of play. Alternatively, if you armor up with the armor tier just below that (which is still pretty good gear), it will take 15 adventures, or about 10 sessions of play. That doesn't seem like an unreasonable investment considering the quality of gear. If you dont have a lot of time to play, and want to equip yourself with less played time, then opt for a lower tier of armor. But stop whining. I find it amusing that all the folk complaining about the time investment appear to only be considering the very best items available, as if that is the only option. If you want the best stuff it takes a lot of time. If you dont have that time, set your sights lower ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">So, those whining from the bottom... before LDON you had pretty much no chance of getting anything, at least now when you put aside the RL you are desperately touting as your reason for not being in a Time guild, and get on for your two hour session you have a chance to accrue points. The points don't expire, and can be used whenever you have enough. And the problem is??? <br />
<br />
Thanks Karshak, thank you very much.  <br />
<br />
Everyone who's whining get that and understand what the dude just said?  I'm a casual player, I play weekends and maybe 2-3 nights a week.  LDoN is the best thing since sliced bread for the casual player and if you don't understand the opportunity that's been handed to you (albeit a time-consuming opportunity), you need to take your dreams of Elemental and PoTime loot out of your skull and wake up:  You will NEVER obtain Ele or PoTime loot unless you join those guilds, which yes, means sacrificing that sacred spare time.  You will NEVER obtain uber loot unless you sacrifice the time, you will NEVER be given a mystical, magical casual gamer key to anything.  Either you join the big boys or you save your points and buy your toys like the rest of us who let that little speck of reality dawn on us months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">Huh?   You're reading way too much into what I said.   The time required is not right IN MY OPINION.   Has absolutely nothing to do with what other people have.  Has absolutely nothing to do with what I want.   I just don't like how they have it setup.  It's that simple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Tarelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Wow, long thread.  It took me a while to catch up.<br />
<br />
A little background.  I am married, 2 kids, full-time job.  I play about an hour in the mornings before work then maybe 3-4 hours per day on weekends.  Some weekends: 1 day, some 2 days.  Rarely, I do get on for an evening here and there.  That adds up to 8-10 hours a week on average.  When not grouping/raiding I 2-box with my druid.<br />
<br />
I like LDoN, not love it, but like it.<br />
<br />
What I like:<br />
- Each adventure I win gets me exp, some plat and some points towards a guaranteed loot (not a chance at an item, but a guaranteed item, eventually)<br />
- Possible looted Aug for some of my existing gear or other looted item.  I haven't gotten any yet, but I hear there is some in there.  :)<br />
- If I spend 10 hours playing, I get the same rewards as an uber player that spends 10 hours playing, approximately.  I think that it is fair in that regard.  Yes he/she is going to get the rewards faster because they put in more in-game time per RL week, but I have the same shot at all of the same stuff eventually.  I dislike that I will never see end-game raids/loot from other expansions, but nor do I expect to.  I simply cannot put in the time necessary to get there.  I have accepted that.  I like that this expansion lets me play at my pace and still get the top level (for this expansion) loot eventually.<br />
<br />
What I don't like:<br />
- LFG.  This weekend I spent an hour LFG on Saturday afternoon without success.  Saturday evening I had 3 groups after me 10 minutes after putting up the LFG flag.  I'm not accustomed to LFG as I usually 2-box or raid, so I am new to the problems of going LFG.  I'm not saying that this is broken or that there is a way of fixing it, I am just saying I don't like it.<br />
- Must have minimum 4 member parties.  I would love to have the ability to 2-box through an adventure on my own for those times when I don't have the time to go LFG and then do an adventure.  I think that it would be very easy to code the dungeons to scale to the number of people in your party.  SoE should be able to support a few more servers for the extra load that it will take when more instances are needed for smaller groups.<br />
- Adventure Points (AP) cannot be spent at whichever camp you want until you have unlocked that camp up to that value.  This is a problem for a casual gamer as I will take whatever group I can get, not just one at the camp that I want.  I am not whining about it, nor do I have a workable solution for it.  It will just take me longer to get the specific things that I want.  I can live with this.<br />
<br />
Overall, I like it.  I have only done 3 adventures so far, all successes with pickup groups with people that  I had never met before.  I enjoyed them and I am playing my character in a way that I don't get to everyday.  In this case different = fun.  It may get old, but not that soon.  That is one advantage of being a casual player.  Things get old more slowly than they do for someone who plays 10 hours a day.<br />
<br />
This is just my opinion.  I give it in the hopes of informing some of those that think that casual playing is 4 hours a night and those that think that all casual players are whiners that think that we should be handed gear just because we pay $13 a month.  4 Hours a night isn't really a casual gamer in my opinion.  Not all casual gamers expect to get equal footing with the uber gamers and whine if we don't.  I don't think that I deserve the same as anyone else that pays their $13.  I do like that I can get the high level items/augmentations eventually and it will just take me longer RL time to get there.  I think that this is the way it should be and this is one thing that LDoN does well.<br />
<br />
Just my ramblings,<br />
Tarelan</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u110"><b>Onte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p110">This leads to an entirely different can of worms, but, for months, guilds at the top of the heap have literally been forced to recruit in order to proceed and succeed with PoTime.  We've all got guilds with 80+ people on our servers.  These guilds are pretty focused on what they're focused on, not LDoN.  I would assume that as time goes by, these guilds may or may not splinter and the ol' LFG flags may not have to stay on as long to find a dungeon group.  The LFG problem may or may not fix itself as guilds change direction in the next few weeks and months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u111"><b>Devnull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p111">Warador, you seem to be laboring under one of the most common misconceptions about LDoN:<br />

<br />
Every person in the group gets those points. At the end of the two weeks, every person will have enough points to buy one o ftheir top armor pieces. Those points can be spent anywhere, as long as you've unlocked the appropriate spending threshold at that dungeon. <br />
<br />
Right now, it's a little bit tougher to get people to go to some of the less used dungeons (like, anything not named Mistmoore), but that will change in short order. As more people unlock the final tier of purchasable gear in their dungeon of choice, you'll see them starting to spread to other dungeons. Sure, you might not be able to buy your Silk Robe of Almostuberness there, but maybe you want to be able to purchase a FT2 augment instead. I predict widescale diversification in the near future; save your points, you'll be able to spend them where you need them.</div></div><hr />

That was what my only gripe about LDoN is to date: It suffers from the same problem the old PoFear and PoHate suffered: full suits of armor coming from one place. If you dont recall, it was far too easy to get a cleric to go to hate but annoying getting the trinity classes to go to fear--at least it was for my guild. LDoN has the same problem. I wish they would have spread out the pieces threough all the zones-- it would have spread out people better.<br />

As I mentioned above, I see this as an initial problem that will fade over time. As soon as someone has unlocked the top tier of gear in a dungeon, there's no real motivation for them to stay locked in there. In fact, if there are any augments or gear they want elsewhere, it becomes a powerful motivation for a diaspora of sorts.</div></div><hr />

I think that SOE should make a few tweaks here and there for balance reasons, and I think these &quot;tweaks&quot; can probably be expected.<br />

My suggestions:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u115"><b>Krac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p115">One thing that i haven't seen talked about in this thread that really bugs me is the award curve.  I am 55.  I and my groups bust a$$ to complete mission at normal, and I'm pretty twinked (ie 2/3 of holy trinity: fungi, JBB, missing epic).  <br />
<br />
I get a massive 15-17 pts per win, depending on my groups average level.  In 10 levels, at 65 you get 51 per win.  *** is with this curve?  You get 36 more points per win, 3.5 more per level on average from 55 to 65?  That's insane.  Considering that the 57-58's I've grouped with get 17-19, that means in 7 levels you jump 34 points per win?  The 'normal' missions are hard, the hard ones impossible in the 50's unless you are an ubertwink.  <br />
<br />
I've calculated that it would take me 28 or so missions, ALL in mistmore, to get my 54 spell.  That's, at an average of 2 hours per mission as my record is 10 min left when done, 56 hours at crap exp, as I get 3 blue per mission.  I literally go at twice the rate in PoX groups or soloing.  The 62, (maybe 63 don't remember) shaman spell takes about 18-20 missions, at a much higher success rate.  <br />
<br />
I think Sony really needs to re-think its award curve.  I'm not asking for much, maybe a 5 pt or so award increase in the 50's.  This problem might be present in the lower levels too, I don't know.  But when I was reading the thread I noticed all, and I do mean ALL of you, were assuming doing LDoN at 65.  I realize that EQ only really starts at 60 now and everything lower is simply an exp grind, but the rest of us lowbees are still here and the award curve is really a slap in the face.  It's actually quicker to simply level and come back because of that nearly vertical curve in the award.<br />
<br />
BTW, anybody know of a Fear raid on Zeb anytime in the next month?  I'm looking to get my epic, but so far as I can tell NOBODY does Fear on Zeb anymore.</div></div><hr />

It's been a long time since I've ground in the 50's, but that kind of exp seemed insane to me. I'll take a reduced AP rate in exchange for the much better exp (relative to a 65 who gets about 2/3 what they would in BoT).</div></div><hr />

After reading Karshak's post and about half of Juujuu's I gave up on seeing any reasonable responses from those uber-people that insist I have to be very very happy about LDoN as a source of end-game equipment.<br />

Calling other people ignorant and whiners will acomplish a lot I am sure. Some of it will be what you want but maybe most of it will be that people that dont post much here formulate an opinion about what kind of person you are.<br />

And any of you uber-&quot;whiners&quot; that enjoy flaming me please let me know where I said I wanted end-game equipment from LDoN by playing 1-2 hours/day.<br />

And to Karshak I can only say that if you have this kind of attitude towards other people YOU DONT KNOW that play a game on a DIFFERENT server than yours then you really need to go seek some professional help.

I think the concern is something SOE feels. You see, let me give you a little economics lesson. If people get the TOP stuff, they STOP playing. They stop playing, they stop PAYING. <br />
<br />
If the casual player could get REALLY REALLY great gear faster than LDoNs current set up, how fast do you think the Powergamers will? The Top 100 LDoN on my server is basically a list of the sole guild in Time, with a sprinkling of names from other top guilds tossed in. The top win leader has 140 some adventure wins. Do the math, even if the events only took him 40 minutes on average. <br />
<br />
SOE is NEVER gonna allow the casual gamer to access this kind of stuff without a MAJOR timesink, period. They have already seen what can happen when guilds get bored. DAoC came at a time when EQ was vulnerable, and took a chunk of players out of the magical cash pool. Lots of those have come back, but some never have. A time sink like LDoN will keep EVERYONE happy SOME of the time, best case scenario for SOE, while the next expansion is finished (or EQ2)</div></div><hr />

They want to buy the end game.

LOL.  Thanks for the laughs.  A few play sessions?  My ass.  Why are you all so overstating how good the LDoN gear is?   It takes like 6,000 points to make one piece of LDoN gear equal to EP gear.

SoE should have made the armor cheaper, and the augments more expensive.  Or just made the armor not as decent as it is and made it cheaper.  I dunno, but the way it is right now is not the dream expansion for casual gamers as you put it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LDoN is for everyone.  Powergamers and casual gamers can all get something out of LDoN.  Powergamers will always get more out of any expansions.<br />
<br />
Is it specially advantageous to casual gamers?  It still depends on your playing style.  Everyone will benefit from LDoN differently.<br />
<br />
Well, casual gamers now have another avenue to get items without having to join a big guild and raid regularly.  PoP did not address the need for casual gamers who are not with guilds that are capable of flagging their members up to elemental zones.  In SoL era, only some guilds got to kill Emp Ssra and farmed VT.<br />
<br />
LDoN addresses the need of casual gamers better than PoP or even SoL expansion.<br />
<br />
How much you get out of LDoN is really individual and also depends on your playstyle and what you want from it.  I don't see even the basis of arguing over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My play time is limited to a few hours during the week but pretty much open on the weekends (both my wife and I play EQ). Since the expansion was released, I've accumulated ~700 points. I guess the expansion is about a month old, so I'm looking at very decent upgrade every two months or so. This is not only acceptable to me, but as several others have stated, without LDoN, my chances of any kind of upgrade were slim to none. <br />
<br />
During that same time period, I've earned enough experience for several aa's (about half to three-quarters an aa per trip), a decent mask upgrade, a spear for a friend's twink, a couple of augments and a decent amount of PP. Had I done this experience elsewhere, I would have been limited to aa's, PP and possibly a roll on another piece of average gear.  <br />
<br />
Seems like a good deal to me.<br />
<br />
That's just my opinion though, I could be wrong...</div></div><hr />

OK Warador, I think I am getting a grasp on what you are wishing for here. You want the items to be cheaper, easier to get, and equal in power to Elememtal gear, all achievable in a few hours played a week. Close enough? <br />
<br />
GET A GRIP ON REALITY DUDE. My gosh, if SOE made it that simple, EQ would burn out faster than and MMORG in the history of mankind. Even the most casual Power Gamer types (which is what I catagorize myself as, a Casual High End player, couple hours a day, more for big raids) would have cleaned out their LDoN wish lists in a matter of weeks. And there is &quot;less decent&quot; armor to be had, for about HALF the price of the top stuff! I seriously do not think you are even putting any thought into what you say at all man.<br />
<br />
EQ has been, and always will be, a time vs reward game. Period. Accept it or move along. You want Elemental level gear? Join an Elemental level guild. Can't dedicate that kind of time? Settle for what CAN GET. Lower your sights man. <br />
<br />
I want a million dollars. In fact, I think the government should just give me a million dollars. Why not? Lots of people who work REALLY hard make a million dollars, why shouldn't I have a million dollars. I shouldnt have to work as hard as others to get my million though, cause I work pretty darn hard now. Plenty hard enough to justify my million. I put as many hours into work as I choose too right now. In fact, I am pushing for doing less work for more money. Why not. My mother gave birth to me, correct? Therefore, I am owed certain inalienable things. One million dollars is a great start. We will work on the personal helicoptor when I get my check.</div></div><hr />

LDON satisfies this requirement very well.  The only way to make it better would be to add some even shorter missions, or some solo/duo missions.  But even that could be added within the framework they have built for LDON, in some future expansion.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u133"><b>Abynormal777</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p133">Something else I was thinking about last night...I have semi-twinked troll warrior that is fast becoming my main (rather play the shaman, but my grp needs a solid tank ;) )  Anyway, I've got about 250k of gear on him - about 120k of which is armor (not including the 50k CoCW.)  So, I've got decent, but not great stuff (cobalt BP, heavy rubicite girdle, etc.)  Still, it took me about 9 months of bazaar trading to raise the plat doing 1/2 hour of buying and selling with my 24/7 vendor before and after each adventuring session - playing about 4 days a week.  All in all, a pretty decent time expenditure.<br />
<br />
Anyway, last night I was looking at the top 3 set of plate armor from ldon and I realized the 3rd tier is actually slightly better than most of my gear!!!  Yes, that's the 442 point stuff and that doesn't even include what I can do with augments...I'm talking base stats here!<br />
<br />
My point is, if you don't want to invest tons of time, you can set your sites a bit lower and still get great gear.  In fact, that's always the way EQ has worked...there isn't much price difference between the first couple tiers of gear, but as you get to the higher end the price goes up exponentially.  <br />
<br />
For me, I'll probably split between the 760 and 1492 point gear, but I realize it'll take a year to get most of what I want.  If I wanted to set my sites a bit lower and go with a mix of 442 and 760 gear I could probably get what I wanted in 6 months.<br />
<br />
Note:  the one thing I wish they'd change is allowing you to sell things back to the merchants...I'd be happy with a 20% loss similar to selling back a horse...<br />

What a lot of people don't seem to grasp about raid guilds is that while a 2-3 hour raid may yield 1 to 2 nice pieces of equipment. You've usually got 50 -60 plus people working to kill that one mob. All these people expect to get some of these pieces at some point. There will be plenty of raids where nothing drops for your class on the target mob, or if it does, you won't have the ELP to bid on it. <br />
<br />
(Example, Last night's raid yielded one bracer, which went to someone for 180 points. At 5 points per raid, 2-3 hours on average it works out to about about 32 hours for that one bracer. This doesn't include the time it took to even get to elementals through Tov/ssraa/vt/pop etc.)<br />
<br />
<br />
Last night Someone linked me an augmented warrior BP from Tak that had over 200 hp on top of it's other stats, at this point that's still better than what most of the warriors in our guild are wearing (just got to elementals).... It can be achieved with ONE group and EVERYONE in the group will have gotten a similar piece of gear in the process. Your 240 hours yields 6 elemental level pieces of specific, hand chosen and customised gear, which works out to roughly 40 hours/piece. This doesn't even count Box drops and named mob drops encountered in dungeons.<br />
<br />
In Ldon one group that sticks together can bypass old fashioned progression and work their way directly to the highest armor set. A guild starting from scratch would probably get equiped this way a lot faster that one working their way up old school.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression from being in beta and reading all the press releases before LDoN went live that current armor could be improved  (I saw a vindi BP on beta with 215 HPs on it).  Looks to me like only PoTime gear has more than just slot 1's on them now?  <br />
<br />
They made LDoN way too much of a timesink to use the good augments.  They require you to get a 1500 point piece of armor to use a 1500 point augment.   On beta it wasn't like this as far as I knew.</div></div><hr />

I'd love a screen shot of that BP.  I never saw anything like that in beta.  Of course, since it was BETA, they were obviously still testing out how the system would work if they allowed folks to augment everything to such incredible power.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't HAVE to buy 1500 point armor to use 1500 point augments!!!  The 450pt armor has type3 slots!  And its close in stats to HoT armor.  The 760 armor has type3 slots!  Its close in stats to ornate!<br />
<br />
Of course the best armor is going to require a huge timesink.  How long had PoP been out before the best guilds in the game started getting PoTime loot?  6 months?  How about elemental loot?  It was quite a while before Bertox and Rallos Zek died on most servers (and after all this time, most still have no chance at seeing the elemental planes.)<br />
<br />
On top of all of this, if you are a casual gamer, why have such a power gamer mentalitly that requires you to have the best gear in the game?  I've always sat about 2 tiers behind the &quot;top&quot; in terms of gear and raiding ability.  But I made that choice and it doesnt bother me.  In reality, unless you are doing Time level raids, you don't need that gear anyway.  It will just trivialize what you will continue to do with your playtime and make the game boring.  :p</div></div><hr />

War suffers from what I like to refer to as &quot;Diablo Syndrome&quot;. See, in Diablo 2, you can log in, create a character, and within a few short weeks be lvl 99 with all the best gear in the game. Its actually fairly simple, even &quot;casually&quot;. Heck, if you got 20 bucks in your PayPal account, you can do it in a couple days. <br />
<br />
Probably why I don't play Diablo much anymore. Got old really fast. Each time they &quot;upgrade&quot; the game and the gear a little, I go back for a week, get a guy to 90, check out the cool new gear, trade for the Uber stuff, then quit again. I would hate for EQ to develop this type of gear system. If casual players start getting Ele level gear with little effort, then the game is already a corpse just waiting for the Coroner to claim the body.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I can't speak for your server, but LDoN is VERY popular amoung the high levels on mine. The timesink situation is because in order to upgrade a VT-Sol Ro-Ele equipted character, you need the TOP END stuff. 40 hp augs don't come cheap. <br />
<br />
Casual gamers have a more expansive choice. For MOST casual players, I think that they can upgrade a vast majority of their gear with the lower level LDoN rewards. One thing that has been mentioned I would like to see though, is a buy-back. Say the casual gamer buys the 760 pt armor. Great. Now he has to save 1400 to to upgrade it? Thats a bit much to ask a person who plays something like 5-10 hours a week, total. A buyback would allow a casual player to feel more secure spending those points for incremental upgrades. <br />
<br />
Its not a perfect system Warador. I don't think there is one. You can't please all of the people all of the time. But this is a great start in the right direction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u145"><b>Takeshi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p145">That's like 120 successful missions.  240 hours.  Again, no failures.  <br />
<br />
  Or just made the armor not as decent as it is and made it cheaper.<br />
<br />
Do you realize that this already exists?  For half the points you can buy armor nearly as good, a few less ac and 3/4 the hp, mana, and stats.  The main upgrade on the top armor sets is the 2nd type 2 augment slot, but most people are going to put in the any type 40hp augs so that hardly matters.<br />
<br />
You are also taking a worst-case scenario for point accumulation.  A good group can do an adventure in around an hour, especially if you can keep it together for 2 or 3 straight adventures, or at least keep the core so you don't have to start all over.  If you only have a 2 hour play session you might have trouble because of the sometimes lengthy startup time of forming a group, but you should still be able to knock out 2 adventures sometimes.<br />
<br />
So, cut the time in half by setting your goal for the almost as good set (which should be plenty good for any casual player.  Why exactly would a casual need EP quality gear?)  Then cut it almost in half again with a more realistic estimate of time per adventure.  Now, in those 60 hours I suppose you could farm plat to buy ornate, and get the focii and effects built in, but you wouldn't have gained a substantial amount of AA or had much fun.<br />
<br />
edit: Your one point that I agree on is the lack of augmentability for old gear.  Though there are a few nice any type augments.  I also agree with the poster above that a buy-back option would make the expansion more casual-friendly.  I'll probably go for the top armor just so I'll feel safe augmenting it knowing I'll never have to upgrade, even though I'd be just as effective in the 760 armor.<br />
<br />

They did do that. It's called the 760 point armor set. Or the 442 point set....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">I guess what I've been &quot;whining&quot; about is based mostly on the fact that they advertised it as an expansion for the casual group of friends who like to do dungeon crawls.  They left out the fact that there's time limits that make it a race, and not a crawl.  They left out the fact that the loot sucks except for the items on the merchants which, agree with me or not, takes way too long to get.  They left out the fact that the raids are impossible for smaller guilds or for pickup raids to do (even on normal).  They left out the fact that the decent augments are useless unless you get the expensive armor on the merchants first.   <br />
<br />
The 760 armor isn't bad, but I can't see buying it for a marginal upgrade over what people can get in a single group in PoP (for better exp.)  <br />
<br />
Other than that, yes I do like LDoN believe it or not.  My server being such a low population server really hurts people like me as far as LDoN goes.  I look for LDoN groups for nice and safe AA exp. only.  I stopped thinking about buying loot on the merchants soon as I saw the prices.<br />
<br />
I don't think it would have been too terrible to make some of the 1500 AP's pieces to be rare drops off of named mobs in avg level 65 missions.   The loot tables just feels beta quality still imo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">One thing that has been mentioned I would like to see though, is a buy-back. Say the casual gamer buys the 760 pt armor. Great. Now he has to save 1400 to to upgrade it? Thats a bit much to ask a person who plays something like 5-10 hours a week, total. A buyback would allow a casual player to feel more secure spending those points for incremental upgrades. <br />
<br />
Its not a perfect system Warador. I don't think there is one. You can't please all of the people all of the time. But this is a great start in the right direction.<br />
<br />
You also have to consider that if you put any augments on that midrange item then you loose those too. And again this affects casual players most since they are the ones that might see the midrange stuff as (temporary?) upgrades. The way the system is now you almost have to save up for the absolute best unless you know you will never want to get the better items.<br />
<br />
Looks to me like there is room for a lot of improvement here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u149"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p149">I agree with the points War and SB have made here. But, even semi-uber people can get upgrades off drops. Check my magelo, I am not uber at all. My gear mostly sucks, except a few slots of VT stuff. I put this on the other day in place of a Skull Charm:<br />
<br />
Lupine Frenzy Earring   <br />
LORE ITEM MAGIC ITEM  <br />
Weight: 0.6 Size: TINY <br />
Slot: EAR  <br />
AC: +6 Dex: +8 Wis: +4 Int: +4 Agi: +8 Fire Resist: +8 Poison Resist: +8 HP: +55 Mana: +40  <br />
Classes: All Classes  <br />
Races: All Races <br />
Slot 1: Type 1 <br />
 <br />
and there is more that drops that I will be after. I am also saving points to upgrade spots that I will likely never see Ornate or Elemental armor for, like my BP. I also plan to buy something on the lower scale so I can stick a couple augs in it for focus I lack, but that are EXTREMELY helpful in the Planes, like Ex Range 4. <br />
<br />
Spiritblood, my hopes for a buy-back clause of LDoN gear includes getting points back for whatever purchased augs are in the item that is returned. <br />
<br />
Like I said, no system is perfect. No expansion is going to make everyone happy. But we all remember Mr Spock's famous line in one of the ST movies about &quot;the needs of the many&quot;. This expansion addresses a lot of those needs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u150"><b>laughingowl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p150">Personally LDoN is a dream for Casual Player / Small Guild / Group of friends.<br />
<br />
As stated almost any not totally impossible group of 6 can normally swing a 'normal' adventure.  For very nice EXP (unless you can kite in high end planes), Decent drops, and the bonus of any 'sucessfull' adventure gives you DKP, umm I mean Adventure Points....<br />
<br />
<br />
LDoN  is just DKP for small guild / casual players :-)  for those that belong to the wayfarers guild :-).<br />
<br />
Getting 3-5 friend together is relatively easy.  (and one or two pickups often will not kill us).<br />
<br />
Grabbing our own custom adventure makes exp, loot, build to high end loot, much easier than before.<br />
<br />
My only wish is the would open 'adventures' to three people group.  While it would jack your fail rate.  Exp, (and loot) would be real nice for a three person group doing LDoN  (even if you fail them all)  and off hours, grabbing two other friends is not that hard.  (either that or leave at 4 required and open the level range a little more (atleast post 50 or so, personally I think any 'exp range group' should be viable for LDoN.  Sure it would make PLing a little easier, but PLing will always occur and always will.  but I can not play my 65 monk alot a times, since not everyone wanting to come if 58+ (all 50+ though and easily legitmate 'groupmates').<br />
<br />
Peace</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u151"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p151">I guess it breaks down to these simple questions and answers....<br />
<br />
Q) Could you EVER get high level gear with only a group of 6, before LDoN?<br />
A) NO!<br />
<br />
Q) Can you get high level gear with a group of 6 now that LDoN is here?<br />
A) Yes! If you are willing to spend the time.<br />
<br />
Trust me, I am a casual gamer (3hrs a night x 4 nights a week). I am in a guild that is close to HoT, but I say that LDoN seems a very viable option to those that can't get there.  Someone said it earlier, only those that put in the most time/effort, to get to the hardest places, should get the best drops (and trust me, I'm not one of them)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u152"><b>Thaak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p152">Spending one year to get a full suit of gear is the way the game has always been.<br />
<br />
Remember spending a year in HoT trying to get that god damn BP to drop? I know I do. I know that I can't get the armour I want unless I put in the time.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I'd see worth bitching about is the itemization, but that's a different story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u153"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p153">Hi, my Name is Harwel, and I'm a casual EQ player.<br />
<br />
By casual I mean, I play maybe 20 hours a week.  Some nights I play 2-3 hours, weekends I play more, some days and nights I don't play at all.  I don't like raiding, I've tried large raids, they bore me to tears.  I don't belong to a guild anymore.  I don't care if the place I'm currently fighting isn't the best exp and loot per hour that I could be getting, as long as I'm having a good time.  As a side note that has nothing to being casual or not, I prefer dungeon crawls greatly to sitting around one spot pulling the same few mobs over and over and over.<br />
<br />
LDoN is the best thing that's ever done for players like  me in EQ.  Not only do I get my own private dungeon, free of camp checks, trains, griefers, etc... it is tailored to my level, good experience, some loot of the named that I can sometimes sell, sometimes use.  To top it all of, I get free &quot;DKP&quot; that I don't even have to bid against other people with, because the stuff you can buy with the points is available in unlimited quantities.  I can design my own armor and gear according to what I speficially need/want to improve.  Yeah, it will take time to do it, but hello, it's EVERQuest.<br />
<br />
I'm thinking any &quot;casual&quot; gamer that has a real beef with LDoN is not actually a casual player... they are a frustrated powergamer with time constraints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u154"><b>Doleck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p154">I'm thinking any &quot;casual&quot; gamer that has a real beef with LDoN is not actually a casual player... they are a frustrated powergamer with time constraints.<br />
<br />
Harwel you probably hit the nail on the head for me. I think your right I am a powergamer with time constraints. I want to play more, lots more, but like you I get about 20 hrs or less in a week. And thats probably where my frustration comes from, that and ldon armor still cost to many APs.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Another thing about LDoN is the drops in hard missions. My guild doesn't have any VT or higher gear and a group went to do a hard adventure last night. They couldn't beat it, but they got two drops, a 90/60 belt with vengence 3 and a decent 1hs sword. That was a single group of people in one adventure. If you have a group of people you really trust that can group in BoT well you can probably do the hard mode missions just for the loot (just don't plan on getting the adventure points).</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean go into a dungeon and spend time JUST FOR THE LOOT? Go on, get out, really? No points? *** is that?<br />
<br />
/sarcasm off - great point Darkpaw. Heck, its almost &quot;farmable&quot;. Have a ranger in your group, get a hard, zone in, check track. 2 named up? COOL! Who cares if you win, if you can make it to the 2 named in 2 hours, you get loot NOW. No named up? Bah, leave adventure, start new one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">Making the game better for casual gamers doesn't mean making it easier.  It means adding more built-in stopping points so you can divide the work into right-sized chunks to fit your schedule.<br />

<br />
fantastic point.  <br />
