<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How does SCRM stack with the 8th shawl effect? Is there a a &quot;duration cap&quot;, or can I realy get 50% +20% +20% = 90% buff duration for a 2.5 h fo7?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't know where you are getting the extra 20%, SCRM is 50% total because it's really SCRM (20%) + SCR3 (30%) but yes the shawl effect will stack. So you get 70% total extension with that combination, subject to the restrictions of that specific focus effect. (spells have to be minimum 42 seconds or something like that) Focus effects do not stack so picking up another buff extension focus item won't extend the duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">70% is the top you can get with shawl + scrm (and I love it, FA lasts forever).  50% of it (the scrm part) will work on torpor/Q, because it works on all buffs, but your shawl will only work on buffs over a certain duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As has already been said they do stack and if there is a max extension you can get no one has hit it yet.<br />
<br />
50% from scrm + 20% from Shawl definitely leads to some nice long lasting buffs. I can easily keep Ferine avatar up on half a dozen people and can do 10 if I'm really working on it.<br />
<br />
As also mentioned the shawl doesn't work on torpor/q because it has a min duration of 48 seconds. There are a couple items that have a lower min like the crown of ambivolence from vt which result in a 65% longer torpor/q and are very nice peices =)</div></div><hr />
