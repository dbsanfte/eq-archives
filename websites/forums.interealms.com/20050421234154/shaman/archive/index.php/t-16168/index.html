<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While pl my soon to be 2 boxing monk, I was going to jp forest killing poachers decent exp a fair amount of hp though. I got eq evolution so I figured I'd try GuG.I tried the fort at first.. didn't work out to well I got feared then nuked to death after awhile, also lots of mobs there that seem to agro easy to my monk. IF you have a group this would seem like a good place. So I tried the shore all I can say is wow.. this place is awsome..  I went from 39-40 in an hour exp was decent 1.5-2% a kill but they go down pretty fast. Keep in mind though I had my shammy there healing, and my pet helping the kills. I can see a monk soloing here pretty easy.. and it is close to the harbor to sell your goods.</div></div><hr />
