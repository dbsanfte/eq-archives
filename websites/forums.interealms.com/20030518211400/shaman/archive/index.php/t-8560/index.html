<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was looking at the quest FAQ and the cudgle quests and noticed that barbarians can use them.  I love doing quests and have a few questions about these.<br />
<br />
How can I most effectively raise my faction to do these quests?  Which factions do I need to raise?  What does the effect &quot;Carnage&quot; do?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, I'm really excited about these quests hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just going on posted info and some chats, I would say you are out of luck if you are hoping to finish any of the cudgel quests past the first.  Barbarians max out their Scaled Mystics faction at a point that is too low to continue questing past cudgel #1 by normal means.  It may be possible to continue the quests by using faction boosting items or by multi-quest.  You will most likely have to get a MQ of cudgel #7 in order to ever possess the 8th.<br />
<br />
Factioning Cabilis is somewhat longer for barbarians if you are looking to preserve FV faction because you have to do the bonechip/scorpion pincher quests in order to max faction.  If you won't be sad about becoming KOS in FV then definitely kill explorers for knives because it truly is the fast route.<br />
<br />
After you max your faction with the bulk of Cab West you will need to kill Iksar Treasure Hunters/picaroons etc. to gain favor with the Brood of Kotiz that dominates Cab East.  Once you get these necros to dubious you can forget about them unless you want to use the vendors.<br />
<br />
Carnage is prolly the handiest pet buff ever.  Lasts around 6 minutes and is +40str/dex/agi/attk.  It will not stack with PE, Avatar, VoB, and primal procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I went looking around I found places that said Barbarians max out at threateningly to Scaled Mystics.  Would it be possible to get to threat, and wear that necklace from shadowhaven to boost to dubious or something?  Although dubious probably isnt enough either.  They shouldn't have gotten my hopes up by putting BAR on the thing hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Get an Ench with project Illusion to make a Leezard of you...should have high enough faction then :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ragnarita</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can a troll (Inno worshipper) get the 8th cudgel without the 'chanter trick ?<br />
I have my 7th cudgel for a while now and just need the HS fight for the 8th but I don't want to loose all if my faction isn't sufficiant (I'm low warmly with max faction I think)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
so now barbarians/kitties have a way around the faction cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">an inny worshipping troll can get it without illusion..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I believe barbs max at indiff and whether the iksar illusion combined with something like Puppet Strings can get you to low warmly in order to actually get cudgels 1-7 completed remains to be seen.  Assuming you could get to 7, the trigger for the 8th is still prolly going to have to be done by someone else because of faction/religious issues that people have with that Oracle.<br />
<br />
Only way to find out is to get your faction maxed and start trying different things to tweak your faction.  I doubt the illusion alone will do you much good because bards/rogues are still KOS with the lizzy mask, but it is worth a shot. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">so low warmly is needed to do any of these quests? and how can i start raising my faction with them? does the bone chip quest do it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes the bone chip quest will max your trooper and crusader factions. But the maxxed factions may still not be enough to do the cudgel quests.<br />
<br />
Jowjo is a Rallos Zek Ogre Shaman. He maxxed at indifferent. I have not tried projected lizard illusion yet though.<br />
<br />
Good luck. Let us know if the illusion bumps a faction. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>deviator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i am a barbarian, i have maxed out at indiff, i have my 6th cudgel by using the necklace that drops in icewell by couselor juliah lockheart, it has 4 charges of alliance which will take you from indiff to amiable so you can do the turn in's. the only problem i face now is that i have killed her twice and she hasnt dropped the necklace. i bought all the other but i heard it is common drop and have yet to see one drop. does anyone konw if this still drops?<br />
<br />
also someone mentioned the faction item from SH, will that work in other zones besides SH? if so i might do that quest over again just to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Someone asked bout the effect of carnage, here is a description of the 8th cudgel and its effect.<br />

However, a guildy posted it for me and i think it can be trusted.<br />
