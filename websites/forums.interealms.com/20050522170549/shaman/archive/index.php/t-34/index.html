<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">1) Has anyone been able to tell if, with this patch, they have done anything to reduce the increased aggro on slows (for those of us who believe it has increased ;))?<br />
<br />
2) Has anyone heard any official response or comment on slows resulting in increased aggro?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ahpok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Our guild try HoT last night, I feel that the Slowing aggro is increased. After lend slowed, MT / other melee can't taunt out until 30 sec to 1mins ..... <br />
<br />
How about you ??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cailleach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try using a Pally as your MT, they can build aggro so much faster than a Warrior, and more importantly can take it back faster.  I havent tryed it, but have heard similar sucess stories with SK's.<br />
<br />
Just remember Hybrids dont get the defensive disc, so you might have to adjust your tactic slightly ... but belive me, it's been worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah; had a lvl 60 Pally MT in Kael Arena Sunday night (3/24).  He could not keep aggro off me when slowing most mobs.  I had to wait longer than normal to make sure the mob was well and truely pissed at the MT.  Even then, I'd get beat on alot and there was no way I could sit until the mob was at 1/2 health. Slowing the ST's mob (Another lvl 60 Pally) always got me beat on even when waiting the same amount of time.  I was pretty regularly on the Rampage lists too, even when making sure I saw the MT get healed and Tash get cast before slowing the mobs.  Which by theory would have made me at minimum 5th on the Rampage Aggro list and only the first 4 (Puller, mt, healer, enchanter - but I never saw the enchanter get rampaged) should have gotten hit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree fully! I definatly wait now and get bitched at it for it :( I suggest standing at max casting range if possible in hopes you dont immediatly draw agro. Since they added the disease counter to turgurs and made it non-disspellable i have died 3 times as many times on raids than before. I strongly suggest you get the focus items from a mage to help reduce your agro.</div></div><hr />
