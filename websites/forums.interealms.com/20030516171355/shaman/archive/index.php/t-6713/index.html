<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As an ogre im thinking about killing ALOT of guards in different cities to earn money and maybe some xp :) Does anybody know what guards are suitable? Felwithe, Kelethin, Freeport?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You are level 52?<br />
<br />
HHK (high hold keep) is very good up to 55, good at 56.  nobles are great exp, guards are green but drop FS and up to 5 pp each.<br />
 zone is close, bank in zone, and you can sell to enchanter vendor on first floor.  outdoor zone, so sow and horse work.<br />
<br />
Katta guards inn Twilight Sea are good.  They have been light blue since I hit 56 (maybe before that?).  two guards at top of ramp, guard and bard at bottom of ramp.<br />
<br />
look for a thread on the wizzies in neriak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Assuming HHK guards havent been changed, thats about the best place to get money in the entire game.  Bring an ae friend with you and clear every guard in the zone with one maybe two casts.  Every guard drops a fs weapon, every time, usually around 5pp on him and sometimes you can get another cash item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Felwithe guards.  They are Pallys, so you have to kill them 1.5 times, but they drop decent cash and the 2HS they drop is worth 20pp with good faction/cha.<br />
<br />
Zone is usually pretty empty too, only people there will be newbies asking for buffs and a couple of people screaming at you for killing their guards.<br />
<br />
I bound in Firepots, took the Kelethin portal, ran to Felwithe, killed guards until my backpacks were full.  Then gate to firepots and take Halas portal.  Sell and repeat until bored.<br />
<br />
Some guards are still light blue at 60 I think.  Only minor exp, but pretty easy cash.</div></div><hr />
