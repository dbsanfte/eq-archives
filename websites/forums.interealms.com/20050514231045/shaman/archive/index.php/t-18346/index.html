<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">No it is not a bug, it is a hack. Low level characters are intentionally hacking in to time on all different servers.  I don't know how it's done but supposedly they patched time and fixed it.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;supposedly&quot; wasn't true, unless they've fixed it since I posted the screenshot. I posted that maybe 5 minutes after I noticed it (go go 2 computers!)</div></div><hr />

Someone in my guild said that they patched time in order to fix this, but then someone else said that they didn't, so who knows :)  The macroquest team is much faster and more motivated than the SOE team, so it wouldn't surprise me if the &quot;fix&quot; was unfixed in a matter of hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The method that the character used to get into Plane of Time is obvious from the frog's name.  I don't think he was referring to hacking and slashing.  What server are you on Karaab?  I think it would be pretty easy for Sony to ban that person's account knowing the server, character name, and the time that it occured  ;)</div></div><hr />

Macroquest has nothing to do with hacking into EQ like this.</div></div><hr />

Apparently it does (according to the other thread titled nearly the same as this)  Looks like we're in for some unscheduled down time soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I spent about 10 minutes at the macroquest forums, and appearantly this is being down with a plugin that was created for macroquest by another hacking community.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maelin. I petitioned shortly after I noticed it and had a GM (yes, a real GM) response saying they were taken care of, but if it has to do with the &quot;free trial accounts&quot;... I suspect more to occur until {insert next emergency downtime here}</div></div><hr />
