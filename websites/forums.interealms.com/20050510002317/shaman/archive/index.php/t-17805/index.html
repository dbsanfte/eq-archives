<br />
yea same here. although I got thinking the other night and I don't think there is any other class that gets a brown bear form come to think of it. Maybe I'm wrong?<br />
<br />
barbarians=white bear<br />
evil races= black bear<br />
vah shir= ?<br />
froglok= brown bear<br />
<br />
who knows- maybe the evil races envy our brown bear!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">poor kitties get brown bears too, and I'm pretty sure either ogre or troll is brown.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Vah shir, frogs and Ogres are brown; trolls and iksar are black; Barbarians are white.  Green bears might be fun, but just think how many times you would get asked &quot;Are you feeling well?&quot;</div></div><hr />
