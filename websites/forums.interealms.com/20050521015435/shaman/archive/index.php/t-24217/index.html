<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone figured out exactly who we are supposed to kill or not kill to get any dragorn quests? <br />
<br />
Can I get Timbor to not scowl at me? <br />
<br />
The only Dragorn I have had talk to me are the Grand historian who is happy to show me the hiding places of his entire race. At the drop of a hat. And the Fella at the Walls of slaughter side of Nobles Causeway. Who wants Murkglider stuff. <br />
<br />
Can we talk to any others? Does whacking the Dragorn have any effect on it? Will Mata muram Make me a Lt. if I kill enough of the scaly bastards?<br />
<br />
There is no discussion on any of the faction issues. Or is it simply Dragorn resistance Good. Everything else kill. And Let some gnome sort it out. <br />
<br />
Enquiring minds want to know. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Basically all GoD type mobs (archers, dogs, snakes and nocs) give a +children of dranik faction hit, which is what most dragorns seem to be on.  Odly the dragorns in NC are on opposite factions to their bretherens in the rest of the zones, so you can kill those too.  What would be realy interesing to see is if you get non-KOS to the dragorns - do they still assist if you pull by them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've caught a few fragments of info from posts here &amp; there.  It seems like some mobs will give you quests, based on Dranik Loyalists faction - as you get better faction, they will talk more with you.<br />
<br />
For example, one poster said some named Dragorn would now hiss at him when hailed, when previously there would be no response at all.<br />
<br />
It also seems like it's a really slow faction to raise, although most everything seems to raise it.</div></div><hr />

I said a couple of years ago it would be nice if you could have ONE faction which, if you saw people fighting your friends, you could PvP on them. (and vv of course)<br />
<br />
Me? Othmir.  I'd be hanging out, fishing in Cobalt Scar, selling my little wares to the vendor, talking with the Chief, chillin to that whacky music they have.<br />
<br />
Along comes Unaware_Druid_01 to slaughter Othmir pups.<br />
<br />
UD_01 has been TASHED!<br />
A Bulthar hits UD_01 for 105!<br />
UD_01 Begins to cast The Gate Spell!<br />
UD_01 is STUNNED!<br />
A Bulthar used UD_01 as toilet paper!<br />
/ooc Unaware_Druid you have ruined your own lands - you will not ruin mine!<br />
<br />
/thread underail<br />
<br />
FWIW I maxxed out one faction fighting in WoS pretty quick. Can't remember the name.<br />
<br />
Good luck on quests.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm up to amiable with most of the dragorn quest NPCs.  Killing nocs, kyvs, ukuns, huvuls, diodites, pyrilens and ikaavs should give you positive Loyalist faction. As I understand it, Mata Muram has enslaved most of the dragorns and some dragorns have become traitors against the their race.  Killing the treacherous dragorns should also give you positive Loyalist faction.</div></div><hr />
