Since LDoN has come out I've been having one heck of a time in EQ, for me it is no longer hang out in bot and aaxp for hours till i want to shoot myself.<br />
<br />
LDoN, for me has been the best thing to happen in a long time.  I love adventures, i get a chance to nuke, dot, OT, and supplemental heal.  My tool chest is being put to work like mad.  <br />
<br />
For example last night we had a mad crazy group, ranjah, sk, pally, cler, me, and mage.  Didn't need crowd control if we got two on a pull sk took one pally took the other.  If we got three, sk took one pally too  k the other, and I would dot, sick dog dog and melle these biatches while the other two dropped.<br />
<br />
I'm by far a well equipped shaman, at level 65 with 33 aa's only have 2500 unbuffed hps (finally) and 1000ac.  Now that may seem like alot but I'm not in a guild and all but two pieces of my stuff is bazaar loot (well scaled avatar is technically bazaar loot).<br />
<br />
Just thought I would post here and proclaim my excitement at an expansion that really lets the shaman shine in my opinion.  I get to use all sorts of goodly spells and tricks that when PoP came out got put on the back burner.<br />
