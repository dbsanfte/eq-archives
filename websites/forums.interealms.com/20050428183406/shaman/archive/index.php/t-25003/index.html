<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There were times in WoW OB that when I went to open my bags, loot a corpse or mine something that I would get stuck.  Was that a function of my system, client-server problems, my internet connection (DSL) or code?<br />
<br />
Or other?<br />
<br />
Not that it won't stop me from playing - just asking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Code Faern.  The mid-open beta patch introduced some unoptimized code that cause significant delays to players when they accessed the &quot;item database&quot; used to transfer items from one entity to another in the game.  By the end of beta, they had it fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">90% likely all you saw was server side lag and that's it.  I have only had true lag or latency ONCE while playing and no doubt it was a local issue with my service provider.</div></div><hr />
