<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was recently doing a Trade in EC with a fellow. I had given my item to him, and he had placed his in the window.  I clicked trade before him and as soon as I hit Trade, I think I went LD.  I've never had a problem with LD's before.  It all seems really fishy to me.<br />
<br />
 I petitioned and sent an email to Verant, but no luck so far. Has anyone else heard of a bug related to this, or seen this happen?  I am really hoping Verant doesn't leave me hanging on this, as all my money was invested in this, and now I'm broke again. =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I clicked trade before him and as soon as I hit Trade, I think I went LD.<br />
<br />
You *think* you went LD?   <br />
<br />
There used to be an old bug that would cause people to get disconnected while doing a trade.  Haven't had it happen to me in a while but it used to happen quite often that clicking the trade button would disconnect you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Have you been in touch with the guy that you were trading with?<br />
<br />
Did he receive the item that you were trading? If not then the server GM should be able to tell from the logs that your item went poof! If that is the case they will probably give it back to you.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dude, if &quot;he had placed his [item] in the window&quot; as you say, then so what if you went LD? If he hit trade then his item went over to you. Jesus this is the stupidest thread I've read today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH<br />

&lt;3 the sig soupy!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember a few months back when I paid 18kpp for a Sarnak Battle Shiled, during the Trade I went LD and nearly had heart attack, but luckly the Shiled was in my inventory when I returned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">this has happened to me. basically you did the trade, went LD before it saved item in your inventory, and it poofed. (at least that's what i think your getting at)<br />
<br />
in my experiences GMs will check this out, and return item to you. however. you should of down this asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Themis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks to most of you for your comments.  I've never had this happen in my years of playing. I've only petitioned to GM once when I got stuck in a wall in Guk. (eons ago it seems).<br />
<br />
I did petition immediately when this happend. I waited for 3 hours and no GM ever responded.  I'm going to keep trying, belive me.<br />
<br />
Soupypoopy, why even bother?<br />
<br />
<br />
Whee -  You have improved your ability to post stupid threads (1)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Berserker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had the same thing happen to me.  It was also with a friend and so I know for sure that the item went Poof!!<br />
<br />
I had to petition over and over, pretty much at the begining when I first logged on.  Then I got the email address of the GM and sent a bunch of emails with the details.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well about 6 weeks later the GM finally gave it back.  By then it was just about the principle of the matter, item was not worth much but I was not about to give up.<br />
<br />
So take heart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blarg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I had an item go poof on me during a trade before.  I had heard of it happening, and it happened to me too.  It was a friend, and the item was a real piece of junk, so I know she wasn't trying to screw me over.  I went linkdead, came back, and she said she never got the item.<br />
<br />
We were scared to see it happen. :P  Thank goodness it was only some thingy work like 50 plat.</div></div><hr />
