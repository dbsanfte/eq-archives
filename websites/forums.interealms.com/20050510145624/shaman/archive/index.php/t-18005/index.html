<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi Fellow Shaman - <br />
<br />
I have posted a few times in the past and have learned a tremendous amount from this website.<br />
<br />
I play on the new Macintosh server, and everyone here started from scratch this summer.  I never played EQ before on PC, and thanks to this site, I am now the second highest shaman on the server, and just half a ding away from being tied with the top dog :) (By level only)  Currently at 52, I have a horse, REIF, Lodi shield(on back), some coterie stuff, leaf scale gloves and other more basic types of items for gear.  Anyhow - that isn't my main point of writing this post.<br />
<br />
We are going to PoH in a two-guild raid for the first time on this server.  While we have many experienced players who still actively play on the PC side, I was wondering if anyone here can tell me what to expect when we get there?  What kind of resists - should I malo first before slow? I did read someting about he golemns being resistant to any slow.  <br />
<br />
Also -if anyone has suggestions for places to level without having a JBB, I would appreciate that too - but that is more of a hunting grounds topic.  I took a couple jaunts out to Wakening Land to check that out, but didn't seem to find any &quot;camps&quot;. I am amiable to CoV at the moment, haven't checked since our last Kael raid.  I did go up and pet Woushi :)<br />
<br />
I should also mention that we do not have Yeshka or LDoN expansions.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Hollowshade has been broken(can't zone out, need port) for over a month now, so it is pretty difficult to get to teneb and Katta/twilight.<br />
<br />
Thanks for helping a level 52 Newb out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sullon One</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i love true new servers<br />
<br />
i should buy a mac~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tikcuf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you want to get to Katta/twilight run through Fungus Groves and click on the porter...  Will drop you off in Twilight Sea so you can run to Katta, TM, SD and beyond from there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well - already i have help.  I have read about the Scarlet desert options and I wanted to check it out, but  didn't know there was a port in Fungus.  I will have to do some research on that.  Thanks for that tidbit, nobody on my server suggested that, but I didn't ask either:)<br />
<br />
And yeah - I dont' think that I would have enjoyed EQ as much if it wasn't on a new server.  The highest level we have on our server is 61 because they haven't fixed the flagging for the upper zones (talking out of my butt right there, but that is what I understand the problem is.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>nuzum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">RAWR welcome to the club, are you a troll, if not you aint nothing RAWR.<br />
<br />
As to the golems in hate, you can disease slow them (if I remember correctly).  the magic slow dont work, and if you dont have either just nuke the mofo down.  Watch for agro cause they'll chew you up, let your tank tank and hold agro dont over dot or nuke.  and good luck up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Being on a server like that sounds like so much fun.<br />
<br />
Since you don't have Malo or Malos yet, you are probably just as well off slowing first.  Malosini and Slow have the same resist checks, so if you can land malosini you could have landed slow as well.  The golems need disease slow, if you have it yet (can't remember what level it is).<br />
<br />
You'll probably figure out pretty quick how resistant everything is, and you may decide to start trying malosini first because of lower aggro if slow bounces alot.<br />
<br />
For soloing, you might try poking around the dreadlands or Burning wood, those should be pretty decent in the low 50s.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There's a mac server?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Oh yeah - also. The guild I am a member of, DarkConquest, is the only high level guild so far on the server so far that can get into the crypt (Rougue) and hold it.  We have done so a few times, and haven't gotten the JBB.  We have killed the mob about 4 or 5 tmes, but still no JBB.  That is the missing piece for me at the moment.  Sit on horse, do the JBB thing.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah - saving for a horse for the first charachter you ever have is quite the challenge ;)  But makes me feel really proud.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ogru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One little tip: The ashenbones (big bone dragons) do follow the dragon casting rule. IE, you must be within melee range to slow them. All but the golems you should be able to slow without too much of a problem. The golems there are very very MR, even after a malx. So stick to disease slow with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might find the Amygdalen warriors quite hard to slow at 52, I'd suggest you open with your malosini line (not sure which you have then) just to be sure you don't get aggro, and then alternate malosini with slow until one or both land. Other mobs, except the named/mini-named, are easy to slow. Take some MR gear if you can to resist the toad's fear, which can be fatal for the raid sometimes.<br />
<br />
Hardest part in fear is the break-in, try to let the tanks get aggro as you're not much use if you die from slow aggro on the second mob. I'm sure the more experianced of you will give clear instructions on the break-in strategy.<br />
<br />
For hunting, Old Sebilis is good at 52 and you can farm some good cash there from the gems, plus a few good items. I'd get in the crypt at every oportunity, if you can take out Emp then you'll be getting some nice spells that your guild will be needing soon. <br />
<br />
Other nice xp places might be PoHate (if you have a wizzy friend), The Hole, Karnor's Castle if its not a train fest (getting a bit low for you now though) and of course if you can get access (not sure if that's the flagging problem you refer to?) then tier 1 PoP is just coming into your level range too, and is great xp if you have a good enough group to keep going there.<br />
<br />
Kael arena is a nice raid target with the quest armour, but you seem to need to stay a while to get past the streaky droprate. Or for single groups you can probably solo the easier mobs around the arena for faction and xp and the odd chance of a drop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>wickibet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As I learned here, and use almost exclusively, i always cast slow right next to the tank, so if I get aggro the tank is right there to ragain. Thanks for whoever put that tip in the madicine cabinet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Level 52 -<br />
High Hold Keep<br />
the bards and nobles on the second floor.  will be a bit tuff at 52, but very doable (seen iksar shaman there often, so the absence of a jbb is not a real problem).<br />
<br />
this is both very good exp and quite nice cash (no shot at a real big drop) ... 2 to 5 plat per kill, and the guards always drop a FS shortsword that sells for 5 plat downstairs.  guards are way green, the nobles bards are dark blue until 54, then start to go LB.  nice ZEM, since it is a city zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Goldy, you gave him tips on Fear and suggested Hate. I think if you read his post again you may want to give him tips on Hate and suggest Fear.. ;)<br />
<br />
Could do a lot worse than Veksar at 52 tbh Wicki, gone very quiet there on the older servers so may or may not be the same on yours, but a good group there can push through reasonable xp whilst making some nice money. HHK is good, as Baz suggests, or even Hole. Nightstalkers in PoN are also doable with a low 50s group and very nice xp if I recall.<br />
<br />
Good luck with your PoH raid in the meantime. :)</div></div><hr />
