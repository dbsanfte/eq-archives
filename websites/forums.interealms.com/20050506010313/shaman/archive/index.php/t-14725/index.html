<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When they opened up some zones for everyone I got some AAs on my wizard and shaman and that charm offcourse.<br />
<br />
What I am wondering if if I would get those flags again for my SK would he get AAs for those now after patch or was that only for those that had the flags when they did the change??<br />
<br />
Wondering cause there is a few that would be easy to do and fun and the free AAs and the nice charm is never wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My monk finished off his Sol Ro access and after doing so, he went back to the charm dude and told him a story and got another AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got Torment flag after the patch and went back and got an additional AA.  The charm stats increase instantly but you have to go back and tell a story to get your AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes when you complete a zone that opens a new plane you will get stats pluss an aa, but you can't just kill like VZ/TZ and hope to get one. You need to complete the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The wizard and shaman, yes. The shadowknight, no. It was only for people who already had flags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goratha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Thats not true.. My ranger had no flags tell we got him in some grummus/tt fights and he got aa's for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The wizard and shaman, yes. The shadowknight, no. It was only for people who already had flags.<br />

Nope. My shaman got his VZ flag (allowing access to ToSR) after the patch and after he had recieved the charm and associated aa points. When did the stories bit with the dorf, I recieved another aa point. So you will still get the aaxp reward even if you recieved the corresponding flag after the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You already had the charm and flags, Tugela. This guy's shadowknight has zero flags and no charm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Rathelon, you are incorrect.  <br />
<br />
You can start a level 1 newbie today, level it up and take it through a POJ trial (for example - you can also take newbie for grummus kill, do alt quests, kill behemoth, etc) for a free AA point, just tell the dorf guy the story and the newbie will get the AA for having acquired access... in the case of doing a trial, for valor/storms access.<br />
<br />
My friends mage had 0 flags when the patch was put in.   After she got level 55 (and default access to the plane of storms), we took her to storms and put her in a group that was turning in for tactics alt quest.   She received the flag for tactics, then she went and hailed the dorf in POK and got her free AA.</div></div><hr />
