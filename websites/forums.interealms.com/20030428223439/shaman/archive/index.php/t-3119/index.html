<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I believe it drops somewhere in Grieg's End...<br />
<br />
But that's all I can tell you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yar, from Grieg's End.  Actual spawn point varies, I think there are several possible spots.  Named mob, something like Alchemist Varona.  Allakhazam's has some info.  Spawn is fairly close to the zone, and is easily a single group effort if you are mid-50s.<br />
<br />
There are  a bunch of named that pop around there.  Bring a tracker, and just mow thru the green and light blue trash.  There are some interesting features to that place, but it is annoyingly low level until you penetrate fairly deep.<br />
<br />
Varona does not drop the stone every time.  I've killed her 4 times now, and not gotten the stone.  Damnit.  A guildie has gotten it, tho, so my facts are straight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shamma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I am just wondering.. How mcuh are these stones? I should get myself one (depending on how expensive it is)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have NEVER seen one for sale at ANY price... but that's just me... maybe someone else has a PC on it.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Durnitol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wait wait is this the same Dorf chick that regens at like 1000 hp per tick? cause I have tried her with a single group, and it is just NOT possible without at LEAST a rogue and probably a monk with a VERY good tank. She just regens too damn much. you have to ahve some insane single group DPS to kill her.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Odd, we whacked her in almost no time at all.  Had no issue.<br />
<br />
I'm planning to go keel her sometime soonish to try again, will let you know what I find out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Durnitol is right, she has some major regen on her.. <br />
<br />
I was fighting in the zone in 2 boxing with my mage and I somehow pulled her, I think she spawned on me while I was looking for a pull. <br />
<br />
So I beating on her with the mage epic pet and tossing in dot's and her hitpoints didn't move until I burned hard with my mage. But there was no way I can keep the DPS on her.  So I made a shaman dog and got this nearby cleric to join me.  We had Shammy dog, Epic Mage Pet, and cleric Hammer pet beating on it.. <br />
<br />
We still couldn't get he down below 90% health.  So I called for a guildie to come help 60SK and when she got there we were able to finally have the DPS to take her out. <br />
<br />
I think I was fighting her at the zone for at least 30-40 mins before getting the SK to help.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive got one and its nice having an extra 10% on Alchemy skills... Now I just need MORE money :)<br />
<br />
I wasnt there at the fight, had to camp 10 mintues earlier, but I was told it was a LONG 30 minute fight for 5 guildies(Cleric/Chanter/3 50+ tanks)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is true.  She spawns in different places in the zone, some can be fairly deep in.  She is the only named Alchemist.  As far as I know she doesn't have a specific place holder.  Seems like if you're there for a while and have been removing spawns, she shows up. So maybe she a rare random spawn on the zone spawn table.<br />
<br />
Varona does not drop the stone every time.  I've killed her 4 times now, and not gotten the stone.  Damnit.  A guildie has gotten it, tho, so my facts are straight. <br />
<br />
This is true, it seems to be a semi-rare drop.  I've been in two groups that killed her, the first time no stone, the second time she had it.  Our guild has killed her maybe a dozen times or so, and only two of our shamans have the stone.<br />
<br />
It equips in your secondary slot and looks like a bag.  I've never seen one for sell.  Personally, I'd not pay more than 500pp for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Her name is Alchemist Valrona.<br />
<br />
The stone looks like a stone - not a bag.<br />
<br />
It is NOT no rent.  It is NOT no drop.  It IS lore.<br />
<br />
Her regen is high - but not godly.  Figure that if you can kill Cazel in Oasis, you can take her.<br />
<br />
I killed her once and got the stone.<br />
<br />
For the rest of the details, check my post on Illia's:<br />
<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?id=7596<br />
<br />
As far as spawn timers and PHs go.... we were the only ones in the zone when we entered.  She was up.  We killed her after we dug through the zone to her (figure an hour).  We proceeded to get wiped out shortly thereafter.<br />
<br />
During the CR, the druid told me she was up again.  So respawn was around an hour or two.<br />
<br />
Maybe we got lucky about not having PHs.... maybe I got lucky on the drop.  Either way, this was my experience.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Has anyone seen this item for sale?<br />
<br />
PC on it?<br />
<br />
I am working on a complete set of geerloks for all of my tradeskills, and this, plus smithing and pottery and baking, are the ones I still lack.<br />
<br />
Although if I use my blessed fishing pole for the PoTC quest like I'm supposed to, I'll have to aquire another one of those :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have NEVER seen one of these for sale.<br />
<br />
If I were to sell mine, I would likely ask about 5K for it.  It's not an easy item to get and it's the ONLY item in the game (that I'm aware of) that provides a skill modifier to alchemy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ganzon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Killed her myself not too long ago, she spawned VERY deep inside a lot farther than I had expected (without a ranger for tracksort, and with a map that had only 1 spawn point listed near the zone-in and less than half of the zone actually mapped, we kinda stumbled upon her :) ), and with a decent group it was still rather hard to get there. Her regen wasn't impossible, but the room we were in had adds that would spawn trap-like throughout the battle and made it rather difficult. Didn't drop a stone :(<br />
<br />
Next time :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kudelini Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">We are shamans right?  Who cares what her regen is.  Disease her and knock that regen right out.  or does that work on her??<br />

That is an old myth.  Disease DoT's do NOT halt regen.<br />

<br />
Finally ran into this lady, I zoned into Grieg and she was standing there on her own. After blowing my entire mana bar on her and not doing any significant damage, I went for reinforcements.  No stone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got my stone yesterday in a Grieg's end raid, the alchemist valrona was near the servitor of luclin. It's an easy mob for a 3 group raid ( slowable of course ).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I have an alchemy skill of 180 and even with a philosopher's stone i stay at 180 when it is equiped.<br />
You will not see the change in your list of skills when equipping an item that gives a bonus to one of them.  The only thing that it changes is your effective skill, which improves your chances of success on a given combine.  If you had a skill of 179 and had this stone equipped while making a titan potion (trivial at 180), you would still even have a chance of skilling up to 180 on that potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i think what he meant by it looks like a bag is when it is equipped it has a wrist bag graphic, but the icon is not a bag, it is a stone. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">We took her down with a one group effort.<br />
<br />
Group was 1 warrior, 1 sk , myself and a cleric.<br />
<br />
I kept taunt during the whole fight, which was about an hour or so long, with DoT's and JBB.<br />
<br />
As long as she was kept slowed, it was no strain on the cleric to keep me healed for the whole fight, just a pain cause it took so long, due mostly to her insane regen.<br />
<br />
Oh, and she didn't drop the stone. :\<br />
<br />
Was kinda worth it for the experience of the fight though :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Tracked her through the zone the other night, we cleared everything as we moved through, got a couple named (druid now has a lovely knockback brrom, and rogue now has a nice warrior taunt helm to mock those who didn't want to come.   Nobody got beer goggles or med kits).   She ended up tracking as behind the locked door, or possibly up in Griegs area :(    Coupld reach her, so no attempt at a stone yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Lyam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">A friend who has a Toon that lives in the Bazaar, said he saw one for sale today for 100k.  <br />
<br />
Is it worth 100k? To me no, I am a casual player and will probably never see that much Plat.  Though to others who are able to commit more time to EQ it may well be worth that much.  <br />
<br />
What does everyone else think, is it worth 100k?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Absolutely not worth 100K.<br />
<br />
If I were to sell mine, I would expect to get 10-15K MAX for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Haggr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">From my understanding of the skill modifying items that once you hit max you are at max. Nothing will raise you over the max. so those saying &quot;wow with this I can have over 180 in Alchemy&quot;,  I think your wrong.  I know it will help with making stuff when your under 180 say a60 and trying for something that trivials at 173 or so. It should raise your skill higher as an effect to help make that spell, it wont make it become trivial you can still skill up. But the chance of making it are better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Not true.  Items such as this can and will raise you above the normal attainable limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">If able, I would suggest laying every single desiese dot on her you can.  One might not work all that well, but stack em all and ya got some damage going.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">From my understanding of the skill modifying items that once you hit max you are at max.<br />
<br />
The rule is that no tradeskill can ever be higher than 255, either actual skill or skill with modifier.  All tradeskills other than alchemy can get to actual skill of 250, but with modifiers will not be higher than an effective skill of 255.  If you're using a 15% modifier at 250 skill your effective skill is still 255.  This may have changed now that stats can go over 250 but that has not been officially suggested or confirmed.<br />
<br />
Alchemy, however, cannot get to 250, so the Philopher's Stone will be more useful for us.  By my calculations you will get the full benefits until you are at 230 alchemy which is still well beyond what we can achieve even at level 65.  <br />
<br />
So no worries, the stone will still give you the full 10% benefit no matter what your alchemy is at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Petercorbin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Actually according to the dev team the skill max for any skill is 252.. anyway the +10% would give you a virtual skill of 198 at 180 to maybe succeed more at stuff you wont be able to sell for more than cost.  Grats!  I saw one of these for sale for 10k and I had 120k in the bank at the time and I didnt buy it.. I *might* pay 3-5k for it as a novelty but not more than that... I've already blown enough cash on this skill</div></div><hr />
