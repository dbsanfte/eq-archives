<br />
This is a great community, full of great people.  We have had so many discussions (even alot of flames ;&gt;) that you guys made my days at work go so much faster! <br />
<br />
But alas, all great things must come to an end.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Take care Wildaar! Although I am fairly new to the forum, your posts always rank up there as some of my favorites. LOL I've enjoyed some of your posts so much I seriously considered starting a toon on your server just so I could try to talk to you ingame. Anyways, you seem like a stand-up guy and you gotta respect that in a PC world. Good luck out there!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Take care Wildaar, but like someone mentioned; dont give your stuff away just yet. Just let the account expire when it does and if you decide to come back, you'll still have your chars &amp; eqpt.<br />
<br />
If you decide after being gone a few months that you are indeed done with EQ, just shoot me your account info :p<br />
<br />
Hope to see you back here soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gytmee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I may be just a lurker, but I am just that - a guy who reads a lot, and hasn't posted much.  I have been playing EQ since the day it was released to &quot;the public&quot;, and my shaman exclusively for well over 2 years now, with about 150 days played.  Anyway my point is this - although I don't post much, I have read, enjoyed, gained knowledge about our class, and benefited from many of your posts, Wildaar.  You have been a great contributor to this site, and I wish only the best for ya.  I look forward to reading your posts even in &quot;retirement&quot;.  <br />
<br />
Although it is derived from a popular saying, I try and live by it as much as I can, and I hope you do too - Life is a journey, and the enjoyment is IN the journey, NOT the destination.  Take time to enjoy your journey, my friend.....</div></div><hr />

Wildaar's not the only recent retiree.  I'd like to see a &quot;Retirement Hall&quot; where the old toothless geezers go to gum their food (pudding=no chewing!) and tell us how hard it was in the days before Kunark when their best weapon was the Mortificator's Staff they had and they envied that warrior with the Langseaxe of the Wolves.</div></div><hr />
