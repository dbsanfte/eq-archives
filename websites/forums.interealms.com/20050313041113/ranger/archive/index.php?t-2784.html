The patch that left the warders and vulak up for a bit caused our server GM to /kill the warders(naturaly). I'm hearing rumors about primal not dropping in zone now and all the mobs seeing through invis. Has the zone changed on your server at all and are primals still dropping? Or is someone pulling my leg?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Today, zoned in, sentinel says he's awake, ONE mob up in whole zone, and it saw invis.<br />
<br />
So yes, something's bugged.</div></div><hr />

I didn't test how close I could get but just coned a lot from behind sneaking.  3 Primals and 5 priceless dropped for us since we had to kill everything to get to the FA.  <br />

Last night was my first time there and we had those Caretakers I think gate on us about 20+ times lol that was annoying.  We had a group of 2 in there to clear the zone, but I was wondering besides the obvious nuking are there any other helpfull ways to stop them from gating?  I tried call of fire, and pallies and clerics tried to stun them but it wasn't working.  Call of Fire and the stuns were hitting and doing dmg, but we weren't getting any interupts.  Any help would be great :)</div></div><hr />

And yes they saw thru invis as well.</div></div><hr />
