<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've a cleric friend near the end of his epic and, just for laughs, I said I'd have a go at soloing old Ragefire - with a force standing by to kill him if (when?) I die.<br />
<br />
I've got a JBB and will have my epic and Canni V by then, but no horse and no torpor so I will be relying on Kragg's mending and chloroblast for healing (maybe some calimony potions instead of chloroblast). I'll also get buffed by the raid, my gear isn't good enough to do this without aego/kei/resist buffs etc.<br />
<br />
Is it doable at 60? I've only fought him once before as part of a massive overkill (slow landed easily). <br />
<br />
If you think its achievable with my equipment and spells, does anyone have suggestions on tactics? I'm thinking alpha pet as suicide squad (won't survice the AE for long) malosini, slow, maybe cripple?, epic, pox, jbb. Renew epic and pox as required, and heal as needed, JBB the rest of the time. I figure Pox is the most mana efficient dot I have. My evocation isn't maxed so not too keen on using torrent of poison due to fizzles. So spell line up:   malosini, slow, cripple?, pox, chloroblast, KM, Canni IV - and one more, plus maybe drop cripple for something else like plague. Not sure what to use, I could use BoN but might go oom if I go that route. Or maybe root if he's rootable. Clicky sow boots would be used to counteract dispells.<br />
<br />
I'm also wondering if I should go all-out on resist gear (fear will be a big problem I guess), or if I should try to keep my hp up a bit too so I get good use of Kragg's mending without risking a few unlucky interrupts killing me.<br />
<br />
Or is this all a joke and I'll just get wasted in no time? I heard a few rumours that Ragefire got upgraded a while back but dunno if that's true at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Spiritbinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can slow Rage ? Dont think so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I slowed Ragefire just fine once at 59... No, no screenshot and no log to prove it, but I did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ragefire hits in the low 300s, and his fire AE does as much as 500 damage.  He also dispells, and fears. Frankly, I don't think you'd be able to pull it off without some pretty hoss gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've easily landed disease slow on ragefire, though tugurs would never hold.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This has me very interested.  Ask Runemoon if he minds if I give it a shot too if you fail Goldark, hehe.  <br />
<br />
Anyways, I have torpor, malo, pox, epic and horse, but no JBB.  I have pretty decent equipment, currently sitting at about 1064ac and 2700hp self buffed.  Raid buffed, I have seen myself at over 4k hp and 1097 AC, although it might be more with different types of buffs on (and Virtue and not Aego).  Looking forward to trying this someday....biggest name so far that I have attempted is Yeldema, and he was a pushover, although I did manage to get adds the first two times I tried her.<br />
<br />
Let me know Gold when you guys go out there, I would love to tag along and help if you need it and to participate in the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rage is slowable. Slowed with turgurs myself. Make sure you are in melee range.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I had to crawl up into a pretty uncomfortable place, but I slowed Ragefire about a week ago, at level 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slowed rage with turgurs the last time we did him. We had 1 group with me a warrior, an sk, a monk, a cleric and a rogue. Most lvl 65. I buffed mr and fr. No one got feared for any substantial amount of time that i saw and i resisted most ae's with 225ish fire resist. After the fight i asked the cleric if she ever healed and she wasn't sure. I'm sure I could probably solo ragefire especially if I was fully raid buffed. <br />
<br />
The 2 biggest issues I would see for you would be no malo / no torpor. With out malo it's going to be alot harder to land a slow on him. Even with malo at lvl 65 he resisted turgurs once or twice last time I did him. With out torpor you have to use the less efficient and much riskier KM to heal yourself.<br />
<br />
As far as specific strats I would definitely use an appropriately equiped and buffed pet since they now use the owners resists and can actually survive the ae and deal some descent dmg. Also obviously get your resist buffs up and idealy I'd say 200+ on mr and fr if you can reasonably do it.<br />
<br />
I'd setup a bit away from ragefire. When he spawns I'd lead with insideous decay and then try to time a disease slow so that it landed on him right as he got into range. Then I would try a malosini and turgurs on him altho i'm not sure how possible thats going to be with out malo.<br />
<br />
Once you've got the debuff side of things done there are 2 routes you can go. You can either dump dots on him and nuke him etc and hope you can kill him before he kills you or you can go for the slow death mode. Don't do any damage but mana free dmg (jbb/epic/pet/melee/ds etc) and save all your mana for healing yourself. As long as you can survive long enough he will die eventually that way.<br />
<br />
If you want to practice one of the easy ae dragons in ww would be fairly compairable I think.<br />
<br />
Malo and torpor would definitely make it alot easier. Lvl 61 for the new pet, new disease slow and Spirit call if you've got some aa would make things even easier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">no offense goldy  but i dont think u got the gear.<br />
<br />
ud need high resists and ac, to solo ragefire-  u cant keep him rooted and heal yourself, i dont tink !  if u had the lvl 61 pet, and gave it the ihb from lodizal and something in offhand with 80+ cold dd  u might try kiting it about-  skyfire bad for adds tho ?<br />
<br />
if u get fully buffed and your doggy with 60+ buffs u could try it, but otherwise - asta la vista goldy!<br />
<br />
However  would be fun to try )<br />
<br />
maybe u could do it with a 61+ chanter who has dire charm?  or was this nerfed in yesterdays patch?   he could speed ya pet tash rage and charm a mob to help ya pet.<br />
<br />
hope to hear about your exploits anyhow)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I know he is slowable - I've done the fight before, landed malosini and then slow, both first time - from within melee range. I think you might need to be in melee range, so could be tricky solo - last time the tank engaged before I slowed, so that made things easier. Maybe I was lucky on resists too, plus bard and tash helped of course.<br />
<br />
Well sounds like maybe I'm a tad optimistic to try this at the moment, but with malo, torpor, level 61 and spirit call perhaps it'd be more realistic. I doubt I can achieve that before the cleric will be ready though.  I'm still gonna try without though :) Or perhaps we could duo him Valsuvious? That sounds a lot more viable especially as you've got the crucial lvl 60 spells and dots stack now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Slow is excellent, but no way could I live through his AE and melee.  Blasted dispell removes Torpor.... but not slow or dots, thank the Gods.<br />
<br />
I'd imagine it might barely be doable with a partner, but you'd be unbuffed PDQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shandy dispell is not a big problem clicky sow boots work just fine. Its the AE that's gonna kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm not that sure that Rage's AE damage would be a problem.  Sure, it is large when it hits for full ... but at 65 with nearly 200 or so FR in appropriate gear, even unbuffed, I don't take many hits for 500 and outright resist often.  Plus, Rage doesn't fear.<br />
<br />
Landing slow on him is a bit rough ... Someone with Malos/Malosinia ought to do quite well, I'm not sure I could get it in fast enough with Malo/Malosini.  Might be worth trying next cleric epic, though. =)<br />
<br />
I definately wouldn't try this without Torpor, tho.  KM just takes too long to cast for this sort of encounter.  I'd recommend having TM also, just in case a couple AE's hit for full and you need an emergency catch-up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm sure I could take him. You just use click buffs like in WW to keep torpor from being eaten. I'll try next cleric epic I help with.(Never)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, I always seem to get dispelled in the middle of casting something and forget to reclicky. :(</div></div><hr />
