<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have made a few of these and ran a couple tests and they do not appear to work. They are supposedly mana preservation 5% but I had a cleric test the beneficial one with different heals and no change with/without the potion in mana percentage. I tested the Ice Focus potion - I used 8% mana consistently casting velium strike. Drank the potion - 8% mana. Anyone get these to work or are they just broken? <br />
<br />
On a side note they do last a long time, I have died every time before they wore off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think these are broken, it should give you an indication that it is working by just looking at your spells mana cost.  It would say something like Mana: 350  Your cost: 325  etc.  <br />
<br />
Definitely not working for me as I tested them out alot in LoY.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just made a crapload of these and was wondering if you guys are testing the correct spells with each type.<br />
<br />
cause the first set works with spells lvl 20 and below<br />
second are like 44 and below and third are 65 and below I think.<br />
<br />
I need to dump these if they dont work =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Mojo, i tried the poison IV one, and magic IV one, and have yet to notice a difference. That doesnt mean they arent working, but if they are, the difference to me, is not noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well I vendor sold these and the sell back isnt bad.  its not great but you don't lose that much money.  Id say these are good skill up potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Maybe I'll make some lower level potions and have like a level 20 character test them out, it could be we just can't tell with only 5% savings at the higher levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have made the poison IV and maybe its me but I used to cast blood of saryn, ancient bane, breath of uthar  on mobs in PoG and after casting all those I had around 70% mana left..  When I used the potion I had around  75-77% or so.( this depended on my casting checks kicking in)<br />
<br />
also I made the cold IV one for a lvl 65 BST who uses his cold dd alot..he said he noticed an improvement in the mana when casting this spell,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You do realize that no mana preservation focus has a fixed percentage ?<br />
<br />
The potion probably will save between 1%(or 0?)to 5%, which makes it hardly noticeable with a mana pool of 4k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did cold and poison ones, didn't see anything =(<br />
<br />
Going to make a II variety and give it to my 33 BL, he should see a differance, I'm thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Think about it a sec.  The mana preservation runs from 0 to 5%, so roughly an average of 2.5%.  On a 300 mana spell - that will average 7.5 mana.  <br />
<br />
Don't spend it all in one place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These most certainly DO work.  I have two people that buy Fire IV and Magic IV from me for quading in HoH.  They swear by them.<br />
<br />
Also - a trick for your sales tactics... although the potions are very expensive, you can resell the last dose of a 10 dose potion to the vendors for about 1100p.  This seriously offsets the cost to your customers.  Just make them aware that they actually should only use 9 and then sell the last one to recoup money.</div></div><hr />

Wow, bet that won't last.  :p  Radars picking up an incoming nerf!  <br />
<br />
How much are you selling these for dose wise?  I just started making them and I'm afraid people are ignorant of them.  Going to be slow to develop a market for them.  Also, which ones sell the best?  Fire and Magic and Beneficial, I'm thinking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fire and Magic are the only things I see requested.<br />
<br />
Since the two people buying from me are guildmates, I sell them the potions at 180p/dose.  It covers my costs and gives me room to breathe if I have a fail or two.<br />
<br />
If I were selling these in the bazaar, I'd charge NO LESS THAN 250p/dose - more likely 300p/dose.</div></div><hr />
