<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That is true but I see the expansions and the idea behind them, Kunark especially, as the super change. <br />
<br />
I started on Innoruuk in April of 99 and left in September of that year with a few mid 20's characters. After mid-20's finding mobs was like finding hen's teeth. The 100+ in Oasis, the spawn battles at the Aviak village, the campfest that was CT before Rubicite was removed and the JBoot camp in Najena are prime examples. Getting to 50 was rough. A lot of people just quit rather than get involved in KS mob chases.<br />
<br />
I came back on Xev in December of 2000 and the natural progression to OT and the rest of Kunark made it easy to get to 50 with more mobs than players in a zone for a change.<br />
<br />
Also the coming of age of the Warrior, who just plain sucked prior to the expansion goodies. Shaman too, hehe imagine a JBB/Fungi Shaman playing the old world before the Kunark upgrade.</div></div><hr />

I second that.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, removal of the manastone and restricting it to old zones had quite an impact (on clerics and druids at least).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's another vote for &quot;level 60&quot; as the biggest change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bad:<br />
- The acceptance of the way ubar-guilds play and the design of many zones to suit only that kind of play.<br />
- The stupid timesinks to prevent people from entering areas/zones that werent finished when the expansion was released.<br />
<br />
Good/Bad:<br />
- AA skills can theoretically add some spice to the game but at the same time it forced extremely wellequipped people back into exp-grinding in Sebilis/FG/Velks/... thereby completely overcrowding those zones.<br />
<br />
Good:<br />
- Nexus making it much easier to get around than it used to be.<br />
- Soul binders.<br />
<br />
Changes that should have been made:<br />
- Many zones that are almost empty most of the time should be made more attactive/accessible (ie. Hole/Griegs/Akheva/Howling Stones).<br />
- Make factions mean something.<br />
- Fix scripts/quests that have been known not to work for a long time.<br />
- Fix drops for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">good call soupy on the hell levels thing, insignificant really.  <br />
<br />
I would say the addition of levels 51-60 had the greatest impact.  Just look at what they had to do only two months after kunark was added!  Vox and Naggy were level capped!  Obviously this signified a huge change in the level of difficulty of pre-existing content.  Look at what used to be hard.  Efreeti camp used to be hard.  Now it's soloed by shamans and rangers and monks and mages and probably other classes too!   Heck, I bet a really really good druid could do it.  You can single pull the whole thing at lvl 60 after all.  It's difficult to learn how, but I have done it enuf times.  Used to be my favorite little duo spot.  Nowadays I just duo there with my little monkie EQ girlfriend and we just sell off the boots to upgrade her equipment.  They still sell well and the camp isn't that contested on my server.  Also the exp is really nice pre-60 and about half as good at 60.  It's quite viable as an exp spot for me.  <br />
<br />
Um, Lguk . . was that ever hard?  let's see.  Perma basement?  Nah, way easy since you can single pull at like 57.  Basically the old world content became trivial and they had to add new content for the game to continue to be challenging.  It was an entirely new game from Kunark on.  <br />
Most people never pass the kunark game, which really has to be played for quite a while to build a character's power.  We've all been there, played that.  The easier velious content is the same idea as kunark content and is used in the same manner.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think Landragoran is right up to a point. But even without the change in level cap I think the same effect would have occurred.<br />
<br />
Players demand new stuff in the expansions - so the new stuff has to have better stats than the old stuff, or no one will bother. Therefore, players get more powerful over time, and older encounters get trivialised. The change of level cap was an extreme example of this, but I think it would have happened anyway.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I agree with Xican - Complete Heal, and it was't a positive impact.<br />
<br />
I admit to only playing EQ since August of 01 (I'm such a newbie :) ) but from what I understand, the MA / CHeal Chain method of engaging mobs is one of the biggest problems facing the developers.  <br />
<br />
In addition, it has effectivly 'capped' an entire branch of spells - namely the healing spells.  As HPs go up, up, up, there isn't any real way to upgrade the heal lines with out skewing things.  Whats after Complete Heal?  'Really Complete Heal'?  'Complete And I Mean It This Time Heal'?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Without a doubt, Complete Heal.  It created heal circles, allowed people to trivialize uber mobs to an extent that VI is now having to work pretty hard to come up with encounters and don't depend on the traditional heal circle (ie, luclin uber encounters like IV, Shei, etc.)<br />

Look at some of the really high end guilds.  They have like 3 of every class and 12 clerics . . .<br />

Kunark was out so I am one of many who has always existed in a all-the-way-to-60 world.<br />

<br />
AO came out - Hybrid penalties removed. (Good thing)<br />
<br />
DAoC Came out - Classes revisited.<br />
<br />
AA - good thing.<br />
<br />
Luclin - horrid addition. I don't know about you but I have to turn the clip plane almost all the way down to be able to play.<br />
<br />
Alchemy - still crap.<br />
<br />
Tradeskills- Nicely done. Farming items is still a pain, but at least it doesn't take 2 minutes for a combine. (DAoC).<br />

<br />
IMHO, positive or negative ...<br />
<br />
1) Raising the level cap, destroying encounter balance and driving the &quot;level fast as hell&quot; mentality. This also equates to more effort being channeled into high-end content creation and zero invested in lower end stuff. Course, since everyone wants to level, no one cares about the lower end stuff. AA = good thing.<br />
<br />
2) The move toward multiple group encounters and away from soloing and single group encounters. Thank god for channels now.<br />
<br />
3) The anti-twinking movement. Massive amounts of no drop gear, level limits on zones, trival loot code, maximum levels per encounter. There was a time when the best gear you could get was all dropable.<br />
<br />
4) The move toward class specific gear. Later Rubicite and Lusterous Russet and hello Blonde Female Barbarian Shaman only.<br />
<br />
5) The slow destruction of the economy by not discovering a way to remove some pp from the game.<br />
<br />
6) Misguided efforts to balance raping certain classes like necros and mages while making clerics and warriors an absolute necessity.<br />
<br />
7) Continued and heightened reliance on rare drop/rare spawn method on item control rather than quests/tradeskills.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ezeekial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I'd have to say Kunark is the biggest single change. Shifted the balance from caster to melee.

CH is not a &quot;change&quot; as that's existed since release (and sometime before that in Beta). The CHANGE related to CH was the 10 new levels, and the massive increase in effective warrior hp due to level, Defensive Discipline, and gear upgrades. <br />
<br />
CH always existed. It just wasn't unbalancing until the L 60 endgame and CH rotations. Now, it's just about broken the high-end game, and totally screwed up class (and to a large extent game) balance. But that's another rant. <br />

<br />
I personally think they need to do something really innovative to make PoP work ... AA with Luclin was a good start (IMHO), merely raising the level limit to 70 would be a cheap get out. And probably break the game (again) too.</div></div><hr />

I am very much afraid that my own opinion is very close to that of Murphy. I think that profit was always number one.  The difference is that now I think short term profit is seen as more important than the wants of EQ1's player base - because of EQ2 and SWG.<br />

Sony always had their hand in the pot from the begining so I don't see how this changed anything.  First they were 989 and then Red Eye Interactive and then they became Verant  before release.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Actually, I'd say introduction of planes would be my choice.  The rise of multi-group raids changed things radically.  I think the only raid-type encounter in the original game was Vox, though I'm not sure if she was available originally.  Nagafen was definitely later than Vox, but with PoH and PoF, entire zones were dedicated to multi-group raids.<br />

99% of the game prior to that was solo or single group encounters.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>balith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">I would say the planes. This was the first time Verant tweaked the classes by equipment. It was also the first time they gave a zone that catered to (at the time) the uber guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Biggest original change was the exp penalty reduction on death.  But that's been around so long the majority of current players would never know what it was like.  <br />
<br />
I do think the biggest change came with Kunark, and equipment.  Kunark brought new equipment that was so vastly superior to anything in the old world that it changed the game entirely.  When you had meleers who went from the best weapons being 1:3 ratios of 7/21 or 8/24 to ratios of 1:2 or better on weapons that were trivial to obtain, it did two things.  One it gave a huge burst of melee power, and two it raised expectations far too high.  People expected, no demanded, that they get similiar increases in power every step of the way.  It raised the bar too high in one fell swoop, and VI had no choice but to keep raising it.  Now people simply toss aside weapons that are not better than a 1:2 ratio, they are deemed unworthy of lvl 1 twinks.  <br />
<br />
For me anyway it was a sign that VI didn't care about the game, they were going to simply run with MUDflation since EQ only had a few years worth of real viability, might as well entice people as much as possible for the short term.<br />
<br />
As for Complete Heal, the first time I ever heard about CH rotation was with the original cleric BPs from Trakanon.  I don't know if people had the idea before that, but I do know that was how some people were killing the big things, with a BP CH rotation for no mana.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Several folks have said this, but I should point out that the precedent for Kunark high end encounters and equipment was set by the the raid-level encounters in the planes.  Kunark simply validated the model and expanded it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">Kunark blew away everything before it, even in the planes.  The planes were logical, incremental improvements in equipment.  Upgrades.  Kunark was a major jump above and beyond to twice as powerful, and more.  It's a matter of degrees.  Armor had twice the AC, instead of 25-50% percent more.  Weapons were twice, or three times as powerful.  The equipment designers in Kunark were all about short term gratification, not long term game health.  A game can't handle player power doubling every expansion.</div></div><hr />

Biggest Change? The emergence of the overnight 50+ character.<br />
Before Velious you had power leveling but NOW its like an art form that HAS to be done.. <br />
Im only 53 in 2+ years.. there are people level 60 in 1 month or les. <br />
<br />
There is no reward for the slow, steady player vrs the overnight crank bot. <br />
Should be a /played based skill :&gt;</div></div><hr />
