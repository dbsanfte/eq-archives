<br />
I have found a few dungeons, KC, Sol B, Guk etc... have mobs (casters) that see thru invis - any items or spells to combat against this<br />
<br />
As well some invis work againest invis to undead and others invis to normal mobs, any spell or item that works against both?<br />
<br />
Thks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">As far as I know, rogues are the only ones with property like this.  When you invis a rogue, it acts as both invis to undead and regular invis.<br />
<br />
That was one of the things Verant did to &quot;fix&quot; rogues before Kunark came out.</div></div><hr />

Also, one of the two is bound to go down at the wrong time :-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
So IVU and Invis can stack?  Didn't know that.</div></div><hr />

Make a necro and get AA Innate Invis to Undead then cast Gather Shadows......Voila !!<br />
I think Sol B Gnolls see thru all forms of invis anyway, which is kinda stupid.</div></div><hr />

Invis wont take hold if you have IVU on you, sorry. I'm sure it works likewise the other way around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, I was not aware of that.  So it won't work even if you do have someone else there to invis you.  Oh, well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm curious how the innate invisibility vs. undead AA ability that clerics/necros get interacts with regular invisibility.<br />
<br />
I imagine that despite the name, you must have to click it to activate the IVU (like rangers do for Innate Camoflauge). <br />
<br />
In any case, I'm not aware of any item that grants total invisibility (ie: invis and ivu at the same time).</div></div><hr />

Incorrect. You cannot have Invis and IVU at the same time.<br />
<br />
Unless you are a rogue. It is a unique feature to the class. Nobody else can do it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand that you can't have two invis spells on you at once. But I think Necros (who get an AA called Innate Invis to Undead) can have regular invis and this AA going at the same time. I could be wrong though, so Rogues aren't the only ones to be able to to be completely invisible.</div></div><hr />
