<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've just moved into a new house, and we got this new BT home highway  installed with 2 phone connections, 2 ports which need  PCI cards/terminal adapters,and a USB socket, Im curently using the USB port, as I got the lead with that, an I didn' want to shell out on a adapter/card, as im pretty skint. <br />
<br />
The point is, that I can get on the internet easily,play other games like MOHAA, RtCW, etc. multiplayer fine. I then try t play EQ..... get past patcher, server screen, onto the game no problem, then, when Im on, I can get lag spikes sraight away and the go LD. Or I will be able to play with pretty much no problem for a while and then with no warning go LD, and then my comp might freeze. <br />
<br />
I know it hasnt got something to do with ISP, as I have tried EQ with 3 different ISP's, and I am not thinking it is something to d with my PC, but I think it is my USB. <br />
<br />
I am prolly gonna go get an ISDN card on wednesday, but I wanted to see if Icould sort it befoe I spent my cash. <br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, this all only started happening once I got this USB stuff installed, in the rented place we had before this, my 56k worked fine. <br />
<br />
I cant get DSL or cable n my aea so this and ISDN are te best thing I can get atm, Im rolly going to go order an ISDN PCI card off the bt web if I cant sort this out... if onlythey dint cost so muh :(<br />
thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">datarate setting in your datarate.ini file.  change the number til it starts working.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah, changing datarate might help.  Try setting it to 8 or 9.<br />
<br />
What version of windows are you running?  Win 98 had issues with sustained connections via USB, that might be the problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are they still using that green &quot;Frog&quot; modem with the BT ADSL package?<br />
<br />
I had it for about a year or so before I swtiched to NTL.<br />
<br />
The modem uses 500ma power from your USB port and can cause your PC to crash/reboot (worst case) or for you to get lag (best case)<br />
<br />
I had to re-flash my BIOS on my motherboard to get it to work. However once it stopped crashing my PC it ran EQ just fine.<br />
<br />
Have you checked out www.world-of-adsl.com (http://www.world-of-adsl.com/index.shtml) or www.btopenwoe.co.uk (http://www.btopenwoe.co.uk) The first is the old ADSL UK page.<br />
<br />
They both have good forums and if changing the datarate doesn't fix it they can probably guide you to what's causing it.<br />
<br />
[EDIT - Doh, just re-read your message.  I thought BTHighway was the new cheaper DSL service? (BTW the link doesn't work)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">doh, okay, here is a link to the online shop you can buy it from, here it tells you about it :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">changing the data rate didnt help :( still as laggy as ever, tried 6 7 8 n 9 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IF I understand correctly, the &quot;home highway thing&quot; is an ISDN terminal adaptor, which some people mistakenly call a modem.<br />
<br />
If so, try just using a good old fashioned serial cable to connect to it. ISDN is only 64k bits/sec, and the serial port on your PC can do up to 115k, so you won't be losing any potential bandwidth this way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">No it isn't a teminal adapter, I will ned to buy one or an ISDN PCI card to use te ISDN ports, Iam currently using the USB port as you got the cable with it :) (yes Im cheap ;D)</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I didnt mention was that when I turn my PC off, and then next time I turn it on, the indicator for my ISDN at the bottom right has a big resd cross through it saying it isnt connected Im guessing, but when whenI unplug the cable from the pc and plug it back in, it works then and the pc detects it... not sure if thats importat, but I couldnt find anything about it on the page yo showed me, so guess not.. : /</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">K, Ive downloaded everything that looks worthwhile at microsoft and it dint make a differnce :(<br />
<br />
My ping fluxuates like mad, the number on the right go from arund 60 up to 2.8k and I get lag spike from whtever I do, and then will go LD, butmy conection doesn go either.. :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok, so we've started ruling out issues with your computer itself, it sounds like there may be some routing issues between you and the servers.  You said &quot;House&quot; but is it a condo or is it part of some PUD (Planned Urban Development)?  Is what you're connecting via something built into the complex?   Hrm, just re-read your post, you can play FPSers.<br />
<br />
Next step it troubleshooting the network connection via traceroute.  I don't remember IP addresses off hand, hopefully someone can provide them, but I'm pretty sure you can get them off Sony's web page.<br />
<br />
Start -- Run.   Type &quot;command&quot;   (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
tracert 127.0.0.1  (only put in the IP addresses of the EQ servers)<br />

But your looking for the shortest route to the server but your also looking for the fastest time to the servers.  &quot;*&quot; are bad (think it is a time out) and the lower the number the better it is.  200 milli-seconds is a big number.<br />
<br />
Maybe do a &quot;ping -t 64.37.151.5&quot;? Let it run and see if you get any really big numbers or time outs?  Not sure what this will tell you other than you may have lost your connection to the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">What video card are you using?  Do you have the most recent drivers?  Connection looks acceptable (a smidge high but nothing too bad).<br />
<br />
My next step would be to suggest you remove all video drivers and reinstall them from scratch.  PITA but I'm betting your system is trying to process something &amp; is so busy working on it that it loses the connection.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">actually the big question is - are you using a motherboard provided USB port? And do you use more then one USB device?  If so you might try an external USB port with separate power supply.  This seems to help with a lot of USB problems, power supply through the motherboard is simply not sufficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>fethanin-eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for all the help everyone!<br />
<br />
Well, Im dwnloadig the latest driver for my video card, which will help hopefuly :)<br />
<br />
Also, I know that I need a new ISP, its seems all the ones I use fr EQ are about the same as the AOL racert I did ( that T on I cant use for EQ, as it is in the contract that it has to switch off every 2 hours, /boggle), so anyone got any ideas of decent ISP's? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>KalSeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">USB just doesn't play nice when being used for modems.  I am not sure if it is because of an insufficient power supply or just  poor implementation.  I really don't understand the &quot;home highway &quot; you are using but I am betting that going with a pci card connection will fix your problem.  It is amazing what you can find on Ebay!  I got a PCI SCSI card to replace my ISA version for $2.25!  Granted they screwed me on the shipping but the total cost was still less than $15</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was thinking it might be video card related because he stated he can play other multiplayer games online without the lag issue.  If it wasn't for that fact I would suspect more with the USB.  A friend had a similar problem but it turned out to be a combination of AMD CPU (before they got it fixed) and video drivers.  We removed every video driver file completely and reinstalled from scratch and it worked. <br />
<br />
Until next patch :(  Then we had to do it again.<br />

But sometimes I get the little * when I did a few more.<br />
<br />
Im gonna see if there are any more video drivers I can download for my vid card ( my comp is getting on a bit at 3 years, and have only upgraded the card once, thank god I am getting a new one next year hehe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Do you know how to fully remove the drivers?  You need to find all the files related to the video card drivers and delete them, not just uninstall the driver.  While you're doing this you'll have to be in VGA Mode, 16 bit color, all the really big, blocky graphics that windoze wants to give you.  The safest way of doing this is switch to VGA settings &amp; reboot.   (Have a boot disk handy in case you really screw up, too)  Create a new directory somewhere and move everything that even looks close to a video driver there.  Create a text file with where you moved things from so if the system is unstable you can move them back.<br />
<br />
Once you've done that &amp; rebooted to make sure you didn't snag a file windoze needed, then go thru the process of installing drivers.  You want every system file in there to be the newest version &amp; freshly installed.<br />
<br />
Since you said you're upgrading soon, an interm fix and relatively cheap is what I did:<br />
<br />
P-III, 500 MHz<br />
512 Meg RAM (bought it before xmas when it was dirt cheap)<br />
Replaced Viper 770 Ultra (32 Meg TNT2 card) with<br />
GeForce 420 (low end GeForce 4 card) for 99 bucks.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a GeForce 2 card, stripped down some, then overclocked up a smidge.  I'm able to play in Luclin with the clipping plane back to full again.<br />
