<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a few notes.. I'm sure others have done this. Working fine at lvl 61 with average gear.<br />
<br />
Camp: the &quot;outer&quot; camp in PoV.. room to run around and no adds<br />
<br />
Mobs: razorfiends pulled from the tunnel and cave.<br />
<br />
Equipment: must have is an affliction HASTE item. Affliction efficiency helps too. A long range focus item helps<br />
<br />
Puppy: taunt off (pet kiting) and on guard. Buffed esp haste, and cheap weapons.<br />
<br />
Buffs: your own are fine, V nice, C3 important (though I did manage without once).<br />
<br />
Spell set: Insidious decay, malo, root, 3 dots (bane, pox, plague), chloroplast for spot healing self.<br />
<br />
aa: I have canni 5, so down time is reduced. VP helps to root em.. but ordinary root is fine.<br />
<br />
Renew each pull or so: SoW on self, regen on self, haste on pup<br />
<br />
Strat: you want the mob rooted at the start. I pull with Insidious Decay (disease resist lowered) then root with VP. Alternatively you can pull with malo, run and root normally.<br />
<br />
Now malo if you have not done so. Don't try this without as manna is precious. Then slow. Then dot away, run when root breaks. Keep running and sic pup on it too. Stop to recast dots, keep three on all the time. You should be able to take a few hits, and spot heal if you need to.<br />
<br />
The mob will run at around 7pc. They are yellow to a lvl 61, so this is fine xp. Alternatively, duo as above with druid, ranger or wizard, and you can ride your horse or drog all the way once the beast is snared.<br />
<br />
If you get two, head to zone. come straight back, and try and back tage the last one. <br />
<br />
There is no easy way to actually split two at our level, and soloing two wont work. Have done two kiting with a group of three.. Sk, druid and self.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Trebaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In terms of splitting a likely pull of two, I think I finally undestand what puppy pulling is about. By using a lower level puppy, green to the mobs, you can single pull provided puppy can actually make it back alive. <br />
<br />
With using this technique while pet kiting, you have to live with a range of problems: pet will have built up agro, which you usually don't want with pet kiting, and pet will be a lower level with possibly much reduced damage output due to mitigation  by the mob with level difference. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don' thave suspended minion, so there is no option of loosing pup and swapping in higher. <br />
<br />
Still, interesting and I'll do some experiments.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The level 49 pet is usually low enough to pull with, but lives the longest.  Set him up with Focus and a HOT before you sic him (Stoicism, Torpor, or Quiescence).  If you can get a cleric to Virtue him before you head to PoV so much the better.</div></div><hr />
