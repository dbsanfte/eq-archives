<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Found out the hard way myself; not a bug as stated by server GM. It leads you to believe that by showing you the adjusted (lower) stats. I was lucky enough that the Bazaar Mule I bought it from was kind enough to buy it back from me, a few days later when I found him not AFK. I was told by GM, you MUST be Lvl 51 to equip it. Not what you want to hear I'm sure.<br />
<br />
P.S. Thanks Gullank for returning my lunch money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bumbi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks man<br />
<br />
No maybe not what I a wanted to hear, but much better then a couldent use it at all, now I just need to get 51</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah there are 2 types of recommended lvl.<br />
<br />
Truely recommended lvl items like the newer sol items will scale down the stats on them but you can still wear them. Scaling seems to be. stat * your lvl / recommended lvl.<br />
<br />
Really should say required lvl. Items like the club of the ice ocean off lod, the phase spider carapace (don't think these even say recommended lvl on them) and most of the cazic gear. Says recommended lvl x but you can't even wear it untill you get that actual lvl. This would be the first i've heard of these items actually showing the lowered stats but wouldn't surprise me.</div></div><hr />
