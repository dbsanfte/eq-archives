<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now, my shammy is lvl 57 I decieded to give WW group a shot for the gold, partly to see if my slows could take at all or not.  I had my lvl 57 malas line spell and my lvl 51 slow.  I was ready to kick can, if it would take at all. <br />
<br />
First mob, RED no doubt, Malos line was resisted, I was scared, but I tried slow anyway.  IT STUCK!!!   HOW, WHAT MADE THIS WORK?  I did it on the 2nd, 3rd, 4th 5th 10th 20th,  on almost EVERY MOB my Malo line for lvl 57 was resisted off the bat but all my slows were sticking without question.   After a hour I got balls and I said, Screw Malo line of spells, I dont need it.   WRONG ANSWER!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I did my slowon the next mob, resisted , again, resisted, again, resisted, 4th time resisted, WHAT THE CRAP, AGAIN resisited, the mob by this time was 50% mana and so I pulled out my Malo line of spells again and casted.  Resisted, then I casted my slow again, IT STUCK!!!!<br />
<br />
WHAT IS GOING ON!?!?!?!?!<br />
<br />
From then on I used Malo line of spells and in a total of 2 1/2 hours of WW with a lvl 57 mob, I only was resisted with 5 different mobs, all were able to be slowed after Malos line was applied, EVEN IF MALOS LINE WAS RESISTED!!!!!!!!!!!     Bug?!   I think more then likely yes.  Its as if at least part of Malos line worked even though the Malo didn't stick.<br />
<br />
Malos did stick on a few mobs the first time I casted it, but the sticks were rare , far, and few between.  Nothing to be able to count on.<br />
<br />
Is this considered taking advantage of a glitch?   Possibly, in any case I got 50% of a lvl taken care of.  It was nice.</div></div><hr />

No chanters, infact, we had many times were we had adds of a spider and a long mobs with many legs at WW camp.  Each time those 2 mobs couldn't be pulled by the Warr seperate, so they both came.   All we could do was try and root the second mob while I Mala, and slowed the first mob.  Once the 1st was done, I would Mala and slow the second mob.  Luckily I had on virtue, but I about died each time that add came due to the fact we had no mezzer, no necro for soloing ,  and even with  slow the mobs would nearly eat me alive regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudancia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And no mage was in group either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wanted to conferm that, while grouping here level 55-57, I have experenced the same thing, but only for magic resists...my poison DOTs still seem to bounce unless malo sticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Same for me at 55.  My slow sticks when I cast malo (and get resisted) 1st, way more than if I just cast slow.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tronc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well I did my first trip to PoV last night.  I'm level 55 and I saw nothing of the sort.  I would malo on incoming and then slow.  Several times slow wouldn't land on the first and often even on the second time.<br />
<br />
Couple of close calls on the lvl 56 tank too...none the less - no one died, even with a few attempts at the purple club.<br />
<br />
On the last pull of the night an ethereal parchment (or whatever it's called) dropped and I pulled off a roll of 200!!  Never did that before.  <br />
<br />
Oh well just wanted to say that I didn't see any evidence of this bug as of last night (Nov 25th '04)<br />
