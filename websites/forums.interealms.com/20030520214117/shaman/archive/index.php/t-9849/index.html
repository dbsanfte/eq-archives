A while back, I got a little bit burned out on xp-grinding, so I messed around with some alts, then did a bunch of trade skilling.  End result is I have a lot of cash saved up (I think somewhere around 180kpp) and a pretty decent selection of droppable gear I bought as i noticed it in the bazaar.  So now I'm doing some XP'ing again.  Should I buy any more gear upgrades or just hang onto the money to buy spells?  I'm leaning toward the spells, having seen everyone's raves about torpor, but if there are any mid-priced (10k or less) upgrades that are no brainers, perhaps someone else who had lots of cash but didn't do much raiding might point them out. <br />
<br />
Things I'll finish up eventually:<br />
 - epic (have tear.  still need to organize the final CoM battle)<br />
<br />
Things I'd kind of like to loot or quest for myself so haven't bought (gives me something to do)<br />
 - obulus death shroud<br />
 - shield of bane warding<br />
 - earring of the solstice (just need to finish GM'ing pottery)<br />
<br />
But there are some spots on my gear where there simply MUST be some decent upgrades I can buy.  I haven't found any in the bazaar though.<br />
<br />
I figure there must be some earring upgrades.  Maybe a better shield?  (I was thinking of doing shield of bane warding.)  Perhaps a ring to replace the 6/65 one?  <br />
<br />
 ** magelo is in sig **<br />
<br />
I usually duo with a 56 ranger friend and often bring along a 42 druid on the second box to handle heals if that makes any difference for gear recommendations.<br />
<br />
Is an affliction efficiency item worth having?  Are any buyable?<br />
<br />
I can also go after stuff which can be had in single-group encounters.  Friends who may be willing to help me out:<br />
<br />
 62 paladin<br />
 62 wizard<br />
 56 ranger</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heres a few ideas coming from the 1-20k price range (On my server at least)...<br />
<br />
Earring : Silver Hammer Earring (Fairly Cheap) / Skull Char<br />
<br />
Neck : Tracking Wolf Collar<br />
<br />
Head : Tae Ew SpiritCallers Coif / Slime Covered Rubicite Coif.<br />
<br />
Fingers : Circled Toe Bones (2.5k) / Ring Of Winter<br />
<br />
Shoulders : Maybe go for 8th Shawl since you say you are into trade skills?<br />
<br />
Waist : Belt Of Dripping Bile Much cheaper than Girdle of Mithanel and with somewhat comparable stats.<br />
<br />
Legs : Artificer's Leggings , nice Wis and Mana on them along with the health and AC make them pretty nice :) The Polished Tin Mail Legging things are also pretty nice.<br />
<br />
Shield : Skull Marked Shield / Bone Braced Buckler<br />
<br />
Range : Might wanna look into doing the Beginers Magic Manual quest, easy quest and a nice item to boot :)<br />
<br />
<br />
There are all the suggestions I can think of at the moment.  Some of the prices probably vary a lot depending on server, but those are some of the more reasonable high-end items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">It depends on what you are after, here are some recent upgrades Ive purchased that might fit you well (Im going for HP, you might be after something else)<br />
<br />
Ear: Earring of Solstice Quest (can buy the pieces for 7-8k), will net you +3ac, +5sta, +8wis, +30mana, +20hp (overall +35hp with sta) and save 5 vs magic cold and fire.<br />
<br />
Shield: Bladestopper (purchased mine for 2.5k), would net you +10sta +10hp (+40hp overall with sta), -10 sv magic cold fire, same ac<br />
<br />
Feet: Barbed Dragonscale Boots (havent bought yet, but around 5k), would net you +9sta and +30hp (overall +57hp gain), same ac.<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  I also replaced my IGS with a Peerless Dragonwing Mantle (5.5k) which nets a loss of 6ac, but gains 55hp and 55mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barrius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Im on drinal too...ill drop ya a tell because i got a few items in said slots that i may be gettin rid of soon.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've found focus items extremely useful.  They can turn relatively crappy items like the Obulus Death Shroud into very good items that can really help you notice a difference in your gameplay.<br />
<br />
I have six of them, I think.  Some junk like shadel ring, some not droppable like shissar ring.  Just got a ceramic gavel of justice, range slot, and spent 18k on it.  Might be way out of line for it, I don't know.  Terrible except for the focus effect.  It's affliction efficiency IV, which supposedly is a 20% savings on DOTS/slow/debuff.  That's fine for me when soloing, as I now tend to solo mobs I will put at least four bane of nife's on, as well as slow and malo, so 20% per each of those spells will add up to some solid mana savings.<br />
<br />
Sometimes, as you see with your own amulet of insight, though, you have to wear an inferior item to get that reward.  To use the AE IV item, I have to take out an item that's actually fairly decent, the Divine Inspiration, 15 AC 15 wis, I think maybe 35 mana besides.  I'm sure I won't always be swapping in the ceramic whatsis instead; just sometimes.  But since you have money to burn, you might want to look for one.  I was thinking it might be pottery made, and you can make it yourself?  No idea.<br />
<br />
Some droppable ones that I don't have are the wicked bone atlatl range slot and the sharp claw ahlspeiss range slot.  The former is something like haste of mithaniel(speeds up spell casting) I think, and sharp claw ahlspeiss is I think affliction extention or efficiency IV.  I saw the atlatl for 25k once and have never seen the ahlspeiss sold; probably won't, since it comes off a gator in the PON caves that hardly anyone ever hunts.<br />
<br />
Orb of Infinite Void used to be 35k only a handful of months back; now I've seen it going as low as 15k.  That's a very nice upgrade to snark shield you have.<br />
<br />
If possible, buy MQ's of some quest armor(dragon or giant) after you get ally status with either of them.  They will be huge upgrades to you and can be a real pain to get yourself sometimes; you can raid for months without getting or being awarded a chain tunic for instance.  Expect to pay a lot of money.  Don't get the gloves; they're garbage.  The wrists are nice enough but frankly I have them and wear my coldain military wristguard and my JBB bracer all the time, which I see you have.  The legs, helm, feet, chest are particularly good though, and the arms don't completely totally stink.  This stuff is far from top end these days, but far above what you're going to be able to buy, generally.<br />
<br />
Oh, Veterans Chain Leggings drop off the Hedge Maze flagging sometimes.  They're pretty nice, too.<br />
<br />
Shield of Bane Warding wouldn't be bad, either; I camped up two of them myself.  Try to bring someone who can track, especially track undead, like a pally.  It will make hunting the skeletons in Tenebrous MUCH easier; you can get through it in a day instead of a week if you're lucky.  The skellies spawn consistently in one place, but not often; however, they also run more widely around the zone as well, and if you miss one, you may have added hours to your camp.   It's much faster to do the tenebrous part with a tracker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">for rings, look at questing yourself the 9th coldain ring, quite easy for us to do, only need help with 3 of the kills on ring 9, the rest you can solo.  also, some people sell the chaining of ring 8, so then would be 3 solo kills and 3 group kills and done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you trade skills listed in your magelo profile are reasonably accurate then I'd look into both the coldain shawls and probably the garzicor quest. Would give you 2 nice peices to wear.<br />
<br />
Earrings have definitely gotta get upgraded. Solitice is good for one. The sanctum guardian or silver hammered loop would be good for the other.<br />
<br />
For a ring the valorium ring of galantry is a very nice peice altho at your lvl currently you would loose some stats from not meeting the recommended lvl. Also not sure what these go for on your server. Prices seem to vary pretty wildly from server to server.<br />
<br />
For affliction efficiency items there aren't many viable options. The pottery item already mentioned is one. The other is a Sharp Claw Ahlspiess. Neither of which is really that great on stats IMO. All other affliction efficiency items are a raid lvl of some sort or another from NToV to VT. Also as far as I've seen there haven't been any shaman useable affliction efficiency items other than the claw found in PoP so far.<br />
<br />
Circlet of the Falinkan is another nice quest item if your into those and have the dragon faction for it.<br />
<br />
hurricane chain makes some nice peices to fill in slots too. Off hand I'd say boots ars and legs would be nice upgrades for you. Probably a bit beyond your ability right now tho.</div></div><hr />
