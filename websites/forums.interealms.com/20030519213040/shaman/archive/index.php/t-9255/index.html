<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, here what I understand of VP so far.<br />
<br />
- You can't gate in any form.<br />
- Dragons there are on RoS faction.<br />
- CoTH works there.<br />
- You are greeted with two badass GWs on entering VP, and they can take 3 different forms of badassness.  They also respawn every two minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
So what I want to know, is there a safe spot anywhere in the zone where you can sit your raid down and pull to?  Someone mentioned to me that he could get to dubious RoS faction by hunting in MM, he could then invis to avoid the rest of the non-faction mobs.<br />
<br />
So the way I see it, you could potentially park a necro and cleric in the safe spot.  Park everyone's corpse next to it, then in the event of a wipe, res corpses, then summon other corpses to be ressed.<br />
<br />
This all really depends on there being a safe spot.  Would just like to know a bit more about this zone.  I feel a strange urge to visit it before they revamp it and probably make it easier to access.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1) Correct, no gating, evaccing, Tling etc.  It's still not hard to get out.  For fights less than 3 hours, leave a body outside and get rezzed out.  For long hunting sessions:  Die inside, run back to VP, take a death outside, zone in, get a summon/rez to your dressed corpse, loot corpse and then get rezzed to your corpse outside.<br />
<br />
2) The dragons themselves are on ROS faction and can see through invis.  The rest of the beasties (IIRC) are on their own faction.  Some of them can see through invis and some can't.<br />
<br />
3) There are safe spots.  When you zone in, you can turn to the left and run down to the little spot near the lava.  A whole raid can sit there and not get aggro from the roamers.  At that point, my guild used an invis non KOS to RoS mage to run to the next safe spot and call the raid.  After killing Silver and Hosh, a monk would drag a mage body and a rez stick to the Purple Velvet cushion and rez the mage.  The mage would then call the raid to the Purple Velvet Cushion.<br />
<br />
The mobs did respawn very quickly, we would normally only kill the mobs that saw through invis in order to get a non see invis mob to pop.  We also used a tactic we dubbed &quot;wurm herding&quot; to damage a snared mob to the point of immobile docility so one person could basically control it while the rest of the guild fought something else.<br />
<br />
I had some pretty good times in VP, I would love to see the zone revamped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The no gating, evaccing, tl thing is silly.<br />
<br />
I am ok with the key quest, it's the obnoxious raid overhead of manuevering people with these kludgy workarounds that are not versions of strategy which are annoying.<br />
<br />
Die inside VP, die outside VP, revive inside, loot and revive outside.  It's stupid.  Soooo much time is spent doing that dumb crap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the other option is to use the exits in the dragon's lairs.  Depending on the lair, you go to the Freeport docks or the first island of Sky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, but when Kunark was released, Veeshan's Peak was &quot;THE&quot; toughest zone in the game.  The no gate/evac bit was to reinforce that.  Heck, at first, the keys weren't even soulbound.<br />
<br />
Scurvey, check this map (http://www.eqmaps.com/m3/vpeak2.jpg) at EQ Maps.  It's about the best one I've seen, and has the first camp spot Glorianna mentioned marked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope VP is revamped as an EXP zone.  Make the spell drops the same as they are now.  Bingo!  Torpor/Malo rareness problem solved!   The bored ubers will pharm them for you and you can pick them up in bazaar for tree fiddy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silkenshammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VP is great fun once you know what you're doing .. not so much fun if you don't.<br />
<br />
Here's an annotated map and pullguide I did awhile back for my old guild should help you out.<br />
<br />
http://www.kysumu.netfirms.com/vp_full.jpg <br />
<br />
The secret to the pull is kinda easy in the end.<br />
<br />
GW's and racnar's deaggro pretty fast if you run at bardspeed, dragons don't. So all you have to do is run up to the aggro point, run away real fast, pause at some safeish spot to make sure you actually aggro'd the dragon, then run home real fast and wait for the dragon to come to you.<br />
<br />
Essentially the pull goes .. pulse selo's accelerando on your rogue, click it off on yourself and start up song of travel. Run real fast to the &quot;refresh accelerando spot&quot; and wait there for the gw to roam far from you. Click off song of travel, pulse accelerando again for rogue, click off accelerando on yourself, reapply song of travel. You then have a timelimit .. the rogue has 1.5 mins to be back in poolroom or he'll most likely die or be unable to join the fight due to aggro issues and you need him to open the door for you. So you hotfoot it to the aggro point, turn around and run away again as soon as you reach it, pause at some safe spot to make sure the dragon is actually aggro then run like the wind for the pool room. Pause on the far side of the poolroom ( the side Phara dar comes down ) so the dragon paths the far way around the room then run to the raid and prepare for incoming .. you want all dragons to path down the same side as Phara so you get to use the right-side fightspot which has much less risk of gw adds.<br />
<br />
If there are see invis GW's .. run past em real fast and remember that their aggro range isn't huge so you can dodge em. Remember also that if you lose song it's quicker to recast than to wait the potential 6 seconds for a new pulse.<br />
<br />
Final word .. have a corpse in camp so you can be rezzed back in for summon rather than having to run back in for summon. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS Couple of other VP notes:<br />
<br />
Get a monk or improved invis caster to faction up on the kaladim king first  ( 1 hr = max ally ros ) to act as scout.<br />
<br />
Pull Hoshkar and Silverwing to zonein if you are bardpulling.  Get Hoshkar first as his assist range is huge and you don't want him adding to your Silverwing fight.<br />
<br />
Don't buggerise around moving invis or cohing .. this is what makes VP boring.  Once Hosh and SW are dead rampage your way up to the poolroom.  By rampage I mean kill, move, kill, move.  You're up against 2 min repop so you have to hammer it but it's fun and exhilirating and imo the best part of the raid .. the rule is if ppl die they consent 3 or 4 designated draggers and don't get rezzed till you hit safespot.  You can have a rest and rezzup in the statue room if you need it before continuing to poolroom.  To get into poolroom get monk to train stuff at entrance ( where the 2 drakes are ) away while you run the raid past .. then camp out to clear aggronear the west wall .. but not too near to wall or you can accidentally get ghetto succoured.<br />
<br />
The other 4 dragons are all easy pulls to that room.  <br />
<br />
In terms of GW's there's a bunch of variants:<br />
<br />
- Fully MR or not ( pretty rare for fully MR )<br />
- Dispell or not<br />
- Weak fear or not<br />
- 300 AE or not<br />
- Hit up to 1500 ( but not many 1500 hitters )<br />
- Split on death or not ( splitters can instarespawn as a single or double of any variant and will corpse camp and can resplit again )<br />
<br />
But that being said if you have your wits on a single group can very easily farm gw's for spelldrops including all variants ( altho we never encountered a 1500 hitter splitting to another 1500 hitter ).<br />
<br />
Last thing .. dealing with wipes:  <br />
<br />
Wipe at ZI is easy .. just have one cleric bind near vp and have an invis class bind near him so he can invis back in and rez up.<br />
<br />
Wipe at poolroom is also easy.  Bard grabs drums from bank, he and cleric zone back in.  They then selos their way back up to the entrance to poolroom, hit da song to get into poolroom and cleric camps out while bard does any final necessary kiting.  For extra safety take a monk too but not really necessary.<br />
<br />
Lastly .. enjoy the place.  VP imo is still one of the best zones I've ever raided in once you get past the pain barrier of learning it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's some great info guys, much more then I'd hoped for, thank you very much. :)<br />
<br />
One theory I did have, was that seeing as how these GWs at the zone in are on a very fast spawn timer, and that they drop topor/malo.  There could be an answer to the drought problem.  It sounds a lot more efficient then waiting for them to spawn in SF.<br />
<br />
Thanks again though, I'll be cut n'pasting all your info down into one guide.  All I need now is to make or find a guild willing to put the time in for it! :)<br />
<br />
I'm sure I don't know what I'm letting myself in for, but that's a good thing right? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally I haven't been back in ages but back in the day the worst thing about alot of the dragons used to be that they would gate and there was no real way to prevent it. You had to kill them fast otherwise they would kill you with thier ae's so seiving didn't work with out alot of enchanters.<br />
<br />
Now a days unless they are specifically flaged as immune thier lvl should no longer make them unstunable. Add mana burn for the quick pop at the end and it should make life easy too. <br />
<br />
With additional level and ae resist songs it shouldn't be nearly as hard to resist thier ae's anymore either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What Gart said.<br />
<br />
The teeeeniest tweaks like making the zone-in a zone-out and opening the zone to Gate/Evac would get one of the most useless hunks of real estate in Norrath some use.<br />
<br />
A full revamp would be great to see, especially for anyone who did the key quest, but just a few little things in the meantime would be great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">believe i am warmly to ROS  <br />
<br />
There any quests, like in chadok ???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">You've just inspired me for a brand new thread! :)<br />
<br />
BTW Mr Moderators, why do my threads always seem to end up with 'Moved' on them?  They're still in the same catagory that they were previously?  I is confused!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the unedited map of vp that I found off the guild that made the edited one's website.  They called is vpmap2 so I just typed in vpmap and it came up with this.</div></div><hr />
