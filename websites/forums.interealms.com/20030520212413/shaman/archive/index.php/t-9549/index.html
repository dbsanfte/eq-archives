<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maivia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was going to try a few soloing places out i haven't heard of any popularity before.<br />
<br />
Just figured id see if anyone else has tried these spots, or whether im forgetting something that should tell me I'm a moron.<br />
<br />
First spot, Pits in permafrost. Me and some nostalgic friends went down there other day and it was fun and pretty easy, keeping everyone regened i had to heal once every 1-2 fights, and that was with chloroblast when someone hit 80%. Only Problem I can see is the Ice Witch or whatever her name is aggroing. *shrug*<br />
<br />
Second spot I really have no hopes of doing but wanted to see what others thought of it. Soloing the Fg down in Sol B. If i could single them, then maybe.<br />
<br />
Last Place is PoG. Heard that it was a great place to solo 55+ there for good exp / pp drops. Tried twice and gated both times with under 100 hps. One was a named horse so thats explainable ( he jumped me through invis). The other fight i got lots of resists, pet couldn't take aggro and without root i went oom trying to slow it while healing myself. I did NOT use Malosi for the fight which im guessing was my problem, anyone try this before ?<br />
<br />
Primarily hoping someone can either A) tell me im a moron and keep me from some possibly nasty CRs, B) share experieances(thats a spelling mistake and a half i know), or C) Tell me im a moron for even trying and explain why =P.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This isn't for everyone, obviously, but I find myself soloing in the big sandbox above and to the left of the tactics arena quite regularly. There's some issues with pathing there that make it dangerous if you're not paying attention, but otherwise its a nice quiet spot with good xp and the occasional sellable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Reave</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think PoG would be worth it at 55.  Maybe possible with epic and Jbb, but still pretty dangerous and very slow going.  I have been soloing there at 59, and while the loot is excellent, everything has way too many hps to make it anywhere near efficent for xp.  Things can also get messy if you happen to get rooted or snared in a bad place.  If you can round up a group though, I think it would be great.</div></div><hr />
