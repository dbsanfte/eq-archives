<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I now have Spellcasting Fury 3 which gives me a 7%+dex% to crit, doubling my DD/rain damage. <br />
<br />
Working on Fury of Magic 1,2,3 now to raise that crit chance  -- this may increase my chances up to maybe 14% per hit. <br />
<br />
We shammies have the worst DDs available among non-melees (our best DD at 64 is 300 mana for 900 dmg and my current DD which is a level 61 spell is 275 mana for 675 dmg, but my rain isn't bad, 450 mana for 3-4 hits of 650 dmg-- although it is resisted more often than normal DDs). Dotting is out of the question because disease is too slow and poison is too aggro-ey and slow (two rains well exceed that damage in the period of time it takes for the dot to run out). <br />
<br />
But, my theory is that we have the best mana acceleration available, we can afford to get hit, and we can raise our own dex to increase crit chances. Plus since it's rain, I get 3 or 6 chances to crit per fight usually. After Malosini, Turgur, Cripple, all that's left to do is rain once or twice and canni/torpor, getting ready for the next fight. We are capable of keeping up with the necessary debuffing job as well as dealing considerable rain damage without needing a mana break. <br />
<br />
Rains are considerably good... especially since in tier 2 it is very risky to slow without malosini... since the malosini is used for the slow and/or cripple, I don't consider that as mana wasted for rain dpm.<br />
<br />
Three resists, 450 mana for 0 dmg is 0 dpm (rare)<br />
Two resists, 450 mana for 650 dmg is 1.44 dpm (uncommon)<br />
One resist (or two resist one crit), 450 mana for 1300 dmg is 2.89 dpm (usual)<br />
No resists (or one resist one crit), 450 mana for 1950 dmg is 4.33 dpm (usual)<br />
One crit no resists, 450 mana for 2600 dmg is 5.78dpm (uncommon)<br />
Two crits no resists, 450 mana for 3250 dmg is 7.22dpm (rare)<br />
Three crits no resists, 450 mana for 3900 dmg is 8.67dpm (incredibly rare)<br />
<br />
Anyone good at probability able to calculate the average dpm for this (and maybe dps also), using reasonable assumptions (i.e. guess at chance to resist and chance of crit due to high dex), for someone at SCF 3, and someone with both SCF 3 and FoM 3?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have had (in 1 month):<br />
<br />
3 instances of two crits, no resists<br />
2 instances of three crits, no resists<br />
<br />
The &quot;usual&quot; situations I find to be most common are:<br />
<br />
1 resist, no crits<br />
0 resists, 1 crit<br />
1 resist, 1 crit<br />
<br />
I would consider any of these situations acceptable.  I tend to think of the crit as a compensatory factor for the resists.  If I get a single resist and a single crit, it is identical to getting no resists and no crits.<br />
<br />
Still, it was nice to see that 1300, 1300, 1300 come up on my display....  brought a tear to my eye (especially since the wizard I was grouped with was asking me at the time why I bothered to do damage at all).  I also critted twice during that fight for 1350 with spear of Torment.  Rare, but fun.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As a follow-up:<br />
<br />
The original post did not take fizzles into account.  Even with maxed evocation, Torrent Of Poison will still fizzle alot.  Each fizzle costs some mana (not sure now much, but its fairly significant).  If you were tring to calculate an average dpm value for using rains, you would need to take that fizzle rate into account.  The fizzle rate on Tears Of Saryn is dramatically less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting...and wrong. Dex doesn't affect crits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Interesting...and wrong. Dex doesn't affect crits.<br />
<br />
You know, that's interesting... I remember doing research on crits when first got Spellcasting Fury 1 and thought I saw quite a few forum messages on dex and crits... but after you said I was wrong I spent about two hours trying to search for it again and found very little.  You're most likely right, it's prolly a myth, although I do seem to crit more with high dex-- could just be stupid dumb luck of course.<br />
<br />
But regardless, any statisticians out there able to figure out the dps/dpm for rains with no SCF, then with SCF 3, then with SCF 3 and FoM 3? :)  If we ignore dex and fizzles as issues for simplication then the calculation should be easier with only one assumption-- resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaneras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as I know Dex affects 3 things:<br />
<br />
1. Melee weapon proc percentage<br />
2. The rate at which you increase melee weapon skills<br />
3. Secondary stat for learning fletching<br />
<br />
Never heard of it having anything to do with spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Everytime someone claims they have proof that Dex improves crits on spells they fail to produce any logs.  I'm telling ya, the man is trying to keep spellcasters down, if they give us a stat to improve crits we would be equals!  Fight da powah!  Resist the man!<br />
<br />
Hrm, maybe skipping lunch isn't such a good idea, it makes me act funny.</div></div><hr />

<br />
talks about rain damage resists.  It points to a wizard board discussion:<br />
http://pub140.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm1.showMessage?topicID=24924.topic<br />
<br />
where wizards have calculated that rains suffer from an inherant 22% resist rate - regardless of debuffs.<br />
<br />
Kinda rude of verant to weaken this line of spells with a hardcoded resist rate.</div></div><hr />
