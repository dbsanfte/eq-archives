<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I think I was in bear form when I turned the report into the first EJ Spirit.  I just turned the 3 logs into the Spirit in the pond and I am still only Kindly.<br />
<br />
Is this normal?  I have done everything by the book so far, except that I think that I may have been in bear form. Does this matter anymore?  Shouldn't I be at least to Warmly by now?<br />
<br />
Just kind of nervous<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Bear form doesn't have anything to do with it.  Has no faction adjustments, and won't affect your faction, irregardless whether you have it on during turnin or conning.<br />
<br />
That said, your probably on track, if you want to feel safer, just turn the logs in again to bump up to warmly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Souldreamer Bearspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well, I'm in the same boat.  I was never in bear form when turning anything in, but I'm also just kindly to the spirits.  I figured by now that I would be warmly, so I think I'll do the books again a couple of times.  Those are easy to get and usually nobody needs them so they rot.</div></div><hr />

Who cares what your faction level is?  If you do each step and he gives you the text that is ALL that matters. <br />
<br />
Umm, maybe because they'll EAT whatever you turn it to them if your faction isn't high enough?  Just a guess. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think Jaradis point is that...if you do all the steps in order....and dont faction cheat your way through it....there should be no worries about your faction level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess that some folks did not understand what I was asking or have not heard of the Bear Form rumor, or just assume that everyone who asks faction questions about the Epic quest is cheating.<br />
<br />
EQShaman- Belgar's Epic Guide (http://eqshaman.com/epic/1begin.html) <br />
<br />
WARNING DO NOT perform any of the quest turn-ins while using Form of the Great Bear. This quest will only trigger with proper TRUE SPIRIT FACTION is detected by the quest NPCs. Reports have been received that being in Bear Form during epic-item turn-ins may BUG the quest NPCs to misread your True Spirit faction and cause the quest trigger to FAIL!  <br />
<br />
If you read the old how-to guide for the Shaman Epic, you will see that it warns that turning in a quest item while in bear form will mess up your faction in that your faction will not be increased because the quest NPC will not register your current faction correctly because you are in bear form and not in your normal form.  I a afraid I made this mistake.  <br />
<br />
I have no plan to CHEAT!!!! This question does not have anything to do with an end-run around the normal steps.  If you read the post closely you would realize that.<br />
<br />
Thanks to all who did not just jerk their knees (jerk being the key word)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sion,<br />
I hope your knee jab at the end of your last post was not directed at me...as I was not trying to be a jerk. I read your post and understood it completely...not hard to do.<br />
<br />
I -also- read Jaradis post without jerking my knees and am only backing what he says....because it has always been my understanding that if a quest npc gives you the quest....i.e. gives you the 'text' of what he wants you to do...then your faction with said quest npc should be sufficient to do that quest.<br />
<br />
heres a faction quirk that Ive yet to understand though and one reason I cant say with 100% assuredness that illusions without a faction modifier can still effect mobs reaction to you.<br />
<br />
The AoN and its effect:skeleton -use- to have a faction modifier. I would use the illusion and it would change my faction(good faction adjust in OT) They have since changed illusion:skeleton to have no faction adjust. Bearform has never had a faction modifier.<br />
<br />
Jaled Dar's Shade in DN is non kos and will not DT you -unless- you are in a non humanoid illusion. So regardless of your faction with him, he will DT you if you are in a non playable race form.<br />
<br />
Run by him in skeleton or Bear and you are going to go down :) , but why you go down IM unsure of to tell you the truth.<br />
<br />
Anyway, sorry if you felt I was accusing you of anything sketchy bro, but I assure you that I have the ability to read between the lines ;) and wasnt trying to offend you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What is the point of asking a question if you refuse to even listen to anyone?  Or worse call people offering info jerks?<br />
<br />
As I clearly said:<br />
<br />
If you do each step and he gives you the text that is ALL that matters.<br />
<br />
No one here said a thing about you cheating.  If he gives you the text for the next part then you have the correct faction level, that is all that matters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Diabalein Avidyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">bear for, at least the lower lvl one makes you human looking to yourself.  humans cant be shaman, so at a guess I would say this might be what causes the problem. <br />
<br />
or not but why not click off bear form if its even slighty more likely to cause a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">bear for, at least the lower lvl one makes you human looking to yourself. humans cant be shaman, so at a guess I would say this might be what causes the problem<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have that weird thing where bear form makes you look like a naked human (with the 29 bear form, you should look like a small, brown bear).   This bug also happens to people using the 55 bear form spell, you should look like a BEAR with the bear form spell, not a human.<br />
<br />
I've read how to fix this, but since it's never happened to me, I don't remember.  Anyone know how?</div></div><hr />

No, you will not get DTed in bearform by Jaled.  I run past him all the time with bearform, and haven't ever gotten DTed.  It is somewhat amusing though when the ranger goes by in werewolf form :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hmmm,<br />
Im going to have to try it now next time Im in DN lol, and btw...I was in bearform when I got DTed...I know that much...although unrelated apparently. I got DTed when Skeleton had a modifier, but ever since I -did- get DTed in bearform and skeleton...I have never ran by him in an illusion again.<br />
<br />
So can I believe and say 100% from now on that illusions without faction modifiers will in no way effect an npcs reaction to you? I guess my misunderstanding came from how an npc will talk to you when your in a non-humanoid form...they call you an 'IT' instead of a he/she/yourname. I like to be complettely informed so that when I pass info, its -correct- info :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Evel<br />
<br />
The jerks jab was a bit over the top and not really directed to you.  I am sorry for reacting in such an asinine manner, but certain phrases just set me off.  I understand that I come from a generation and a geographic location that is removed from most of the posters here, but I think that some dialog clues still have the same meaning regardless of age or region.  I should just let it drop, but I will not be pushed around by bullies.<br />
<br />
I would have had my mouth busted by my father if I would have started a reply to anyone with the phrase, ‘Who cares  .  .  .’  I understand why my dad, would be upset with me for responding in such a way.  When I hear or read ‘who cares’ as it is directed to me, I immediately know that the person has no or little respect for me and is probably hostile toward me.  Because of the phrase, I think I correctly made the assumption that the poster was putting me in an adversarial position that I did not intend to be placed in.  Regardless of the validity of the information in the post, the manner in which it was written caused me to feel that the poster was regarding me as an idiot.  Besides, there was a good reason (Belgar’s guide) for being concerned about handing in an item in bear form.  <br />
<br />
If this poster wanted to allay my fears, he could have just stated simply that bear form does not have an effect on faction without the smartass, ‘who cares’ prefix. Gwaeron did not seem to have a problem answering the question without attitude.  Must be an Ohio thing.  Wilmington College still the Fighting Quakers?  <br />
<br />
<br />
So I say what is the use in offering advice if your attitude is so loud that your target can’t hear the message.<br />

No hard feelings at all my friend. You know I seen it posted recently, although I forget by whom, that its really hard to tell how a person is trying to respond to you in a setting like the internet. You lose all the tone of voice, body lanuage, ect...and its true that you almost -have- to use emotes to get across what your intentions are in an internet forum.<br />
<br />
I can only hope that I kind of mirror what I am in RL, here on the internet. I truelly hope that peoples experiences with me are not unlike the RL interaction I have with people. <br />
<br />
Im laid back, understanding and I pride myself on trying to be helpfull when ever possible...no, Im not saying Im Beaver Cleaver or anything....just that I feel Im a friendly person. I have something inherent...I have respect for people, here and in RL....where I cant exactly relate to it being instilled by my parents...I still have it and have tthe integrity to claim it :)<br />
<br />
...So, back to the point of the post to start with....hope everything turned out ok for you! How far are you on your epic now anyway?</div></div><hr />

Sure is, although I'm not real big into the sports thing.  I'm usually working, studying, or playing EQ to bother with them :)<br />
<br />
Course, being that I only have a couple weeks before I'm done entirely, gets me agitated at time :D<br />
