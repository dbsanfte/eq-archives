<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Treedom Gottasnare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all, Im making a shaman and have no clue what race to pick. I know it doesnt matter at higher lvls but I just want to know which one to choose. I know all of the pro cons and just cant decide!!! Are there quests specically for certain races? That could be a plus that I didnt know about. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm not gonna bother answering this. Use the search function and look for other people who've made the same type of post. I don't mean to offend you but this kind of post is made about every week or two. <br />
<br />
BTW Can we get a sticky of race comparisons on this page for other people that don't know which to pick. I'm sure someone did a good one on pros and cons of every race.</div></div><hr />
