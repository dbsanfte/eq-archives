<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">will probly cost 500pp a fail</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Probably... Anyways it was added dec 3rd.. maybe its going to be a christmas gift to shamans? :)<br />
<br />
Lets not get pessimistic yet - they MIGHT ... just MIGHT let it be pretty cheap, at least affordable so it could actually be a market for it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Turbosilk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It'll be the same old story.  The potions will cost a FORTUNE and the effect won't last long and/or won't stack with buffs.<br />
<br />
Yes I'll be pessimistic on this.  IE. Luclin potions and 97 percent of the rest of the potions.  Wake up and smell the roses alchemy is and always will be gimp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you miss the point...<br />
<br />
the 25 resist / 25 stat potions cost &quot;only&quot; 18pp per combine - that isnt that much - and i already have tons of ppl interested in them if these changes go live :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, as do I.  The negative stats were the only thing scaring folks off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Guess I might have to throw some aa's into alchemy master then.</div></div><hr />

Guess I might have to throw some aa's into alchemy master then. <br />
<br />
This would be a waste of time unless costs drop on the high end Luclin potions.  Dropping negative stats is a definite improvement on those potions, and the cost is pretty good.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping that this is singaling a revamp of alchemy that will include major cost decreases on high end potions.  Heck, I wouldn't mind at all if we also got some new potions that required dropped reagents, like what is going on with rogue poisons now.<br />
<br />
Only then would it even remotely be worth using AA points for AM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks like this went live today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ayup, it's a miracle... a patch which acknowledged the existence of Alchemy.... I can die happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">that Aura of Eternity effect is live too... that name and the whole spell effect looks a lot like other potion effects we have... anyone seen any new herbs on vendors? maybe we should try some combinations with the 2 pop herbs again? i know i'm gonna in about 10 minutes... ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry for forgetting the potion names but the 25STA/25CR potion stacks with Boar (likely any Sta buff) and the 25Dex/25MR stacks with Focus but the 25str/25PR does not stack with focus. <br />
Also the 25str/15sta potion doesn't stack with focus. <br />
<br />
Kinda cool all in all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>KriFos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Str... who needs :)    25 sta potions roxx... already addicted to the Greater Heat and Greater Adroitness (both gives 25sta each which stacks with eachother and our Boar buff)<br />
<br />
50sta = 150hp+ for a shaman lvl 60 - and a bit more above..</div></div><hr />
