<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently aa'ing(also so my friends can catch up to me) towards mass canni, I currently have achieved 11 aa, almost 12. I understand mass canni is the most important aa skill we have and getting it asap is pretty important,  would it be a complete waste of 2 aa to grab lvl 1 chanelling focus? I currently have ring of the walking dead with a 2% channeling mod that plus 5%(unsure wether they stack or not) would seem valuable to fire off that slow, root, heal or whatever as your getting pounded. Has anyone see a noticable difference in this aa? After all it's only 2 aa in the long run it's not gonna really slow me down that much, maybe 2-5 more hours of grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Innate Dexterity is better than Channeling Focus. Channeling Focus is the most useless skill, unles you are an ogre. <br />
By the time channeling matters that much, you will usually not fail a channeling roll, unless you get bashed or kicked(and Channeling Focus doesn't help at all with those).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Channeling focus is gimp, wish we could buy the stun resistance warriors get though lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Khang Runningwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Mass Can, it's the best AA you can get. In the long run you'll have far more mana saved by this than by channeling through the occasional interupted spell.<br />
After I got Can5, I went for Spell Casting Mastery to get the increased chance of specilization checks happening, to further decrease mana useage. With those, mental clarity and the effect on my scaled avatar's boots, I can dump mana out and stay above 75% almost all the time. It's awesome.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wytchone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I used to sing 'im just a mana machine' to the disco song Dancing machine when I first got Cann AA.  It's SO worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Channeling focus is the least useful of all our archetype abilities.  It is the last one I filled out and I don't regret saving it for last.  You should, without question, go straight for canni5.  You most certainly should not stop for something like channeling focus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I agree with Jinheim. <br />
<br />
I have channeling focus 3, but I got it only because I thought it would be fun to have the Archtype tab completely purchased.  I sure haven't noticed any improvement in my ability to channel -- and I doubt I ever will. <br />
<br />
In fact, the skill probably does nothing at all.  No matter how you look at it, it isn't worth getting channeling focus ahead of ANY other AA skill, especially Canni5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok thanks for your input everyone I really appreciate it. Straight for canni 5 then. I was just gonna do lvl 1 not anymore then that, from the sound of it though it doesn't help at all if any.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Maybe I'm all by myself on this one, but I noticed a difference with CF... I didn't take any kind of statistics, it's just gut feel that I channel through hits better now.  /shrug<br />
<br />
either way, the question asked was Can5 or CF... the right answer is Can5 even if CF was 5 times as effective as it is.  Can5 is that necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just want to clarify, it wasn't can5 or cf, it was if I should spend 2 aapoints in cf before can5. since can5&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;all<br />
unless they gave us gnome illusion aa, I'd go for that in a heart beat</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm sitting at 316 AAs right now, and I still haven't hit that first rank in channeling focus (I'm actually pretty close to getting it, just think that I will finish working on maybe dis and poison resist AAs first, then maybe RC3, then VP 2 - 3 and then maybe channeling focus).  If you haven't noticed from above, it's not a highly sought after AA skill.<br />
<br />
To summorize what was said up top:<br />
<br />
Dont' pass go, don't collect $200, go straight to CANNABALIZATION.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Valsuvious <br />
<br />
316 aa and no VP3?<br />
<br />
you must get this aa, knock mobs out of the ballpark and root them all at the same time, omg what a useful and fun aa<br />
<br />
9 aa's very worth spending.<br />
<br />
imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">VP is good, but it's usefulness really is limited, I've got VP3, but mostly to mess with my guildleader clearing trash in fire.<br />
<br />
I could've easily spent 300 without getting to it<br />
<br />
also, get canni5 as soon as possible</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cannibalization then about 250pts worth of other AA before Channeling focus.<br />
<br />
I didn't get channelling focus until it was time to win Archetype.  Right about 300.  Right now I have 30 saved for GOD and buying like 3 points of wisdom needed to cap me with voq heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I dunno how I soloed in planes without VP3.  It's soo useful.  It's basically a guaranteed 2 minute root if Malicious Decay is applied first.  Total of 4 seconds casting and you've got a rooted mob that's red to you.  Reliable?  Never had it resisted on any exp mob in Fire or Tactics after MD was in.  And it's pretty much invaluable in LDoN missions when I get to be the CC.  If i had to do it all again i'd get VP3 before MGB.</div></div><hr />

hell man, I don't even have VP2 yet.  The way I look at it, is this.  I don't solo alot, when I do, it's usually stuff I'm doing for quests or maybe some quick farming.  While I can root/rot, I much prefer tanking in the face (guess it goes back to how I got to 60.. by soloing my way there).  I like to think that I got the AAs first that were important to my class.  Meaning that I first made sure that I could survive the hits, then made sure that my buffs ran long enough, then made sure that I could heal good, then I started with dealing more dmg.  I'm a raiding shaman.  I don't group a whole lot cause I really don't need more AAs (well, maybe a few more resists).  I have done alot of hard ldon adventures, and when I do normal ones I'm usually the puller.. and I do use VP there to get the mob offof me so that I can go out and pull.  Really, I don't use it often enough right now to spend the AAs on it.  However, it is high on my priority list (well, it will be after alot of the GoD AAs.. cause despite what people are saying/thinking, we do get some pretty great AAs).</div></div><hr />

I'm 61 and was grinding AA's for Canni V, but my friends want to get me into HoH so I can join them and probably get the AA's and Level's I want a lot quicker.<br />
<br />
Now I've got some AA's sitting there unused while I level up, would you recommend spending some on VP1 or just saving them until I get canni V then go for VP?<br />
<br />
My original aim was 61 &gt; canni 5 &gt; 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Uhamok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Honestly thats up too you, can you wait to grind out those AAs you spend again, befor getting Canni? Exp will be faster, but it just puts you that much closer to Canni.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you find that your playing a fair amount of CC even VP1 can help, though not as much as VP3 would. Nothing quiet like seeing that extra mob beating on the skirt(int caster) in the group or cleric, hitting it with VP and watching the sucker fly accross the room. I found that VP1 rarely pushed the mob entirely out of melee range, but it did help. And having a different resist to work against can come in handy as well.<br />
<br />
My 2 pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Iknumon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Canni V first.  Then VP if you don't raid a lot and don't really need MGB.<br />
<br />
VP is just fantastic.  CC becomes so much easier.  Though it takes a bit to learn how to position mobs just right with it, especially in close quarters like a dungeon -- after blowing a mob practically up to the ceiling in an LDoN and having my entire group rolling hysterically on the floor as a result (my excuse -- hell it was beating on me! -- didn't stick, they still call me either &quot;Lob Shot&quot; or &quot;Hail Mary&quot;)  I'm a bit more careful with that.<br />

<br />
Usually that's the enchanter who isn't mezzing though :/  Then I have to heal them while they run around like a paniced fool.<br />
<br />
Once you get canni 5, you will wonder how you could possibly have considered holding off on getting it.  It's that useful.<br />
<br />
I'd get 62 first though, if people want you to exp in HoH.  The exp is way better and will get you to canni 5 that much faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would save your AAs for Canni V, and when you have nothing else to buy with your AAs, get this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Channeling focus as a guild requirement? Is that some form of hazing? ;) Just playing. :) I will second the others though. CanniV &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; channeling focus and any other AA ability.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do see myself being able to cast more without being interrupted if I am hit.  I guess it was not a total waste.</div></div><hr />
