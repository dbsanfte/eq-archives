Which is better?<br />
<br />
The Onyx chain sleevs has better AC but scaled avatar sleeves has effect which is 3 HP regen per tick.  Now I understand some shamans are very into HP regen since we can convert it into mana.<br />
<br />
What do you all think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a tough call really, more saves/ac vs ~16hps/3 regen per tick.   Tbh I'd likely hold out for better sleeves or just go with the scaled Avatar ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sir Yakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">How about, &quot;the difference is too small to upgrade&quot;.  Whichever one you are wearing, or can get first, wear.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jeraem Gaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">/Agree with Sir Yakk<br />
<br />
I have onyx so I'm not pursuing avatar if they have this regen effect. If I didnt have either I'd just use whichever I got first. If ornate had the same effect (healing 4) of the elemental then I'd be looking into them. Magelo lists them as healing 4 but I heard they had this regen instead. Anyone have some that know for sure what effect is on them?</div></div><hr />

The regen on the arms is normally melee thing which matches the ranger class you have in your post.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kromy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Even with improved healing 4, I am not sure if it is better than onxy chain arm.  At lvl 65, seems the only spell that I cast these days that is affected by Improved healing IV is Tnarg mending.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.<br />
<br />
I tried changing my magelo profile and yeah, the effect is IH 4.<br />
<br />
So with IH 4, would it change your opinion?  Tnarg mending can do up to 1,560 HP heal now.<br />
<br />
Strangely, I can't get Scaled Avatar's gloves or boots out of magelo profile though.</div></div><hr />

Ranger - Planestriders Vambraces (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11446)<br />
Shaman - Scaled Avatar's Sleeves (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=11518)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wisey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Just curious.<br />
<br />
So with the improved healing 4 effect, would anyone prefer it over onxy chain sleeves?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you got the Onyx Chain Sleeves and are able to get the mold for the Scaled Avatar stuff, you can probably semi-easily get another IH4 item. The torque from the PoI prototypes or the veil from TT come to mind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would gladly take the scaled avatar sleeves over the onyx chain given a choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boots are the bane of my existence. They have &quot;blast of venom&quot; as a &quot;focus effect&quot; of course, its not a focus effect at all.. its a dd.. but they arent clickable.. they dont do anything for any spell we can cast..<br />
<br />
GRRR I also seem to be one of 2 total shaman in all of EQ to have and have noticed this problem =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can thank the absurdly rare drop rates on the boots specifically for this. I think I've seen 1 whole pair of chain boots on xegony, and they were on a rogue.</div></div><hr />
