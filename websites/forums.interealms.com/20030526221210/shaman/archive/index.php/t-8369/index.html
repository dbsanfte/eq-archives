<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">When I hit level 19 I see 4 shrinking spells, and 3 of them look to do the same thing (Ant Legs, Diminution, and Shrink) and Tiny Companion bringing up th rear. What is the deal here? I checked allahkazam for spell info and the grouped 3 all say that you shrink 34% and cost 50 mana... why have 3 spells that do the same thing? Or even what is the benefit of being smaller?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ant Legs is actually the effect on the shrink Potion. It was created as a seperate effect because Shrink was limited to indoor only (said restriction was removed Sept 26th of this year)  and they wanted the potion to work anywhere. It isn't actually a castable spell.<br />
<br />
Diminution, I haven't seen anything that actually has said effect - it is essentially a wasted slot. It isn't a castable spell.<br />
<br />
Shrink is the one that you really can get, scribe, and cast.<br />
<br />
Tiny Companion was added in PoP for all classes that have pets (and all get it at level 19). It differs from Shrink in the following ways:<br />
1)50% reduction instead of 34%<br />
2)It only works on your own pet<br />
<br />
For a shaman, it is a pretty much pointless spell. Shaman only got it because they have a pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye. Tiny Companion was mostly added becaues of the bitching about the Mage Pets, particulary air and water. <br />
<br />
I just got used to grouping with the mages and shrinking their pets, then growling when they resummoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What's the use of these spells? I have been shrunk before but did not understand any value of it... and with &quot;Grow&quot; I did not se myself get any bigger. Thanks for any response :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Try to group with some ogre tanks in dungeons. They are so fat, i always fear, they get stuck in a tunnel someday :D <br />
<br />
So mostly for shrinking large races, when you need the space and want to see something except their behinds.<br />
<br />
And you should shrink your bear form in later lvls, cause it is quite huge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hyacinth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shrink works wonders when you're grouped with barbies, ogres, &amp; Iksar in a teeny tiny dungeon. ;)<br />
<br />
Also, Shrink helps you get into places like the Hole without a key and other places that may be difficult to maneuver around in.</div></div><hr />
