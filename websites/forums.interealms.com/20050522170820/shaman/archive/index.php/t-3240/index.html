<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been over a year since played EQ, might fire up a toon on one of the zeks, because they arent pimp daddy crowded, curious how different the shaman is since I stopped playing last year.<br />
<br />
troll shaman be good in PvP right?<br />
<br />
<br />
I just get too damn bored not playing any online games :(<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pre 50 shaman are a good PvP class, though your best PvP will come around 35. Unfortunately our poison dots are too easily resisted. post 50 you will be pretty ineffectualy unless it is against pure INT casters, but even then it will be touch and go against some of them.<br />
<br />
As for PvP at 60, I have no clue, as I am not 60 and I have left RZ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My 60 Shaman friend in guild Killed 6 people in bazaar arena 6 vs. 1 heh heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dueling for fun on a non PVP server just can't be compared to life on a Zek server.<br />
<br />
By all accounts, Zek server players are masters of preparedness, running around with all resist buffs, paying attention to buff stacking, using all tools at their disposal like golem wands or pumice stones.  They are also good at using the terrain to their advantage, circle strafing, jousting, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The problem at level 60 is that shamans have no ways of offense vs. Melees with high end gear. For the first part, disease/poison spells are way easily resisted, and if you have a potion, will there goes 400+ mana. Ice nukes are a joke, you'll get pounded horribly and not to mentioned interupted. However, rabid bear might tip da seesaw harr, and mebbe we cud have a chance vs. melees. A dog is minor help, a shadowknight/pal/warrior can easily back and outjoust it in about 5 decent hits.<br />
<br />
However, shamans are the best dueling priest class, you can easily defeat a druid or cleric, shouldn't even consider a cleric. The only caster I see shamans should have problems with is a Necro, but you can still defeat them. I was able to kill our necro server botb winner, with about 30% or so of my mana back, we didn't use pets though =)<br />
<br />
As I see it, shamans are prolly the best caster dueler vs. other casters, against melees its very icky, at least we can beat rogues with a damage shield potion and healing ourselves. THe class that would pose the most problem would be of course a Pal or SK. Rangers are also nasty. Bards, I dont even consider them duelers really. <br />
<br />
This is from a high end perspective, if you were dueling someone with crap resists, yea of course you will win. I was able to defeat a 60 warrior that actually had nice gear for the time period, full warlords and a few misc. items.<br />
<br />
So to think of it. Classes we have NO chance at all to beat are.<br />
*High End Perspective<br />
1.) Paladin<br />
2.) Shadowknight<br />
3.) Ranger<br />
4.) Monk<br />
5.) Beastlord<br />
<br />
I mean its really hard to get a spell off when some monk is crushing you for 300+ ya know? Torpor is outdmged by their melee, a mere 50heal per sec ain't doin much.<br />
<br />
Bards dont really count, they run run run run and its ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I've dropped each one of the said classes. No chance you say? I disagreee 100%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Rallos Zek is a totally different ballgame from SZ, TZ, and VZ.  On RZ your gear choice is affected alot by the no drop tag and if you aren't in a powerful guild, you probably won't have much great no drop gear.<br />
<br />
On the other zeks, everyone has massive resists at all times.  Shamans don't stack up in lvl 60 PvP.  Most of the time even if you were going to kill someone he'll just zoneplug or gate to his bind point.<br />
<br />
Shamans have very little offense.  If you're looking to rack up killshots, choose a different class.  I'm not saying that shamans aren't fun to PvP with... they can be... but solo PvP as a shaman will bring much frustration.<br />
<br />
Many players carry cure disesae and cure poison potions making your DoTs 100% ineffective.  Your nukes really blow.  You just don't have offense.<br />
<br />
Necromancer and Wizard are the best classes to get killshots with in the high-end game on the zeks.  Manaburn and Lifeburn as well as cheap fast-casting offensive spells are just where its at.<br />
<br />
Shadow Knights and Rangers are good for getting kills too.  Trueshot rangers can rip people up in the proper terrain and Unholy aura harm touch can basically 1-shot most INT casters.<br />
<br />
The worst classes for getting kills are Shaman, Cleric, Bard, and Enchanter because all those classes lack offensive ability.  I've seen some chanters with the lure nuke from tormax rack up some nice kill lists though :).<br />
<br />
If you want to play a Shaman on a zek, it can be alot of fun.  I don't advise it if PvP is your main focus though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a 60 shaman, I can kill anyone who is unprepared. The problem is keeping them around long enough to do it. We are not a gank class and our opponents have forever to get away/zonplug. I've caused many more people to die at their bindpoints than I have gotten insignia from. Also, high end melee are usually unkillable for us, and high end wizards are too because of self buffs + familiar buffed resists on top of gear. My favorite targets are druids. They are so good at ganking that they get cocky, and that leaves me plenty of opportunity to kill them. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Holy crap COltrane please share your duel tactics.<br />
<br />
I have problems killing shadowknights yah...<br />
<br />
THINK ABOUT IT.<br />
<br />
ICE STRIKE = NO<br />
<br />
DOTS = NO -------- THEY CAN EASILY, EASILY EASILY EASILY EASILY GET A FEW DAMN POTIONS. <br />
<br />
POTIONS, CURE DISEASE POTIONS, will cure POX and SLOW. IF they are any DECENT at pvp they will EASILY outjoust your pet and YOU can't land a spell on them because when you finish they'll have out of range.<br />
<br />
MIND you I am talking about a HIGH END PERSPECTIVE, DID YOU READ? I hate it when I have to explode and use caps.<br />
<br />
I also stated that this was WITHOUT rabid bear, I do NOT have rabid bear so I cannot test it myself. I figured if your joust skills are fare you well you WILL be able to beat them. <br />
<br />
I would also like to know how you chewed through a 60 Paladin, who has 5 charges of complete heal, along with Celeastial Cleansing, who probably has a Great Spear of Dawn poking at you.<br />
<br />
I will say this ONE more time, POTIONS, reallyl CHEAP CHEAP POTIONS that they can make a TWINK to create.<br />
<br />
Monks? Same deal as above, they aren't as powerful but HOW can you go OFFENSIVE on them.<br />
<br />
Damage Shield Potion? Theyl'l have 2handers, since yer on RZ I'd suspect everyone jousts their brains out?<br />
<br />
Yes even rangers can use 2handers. With a trueshot DISC you will probably be hiding a lot...Hell they'll bow kite you to death. They don't have to come into contact? Cast a spell? They'll go OOR, come back in, shoot you. C'mon THINK about it.<br />
<br />
Sorry in a pissy mood. I'm probably wrong, someone disprove all this crap I just said. Do not say that they cannot obtain these potions, preparation is a must. Its like going shopping without money. Bad analogy but you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
Btw my SK is 52 Morbad ;p<br />
<br />
You can tell EQ pvp is rigged, my 52 SK has taken out 60 warriors with primal/ntov gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heh, yeah, I've seen you rip up people in commons with your SK.<br />
<br />
What, are you keeping him at level 52 just to embarass people?  I remember him being 51 many months ago, heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sallaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hi, wanna duel, here are my rules no potions or pet.  <br />
<br />
I think this is fair since its not their skill to make potions unless shaman so its not them fighting its the potion. So is this fair?  Hehe just MHO :)  Bet you $100 their reply is &quot;No wait thats not fair you can't do that the potions are my life its not me that fights its the potion!&quot; Hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Jenoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I want an unresistable poison debuff at lvl 52 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Being on Vallon Zek. I have only been killed a few times in my 52 seasons.  These are usually when I have just gotten done finishing a mob, and melee jumps on me at that point with low mana, half health or so.  Most straight up encounters I tend to draw or have to gate myself if it gets real close to me dying.  I ran into a 56 Wizard the other day in SRo and all I could do was heal his nukes while dogdog chipped away at him.  Once he was oom and i still had over half health with about 20m left, he was low health from dogdog, and i fired up my 44 Poison Nuke, only to see him gate away before the spell went off. :mad:   Most encounters end like this solo, in a group encounter it becomes more to a shaman's advantage as you can have time to malxx, slow melee, throw in some dot's once resists are down, and then go slamming with your 2hb with melee or caster backup.  I like the group encounters more as more tactics are involved and you gotta think about blowing a whole bub of mana on EBolt if it might not stick.<br />
<br />
Life on the Zeks is good if you stay out of the &quot;easy&quot; cycle zones (I'm sure you know what I mean) as the kewl d00ds/gankers tend to hang out in those areas.  All PvP I've had the pleasure of being in was straight up fights (asides from the occasional passing gankage after mob fights).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well Morbad hehe when I  hit 55 there will hardly be any challenges really, 60 warriors were trivial at about 51 hehe. Honestly don't have much time to level him with the AA points needed on my shaman. When I do play him he's in the bazaar reena hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Being on Sullon Zek it is hard getting kill shots in because most gate to their bind point and die to dots, but I have found out a few ways to kill the harder classes:<br />
Note: dogdog is always up nipping<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
ID, IF, Malo, Malosini, Blind<br />
Being dot stacking:  BoN, Pox, Spear (if you want)<br />
Blind, Bracer/Ice strike<br />
<br />
The trick is getting the MR down to blind, though some smart PvPers got hotkeys, its a real bitch to use em when blinded.  I dont know of many paladins with high MR past 180-200, and malosini gets it down to around 80.  <br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
ID, IF, Pox, Plague, dogdog on heels<br />
wear em down about all you can do<br />
<br />
Monk:<br />
BoN, I get so few resists on this against monks and once that mend is gone then you can start dot stacking. <br />
<br />
SK:<br />
A bit harder, got to ID, IF, Pox, Plague em and make sure you got near full HP at all times.  They go down faster then a warrior.  Blind pet.<br />
<br />
Ranger:<br />
If they archery disc, just run, you cant deal with it.<br />
If not, malo, malosini, BoN, Ice strike, they tend to have lowest hp of the melee classes and go down quick but if that bow comes out you better hoof it cause you cant take the damage.<br />
<br />
Beastlord:<br />
Really cant tell you because of the lack of them, overall I find them to be a mage without spells, a weak version of shaman and mage put together.  I would assume blind pet and ID/IF/pox/plague em to death.<br />
<br />
Paladin and Ranger are hard pressed to beat.  Period.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I never think shaman is any good at pvp, but not insanely poor pvper.<br />
<br />
If you rank the classes up, we're probably around low middle (A little below average).<br />
<br />
Resists just kill.<br />
<br />
These talks about having dogdog nipping enemy doesn't really work much.  If the opponent has half a brain, he or she will kill the little nuisance first right of the bat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">When all things are equal at 60, hybrids pretty  much rule pvp.<br />
<br />
As a shaman, it's difficult to kill anyone who is A) repared or B)superbly geared.<br />
<br />
It's kinda sad trying to kill warriors with almost 6k unbuffed HP with 200+ on all resists.<br />
<br />
However, it's not easy for other classes to kill a shaman, and as long as your opponent isn't repared or don't have ungodly equipment, you stand a pretty good chance of gaining the upper hand. It will be difficult for you to actually kill somebody if they don't want to die, but forcing them to withdraw isn't impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're assuming too much :rolleyes: Once I see a melee start to turn on dog dog, running up and whacking them with your big 2-hander for 80's makes them reconsider who they should be focusing on ;) They tend to turn back to me, and when they do, I either joust or just pet kite them just out of melee range, it's pretty comical sometimes :D <br />
<br />
You'd be surprised (maybe not) about how so little some people know about their class in PvP.  In my wiz example the other night, if he would have nuked, stunned, nuked, stunned, I would have had no chance at all to heal myself.  I could just feel his frustration building as he nuked and i'd heal it right back up with dog-dog interrupting just enough to give me time to catch up on the extra damage i couldn't heal (420 nukes, only heal for 270 at the time).<br />
<br />
Edit: Don't underestimate dogdog either.  I had a Druid friend that wanted to fight dogdog while we were camping Ghoul assassin room for a rogue friend.  Fight was basically her trying to cast the whole fight with dogdog interrupting every cast she tried.  The only thing that wore dogdog down was those dern Damage shields they have.  She treats dogdog with respect now :D <br />
<br />
I guess I've been lucky so far with not running into any lamer people that send tells to me whining after a fight.  Most send a tell with good fight, or hey, close fight you almost had me, can't wait til next time.  All us Zekkers aren't that bad ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Up until Luclin, PvP was fairly balanced. But with all the AA abilities and weapons with insane dmg/delay ratios, the balance has definitely tipped in favor of melees.<br />
<br />
Wizards/Necros with mana/lifeburn are a pain in the ass, mainly because it requires no real skill to get a kill in one-on-one PvP. Hell, I got crit nuked by Elnerick's Electrical Rending for 2300+ dmg a few weeks ago, with an MR of over 160.<br />
<br />
I've seen rangers with trueshot and ubah bows crit-hit kill people in less than 10 seconds. Paladins at 60th with good gear are well-nigh impossible to kill, particularly with a few insta-clickies so you cant get rid of their DOT heals. SKs have always been evil, because they only realistically have to get you down to about 1/3 to 1/2 health, then HT. Monks are bad if they catch you indoors, as are rogues with frontstab, unless you can get a decent dmg shield running. Bards are just obnoxious but not dangerous, until they get their mana-drain song. Warriors....well, if you play one dont expect to do that well in PvP (as far as actual killing goes) unless it's raiding groups, when competent warriors form the foundation for a group victory.<br />
<br />
But apart from insta-kills like manaburn, very few classes in EQ can stop a shaman who wants to get away from a fight. Up until the AA abilities came along, the only things I feared outdoors were velocitied epic mage pets and 56+ monks with T-staves. (Inner Flame + 100 Blows hurts :eek: )<br />
<br />
But against anyone who doesnt have an assload of AA ability points and who isnt in the uberest of your particular server's uber guilds, a shaman above 55 doesnt do all that badly. Just try and keep all your resists above 150, have Insidious Decay memmed, and your first 2 buff slots open, and you'll do fine against 90% of a server population.<br />
<br />
And please dont insult us Zek'ers with talk that seems to equate dueling with real PvP. Until you've wiped out another guild in a 40 on 40 grudge match for a spawn in Ssra, you havent really played EQ. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Ok Moosh. The tricks are as follows, distance,golem wands,pumice stones,stinging wort potions,da idol if you can farm one,ds potions are great indoors, but useless outdoors(read,distance),and a great trick as also the right click pet maker from KC. With rangers, as it was said, you have to run when they start using you for target practice,you ain't gonna make it otherwise.With paladins and sk's, you need to be patient. We cannot kill peoples really fast,but in the long run, you can win. Once you slap malo or malosini on them,try your best to land cripple. This will work as a lower snare, as you should have allready taken off most of their buffs in the begining.ID and pox are your best weapons. Yes, it will take a while, but it will work.Same goes for warriors,it takes time, and lots of it. I'll post more on the subject when I can,or do a search under my nae for other pvp posts. And yes, I am talking about high end encounters,level 56 +.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Seems like too much work involved to PvP.   There's a long list of things we can do, but 3/4's of it doesn't take out your opponent.<br />
Which is why I hate dueling, although I've taken out a druid in the arena once. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Eek!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell when I stopped playing a shaman was nigh unstoppable, think was a tie with necros and shaman at the top levels. I don't even know what an AA point is. Ya it has been that long.<br />
<br />
I would think wizards would just blow because of resists, the lure type spells don't even come in to play untill post 50 right?<br />
<br />
I had an enchanter, was pretty good dueling, but unless pet was there duel wielding and hasted and alive, no offense, agreed.<br />
<br />
Worried about playing a melee as they are so equipment oriented, and I have never been a good farmer or uber l33t gear dude.<br />
<br />
Won't make it to high high levels I am sure, was thinking of fun in mid range.<br />
<br />
<br />
Started last night, have a iksar shammy to 6 and a wizard, my god am I a  noob, took me forever to figure out how to read my newbie note.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill the pitiful</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Coltrane, did you read what I said? CURE DISEASE POTIONS<br />
<br />
They can dispell cripple too.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming people on RZ are concerned about pvp.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok now read what I said above.<br />
<br />
Again.<br />
<br />
Do you know what jousting is? If you think about it, someone can hit you pet, BACK UP, let the pet follow, HIT IT AGAIN, 2 more times it's dead. They'll go out of range of your spells with this, and if you back your pet, will congratulations you didn't accomplish much. If you were casting a spell he'd be too far away for you to /pet back off.<br />
<br />
The pet from KC is a joke, this is ONLY good with casters who can be interupted.<br />
<br />
And no, I MEANT 60, not 56+<br />
<br />
I mean, sure when I was 57 I easily beat a 56 Paladin.<br />
<br />
I suppose you are right Coltrane, this would work for people who, can't find a choice of words but I'll say suck. You need to SUCK really bad in order to lose to a 60 Shaman if you are a 'decent'.<br />
<br />
And have this in thought, What did you say you did about Shadowknight lifetaps? They can probably lifetap you well over 1500dmg worth of tapping, and healing themselves while at it. You realize, if they get you under half your dead.<br />
<br />
You say stinging wort potions? Well good lord if I had a backback full of them I don't think I'd lose either huh?<br />
<br />
Ok lets say we have a prepared Paladin, JUST LIKE YOU.<br />
<br />
Weapon - Great Spear of Dawn.<br />
<br />
Gear - In partial Ntov, has primal.<br />
<br />
Toys - Soulfire, Ivandyrs Hoop (soulfire EASY to get)<br />
<br />
Spell - Celestial Cleansing - 900hp heal? or 600 I fergets =)<br />
<br />
Lets say its a 600 hp heal. Ok, they can cast it about say 15 times.<br />
<br />
Thats 9000hp of damage you need to pummel through, IF YOU DISPELL IT, thats even worse, hel'l come up and bash you apart. Or if you think of dispellling it from a distant, he'll run out of range.<br />
<br />
Ok after that is wasted, say he has about 4000hp. 5 complete heals? Lets say that'll heal 19000hp. So  uhm... Ivandyrs hoop? Gonna do 720 dmg to you, and give him 720hp. That makes 28720hp YOU HAVE TO DOT THROUGH.<br />
<br />
Thats 21.54 CASTS of POX. Assuming he resists NONE. Thats also equal to over 9300 mana. Heh, we don't even NEED the ivandyrs hoop.<br />
<br />
Bleh ok one more time. CURE DISEASE POTIONS!<br />
<br />
Paladins actually won't need them with that much healing power hehe. <br />
<br />
Ok uhm lets clarify this one more time.<br />
<br />
CURE DISEASE POTIONS, CURE POISON POTIONS<br />
<br />
They're so cheap I destroy them instead of selling it back when I was leveling Alchemy.<br />
<br />
Read Boinshar's post, that is EXACTLY what I wanted to say. High end I meant 60's with HIGH END GEAR. Reason being, I said HIGH END.<br />
<br />
I dont know of many paladins with high MR past 180-200, and malosini gets it down to around 80.  <br />
<br />
Oh good god, a shaman that doesn't know what his spell decreases resistances by.  200 - 60 = 140. <br />
<br />
With rangers, as it was said, you have to run when they start using you for target practice,you ain't gonna make it otherwise. <br />
<br />
Ok great, now how do you kill them? You can't POX them, they'll be out of range. OUT OF RANGE shooting you any chance they get. They're not stupid, they won't go in and melee you heh.<br />
<br />
I had a ranger the other day SHOOT me for 170, 160, 100.<br />
<br />
That hurts.<br />
<br />
<br />
ID and pox are your best weapons.  <br />
<br />
Well uh disease potions are their counter. Once again, they're cheap as dirt unlike the stinging wort potions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're assuming too much  Once I see a melee start to turn on dog dog, running up and whacking them with your big 2-hander for 80's makes them reconsider who they should be focusing on  They tend to turn back to me, and when they do, I either joust or just pet kite them just out of melee range, it's pretty comical sometimes   <br />
<br />
Uhm okay I guess I assume too much that everyone has a half brain hehe. They can easily joust your pet by hitting it, BACKING UP away from you, hitting it again, BACK UP, hit it again, well its dead now. Shadowknights will probably hit your poor green pet for at least 200 a pop, this guy with a great spear of dawn impaled me for over 300.<br />
<br />
If they archery disc, just run, you cant deal with it.  <br />
<br />
You can't just RUN away, you need to HIDE behind a tree, druid portal,  wiz spire, mountain etc you name it. THEY HAVE SOW TOO!<br />
<br />
Really cant tell you because of the lack of them, overall I find them to be a mage without spells, a weak version of shaman and mage put together. I would assume blind pet and ID/IF/pox/plague em to death.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords - They have our lesser spells, THUS will have CURE diease line, you can't pox them, casting blind on pet means a beastlord hitting you.<br />
<br />
I am also sorry I said IMPOSSIBLE to kill them, I overexaggerated that hehe, since nothing is impossible except for something to be impossible.<br />
<br />
Anyways lets go over the important points...cure...disease..potions =(</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for level 60 shaman vs. Paladin or SK, uh, yeah.  They have to be in waaay crappy equipment to lose, or just be totally and utterly clueless.<br />
<br />
Notwithstanding bards, paladins are tough mofos in a duel.  Celestial Cleansing is a 700 point heal for 225 mana.  The average &quot;well equippped&quot; paladin has ~2100ish mana, uber paladins have around 3000.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Thought resist debuffs had a 150% effect on PVP. So Malosini would reduce by about 90. Regardless, I can't help but agree... Shamans suck at PVP.<br />
<br />
When I duel a melee, they almost always keep up with me where I go. A typical fight involves trying to get the hell away from it to cast... because it is damn near impossible to channel spells through some Monk or Warrior who is quadding you at an extremely fast pace. Let alone one spell sticks... the resist rates are atrocious, and our offensive abilities are limited. And, of course as said, anyone can cure themselves of pretty much anything a Shaman can actually land. Our nukes are also quite lame, too. Dueling a Ranger is a complete no, since he/she can just get away from you and blast you with overpowered arrows.<br />
<br />
Casters... based on them I guess. All I know is, when it boils down to who can dish out more hurt faster... I always find myself falling behind. Wizards, Necroes, and Mages can pretty much out-blast you... Necroes are actually the worst, since they heal themselves with every lifetap. Wizard and Mage nukes are difficult to resist as well.<br />
<br />
The only real advantageous tactic I've had is hiding and chaining the JBB/Ice Strike/ToP on them, while they frantically search for me. Even then, some just cast back, or use a ranged attack to locate me. Meleeing, DoTting, debuffing and tanking... none of them work well enough to be efficent tactics for the Shaman. The pet too, is worthless. Any melee can dispatch it instantly, jousting or not.<br />
<br />
Insidious Decay / DR DOT isn't too bad too... but again, a smart PVPer will just cure it. Shield of the Immaculate, anyone?<br />
<br />
To sum it up, Shamans are not the best at PVP. I can't help but agree... you have to suck to lose to us! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">buy a horse, you cant be backstabbed or shot with arrows, nice isnt it?<br />
<br />
and you have to realize pvp and dueling are 2 very different things. duels are usually all out defensive to see who has the most mana/clickable toys. pvp is completely different. a 60 shaman can kill any class, you just have to know what you're doing. you'd be amazed at how few people carry cure poison/disease potions, you act as if they are ground spawn items everywhere. 60 shm with good gear vs any 60 caster (cept lifeburn/manaburn) and the 60 shaman wins, every time. just ask kylt, crashem, or lenard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Rigu, I think everyone knows that we can beat any caster, we've been talking about melees. As I stated above I defeated our server botb necro winner with like 30m leftover.<br />
<br />
Yet no one has told me how you can kill a Paladin with healing ability that totals to 28000. It's actually a little more than 28000, I was a little off, as stated by someoen Celestial Cleansing heals 700 not 600.<br />
<br />
And no there is no 150% debuff thing, where the hell was this from? I just casted malo on myself and wup tee dooo its still -45.<br />
<br />
If there was the 150% debuff, what about Darkness/Snare lines? That has to be really crazy<br />
<br />
Yer right the disease potions are not ground spawns, but they're cheap as crap. If you have any concern about dueling you'd at least make a shaman to make them for you, or even buy them as for they're cheap as hell.<br />
<br />
As someone stated, any smart player would carry around these potions.<br />
<br />
My 52 SK almost beat a 60 Shaman, he had a sliver of red health left and I used my HT already, if I was a few levels higher I'd beat him. If my SK was level 60, think about how BADLY I'd kill him. Perhaps that shaman sucked? He was in the #2 guild on my server, didn't win botb but I wouldn't say he sucked.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Sssithmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">150% debuffs are part of the pvp rule set of Zek servers.<br />
A list of the rule sets can be found at the link below.<br />
http://eqlive.station.sony.com/library/sz_rule_sets.jsp<br />
<br />
Shaman are great for pvp, as a 60 shaman on SZ I find that it is almost impossible to kill me outdoors.  Only times that I cant get my self out of trouble are when I dont see a mana burn coming or get gang up on in group pvp.  <br />
<br />
DS and Regen are your friends vs meelees, as are 60 clerics with aego.  The trick to killing people are getting them when they are not expecting it, killing that quading druid or wizard, or a groups warrior right before a cleric cast CH during one of there pulls.  Pulling a train and picking off people that get low.<br />
<br />
A fun game is finding a group of 45+ and seeing how many stand still for all 3 waves of torrent.<br />
<br />
Shaman lack finishing power, this is true, but we are essential for group PvP, torporing meelees and moding clerics. Maloing every one you see, IDing so your necro can snare.  Shaman roles on group pvp are much the same as pve, put shaman stack much better in pvp, there always more pepole to malo and heal in pvp raids then there are mobs in pve.<br />
<br />
Granted I might not be able to kill you, but I can make your life misrable enough to leave me alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>CasmussSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">There is a +50% addition to resist debuffs on SZ. And if there weren't, casters wouldn't have a prayer except for wiz/necro. Also, there was a patch about 10 months ago that changed the way resists work. It's alot more random now on spells that can land for partial damage. For instance, I resisted sunstrike (thx 230 FR) and then it hit me for 820. You have a higher chance of resisting with higher resists, but damage spells aren't unresistable anymore. <br />
<br />
As far as pvp goes... a 60 shaman can be a monster if played correctly. We can be huge in group pvp, but unfortunately opposing melee usually know this and I often find myself swamped by monks and rogues early in fights. Fighting against green cons (54 and below) is almost never a concern and I can take on up to 3 at a time (depending on their class makeup). Fighting against even cons is much more difficult, and I have to be well prepared and have my bag of tricks ready if I'm going to have a chance to kill them. <br />
<br />
Oh, and one other thing: the worst class to fight against solo, and even moreso in group/multi group pvp are BARDS. THere is no way to kill a bard as a shaman (or as most any other class) unless they are stupid or make mistakes - they are so broken in pvp it's ridiculous. Bards are the difference in all fights on SZ due to selo's, super haste, and charmburning, and paladins are a close second in high lvl group pvp thanks to their group heals.</div></div><hr />

Just because you can't see how it can be done, doesn't mean noone else can't either.<br />
<br />
On a Zek-server a 60 shaman that plays with a clever mind can do wonders - don't diss all his opponents as fools just because he can win over them... and for the record: SKs aren't invincible <br />
/grin</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only class that is a pain in the ass is SKs, if you even think about getting low on HPs they will end the fight right then and there.<br />
<br />
But yeah, shamans don't kill anybody quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I think Moosh and Coltrane are talking about two different aspects of PvP--dueling and ganking.<br />
<br />
On blue servers, most PvP that occur are duels, and when two skilled players duel, they are both extremely prepared. One on one, you can seem some spectacular duels between well played chars of ANY class.<br />
<br />
On red servers, PvP is mostly defined by jumping someone who's not ready, or on RZ, jumping someone who's not using the best of gears for fear of item loot. Ganking by nature gives the attacker a HUGE advantage, only the extremely skilled, or extremely lucky, can balance the playing field after being jumped.<br />
<br />
When ganking, shamans can do well, almost any class can do well. Jumping  a group of level 45s shouldn't even be a problem for a cleric, with their resists reduced to nothing (cleric = 9 judgements, me = 255 unbuffed MR, resists = 0.).<br />
<br />
When dueling, you are going to have one hell of a time trying to kill anyone who's remotely skilled with a shaman, I often have to go down to jousting (vs fairly unskilled melees, but unskilled melees who brought potions) to finish them off.<br />
<br />
By contrast, my level 53 SK (yes, he's twinked, a lot) killed more uber equipped 60 wars, monks, and rogues, than I can count.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying ALL pvp that goes on on red servers are gank fests, but after playing on RZ a long time ago, I think it's fairly accurate to say that MOST PvP encounter on a red server are ganks. Remmber, when you gank someone, they inherently are not ready, therefore giving you the upper hand. A level 60 shaman vs anybody duel, on the other hand, starts off with the shaman at the disadvantage when both players come prepared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Ganking harhar nice choice of words Boinshar =)<br />
<br />
Anyways thanks for correcting me, don't play on a pvp server to know the +50% debuff thing. Have a question though, what happens to the slow %? Does it go up or no? Does this also means debuffs last longer? <br />
<br />
Also would like to apologize for my agressiveness, but some of you &quot;Zek ERS&quot; make it sound like people on blue servers don't know jack, or even duel. Winning Shaman BoTB I should know something don't ya think? :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Sanctifier</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Facts:<br />
<br />
Blue servers are not real PvP servers, a blubie shaman can talk all he wants on PvP but until he lives on a zek from level 1 on up then he can get the real experience.<br />
<br />
Duels are not real PvP, they are planned PvP.<br />
<br />
PvP servers are real PvP servers, its why they are red servers and not blue servers.<br />
<br />
People who play on red servers know a lot more about PvP then a standard blubie would, even though a blubie will have better equipment since there are no real PC encounters just Group monster gank fests.<br />
<br />
A shaman is a god in PvP, you are the one who can adjust to the battlefield, one on one you can beat any class except another shaman of equal skill/caliber/equipment, because it comes to a draw or a battle of annul/epic/JBB/torpor fest, which then comes down to melee between the 2.<br />
<br />
You cannot be killed unless you let yourself be killed, save MB/LB and a SK who randomly warps into you while you are zoning at half life.<br />
<br />
PR/DR resistances need to be upped because resisting BoN or Ebolt with a resist of 70 constantly is nuts, it should be around 120+ just to have a chance to resist, esp on red servers where 60-70 gets away with it, if this was upped considerably I feel that alot more battles would swing our way.<br />
<br />
Shaman need a lure dot aa skill, pallys/sk's get nice horses (equiv to 100k horse), wizzys get insta gate/lure roots/MB, rangers get am3, we get...<br />
<br />
:rolleyes: Mass group buff.   (ok it has its uses. Khuras, about it)<br />
<br />
For a offensively based priest caster we sure do get some real offense: Rabid bear, 2 hour reuse.  How about something with a real use like Lure of the spirits, 300dd 225 tick for 7 ticks dot, unresistable, reuse time same as manaburn???  After all it is lv59 and time invested would justify it.  <br />
<br />
Cure poison/disease potions need to NOT be able to cure a lv59 disease or 56 poison so quickly, even counteract poison/disease.  Thats like saying heres the bubonic plague, take 2 advil and you are instantly ok.  Make it so a lv5 spell cannot cure a lv59 disease.   Make disinfecting aura and abolish lines be able to cure lv50+ poisons/dots.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">There's also a common misconception about PvP skills, since PvP is seperated into combat and suvival.<br />
<br />
Combat skill, as a whole, is being able to not only use the ability of your class to the fullest, but also to know the weakness of ever other class, to use everything at your disposal to capitalize on those weaknesses, to be able to create weaknesses when possible, and to use surrounding terrain to your advantage.<br />
<br />
The vast majority of Red players for the most part know more about survival than the vast majority of Blue players. However, there exist Blue players who *are* skilled in combat as mentioned above. Not only are they skilled in combat, they also have a far more experience in dealing with people who are far better equipped and who come prepared against every tactic you can use against them. They are more experienced in ways to crack open the formitable defenses of someone who comes to a fight with a full compliment of potions, insta clicks, insta-heals, and single charged items.<br />
<br />
For Red players, most of the PvP experience they referre to include group pvp (which is extremely rare on blue servers for obvious reasons), common sense (hide somewhere while medding, keep an eye out for that druid while soloing), ways to avoid being killed (zoning, plugging, use lag/hilly areas to throw off persuers), and know what fights to pick and when to run away. For the most part, these are survival skills, not PvP skills, although it can be argued either way.<br />
<br />
That, is why Blues have won all of the &quot;PvP&quot; contests Verant has hosted, because those contests only test one's combat skill, and everything a Red knows about survival goes out of the window when restricted on a small, flat, and clear platform in the Arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Tyric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Actually, I'd say the old BotBs were won by blue server players due to gear disparity. With the rise of red server uber-guilds like Pandemonium, Hate, etc., I think you'll see PvP server teams and individuals doing a lot better in inter-server events (assuming Verant ever runs another one, unlikely with Lady D gone). In the last ToT, Afterlife's team (which won) said that the semi-final fight with Pandemonium was more difficult (something like 16-14) than their fight with any other team, including the final match (which was something like 17-4) they were in to win it.<br />
<br />
And when you play on PvP servers, you learn more about tricks like casting Malo to remove DMF from necros, using telescopes to create open buff slots at the front to make WD, Splurt, etc. easier to dispel, and the fact that disease DOTs are one of the few spells that dont have to eat through a wizard's epic skin before they start doing damage directly to the HP total.<br />
<br />
If they made Turgurs, Cripple, and poison DOTs a bit less resistable in PvP, even with the gear disparity, shamen would be able to clean up, even against paladins and bards. Mmmm....BoN and Pox on a bard. :)<br />
<br />
And for the guy talking about Cure Poison/Disease potions...I've downed 2-3 doses of Cure Disease on my rogue just to remove Insidious Decay. They arent the end-all-be-all of beating shamen. If necessary, you can just keep reapplying ID to make sure they never get the chance to touch Pox. Meanwhile your DOT is eating away at them while they try and channel off a potion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">At 60, melees are easy if ya have good alchemy, Kilva's Skin of Flame + Torpor = dead melees.

Also, if possible when fighting melees, get into a corner so they cant push you around, that is what will get ya killed.  Against casters, /shrug, I have ok resists and they usually cant land much on me, but malo lets me cast on them and I can always break out the Hammer of Spiritcalling and use it to snare and beat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on SZ and think this is total BS.  <br />
<br />
#1: Ganking has nothing to do with PvP.  A 4 year old with half a brain could take any class with offensive capabilities, play for a little while, and learn how to gank unprepared people.  It's NOT a skill.  Repeat after me.  Ganking is NOT a skill.  The only skill that is involved is picking the target and knowing when you need to run away.<br />
<br />
#2: I have better gear than almost all bl00b shamans.  The fact that my guild can slice up those who get in our way helps me get gear as does the fact that there is a virtual smorgous board of high-end encounters for us to pick from since there is only one other guild on SZ that can kill things bigger than the vindicator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Mooshfu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Actually, I'd say the old BotBs were won by blue server players due to gear disparity.  <br />
<br />
Is this why I was wearing Totemic Legs? Rune Etch? While some other guy I beat had Kael Spirit Callers?<br />
<br />
I even made it to the 2nd round on the test, some used a tactic better than mine, not cause his gear was better.<br />
<br />
Boinshar has a good point with the survival thing, when I was watching Slithur fight, gr I forget his name was it like Swiftraven?<br />
Yah Swiftraven, Slithur obviously was out manouvered and his pet died in the first like 20 seconds while Swift still had his pet. Slithur liveded another like 15 minutes but Swift's pet was still alive so he eventually lost. I liked how Slithur ran out of range of the epic dot when it was almost finished, it was like he counted the seconds =p<br />
<br />
Uhm by the way there ARE counteract disease/poison potions, and it takes ONLY 2 casts of Counteract disease to cure them. Sorry I used Cure because he has less letters =\ I assumed you meant what I was saying heh. Cast time of 2 seconds is so hard to cast =p<br />
<br />
My shadowknight carries this around when I fight shamans sheesh, as I said before, channeling through someone hitting you will never be that easy, unless I pummeled through that 60 shaman with luck, which I did have some of.<br />

There was a huge discussion of tricks before the BoTB if you remember hehe, especially about the buff slots.<br />

<br />
Holy **** man I couldn't agree with you more, I love dueling and it'd make it so much easier. When I get rabid bear I can probably outjoust half the people in my guild.<br />
<br />
I read the EQ Gen Con EVent and this is EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEED TO DO.<br />
<br />
They deleveled everyone to 51, gave them the same gear. So then people can't whine about so and so who has better stuff than they.<br />
<br />
At the moment shamans can't necessarily kill each other. At BoTB, Cannibalize 4 WAS NOT OUT YET. Now we can heal ourselves and gain mana at the same time, because a shaman's dps will not beat torpor. However, I have NOT experienced rabid bear. Since shaman AC isn't that great I think we can interupt/ and possibly outdmg torpor. But 3 second torpors are an icky :confused: <br />

Will there ever be a pvp thread without trash talks between zek and non zek? <br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt it.<br />
<br />
This is partly why i love the Crucible though, even our 'trash talk' and 'flammes' are pretty good natured and never get out of line.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going back on topic, there is a HUGE spectrum of being lvl60 and lvl60. A lvl60 paladin can be an easy kill because he just dinged 60 and sat in velketors since lvl45. He has no resist gear and zip pvp experience. A lvl60 paladin can also have 200+ in pr/dr/mr, weild primal, have 3 backpacks of potions and golemwands, and so many aaxp points to make baby jesus cry.<br />
<br />
Like already said, shaman are decent in pvp thanks to our versatility. Combined with the totally (pvp)broken sowboots this makes us very durable. What is doesnt make us is killers. Anyone with half a brain can escape death from a shaman. Killing a shaman is a completely different deal.<br />
<br />
The only classes I consistently have problems with are the hybrids and well played enchanters. The latter being my most feared opponent.  Bards with decent resists and the lvl60 manadrain song, well what can i say, a chimpanzee could defeat a caster playing a bard.<br />
<br />
PvPing as a shaman, in my opinion, is like walking through a maze set with traps while being hunted by a rabid dog. You have to prod your way forward as slowly as you can but not so slow as to get caught with your beard in the mailbox, as we say in Sweden.</div></div><hr />

You need to SUCK really bad in order to lose to a 60 Shaman if you are a 'decent'.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'd classify the shadowknight serverwide BotB champion as a little better then 'decent', and i've killed him before.  The only class that i feel we don't have a chance against in duels (assuming a skilled player with decent gear) are rangers with discipline up.<br />

<br />
My 51 SK got a our server botb winner down to 35% then I went ld at 20%, came back and I assumed he HT'd me while linkdead, we agreed on no spells though since my Siphon Life won't compare.<br />
<br />
Ouch great job Gikk, he must feel a little embarrassed / crunchy =(<br />
<br />
Rangers are killable, as mentioned above I hid behind the wizard spires when he was shootin me =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Gikk, I would add bards to that list. Loosing 350mana every 13 secs to an opponent who can always catch up to you and cast while running is never a winning recipe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Well we only duel in the bazaar arena so that kind of limits his effectiveness, but i'm 3-1 against our resident pvp bard.  Don't manage quite as well against the afformentioned sk, only killed him once out of maybe 5 times.</div></div><hr />
