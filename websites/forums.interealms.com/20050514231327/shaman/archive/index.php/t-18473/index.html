yeah so shammy snare is really good? also who has the best root and snare in the game?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Our snare sucks due to it's non-existence.<br />
<br />
Our primary roll in groups is slower<br />
<br />
We have two ways of soloing. Root rotting and tanking IN TEH FACE. Usually we need to tank mobs that summon so we just slow it and keep ourselves healed using Torpor or Quiessence. (heal over time)<br />
<br />
As for rooting, our best root lasts up to 2 mins and we have an AA knockback root that can last up to 2 mins as well.</div></div><hr />

Shaman's main &quot;thing&quot; in the game is slow.<br />
<br />
Your post is very difficult to figure out what you are really asking.  If all you would like is to know what types of spells Shamans have, well they have just about everything except ports, feign death, and rez except they do not excel at any specific ability outside of slowing a mobs attack speed.  There is a (relatively) weak snare available to troll shamans via an item also.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't suggest a mage as they lack heals, buffs, root, and snare.  You do sound like you are confusing a shaman with a druid, or *possibly* a ranger.  I would suggest a druid for you if you are looking to make a new class.<br />
<br />
If you are playing a pet class such as a mage and let your pet do 100% of the damage you will not get full experience for the mob.</div></div><hr />

sorry for the sarcasm ;)<br />

Shamans have great mana regen via cannibalize lines of spells/ability, 3rd best healer, best slower, good roots, mediocre pets, great buffs, are great soloers and have strong group desireability, to name a few.</div></div><hr />

Shamans are hard do learn -- too many options.   Try a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ok, I'm going to try to be nice here.  First off, try using proper spelling, capitalization, and punctuation to more clearly communicate.  An occasional grammar or spelling gaffe is unavoidable, but your posts are full of those types of errrors and make them very tough to understand.<br />
<br />
Many people read posts like yours and just get tired of reading run-on sentences with no discernible breaks, so they don't bother replying.  If you can't bother to put a little effort into better phrasing and structuring your questions, don't expect a lot of people to go out of their way to help answer them.<br />
<br />
Your grammar is so poor that I first assumed English isn't your primary language, but I noticed your location is Texas.  So, I'm assuming you just have poor grammar.  If I'm mistaken and English isn't your primary language, please accept my apologies.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd say a necro would be a compelling option.  They are an excellent soloing class - probably the consensus choice for the most powerful soloer, actually.  They solo well indoors as well as outdoors.  They have excellent mana regeneration with their hp-to-mana spells, excellent damage output with their pets, DOTs, and lifetaps, and very nice utility via feign death, snare, etc.  They aren't terribly gear-dependent, so they're an inexpensive class to start with.  And their power in groups, especially in LDoN adventures, makes them valuable partners.  It sounds like a necro would be your best choice, based on the criteria you mentioned.<br />
<br />
Good luck, have fun, and work a litle harder on communicating more clearly.  Your group-members will appreciate it.<br />

Fargonstuff: please try a dictionary or spell checker to avoid the plethora of spelling errors you made (before your next amusing post).  I would &quot;sudgest&quot; you try a druid as they can probably do everything you want.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Due to the recent changes with pet rules as long as the pets owner does at least one point of damage to the mob (mele or spell damage) there is no experience loss, you get 100% experience for the kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">All pet classes take an xp hit - and that is part of the game that makes if fun for most.<br />
<br />
Don't look at it as you fighting a mob with your pet helping you. Rather, think of it as you fighting your pet for a share of the xp from the mob the pet is fighting. It's like a race - you and your pet are racing.<br />
<br />
To win the race you need to do more damage than your pet and you have to absolutely make sure the mob is always trying to get to you (refered to as aggro control). This means you have the xp edge and as long as you keep this xp edge you will get the xp.<br />
<br />
If your pet ever ... EVER ... takes aggro away from you then the pet will take most of the xp away. Mages are the best at beating their pets with clerics and wizards (in their 50's when they finally get their pets) next. For shaman it isn't that big a deal because after 55-58 if your pet ever steals aggro from you the mob usually kills it in 2 or 3 hits.<br />
<br />
Best advice I can give you, if you want to play a pet class, is to make a cleric. Their warrior pets can be pretty cool but you have to give them random drops and cash to keep them summoned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no one god class...although beastlords are damn close.  WOOT!<br />
<br />
It's a group-oriented game and classes are designed to work together for maximum effect.  No class is the best at everything or there would be no incentive to group up.<br />
<br />
Shaman is a great class in that we get a lot of different types of spells, which leads to a variety of potential tactics, roles, and options.  We can solo, sometimes very well, we are highly desired for groups, and we are equally effective indoors and out.  Pretty much all classes become powerful if you level them up nice and high, get some AAs, obtain good gear, and most importantly - play the class well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shaman do NOT get the snare spell.  Certain evil race shaman can get a quest item with the snare effect that many say gives mixed results (ie, some say it's less useful at higher levels).<br />
<br />
Shaman get root and many upgrades to root over time.  I don't think any particular class is better with root than other classes.  You might say that some players utilize root more effectively than others.<br />
<br />
Druids get both snare and root spells.  The phrasing of your original question could lead one to think that you are asking about druids, not shaman.</div></div><hr />

Shaman can cast root, no better than anyone else.  <br />

If you are looking for a class than can solo, snare, has a pet and is good indoors... play a necromancer.<br />

<br />
SO...shaman get ensnare at level 1 and can snare the best of all classes in the game, and shaman roots never break (ever).  Shaman can also kill mobs just by staring them down a few seconds, and if we want a certain item in the game we just type /summon time's antithesis (or whatever item you want) and it appears!  We try to keep this a secret amongst ourselves, but you seem worthy of the knowledge.</div></div><hr />

Shaman can not snare. Snare reduces how quickly a mob moves (Anti-SoW).<br />
<br />
We have slow, which increases the decreases the number of swings a mob makes over a given period of time.<br />
<br />
We can root, but I wouldn't say root varies enough between classes for it to be a major reason to not pick one. Our best root is an AA skill - Virulent Paralysis. It's disease resistable (as opposed to magic) and has a knockback effect on it. This makes it handy for &quot;parking&quot; a mob that's hitting you. As far as I know, no other class has a knockback effect on their root and they are all tied to magic resists. Druid root has a DD component tied to it. Other than that, root is pretty much root - the only difference between each variant is duration and possibly resists.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

Having never played a Necro, I couldn't comment on their mana efficiency. However, we both have ways of converting HP to mana and then regaining the HP back.<br />
<br />
Necromancers have Skeleton/Lich Form, which passively converts their HP to Mana. You only have to cast the spell once for it to work. They can regain HP by Lifetapping mobs. The downside is that the mana regen from their form does not stack with KEI.<br />
<br />
Shaman have Cannibalize, which converts a set amount of HP to Mana instantly (more or less). Until you get the Cannibalization AA, it's done in very small doeses, so you'll find yourself tapping your Cann key a lot to regain mana. There's even a little dance you do to make it work more efficiently which I absolutely do not feel like going over. Just do a forum search for Canni Dance. We can obviously regain our lost HP through Regen spells and heals. Our Heal over Time spells are extremely mana efficient. Also, because our HP/Mana conversion is not passive, it does stack with KEI.<br />

With a shaman's power slow spells, they can (at the high end) SLOW TIME itself, increasing the overall DPS of you and your group.<br />
<br />
There is a great thread by Bracy tucked away in the archives that you should refer to; it explains these details in a very approachable, easy-to-understand fashion.  Find that thread--I am sure it will answer all your questions.<br />
<br />
Also, since it appears that you are about to start a new shaman, remember that charisma has a large impact on the resistability of the SLOW TIME ability, so be sure to place a substantial number of your starting stat points into charisma.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dont ever let anyone tell you how you should play your shaman. The expected role for a shaman is to slow and to buff, these things are your NEEDED abilities by other people so you better damnw ell do them. However the rest is up to you. <br />
<br />
There is NO right or wrong way to play a shaman once you get the buffing and slowing thing out of the way. You like to nuke? Do it, dont listen to people whining about how crappy our DPS is, they either dont use their spells effectivly, or have wizzy envy. Like playing a more clerical role, then do it, shaman are well knwing for their high level healing ability, though we are a lil weak before 58. Wanna be a ghetto enchanter, then do it, whatever you can squeeze out of your toon that is either fun or helpful to everyone else, just do it. The true beauty of the shaman is its HUGE ability list and its a shame that so many shaman are so one dimensional and forget this. I think Verants description of us in 1 incarnation was &quot;swiss army knife&quot;. Pretty good name for us IMHO.<br />
