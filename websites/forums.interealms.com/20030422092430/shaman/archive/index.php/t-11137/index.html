<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chikkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all.... had a little problem.. handed the gem i got from wandering spirit into the spirit in EJ...and as i went through each phrase i had to say, after the second one i accidentaly hit attack with him targetted.. he died.... he respawned like 5 min after that but didnt respond to anything i said.. so i went to MM to kill black dire.. killed him and got pelt.. I'm wondering if i could turn the pelt into the spirit in WL if I killed him after giving him gem... any help would be MUCH appreciated.. Don;t really like the idea of startin back from the beginning...<br />

If you didn't see a Truespirit faction hit when you killed him you should still be fine.<br />
<br />
If you are worried just redo the Shield of Falsehood turn-ins a few more times to improve your faction.  It doesn't take long and it can't hurt but I doubt it's necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chikkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thx Catty.. I guess I'll go log on now and try it.. Can;t hurt i suppose.. wasn't faction hit for killin him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chikkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ok.. just went and turned pelt in.. CONG.. works... you CAN kill the sentinel spirit and be ok (no faction hit) if you turned the gem in first..FYI to all the shammies that accidentaly kill he<br />

<br />
Accidentally hitting something once doesn't mean you have to finish killing it.<br />
<br />
P.S. Lay off the excessive dot use, it's annoying to read.</div></div><hr />
