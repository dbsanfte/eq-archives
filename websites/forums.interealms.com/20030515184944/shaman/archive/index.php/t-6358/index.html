<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm really not trying to be a braggart at all, but the weapon I use, listed below in my magelo, seems to be exceptionally rare.  The Ensorcelled Spear, off of the Netherbain Swarmlord in UP.  I mean, I know that UP has some pretty popular spots for raids, and to get to one of the two spirits (can't remeber which), I am pretty sure you have to go by the mini-ring of fire room where the swarmlord eventually spawns (ring took about 26 min total I think).  <br />
<br />
I just find it odd that I have NEVER seen anyone else on my server with this spear, nor have I seen it in any Magelo.  As far as I can tell, the spear is about as close to our epic as one can get without having a proc (and sans dis and poi rsts).  So, does the Neb Lord never get raided, is the spear a rare drop, does everyone find it trivial because they already have their epics if they're at the level to kill this mob, or is it just a bit too ghetto looking (it is.)?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Holdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah this is a great weapon, I felt bad when I bagged it for my epic.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Can't see the stats.. Suddenly, this week, the Magelo started to show gibberish to me. Always worked well, and neither have I made any changes in my PC settings.. But Magelo is now just a cumbayaa of gibberish... Weird.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dafyd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same here, magelo = gobbledigook</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xelnag Ashenpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's rare because you really don't need to bother with the ring to pull Tawro. In addition to that the Swarmload is immune to changes in attack speed, making him much more of a pain to kill than the spirits, and his loot does leave a bit to be desired(the spear being one of the exceptions).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You dont see it because it sucks.. Of course thats just my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First time i've seen it. Nice spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Very nice.<br />
<br />
Yeah Magelo's been funky for sime time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We got the enscorcled spear a long time ago on the way to Tawro by spawning the swarmlord.  It is listed for rogue (/boggle) and shaman.  I had my epic at the time, but none of the rogues wanted it so I looted it.  I think I actually saw it drop twice, because we've done the swarmlord a couple of times.  Equipped it looks like the n00b spears from Luclin or CT.  I think we had 2 groups of nearly all level 60 players when we spawned him.  The spear is no drop.<br />
<br />
The spear is nice if you don't have an epic, probably the best spear at that level.  I think he could probably be done by 3 solid mid to upper 50's group.  Would be a nice raid to do him, Tawro, and Radir for a 50's level guild.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the spear doesn't qualify for my spear collection.  For some unknown reason rogues were listed as able to use this spear.  My spear collection is of shaman only spears.  The only one I lack is Garduk from Sky, and its not likely I'll ever see that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hiho,<br />
<br />
I for one have done the swarmlord thingie a few times with my guild (before we knew how to pass it), and he always dropped a mediocre blade.<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=10292<br />
<br />
The spawning is too slow so we moved on after killing the swarmcaller and just killed Tawro.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless it's a fine spear, congrats that you got it.<br />
<br />
So long<br />

You dont see it because it sucks.. Of course thats just my opinion. <br />
<br />
Mind qualifying that opinion? That spear is far from suck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tgout</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I prefer to use my epic for holding and proc reasons and when I do melee I swap out for this little gem, sure the stats aint as good but the dmg/delay is far better and the 81 point proc makes for a very good melee weapon.<br />
<br />
Rune Etched Icewurm fang (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=3969)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">im failing to see why this spear is so great. i agree it doesnt  &quot;suck&quot; well the damage output is kinda weak , but the stats are nice<br />
<br />
if it was range usable it would be sweet for that , but bag my epic or even my rune etched ice wurm fang ? I guess if i melee'd less maybe <br />
<br />
/shrugs<br />
<br />
<br />
enlighten please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KrintixXaneris</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Btw, it does have +3 magic damage if you're really worried about melee'ability, but, uh, i think 15wis 50hps 100mana are enough reasons to use this over Iceworm fang.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">right on , didnt see the +3 magic damage cause i am worried about melee , i do quite alot of melee:). <br />
<br />
<br />
looking a lil nicer now, i would still use my REIF though , but not bad at all ;)<br />
<br />
i need to get a massige 2hb though , i was playing wiht my old ice grinder and it made me realize how much i miss those big numbers  ;)<br />
<br />
Only switched to pierce to get skill up for epic</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tristarss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The weapon has a 9.5 damage per second, its just not that great. If it had a useful proc..... but it doesnt.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">About 6 months ago, my guild were killing UP spirits almost every day.  We had one of these drop on the way to Tawro once, which ended up rotting as all shamans had epic.  <br />
<br />
Seemed a real shame to me, so I parked my shaman in UP for a while, in the hope that another might drop that I could loot, but unfortunately it never did.  We did kill him another once or twice, I remember some mediocre sword with +5 poison dmg on it.<br />
<br />
It does seem to be about the best 1hander pre-epic as far as stats go, really nice item.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have my epic, but prefer this:<br />
<br />

and just swap out for my epic on the dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In part you don't see this because no one does the Swarmlord.  Its a pain, needs way more people than the spirits do, and takes too long.  In part you don't see this because it is his rare drop - his common are a pair of 1hs with +pois and +dis damage, respectively, that we've given away to second-string meleers like rangers who forgot that weapons are something they need to upgrade between 40 and 57. =P<br />
<br />
Half a dozen kills - no spear.  Not caring much, i'm epicced.  But I think there are some non-epic Shaman (why so dead to day guilds, Fear Golems?) in the guild still who'd like it.<br />
<br />
For my part, I just wish we were on the DA/DM armor class list, so we could get *something* out of UP other than some of the Rumblecrush drops (go shield!) and maybe the bracers.<br />

<br />
No ... when I saw the first piece of Shojen armor, and saw that Iksar are not on the race list for it ... the last of my doubts that Iksar was the right choice to play faded.  Any race unable (or unwilling, perhaps) to wear that crap is clearly the superior choice.<br />
