It seems so cheesey to just log in and find the widget_01 that has been in your bank vault for the last 10 levels now has casting l33tness III on it.<br />
<br />
It certianly makes no sense from a roleplaying aspect (I'm sure not many care about that)  Still, I have to wonder where did these changes to my equipment comes from?  A gift of the gods or what?<br />
<br />
I always liked the idea of upgradable equipment.  Back when totemic armor first came out I always felt it was a great quest from that stand point.  We were taking that old banded armor of ours and tuning it up a bit at a small cost to us (minus camping parts which mostly sucked)  this served 2 purposes - it aleviated the trickle down of banded this revitalizing low-level smithing to a degree, while at the same time sucking plat from the enconomy.   Heh, I know I was broke at level 19 after doing 2 totemic bracers.<br />
<br />
Along those lines I think a cool idea would have been to implement these as quests.   Not typical VI farm fests, but more like the totmeic quest, i.e. go to the a quest npc in some random zone give him (for sake of example) 2 chipped bone bracers, a buyable gem and some random research words and you get back a new &quot;improved&quot; chipped bone bracer with an effect on it.  The effect would be pre-determinded the same as it is now.  <br />
<br />
For Level 3 items its would be a little too costly to implement it in this way, but you could still do it slightly differently by just requiring 1 of the item instead of 2, but raising the plat cost much higher.<br />
<br />
At least  this way they'd be adding new abilites but not giving them away completely free, and at the same time draining some of the lower end items and a bit of platinum from the economy.</div></div><hr />
