I have heard that the golems in Skyshrine drop velium, and I was wondering how good the drop rate is.  I am currently ally with CoV and Yelniak, and although the factions are not too extreme to level back up, my question is- is it worth it to farm velium there?  Any information you have would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

I dont think you need to lose faction just to farm that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am not sure that &quot;plenty&quot; is quite the right word. You can kill CC Orcs non-stop, but only Miners drop Velium and it's somewhat sporadic. Velks is a bit more fun since the spiders are light blue (mostly single pullable at 58+) and occasional named mobs drop mid-level items to sell, but it will take a while to farm Velium there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>brokenlimit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">i did enchanted velium bits to 220 for the signet quest, essentially what i did was, farm 5th floor of ToFS till i was almost full up on velium (4-5 bags full), then run to CC, da drop and use the forge in the dorf town to break down, then clear back up and sometimes hang around CC Killing miners if the zone wasn't too full.  <br />
<br />
i've done velium farms in tofs, cc, skyshrine, and velks, and from what i can tell i would rank them as:<br />
<br />
1.  tofs (5th floor golems, about 10-12 on floor, decent spawn time)<br />
2.  cc (miners, not bad but always camped and lots of running around)<br />
3.  skyshrine (better, and empty, but mobs take longer to kill than 1/2)<br />
4.  velks (same as skyshrine, except less golems, more people, and longer kills)<br />
<br />
essentially what i did was pull all 12 golems in tofs, kill them all (using 43pt self ds) and nukes/dots etc., then afk'd till the next spawn.  when i got very bored of tofs i headed to CC, but never could stand that long as always lots of people there + it's a ton of running around.  in terms of being lazy about it, i think ToFS is the way to go, and you can have a friend port u up to 7th floor to get master key very easily as well.  for farm situations i prefer mobs with low hp just for ease, especially when farming with a caster.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zuksharn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Crystal Caverns is perfect for velium farming.  On average, you'll get a brick, block, or small piece off of every 3rd or 4th miner.  Plus, killing the orcs now gives Coldstone dwarf faction.  In the dorf city down there, there is a banker and two forges.  You can just fill up on bricks, run back to dorf central, break em down into pieces, throw the pieces into the bank and run back out to get more without ever leaving the zone.  To top it off, the orcs can drop some decent cash and cash loot.<br />
<br />
I, myself, usually get about 4-6 stacks of velium pieces in about an hour of casual pet grinding there.  But like people have mentioned earlier, the real downside of CC is that it tends to get crowded during prime hours and weekends... it's pretty easy for a mage or necro (even us with our dogdog) to wipe the place out in a sitting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>astop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yep I remember grouping on my SK and it was a common drop in velks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Velks is pretty good for velium. The crystalline spiders dropped a good amount of it while I was farming threads for the Coldain shawl. I have two-and-a-half bags full of blocks of velium, and another bag full of small bricks and pieces of it. The zone is trivial, really, and you can get SCHW, chitin wristbands and shields to sell and make a good amount of plat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dogpoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">bring a lower lvl friend to powerlevel and the farming is much easier on the sanity hehe.<br />
      sometimes they have better dps and can even speed things up 8D</div></div><hr />

Any information you have would be much appreciated.<br />
<br />
As far as is it worth it to you to farm there - for the fastest farming with a forge in zone - it cannot be beat. I have tried all tofs, velks, CC and SS and most of what you have heard here I have found to be true.<br />
<br />
tofs: quiet and mostly peaceful camp allowing afks between spawns. However - no forge and takes a long time for spawns if you don;t have something to do during the lulls between spawns.<br />
<br />
velks: pretty slow in my experience for farming but might be nice if you are two boxing and PLing an alt. <br />
<br />
CC: if you play LATE at night when less people are there its not so bad - there is a forge in zone but you have to be an active farmer (IE running around searching for spawns). Notice I said less people - not none. This is one of the few older zones that seems to almost never be empty. <br />
<br />
SS: The only bad thing here is the faction. There are more spawns than I could kill before repops (that drop velium), theres and easy to hit forge you can incorporate on your farming loop, and often your the only one killing here. If the faction is nothing to you (IE your in a guild way past velious content or you just don care) than by all means this is a great spot. If faction is more important than sheer farming speed/volume then I would recomend CC or tofs. Velks IMO is only worth doing if you have a twink in tow for xp or something.</div></div><hr />

CC is much easier. The problem with TFoS is that you have to go through the time sink of gathering keys for each floor if you don't have them already. CC it is zone in and the miners start right there.</div></div><hr />
