<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Doesn't anyone roleplay anymore? It seems like to most EQ is all about being uber. Just scroll through the thread titles and you will see that the majority deal with min/max technical aspects of the game. Or they are posts about uber loot or being the first guild to complete PoP. It's all very depressing for someone coming from a strong roleplaying background.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">EQ has a rich story to it... more than people know.  I think the roleplayers have long ago given up on eq and just moved into the farming of better equip and xp mode.  Which is sad as the usual response from this crowd is that EQ is one dimensional with no story... when in fact if you spend some time doing quests and actually reading up on the dialog and such there are some wonderful stories and history present in Norrath.</div></div><hr />

I agree, especially in the later  expansions, the storyline is great, but, given the engine, knowing the story doesnt help very much. Some of the background stories behind the quests are also realy intreiguing, but the quests themselves are a pita.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">On FV server...which I play on...there are still quite a few RPers, but its just becoming like any average  blue server with all the idiots</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zamnon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not that EQ is any less geared towards roleplaying now, just that the majority of players are after a quick trip to the top and only the best loot will do. Human nature I guess.  These types typically use their characters essentially as their alter ego to RL.  That's fine with me, it's still extremely easy to go off by myself and do some exploring and roleplaying.  It's the idiots that have completely turned me off to the game and tend to ruin my EQ experience.  Example:  zone into PoD to find a group, several idiots shouting out how they would like someone to camp their buttholes.  There are 50 peeps in the zone, no one says a thing as these idiots continue their lewdness, I shout out I'm gonna petition the fools, think that stops em?? Nope.  So I leave to everfrost thinking a trip down memory lane would be fun, well some idiot is there as well shouting out how he has a boner as big as texas, and if there are any girls in the zone.  Once again, i'm the only one that cared enough to shout down the fool.  Many do not respect the roleplaying environment, and GM's are not enforcing policy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While there are many opportunities for roleplaying in EverQuest, they are rarely realized.  At no time has the focus of EverQuest ever been strongly directed toward roleplaying; it is instead directed toward character development and advancement.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but if you are looking for a &quot;roleplaying experience&quot; you will likely have to look elsewhere.<br />
<br />
That being said, there ARE some things you can do to eliminate some unwanted noise.<br />
<br />
1) turn off shout -- you don't need it.<br />
<br />
2) turn off ooc -- you don't need it.<br />
<br />
3) turn off auction -- you REALLY don't need it.<br />
<br />
4) /ignore Nizerx (if you happen to be on The Rathe).<br />
<br />
Those 4 things will eliminate everything except buff-beggars.  For those, uh...  roleplay with them.  :)  &quot;Aye, child, I would be happy to grant you increased strength in battle, but first you must prove your worth to me by obtaining fo me the meat from a mammoth.  I am too old to hunt.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Roleplaying requires concentration, creativity and energy.  Most find it like throwing money into a firepit, lots of flash with no reward.  The only roleplaying I run into nowadays is completely humor-oriented.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Uggums</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Peepul iz alwayz sayin dat Uggums iz a roll-playur.  Mee iz stil waitin fer da roll, tho...<br />

((I almost quit EQ about 6 months ago.  While I would not have described myself as a &quot;powergamer&quot;, I was definitely caught up in the xp-grinding and loot gathering aspects of the game.  Eventually I just found that it all got boring.  I took a couple months off, and (as everyone always does...) eventually decided to give it another go.  In order to make sure that the boredom wouldn't catch up with me again, I figured I would try my hand at role-playing, since the fun and adventure of the game were what drew me to EQ in the first place.<br />
<br />
Best decision I could have made!  Uggums is a blast!  ('course, choosing to play a shaman also helped)  Admittedly, the &quot;Hukked On Ogur werked fer mee&quot; typing can slow things down from time to time, but the general response from the people I play with has been very positive.  I think my role playing makes the game more fun for everyone I play with, and would highly recommend trying it if you are starting to find the game is getting a little dull (as long as you don't use it to justify being a jerk...).<br />
<br />
Just pick a race/class that you enjoy playing, and make up some back-story.  Sometimes, staying in-character is hard, but it's well worth the effort IMHO. ))<br />

There's always a few role play guilds out there. Being in a role play guild is a ton of fun, we carry out stories on the boards which effect guild chat and since we group together often, makes for diversions between pulls. I have fun with my macro's and have an excuse for causing trouble - being a mischevious kitten and all. Nothing is funnier then grouping with a kitten and an ogre discussing how they are going to prepare and eat today's catch /grin. Last night it was frost giant toes stuck to the end of my epic spear... popsicles! So yea, we raid and we exp grind and we camp lewtz AND we have a RP blast doing it. Even when I go /lfg - I enjoy RPing with the folks I meet. You won't believe how many folks out there love to RP when they have someone to play with. Sooo... stand next to the cleric next time you scratch your rear and pass gass... Share a fish wine with your new melee friends... burn yourself on the chanter in fire elemental form... Make war cry macros and use them... and YES read the quest storylines, go through the phrases and replies, have you even hailed a few folks in Katta and Seru? Wow what a storyline!<br />
<br />
As for the jerks in /ooc. Pretend they're speaking erudite... They only act up for attention and when ignored tend to shut up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I went straight from a MUD where I was a fairly hardcore roleplayer, to everquest.  When I first started meeting other people, I was appaled at the way people openly talked out of character in places besides the /ooc channel.  After a few sessions, though, I realized that EQ is not a roleplaying game.  It has a nice story and environment that makes you feel like you are playing a fantasy game rather than a job, but few people actually try to play a character besides themselves.  It is very hard to roleplay when no one around you is roleplaying, which is why there are very few roleplayers left in EQ.</div></div><hr />

(or closer!).<br />
<br />
Only real attempt at roleplaying I glimpse now and again is when a newbie Ogre starts to say sh1t like &quot;UG, Me Bashem Gud! Har Har&quot;.<br />
<br />
That's kind of heartwarming. Somedays!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>jathu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">it's hard to role play in a game full of people cussing in /ooc every 5 minutes and talking about each others moms.  i hear enough of that at school and was hoping to escape that in eq. unfortunatly, i usually can't. nobody rp's on my server.</div></div><hr />

Why so vehement about RP'ers?  It's not like they're FROGS or something  ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The story is cool and all, but I play for the teamwork, for the raiding, and no, I don't spam /ooc with stupid stuff like what you guys are speaking of.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">You wont ever find much roleplaying in a graphic-based game like EverQuest. Most people see it as just a video game, not roleplaying. And, besides that, most people are too unimaginative and undisciplined to even try. <br />
<br />
Maybe SWG will be good enough that it'll kill Everquest's popularity..then all the d00ds can go play there and they wont even really be out of character regardless of how they act.<br />
<br />
Roleplayers should be beaten to within an inch of their lives!!<br />

I agree. Let's start with you.</div></div><hr />
