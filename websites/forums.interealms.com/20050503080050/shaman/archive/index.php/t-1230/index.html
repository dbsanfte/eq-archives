<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a group last night with 2 warriors and 1 rogue and I managed to get aggro'd a lot with Togors.  They we in the upper 40's and low 50's in level, while I'm 45th.  It seems this is still broken.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>whinar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was in Chardok last night with a 60 monk and a 57 warrior and I was wondering the same thing...<br />
<br />
I'm going to test this more tonight.  The monk was dumping his agro when he got back to the party and then re-engaging.  I suspect this was removing enough agro from the mob that I was 'bubbling' back up to the top.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwaeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems to be working just fine for me, other than an occasional mob here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hilladara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We did HoT this past weekend. I noticed no change for the better on slowing.  If anything it was a little worse.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nope, aggro is ALOT better for me.  I had a routine where I knew when to sit my shaman down after the slow, and i'm back to it now.  They definitely fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gert Groinwounder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Slow agro seems to be fixed to me if the slow actually sticks.  I'm still getting the crap pounded out of me on resists...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did HoT twice during the time where the aggro was out of whack, I died alot.  We went back on Sunday and the aggro was amazingly better.  The difference was incredibly noticeable, and I have no doubt that aggro has been fixed, or at least partially fixed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have a decently equip'd shadowknight in your raiding party?  If so, have them taunt.  It is more economical to heal the shadowknight than to heal/rez the debuffers all the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When the slow lands it appears fixed. When it is resisted it seems worse :( <br />
<br />
However, for lower level characters the &quot;fix&quot; seems to be working quite well. My boyfriends twink Enchanter was having a field day slowing mobs for us this past weeked. He could tash and mez with no agro as long as he slowed last. He thought it was funny so he decided to try slowing an add before mezzing, it didn't even look at him (and I wasn't taunting it either). That's a huge change from what it used to be like (pre-broken slow even).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see no dramatic change - the tanks I fight with stand right by me so they don't have to chase the mob all about after I cast slow - I am a mob magnet.   Hunting in CT the other nite OUCHE - those mosquitoes pack a whallup!!  Definetely need cleric who is on the ball and has plenty of mana.<br />

Aggro in CT doesn't count because it is currently screwed up. Go ANYWHERE but CT if you want to see a difference.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only time that the slow agro DOESN'T work is when you don't land the damn thing.  Then you get the extra agro from disease as well as slow.  Its fun to try to get a mob offa then :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I was in NTOV and Maidens slowing and have definitely noticed an improvement when slow lands.   If it doesn't land It appears to be the same huge agro it was prior to the patch.<br />
  We all know the agro we generate by a resisted DOT spell....  how does Verant compute that?   By how many potential disease or poison counters that would have landed?  <br />
  Just for grins suppose they did something like this:  16 disease counters (but resisted) = 10 real disease counter equivalent agro generated.  This might be similar to how they decide how much agro one of our DOT's will generate.  It would also account for why we feel the resisted agro is still not fixed.<br />
<br />
  What really concerns me about this is that Verant would be so confused about how their own product works to miss the resisted agro counters (or whatever it is for resists).  I can see we have a lot to look forward to on caster balancing.........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Szago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Aggro aside...has noone else noticed a huge increase in resists vs sticking a slow?  I was in Hate this past weekend for a leisurely grind and was having a great deal of difficulty slowing ANYTHING up there....I could just about plan on at least 1 resist per pull.<br />
<br />
Also, we were in NToV after the last patch....and none of our shaman (all lvl 60) could slow Ary....had to get an enchanter to do it!<br />
<br />
If anyone's noticed this please share....if not....just tell me &quot;Szago...trust Verant, they know what they are doing!&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks folks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>sinladar orchammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Slow is and isn't fixed.  After a weekend in HoT, I learned that the resisted slows draw way too much agro still.  Successful slows were getting me summoned even if the mob was down 20% health. <br />
<br />
Had to change my hot key to /1 Save the Shaman....so and so is now slowed.  I had a cleric to myself for the raid.<br />
<br />
Good news is that Insidious Decay and Plague of Insects works wonders on HoT mobs.  I was usually able to stick ID with no problems and usually 1 or 2 resists on Plague.  This was with and with out Tash and Malosini (our 60 shaman didn't make it till sunday and even with landing malo - Plague was still a better choice).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gorslam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I slowed statue last night within 10 seconds of him being pulled (only debuff on was malo - /flex level 54). He didn't aggro me, and I thought it was weird, I was just trying to suicide slow for the heck of it. So I chain casted turgur's another 15 times or so, and went oom, kept caniing up to turgur mana and casting it thoughout the whole fight (everything after original slow was resisted), and he never aggrod me, so it seems to work fine, even with resists. Not like any of us actually know how resist aggro works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Was in HoT just last night. One resist slow + one successful slow still insure you a warm and fuzzy spot at the top of the hate list for most of its remaining (and brief) existence. But a simple unresisted slow? Nah... just a quick summon from the sheer outrage then the tanks had it taunted off me in no time.<br />
<br />
MUCH better than it was the last couples of week where I otfen ended up tanking the MOB for most of the fight.</div></div><hr />
