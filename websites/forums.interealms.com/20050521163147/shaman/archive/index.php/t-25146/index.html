<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>XeroOmega</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, the OoW manual (PDF file, downloadable from SoE website for free) has a list of AA/Tradeskill titles that are currently available, there are more to get from completing Epic quests, like Heyokah for 1.0, and Fateseer for 1.5/2.0.<br />
<br />
the tradeskill titles are pretty simplistic, no title for skill under 100, Apprentice for skill 100-199, Journeyman from 200-249, and expert for 250.<br />
<br />
AAs follow the same rules as before (@ 6 AA, 18 AA, &amp; 24 AA), though instead of Baron/Venerable/Elder, you get a choice of 4 different titles per AA &quot;goal&quot;, and you keep titles you've earned, meaning that you can be &quot;Baron&quot; if you have 900 AA's and switch to whichever you want at whim.<br />
<br />
and thats the gist of it as I understand it.</div></div><hr />

Um, I've been meaning to add the newer titles, as well as the /who titles up to 70. Consider me prodded. Also, Oddloots (Lgurin) had a better list on page two of that thread, here (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showpost.php?postid=290065&amp;postcount=52).<br />
<br />
EDIT: added that info to my page; still need info on other classes' level 70 and epic  titles.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Title list at http://samanna.net/general/info.shtml nearly complete; just missing a few 1.5 titles, I do believe.</div></div><hr />
