<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play Everquest like I play Quake.  I use WASD and I am constantly moving around.  I target nearly every npc I find and con it immedialtly.   I never sit still for more than 3 seconds, and I am always trying to get a better view see what is ahead, re position myself, etc.  My guild says I move around more than a Mexican jumping bean.<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ like that for five years.  Its no longer a concious activity for me, it's strait up muscle memory.<br />
<br />
One very negative side effect of this is that I am always looting corpses on accident.  It's just something I have had to deal with over the years.  The problem is since the directX 9 patch it has been out of hand.  <br />
<br />
Today I had wipe after wipe after wipe in vexed because we were bringing along some inexperienced people and trying to get them flagged.  There were several times when I could have saved the enchanter with a quick heal, and possibly avoided a wipe.  As you can imagine it was so completly frustrating to have a heal not go off because the millisecond before I hit my heal key I loot a corpse and loose my target.  The third time it happend I wanted to throw my keyboard out the window.<br />
<br />
I don't ever want to loot another npc again unless I target the corpse and type /loot 5 times.<br />
<br />
Please give us a command to make this possible.<br />
<br />
How many times did someone get mad at you because you accidentailly considered them before we had /consider off.  Same thing here.<br />
<br />
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Secondly, I don't ever want to duck again unless I hit the duck button.  If I try to move my character to a space that requires ducking DONT LET ME GO THERE.  The new autoduck feature that came with dx9 = bad.  Its not easy to tell if I am ducked or not, simply by looking at my screen.  On top of that I duck all the time anyways to cancle spells.  The duck/unduck loops I get myself in are comical.  Its similar to when to people are walking strait at each other and they both move to the same direction to avoid, and then they both move the opposite direction.  Its just funny, and super annoying.<br />
<br />

Does anyone else have this problem, and does anyone have a suggestion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yeah.. when im grouping.. i loose train of thought and just run and hop everywhere. Atleast u remember to loot LOL when im looter i always forget cuz ive done it like twice but my suggestion to u would be.. uh.. watch tv  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Odd.  To loot a corpse not only do I have to target it, I have to right click it as well.  And I play an Enchanter quite a bit in places like Guk LDON where targetting can be a nightmare.<br />
<br />
While it may be impossible to &quot;teach an old dog new tricks&quot; you can always assign keys to group members or use your mouse to click on their name in your group box and not the individual themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Try not clicking and then right-clicking on corpses.  Muscle memory or not, figure it out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Really, you'll need to develop some discipline with your clicking in these types of situations. The other thing you can do is /feedback on the feature selection you're looking for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Secondly, I don't ever want to duck again unless I hit the duck button.<br />
alt-o and turn it off.  First thing I did when I logged in after watching the BEAUTIFUL sunrise in PoK the day they patched all that stuff live.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>stanislao</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Until they fix it ....(!)...   set a macro for 'last target' , close the corpse and use it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never had that problem and I rely on f# keys generally to target my group members.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Faern:  can you double check that for me.  I just logged in and kill a rat in freeport.  I was able to loot it by right clicing anywhere within a centimeter of the body.  I checked to see if I had to target it first, and I did not.<br />
<br />
If you aren't able to do that, then either one of has a bug, or there is already an option to do what I want.  <br />
<br />
UgZug:  You do not have to click and then right click to loot something.  At least I don't.   This is the exact same problem when people used to complain about accidentially inspecting someone.  Because of that, they implemented the /inspect off command.  All I want is a /quickloot off command.<br />
<br />
You are right though,  If i had to click and then right click, it would be easy to get around and just deal with it.  Thats not the case. <br />
<br />
Tigrain: thanks for pointing that out.  I had to switch to the default UI to find that option but there it was.  You have made my eq experience 50% less annoying, enjoy the rep points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope  to loot a corpse you dont have to target it just right click on it.<br />
<br />
Although what the original poster is doing right clicking to target a group member i can not figure out.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I use a mix of targeting group memebers with Fkeys and targeting with the mouse, basically whatever my hands are closest to at the time.  Often its faster to click with the mouse and cast with my left hand then move my left hand and target, then move my left hand back cast.</div></div><hr />

He's doing the same as me, using mouse to change direction. I was going nuts and apologising all the time about inspecting people till i turned /inspect off (or whatever the command is)<br />

<br />
Pretty fast!<br />
<br />
But only half as fast as I can do it with with 2 hands.<br />
<br />
type &quot;cat&quot; 100 times in a row and then then type &quot;dog&quot; 100 times in a row, which do you type more accuratly, and which can you type faster?  <br />
<br />
But thats not really the point.  The problem is moving my field of vision around requires the mouse.  And that requires I hit the right mouse key, and looting is to sensitive to right mouse clicks.  In the exact same way that inspecting is to sensitive to right mouse clicks.  They fixed one problem, they should fix the other.</div></div><hr />

You are correct sir !  This is gonna save me time looting those damned  Moss Covered Trinkets</div></div><hr />

<br />
D. has it right.  Sometimes the hardest part to fixing something is identifying the right problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS - I have no problems targetting grp members, but this ^^^^ problem is a PITA when trying to tag various mobs in camp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right-click is used to mouse-look. Letting go of the right mouse button while your invisible mouse-look cursor happens to be positioned anywhere over or above a corpse will loot the corpse whether you wanted to or not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is a huge anoyance to me as well. I bet most people that dont understand still play in first person /cringe. im always in third pretty much unless im swimming and i too am always in a constant state of strafe so i feel your pain.</div></div><hr />

Absoultely.  Since I've made one, I no longer get yelled at =)  I too am always moving around.  It prevents me from falling asleep.</div></div><hr />
