<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>coryn braun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to get some input from how some of the other shammies felt about price gouging in the bazaar.  Not quite sure if it's affecting all servers, but I'm pretty sure it has.  Shamans are continually dropping the prices of all of our potions to outrageously low ones in an attempt to beat the other guy to the sale.  I can't say I didn't see it coming, but at the same time, it's a little disappointing.  <br />
   As a whole, I've felt that alchemy is one of the most unappreciated and undervalued (not to mention unprofitable) skills around - while tailors, smiths, jewelcrafters, and even tinkers are making thousands of plat (sometimes in the range of 10k-25k or more) for their products, we make little to nothing.  Some potions cost exorbitant prices just to make, and to be reasonable to other players the cost we sell them at nets little profit.  When the bazaar first came out, I was determined to stick to my guns and to continue selling potions at the prices they always sold at;  when I got next to no business, I was forced to drop my prices to match those of everyone else.  Why bother making shrink potions for 150pp to net a measly 30p profit?  There's even gate potions being sold for 190pp - that's 3pp in the pocket!  It's absolutely insane.  In my opinion, thanks to those shaman, alchemy has been made next to useless.  Potions can be made for friends and guildies for utilitarian purposes and when needed on raids, but certainly not used to make a profit. =/<br />
<br />
How does everyone else feel about all this?<br />
<br />
Hopefully we'll see some improvements on alchemy like we've asked for, with the upcoming balancing.  I only get requests for 5 or 6 potions on a regular basis, the others are negligible.  No one will even touch the Luclin potions with a 10 foot stick... I won't even bother trying to make them, considering the prices they would have to be sold at to make any decent returns.  The +10 save potion would be decent if it was knocked up to say, +20, +25.  10 is a drop in the bucket. =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>camibella</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I agree with you. Its killing me. I am lvl 36 and bustin my hump to get my alch skill up but cant afford to at the prices things are going for in the bazaar.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tienen Crazywolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just leave my potions same price as usual, for example, I see 75pp 10 charge sows for sale, while I leave mine at the 100p ive been charging for the longest time. I go to sleep for a bit , wake up and they all sold . Just takes a little bit longer to get the price you want, but 99.9% of the time you can get away with usual price if you wait long enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When the lowballers sell out, people will come to you.  Patience is all that's required. :)  If someone really wants to sell their sow potions for 75pp, that's fine, I continue on my way at my prices.  They're making themselves work twice as hard as you are for their money.  The last laugh is yours.  Make it a long and hearty one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Brat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sold a 5 dose gate for 1300pp last night while I slept, have sold a couple of sows for 100pp and 10 dose of ITU for 200pp  /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Clawsor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I agree with you How it can taake hundreds of pp to make a potion and u get that much it takes like 10pp for some armor and they get undreds, anyway ive been okay so far wit hselling Shrink potions for 200p an Ogre Friend of mine bought em for fulll price cause he saw me sit there and buy the stuff and fail half the time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I've sold some ITU's at 200, Shrink at 175, Sows at 95.<br />
<br />
But I don't vendor when I'm offline. It's just not profitable, it's just not worth keeping my computer on and running up the electricity bill for the possible 50 plat profit.<br />
<br />
I don't stock ITU's or shrink anymore - those were just made during a skillup session.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm a fan of overnight vendoring, though I tend to match the average price on sale items.  90p per 10-dose Wolf's Blood is fine by me.  Little effort, 30-35p profit.  Tolerable.  Matching prices is sometimes needed when there are 5 or 6 potion vendors all selling them at 90p.  I used to keep mine at 100p, but never sold a one.<br />
<br />
And when I see somebody selling them at 75p, I generally buy a few myself and add them to my mule's inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shokar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">But this seems to be just as good.<br />
<br />
I worked up a spread sheet that offers various profit margins on Potions.  Now, in REAL LIFE pricing, what is marked up, say 40% for lower priced items may only fetch a 20% mark-up on the higher priced items.  Some stores may sell everything at a straight mark-up...or may adjust profits as needed.<br />
<br />
With that in mind,  my spreadsheet reflects various profit margins.<br />
What I did was take the average cost of materials, and multiplied by ten.  Then, I needed to take into account failures.  As everyone knows, the higher you go, the less failures you get.  BUT...how to make a formula for that?  Well, I figured that with a base failure rate of THREE...this would cover current failures, and past failures.  In the Drug Industry, when you pay $100.00 for a bottle of pills - you are not only paying MATERIAL costs, you are paying for research.<br />
<br />
I can make 40 sow potions usually in 42 tries.  BUT, there was a day that I would have 5-10 failures in 20 tries.  SO, with the base failure rate of THREE, I am taking into account materials and research.<br />
<br />
Now, if I have not lost you - here is the link to my pricing sheet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kytra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I see people selling sow for 75pp all the time. I sell mine for 90pp and and go to sleep. All 30 are gone by morning. The 75pp sows sell fast, so there's always someone looking to buy. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zionak Maliseer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree, it makes me sick to see SoW pots for anything under 75pp,  On VZ,  Potion prices are WAY off balance.<br />
<br />
Not saying that alchemy was ever profitable but the bazaar in general has hurt most item prices.  <br />
<br />
The only things that I can see profitable ( especially on VZ ) are<br />
<br />
Kilva's Skin of Flame      700pp<br />
SoW                                 95pp <br />
Counteract Poison         120pp <br />
Counteract Disease        120pp<br />
<br />
these are the ones I sell the most of,  occasionally do I sell a shrink or rarely an ITU,<br />
<br />
just what I've seen,  Alchemy definitely needs work</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've recently brought my skill up from 52 to 70.  I have stuck with the standard prices on my potions so those up and coming shamans will be able to charge the same as me.<br />
<br />
On more than one occasion, I've heard someone yell for SoW potions... because I wasn't AFK, I was able to respond with prices and get the sales, although mine were 100pp for the 10-dose and other vendors were selling them for 75pp or 95pp.  <br />
<br />
I'm slowly building up clients for my potions... went to Nagafen's Lair the other day, and a monk was FD in the hallway to the entrance.  The Troll in my party could not get around this person.  We asked nicely for them to move (what is going to hit a level 60 monk in Lavastorm?) and petitioned to have the person kicked off the server or moved to a safe location.  <br />
<br />
Someone ported to Neriak and got me three of each herb... I combined them, the troll drank one of the potions... and we were able to continue on our way.  (It wasn't until later that someone suggested we could have used Group Wolf Form.)  That was 15 new converts on the greatness of Alchemy.<br />
<br />
I also try to make shrink potions and damage shield potions before scheduled raids and let my friends know that they are available for purchase.</div></div><hr />
