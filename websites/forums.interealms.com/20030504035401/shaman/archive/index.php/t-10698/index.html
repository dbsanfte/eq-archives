<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Seeing as these are the two rarest spells in the game from what I've heard.  And given that the only time I've ever seen Torpor for sale it cost 95kpp, I have a feeling that I'm going to have a really hard time getting these.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for suggestions on how to acquire these two class defining spells, given that I am in a small guild (only 2 main shamans in my guild) and I don't have large amounts of time to play.  While I realize that I have a while yet before I can even use the spells, I like to plan ahead and am trying to figure out where I have the best chance of seeing them drop and what sort of forces are required to bring down the mobs that drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stuff that's single group doable (or less)<br />
<br />
Guardian wurms in skyfire - Friend of mine got torpor that way.  All I ever got was Talisman of the raptor here.<br />
<br />
Emporer in Sebilis - He's a umcommon spawn, and doesnt always drop spells.  But this is where I got torpor.<br />
<br />
the Protector and Jumpy in Sebilis - This is where I got the rest of my 59 and 60 spells.  Never really tmied the spawns but seemed like they usually spawned every 2, to 2 and a half hours.  We'd take a single group to Traks Lair, kill them both, pull juggs and frogs until they spawned one last time, then head out.  For a really long haul, we'd stay for another round.  I got 3 spells off of the Protector (malo included), and 1 spell from Jumpy.  Besides Malo, I dont know which was which.  But, the other 3 were votb, avatar, and pox.<br />
<br />
I've seen malo, pox, raptor, torpor, and votb all drop from Sev and Talendar as well.  Gorenaire drops em as well, but I've only seen her die 2 times.<br />
<br />
edit - Ok, one thing I did not mention.  I spent ALOT of time farming for these spells.  Over 30 guardian wurms killed, seen the Emporer's placeholder spawn more times than I care to remember, and if someone drags me back to Traks Lair one more time, I'll pass out.  These are something most people have to work, and work hard and long, to get.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyramon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I fully realize I will spend ungodly amounts of time in my efforts to get these spells.  I can live with that, from what I've seen of torpor it would be worth it hands down no questions asked. <br />
<br />
Also seeing as malo would be less useful to me personally since I don't raid much and it seems to be a raid-type spell, if I never get that one I won't exactly be put out by it.  <br />
<br />
At any rate, thanks for the info..and if anyone else has anything to add, I appreciate all the help I can get on it.</div></div><hr />
