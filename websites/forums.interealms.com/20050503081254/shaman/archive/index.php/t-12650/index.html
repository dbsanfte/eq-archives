<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I waited several months after PoP came out before I finally bought it.  And being only 57 I did not delve deep into learning about the various planes, or flags.<br />
<br />
Well, I finally got part of my PoS/PoV flag (talked to the guy, but have not done the trials) and last night I got the flag for the PoI Factory.  I have heard about a Maze event in PoN, the Crypt of Decay and PoNb, but I'm a bit confused.<br />
<br />
Is the Crypt of Decay and PoNb the same place?  Is the Maze event how to get flagged for it?  And can someone direct me to a good guide concerning this event?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This guild has put together an awesome flagging resource:<br />
<br />
http://www.mysticalorder.org/flagmap.htm#PoValor<br />
<br />
Basically, the PoP zones are arranged in &quot;Tiers.&quot;  <br />
<br />
Tier 1 - <br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmare<br />
Plane of Disease<br />
Plane of Innovation<br />
Plane of Justice<br />
<br />
Tier 2 -<br />
<br />
From Plane of Nightmare - complete Hedge maze quest (max 18 people) get access to Plane of Nightmare B.  Kill Terris Thule, get access to Plane of Torment<br />
<br />
From Plane of Disease- Kill Grummus (or do quest), get access to Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
From Plane of Innovation - Kill Magnetic Behemoth (there is also a quest involving Diaku raiders in PoS), get access to Plane of Tactics.  One person in the raid must have completed the &quot;follow the gnome&quot; quest in PoI, defeated the dragon and received the flag to open the factory door.<br />
<br />
From the Plane of Justice - complete any one of 6 trials and receive access to Plane of Valor and Plane of Storms<br />
<br />
Tier 3 - <br />
<br />
In the Plane of Valor, kill Aerin Dar (or complete quest) and receive access to the Halls of Honor.  In the Halls of Honor, there are 3 trials to complete (raid needed).  After completing three trials, you are flagged for HOHB, kill Mithaniel Marr.<br />
<br />
In the Plane of Storm, complete quest and receive access to the Bastion of Thunder.  In the Bastion of Thunder, there is an event (requiring raid force) to defeat Agnarr and release Karana.<br />
<br />
In the Crypt of Decay, complete the Carprin event (raid needed) to receive access to the Lower Crypt of Decay (this shows up on your key ring).  Kill Bertoxx in the Lower Crypt of Decay.<br />
<br />
In the Plane of Torment - Get key to Saryn's tower, help out Tylis, kill the Keeper of Sorrows and Saryn.  If you've done everything listed previously, you get access to Sol Ro's tower.  Killing the 5 flag mobs here and Sol Ro gets you flagged for Plane of Fire.<br />
<br />
In the Plane of Tactics - kill Vallon Zek, Tallon Zek and Rallos Zek (very tough fight!)<br />
<br />
If you do everything listed, you will be flagged for all the elemental planes.  Kill each boss and receive a key.  Kill all four bosses, and earn access to the Plane of Time.<br />
<br />
Eryslai, the Kingdom of Wind - Xegony<br />
Vegarlson, the Earthen Badland - The Council of the Rathe<br />
Reef of Coirnav - Coirnav (Avatar of Water)<br />
Doomfire, The Burning Lands - Fennin Ro<br />
<br />
Easy as pie, right?<br />
<br />
Oh, another important thing to know, is the fact you can do some flags out of order.  Once 32 flagged raid members are in a zone, raid members without flags can zone in, based on a percentage of flagged individuals within the zone (I don't know the exact percentage). I was able to kill zone in and kill Agnarr before getting my BoT flag.  This doesn't work for the Carpin key for Bertoxx, each person must have it (it's a key, not a flag).  I also heard (not personally confirmed) that you must have every required flag to zone into the elemental planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Gloriana.  That makes a bit more sense now.  :)  But what I still don't know is the point.... goal of the Maze event is.  Rather, what to do inside there and what to expect.<br />
<br />
So the Lair of TT is PoNb?  Don't know why I thought it was Crypt of Decay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">From Plane of Nightmare - Kill Grummus (or do quest), get access to Crypt of Decay<br />
<br />
I think you mean Plane of Disease right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Only problem with Glori's assessment is it's Plane of Disease where you kill Grummus.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Very nice!  That post kept getting bigger and bigger.  :)  Thanks again Gloriana.  Now to find info on the actual Maze event.<br />
<br />
Oh, you left off the Factory flag.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The goal of the maze is to release Thelin who is trapped in Terris Thule's nightmare.  Once you've completed the quest, you are able to enter Plane of Nightmare B (Lair of Terris Thule) and fight her.<br />
<br />
If you aren't in a raiding guild, probably no rush to complete this event. PoNB is not a good experience zone.<br />
<br />
What happens is you go to the Hedge in PoN, and get into a 3 group raid.  The leader of each group will have some dialogue with Thelin and each group will be ported inside.  (multiple events can occur at the same time)<br />
<br />
Enchanters are key for this encounter, there are many multi mob encounters and Thelin must be constantly mezzed or mem blurred.  You will follow Thelin about (sowing him helps greatly) and various monsters will jump out at you.  When Thelin gets to a cleared out space, there will be one monster.  Kill it, and 5 will appear which must be locked down and killed.  This kill one mob, 5 appear thing happens 3-4 times.<br />
<br />
At the final fight, a Construct of Nightmares will appear.  He is slowable.  When he dies (he can drop a decent pair of shaman pants), the raid leader will loot a dagger hilt and hand it to Thelin.  Terris Thule will appear (non targetable) and yell at Thelin for a second.  Hail Thelin to receive your flag and to be ported outside of the event.<br />
<br />
Only problem with Glori's assessment is it's Plane of Disease where you kill Grummus.<br />
<br />
Typo! I fixed it thanks.  I also left out the factory flag because you only need one person to open the door.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Would you say the Factory flag is harder to get than this event?  Because, to be honest, the Factory flag seemed easy.  :)<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
Gloriana, you first say 3 group raid and then &quot;the leader of each raid&quot;.  I assume you meant &quot;the leader of each group&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry, I should never post before coffee.  I think both events are pretty easy.  Factory event is more frustrating because the gnome can get bugged and poof.  The Hedge event really depends on good enchanters.   I don't remember a time limit on the event, when people are short of mana, just mez Thelin and med up.  When the 5 mobs are about to pop simultaneously, be sure all casters are against the walls and standing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Depends on how good your guild is....<br />
<br />
Factory event was/is a royal pain for my guild because doing it with 18-24 we've wiped 3x now -(twice because slows didn't stick)- where as if we brought 60 to it, it would be cake no matter what, y'know? :)  ... where as the 3-group designed thing for PoN was cake for us as we had the skills down to do it well.<br />
<br />
As for the hedge event, one tip: Have a monk or BL start in the middle of the spawn rooms, with stonestance ready.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This was our first attempt at the Xanamech encounter, so we had a huge turnout.  We had 55+ people there at least.  We had some aggro management issues, but he dropped with minimal losses and seemed fairly easy.  (Although I made a huge mistake at the beginning and died very early in the fight).<br />
<br />
What is a good estimate for time needed to do the Hedge Maze?  I am planning to do one of these soon, but with Easter and my daughter's birthday coming up I may have to plan this one week night.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardest part about the damm factory flag is getting the gnome to not poof on his way there. We had to do the thing 3 or 4 times before we got him to the dragon. Yeah it's not very hard if he doesn't despawn.<br />
<br />
Hedge maze isnt very difficult either if you know what your doing but like they said no real hurry unless you can get in on a terris thule kill some how for the flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The alliance I am in did this event on 4/25, and succeeded!  Average raider was level 58 according to the raid window.  4 Shaman present, 3 bards, 2 enchanters and a smattering of everything else.  Was not too tough once we got the hang of it.  Took a couple waves for everyone to get into gear, but we handled it.  Then came the big fight.  People reported that this was like a Vindi fight.  Either Vindi is easier to us than I thought, or this guy is not a Vindi.  The fight with the construct of nightmares was semi-long, but not that hard.  Especially when he was slowed.<br />
<br />
At one point I had 5 DoTs loaded in him.  :)  When I restacked them he got angry at me.  I was the only one to die, and that happened when he got to 5%.  Got rezzed and we got our flags.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the information.  It really helped!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Both the factory even and PoNB events can be either very entertaining or way annoying.  Both extensively use aggroing or rooting the NPC you're supposed to be helping and mem bluring him when you're ready for him to move.  Both are based on the Coldain Ring level 7? model and can be very entertaining, with ambushes and an exciting fight at the end.<br />
<br />
Neither rewards you with a flag that's particularly good for EXP, but both speed you on your way to higher planes.  The factory needs to be done by one person in a guild, the maze by all.  The mob at the end of PoNb is challenging, the one at the end of the factory is a TOUGH fight, with many people in different areas of the factory, stopping the little spiders from causing a lure 3500 HP AoE from happening.<br />
<br />
Content-wise, Getting access to ST (and much of Vellious) is ho-hum...  PoP planar advancement has some GREAT content to it.  Have fun with these fights  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that this doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I've got all the flags and events done minus Tallon and Vallon and i can't zone into Sol Ro.<br />
<br />
MM, Karana, Bertox, Saryn .. the whole bit .. i have access to tactics but i haven't killed the zek-lings yet .. and no access to sol-ro</div></div><hr />
