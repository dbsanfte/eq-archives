<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>sardaor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok all I know these are kind of constant and some of you may not appreciate the need for this but as im on a budget (nothing) and this is my main character I was wondering what everyone thought of my gear.<br />
      Any help will be appreciated just wondering what I should be looking towards.<br />
      My guild has been raiding Kael but due to large numbers of other people being there we have been kind of stuck so any help at all would be gratefully accepted<br />
<br />
Many Thanks in advance<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If the rest of the guild is at the same level as you, it may take you awhile to get Thurd armor, with the amount of competition on most servers for the Arena.  Your armor isn't that unusual for shammy's at your level.  I'd start concentrating on some more Wis, as it's so important to you.  First thing, I'd probably put the rings in the bank for later and get some wis rings, as the extra mana's gonna mean more than 130 HP's and 12 AC at this point.  When you have more wis than you can handle, it'll be the other way around though.<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to keep grouping and raiding with your guild.  The rest of them will have similar needs as you will and your armor will upgrade naturally.  Good areas for you to hunt would be Sebilis Crypt or Necro, Rares in TT, Velk's safe room, the Gorgo Chief in ME, Fear to help out the people who will help you out and of course, work on that epic.<br />
<br />
The items that need the most attention IMO are yer BP and yer legs.  Unfortunately, they're also the toughest to get.  Other than that, it looks like yer doing good on equipment, keep working on the skillz as it really makes the good shammy's stand out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your wis is fine, theres plently of shaman running about with similar.<br />
<br />
You're at that akward stage before Velious armour, you've got a nice balance going on in the meantime. <br />
<br />
Jarsath armour from KC can tide you over in some slots, bracer, BP, legs.</div></div><hr />
