<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm currently working on the guild quests in Shar Vahl for the cloaks and i was wondering if anyone has completed them and gotten the Dar Khura Officer Cloak. If so, could you please give me the stats on it. I have not seen it anywhere and only ones i can manage to find is the beastlord and warrior ones. thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Good luck.<br />
<br />
The hollowshade moor is broken. Sonic wolf blood, powdered sonic wolf claws, and sonic wolf brains are not dropping. You need those for the warrior and shaman parts of the quest.<br />
<br />
I'm stalemated at this bit, I keep filing bug reports but heh, they aren't ever fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Not entirely true. I've MQ'd myself into these quests (because I like to quest...........really), and I've been getting the brains and powdered claws pretty regularly from the wolves prowling out near the river near the Grimling forest zone. What I can't find are the Roots needed. They are supposed to be a ground spawn, but can't find them anywhere. Also, the wolves seem to have captured the Grimling camp everytime I check there, so I haven't gotten the piece off the Mystics yet.<br />
<br />
The Owlbears regularly drop the Digested Nightpalm. Cubs seem to do so often. Owlbears are aggressive, so they'll attack even above their level. Grapplers also tend to drop it.<br />
<br />
Haven't tried in about 2 weeks, but these were all dropping 2 weeks ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I know the root ground spawns near the wolf cave on top of the hill. and the best place to find mystics are in the fishing huts on the islands. I've been holding off a little on collecting the stuff til i get dogdog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmm.. not sure if I can help much :D but i do know that the brains etc are dropping.. i even got most of that part done.. until i gave the cloak in too early and couldnt get it back :( tried petitioning guide just said &quot;We cannot help you if you did the quest incorrectly&quot; and promptly ignored me :( so.. i'll let you know how it goes next time i do the quests~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You can get the cloak back by having someone make a shaman alt and mq the citizen part again. Only bad part is you have to start over from the begining.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ya, that's how i got my citizenship the first time :D deleted my newb papers when i first made this guy, never really bothered until i found out the end reward :O</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The drop rate for parts of the wolfbane weapons sink into the toilet after any of the factions take another area in Hollowshade Moor.  You can still get them but it's just not very likely.<br />
<br />
I am the only shaman/GM brewer in a predominately kitty guild so I have made quite a number of Reactive Solvent Soaks for guildies and others.  The best time to get the SWB items is right after a patch.  If you ask nicely you may be able to convince a GM to repop the zone if you tell them it's for quest items.<br />
<br />
I am currently trying to put together a strong enough force to get my officer's cloak but my guild is small and getting enough of them online at the same time is difficult.  My guildmaster has the beastmaster's officer's cloak and I have seen a few other's.   The stats for each cloak are similar but geared to the class they are intended for.  They are AC 12 if I remember right and look like a very nice back slot item, well worth the work involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That explains it. When I was farming for brains/blood/paws, some idiot had made the wolves overrun the grimlings, but the owlbears owned the wolves area.<br />
<br />
I'll try again after a patch, I've got a warrior mule who lacks only the paws, blood and claws. Myself, I just need the brains and I can make my own part, I am a bit short on the blackened salt crystals, they're a pretty annoying drop.<br />
<br />
I've got the rogue bit, and I'm asking around for the bard and beastlord bits... although I am not against muling a bard and a beastlord through it. Now that I know that these parts are actually dropping, I am more willing to mule my way through this quest :)</div></div><hr />
