<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My Shaman was in Gunthak a while ago but i couldn't find the zone to Dulak.  Is it hidden or underwater?  Also, why wouldn't it let me explore to the right of the docks when getting off the boat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh, welcome to Gunthak.  The trick is to explore the are left of the docks, which is where the rest of LoY is, including Dulak.  Specifically, you want to head to the beach and follow the right wall all the way to Dulak.  You'll pass over the beach, through a bunch of caves, through a troll town, and finally in to Dulak.  You'll need invis unless you want to bring a giant train along with you, and I'd also recomend stopping off at http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/ to pick up a set of maps now that own LoY.  Once you copy them in to your maps directory, all you need to do is hit backspace in EQ and you'll have all the cartographic wonderment you need to travel around LoY.<br />

Hope that helps.</div></div><hr />
