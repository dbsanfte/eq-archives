<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">We wanted to kill this guy yesterday. Read up on Alla, and started killing for the keys and hand them in to the resistance guys.<br />
<br />
After doing this for maybe 2+ hours, I had to log. We never realised it would take that many turn ins. Has any one done this? How many keys did you have to turn in? Or is there another trick to this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Getan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It takes between 1 and 20 keys to call the Captains. We've found the most efficent way is to give a stack of keys to a ranger or rogue and let them run around looking for resistant miners while the rest of the group kills everthing else in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Friend and I spent an entire afternoon gathering keys and turning them in, didn't spawn.  I went to bed and he got some other ppl to come and kept handing in keys, I think we did 20 total to spawn him.  He's pretty easy for some nice loot, but it takes forever to get the keys turned in.</div></div><hr />
