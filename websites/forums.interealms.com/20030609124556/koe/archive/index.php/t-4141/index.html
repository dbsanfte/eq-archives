<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Mawafu is ready for the final battle in the Lake of Ill Omen. We will gather on the East side of the Lake and begin making groups. We will need at least 2 or 3 groups and a standard mix of classes, but I will take as many people as want to attend. All KoE, KoE recruits, and friends are invited. Please reply below if you can attend.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
EDIT: We were not able to do this since the newbie guild wars went very late. We will try again tomorrow night.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cshae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can make it if it is in the evening :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Mawafu Steelfist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well, Bem has yet to respond to my PM but I will not be able to do this on Saturday morning (10am for me) or at 3pm (the other time Bem suggested to me) *bonks the mage for not asking me first if I could make these times*<br />
<br />
So it would have to be late Saturday, or even Friday night after our guild war as I suggested to Bem because more people will be on and it is a weekend night, meaning more can stay up later.<br />
<br />
All is up to Bem though, but I wanted to give everyone a heads up on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Meiamour</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">hehe the Mage meant well :) I can make it either of those times Maw. I just can't be there in the early evening on Saturday. I will be great to see you with the epic so anything I can do to help I will be there.<br />
<br />
Hugs Sweetie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Infinate</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Evening would be best for me.<br />
Edit: Nevermind will be working Friday thought this was for Saturday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Doh! I am on normally all day but had a client visit today. Let me read Mawafu's pm. <br />
<br />
EDIT: Ok Friday night after the guild war. Around 10pm EST I would think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>razma taz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well I can't commit to this because I have to work early Saturday morning but I would sure like to be there when Mawafu gets his epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Nadonius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Barring any RL events I will be there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Yadilu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Hm.. I wouldn't mind seeing another completion of an epic :D   My help is always open and just give me a tell if you guys want me.  It's been a while since I've seen quite a few KoE members that I was friends with long before either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Aseid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I can help tonight and will bring either the druid or the rogue, whichever may be needed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Knarlz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">my home comp is toasted, i'll have to miss this (</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Vederian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd be glad to come help. I've never seen anyone get thier Epic yet so this should be fun. See you there tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Bemidian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I am leaving work now to go get my wife and her overheated car. :( Not sure how long it will take. I can't imagine that it would take so long that I would not be able to make this. If for some reason I am late, then I am sure KoE can get an Epic team member or officer or Mawafu to take charge. In other words, I think I'll make it but if not don't wait on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Venomblood Draconis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">With Raz on this one. I have to get up early on Sat, so I can't absolutely commit, but I will try to be there. I should be able to log over from the war immediately. If it doesn't go too late, I'm there. At least I can help with the initial buffing if I can't stay for the fights. <br />
