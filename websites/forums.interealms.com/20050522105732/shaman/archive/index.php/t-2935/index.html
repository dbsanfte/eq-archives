<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, I got canny5 last night, and are pretty thrilled with it so far. I've got a few questions about it though.<br />
<br />
- Is it possible to make a multi-line hotkey with it, with an emote or /g tied to it, or do i have to stick with the hotkey it generates?<br />
<br />
- What is better; canny5, then torpor, or torpor then canny5, to reduce low aggro hate/reduce risk ?<br />
<br />
- What is the exact amount of mana it gives?<br />
<br />
- (new User interface question)I've already noticed that it would be a lot more handy to have a permanent numerical display of my hp up. Does the new UI give this as an option?<br />
<br />
Thank in advance :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can use any activateable AA skill with the command /alt activate [number].  Can V is 47.  I'm not sure about others but usually its in your scrollback whenever you hit their respective keys.<br />
<br />
1. This is my macro.<br />
<br />
/g Using Cannibilization.<br />
/alt activate 47<br />
<br />
<br />
2. I usually try to torpor before Can V, no real reason other then I like to be sure I'm going to get the healing.<br />
<br />
3. Can V is 1924 HPs and 1066 mana.<br />
<br />
4. I don't think that it gives an option for an absolute number, but it does give a percentage ... I'm sure someone will skin it so that your hps can show in your main display.</div></div><hr />
