<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What is the name of the moon that you see in the Norrathian Sky?<br />
<br />
First person who answers correctly winz free oxygen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Luclin. Woot free oxygen!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Luclin was hidden by the goddess of the same name.  It's not Luclin you see but the name of the other moon escapes me at the moment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Drinal .</div></div><hr />

Great trivia question.  I honestly have no idea, but I'd love to hear the correct answer when someone can confirm it. :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Drinal is correct.  The old game manuals mention this.  Luclin is hidden by the goddess Luclin (which was never put in the game and remains unfinished content).  In the Plane of Sky, the old island hoppers fantasy, you can see Luclin which is a blantant ripoff of an old Saturn Nasa image.  You can also see Drinal and another moon.  Some claim this other moon is Norrath, which might be possible however they didn't use the same graphic when looking from Luclin.  Who knows :)<br />
<br />
In EQ2 Luclin will explode and fall apart becoming visible from the surface of Norrath.  This image shows both moons in the same sky.<br />

Blow up Luclin!?  Ack!  I'll be homeless! *sob*<br />

Actually you wont be homeless...The Kitties take over the Iksar's home.  Where the iksar's go though I have no clue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm an iksar and I feel sorry for the kitties.  Our place is a bland colorless dump that is a Queer Eye for Straight Guys wet dream.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Cabilis is my favorite city in the game, how can you say such things about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would think the Vah Shir would move into Stonebrunt before taking over such a decrepit waste as Cabilis.  <br />
<br />
We already have family there (the Kejekans) and the place is well suited to the temperment of us predator cats with woods, plains and mountains for all our varieties and plenty of game to hunt.  With the knowledge and skills of the Vah Shir we could teach the Kejekans how to build a great city instead of that wooden stockade they inhabit now.<br />
<br />
It would give SOE something to do with that funny passage there too.<br />
<br />
And after hearing the trolls whine I don't think I want to see another race lose their home.  At least Kitties are a warlike race, the iksar would still have some self-respect.  I mean really, trolls evicted by frogs! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Good lord man. Cabalis much like all of kunark, oozes with character. So what if its not all pretty colors, i mean the place is run by fear breading serpant slaves that have had a hard life. It aint not martha stewarts garden.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Kunark is just one big lore fest which I agree is awesome, I'm just thinking of the big colorful cat pad that they are used too.  I mean us Iksar have a gigantic sewer running through the entire city!  And we swim in it!  They have cush lush pillows and a harlom, we have untreated sewers, barracuda, and a lovely resort called the Temple of Terror.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heard a rumor that we Iksar get displaced to Faydwer.  Strange place for us to run to.  But considering the way EQ2 is going to handle Good vs Evil, it makes even less sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hmmm.  The last lore that I read concerning EQ2 was that the Vah Shir were gone.  Where are you all getting the current information?<br />
<br />
Oh, and are these rat people that are supposed to be  aplyable race from the infestation of rats that all cities in Norrath have encountered in the last 9 months?</div></div><hr />
