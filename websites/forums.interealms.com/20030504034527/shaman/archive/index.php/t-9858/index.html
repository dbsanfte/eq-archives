<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Surely they would have put in a mechanism to allow game card users to download it and be billed or something.<br />
<br />
Oh...wait...sorry, my bad. That would require forethought. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Up to level 60?<br />

So it's all green to 65 when it's introduced?<br />
<br />
That seems odd.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That seems odd. <br />
<br />
new zones to over run and farm cash yay<br />
<br />
/boggle<br />
<br />
seriously though , green to my 65 or not , itll be great for my alts , so thats good. I really so hope its not green to 65 , it doesnt make sense to make us level to 65 to have a expansion come out we can use . At 65 im limited to very very few zones worth going to unless im farming cash heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Numzan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I enjoy the game but not that much to pay without owning a cd.... <br />
<br />
Its bad enough i rent an image to scroll through a fantasy world.<br />
<br />
Atleast having the CD makes my mind at ease..... Feel the same as i do?<br />
<br />
Doesnt matter there is alot of content in this game i have yet to see, when that gets boring move on.<br />

But it won't matter. Everyone will buy the extension to use the features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kusala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cant believe you all whine because might be green to a 65... This game usually is all about higher levels like PoP.  They throw a bone to the middle class and bam you all cry.  I hope the even put the loots so they cant be farmed if you are to high.  My 2 pennies worth.   May seem rude but Higher ups have been catered to more than the middle class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Looks good to me!, only thing I am worried about is HOW BLEEDING LONG IT WILL TAKE ME TO DOWNLOAD VIA ISDN lol.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Adran Windrunner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'd much rather download the thing than wait to try and get hold of it on CD. Just so long as they have servers that can handle the load. Of course, living in the UK I'm slightly biased :)<br />
<br />
I download almost all my software these days. If you don't have a CD writer of your own, it's not hard for them to make it re-downloadable if your hard drive dies and you lose the orginal copy. Other companies have been doing this for years. Hopefully SOE will do the same!<br />
<br />
Besides, we have to re-download every new expansion anyway, as they patch the things to hell and back after launch.<br />
<br />
I'm more interested in the &quot;New Cartography System&quot;. Please tell me they aren't introducing in-game maps after all these years!</div></div><hr />

The only whining about this i see is from your post.<br />
<br />
<br />
2 posts were made about this , one simply saying &quot;odd&quot;<br />
<br />
and mine saying also odd but itll be great for my alts , which im serious about. dont be so quick to slam people please</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I wonder how this will work if you have more than one account, but only play them on one computer? Will they make you buy it twice, or just once its on that computer you can use the expansion no matter what?  I  they will probably send us some key-code after purchase to our e-mail or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I like the download thing, means retailers are getting cut out of the loop, which means the high street stores here get hurt.  Considering the disgustingly low level of service, lack of variety of stock, massive delays in releases from the US this can only be a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chances are you'll simply be paying for multiple registration keys, but only have to download it once, then install it on all of your EQ machines.<br />
<br />
I like the download idea as long as they've beefed up their network infrastructure to support massive downloads. Even if they have I'm willing to bet the first few days are going to be chaotic at best.<br />
<br />
Once I download it I'll just burn a &quot;backup copy&quot; onto CD for safe keeping.</div></div><hr />

531 PRE-ORDER<br />
532 BUY LoY<br />
533 Thank you for selecting Legacy of Ykesha! Please complete the process by clicking the 'Advanced' button on the patcher and selecting the &quot;Legacy of Ykesha&quot; toggle.<br />
534 EverQuest will now exit and send you to the Legacy of Ykesha order page.\n\n(www.everquest.com)<br />
535 (2) We will charge your credit card no earlier than 12:01 a.m. PST on February 24, 2003. If you change your mind and want to cancel your pre-order before that time, go to https://store.station.sony.com/my_account.jsp and cancel your pre-order. At 12:01 a.m. on the live date and thereafter, all sales are final.\n\n(3) The file patch plan is to make the necessary files gradually available for patching during a several week period prior to the live date. When you pre-order, the “Legacy of Ykesha” box on the second page of the client patcher will be checkmarked – so that each time you patch, the patch routine will check for new extension files and download them to you. Narrowband users – some patches may be quite large and take significant time to download. For patch hints, go to http://eqlive.station.sony.com/supp...atcher.jsp.\n\n<br />
536 (4) You must order Ykesha for each account you wish to have &quot;Ykesha-enabled;&quot; you must download and install the necessary files on each machine you wish to &quot;Ykesha-enable.&quot;\n\n(5) The Legacy of Ykesha extension and your pre-order is subject to the EverQuest User Agreement and Software License (located at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/supp...ice/cs_EULA.jsp), SOE’s Terms of Service (located at http://sonyonline.com/tos/tos.jsp) and Rules of Conduct (located at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/supp..._of_conduct.jsp), and SOE’s Privacy Policy (located at http://sonyonline.com/tos/tos.jsp#privacy). Minimum system specs can be found at http://eqlive.station.sony.com/supp...quirements.jsp; you must be an EverQuest subscriber to order the extension.\n\n<br />
537 (6) As with most software, the anticipated live date may slip; if so, we will post a new anticipated live date in a patch message and extend the deadline for pre-order cancellations until 12:01 a.m. PST on the new live date.\n\n(7) Expect heavy patch server load, difficulty connecting and – perhaps – unscheduled downtime on the live date and for a few days thereafter.<br />

Years later, in a flood of brutish strength and cunning the trolls of the Broken Skull clan returned, and by their actions forever changed Norrath. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Zoulen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Just a guess, but... Aside from the new starting race, this sounds like an expansion that includes things that didn't make the cut into PoP during the design planning. That would explain the back-to-back release and the download-only option. It's also a good experiment to see how willing people are to use this delivery form in the future for EQ2.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to it. No-one should bitch about new content, regardless of the level range. My only lament is that there's no indication this release will include revamping of old dungeons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want whining?  Ok, I'll whine.<br />
<br />
PoP blows.  It has some good features, but for the most part, it has hurt my guild badly - although obviously we can grow in power.  I'm ok with disparities, but they are widening too far and I think that sucks.  <br />
<br />
PoP blows, so I want new content I can reasonably get to and do stuff in with a few friends that's fun - and actually get something, or have some purpose to it.  Is that too much to ask for?  As zones go, Valor sucks, Storms sucks, Decay sucks, and I haven't gotten to HoH or BoT yet.  Could be after nearly 4 years I'm tired of the game.  <br />
<br />
But I think it's more I'm tired of drones telling me I'm whining or I suck because I don't have 40 people to raid with nightly.  I play erratically, and often don't know when I can be on, so I'm used to things being harder for me.  It's much worse now, and I'm tired of that and bull**** from those who get spoonfed everything simply by showing up regularly.  <br />
<br />
Yeah, I wanted new dungeon based content I could do with a group or less.  Maybe this expansion will do that.  I'll certainly be there and will try it out.  Just hoping, that's all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Thought Verantn said a long time ago they were going to move away from raid oriented stuff to more small group things?<br />
<br />
bad, never had more fun then when I was with a few friends.<br />
<br />
This is the only time I detest twinking with items and PL'n, when a new race is added, within a week there will be level 60 frogloks running around, stupid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>garlaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Frog's are found in more zones on Kunark, no?  There is that one &quot;tribe&quot; of them in Swamp of No Hope up on that platform.   They could just convert that to a starting city and make 'em like wood elves in kelethin.<br />
<br />
Also, someone posted about getting a friend to cut them a CD with the downloaded files... There should be no reason that wouldn't work.  Alot of times, that's how I update my laptop (well, copying files across the network from my PC) rather than downloading.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Wonder if Guk will turn into a starting city? <br />
<br />
No ... my guess is a new portal off the Innothule swamps to Island of Broken Skull will be found.   All the threads on this point to those swamps ... even the PoK Quests.   Most likely it's going to be the Tower which is the home of Jojuanga and Undead (skellys) located in the swamp between SRO and Guk zones.    That's the off away from Grobb and Feerott zones.    I've been on top of that tower before thinking that it was a great place for portal if only the ladder part was easier to move up and down.   <br />
<br />
BTW ... I'm on board with LoY getting hunting zones for ALL levels.  It's just silly to think that there is not going to be content designed around a lvl 65 player.   If it's built from lvl 60 and down ... then what happens when a group of lvl 65 folks walks into the zone and lays waste to everything.     All new expansions HAVE to take the total player base into account at design time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I doubt that they would make the new froglok starting city in the same zone as the newbie guards of another race.<br />
<br />
They MIGHT convert guk, but I doubt it. Mostly likely there will be a completely new location.<br />
<br />
As for the 35-60 thing...sorry, but W T F??? There are many many zones out there already for the 35-50 crowd. That the 35-50 crowd totally ignores them and only goes to a small number of more popular ones is their fault, and not the fault of the 65s. Plus, most of the people in that level range are twinks...their goal is to get through as quickly as possible, not to hang out and play.<br />
<br />
It is a crappy thing to do to the 63+ people who lack major guild support, and are therefore limited completely to only 6 zones of the new expansion. When you hit 63, most of Justice/Disease/Nightmare/Innovation turns light blue or even green, at 65, all 4 of these zones are MOSTLY green. That leaves 2 zones to hunt in and gain experience. Valor, and Storms. Storms really blows for XP. Too many slow mitigators, too many slow immunes, no wearable loot of any kind (that a single group could get). So that leaves Valor. I can't speak for your server, but during prime time, Valor on Luclin has 60-100 people in it, most LFG because the zone doesn't easily support that many. It's ok for me, because I have access to CoDecay, Torment, Tactics, and BoThunder...I'm in a fairly large, raid heavy guild but most aren't.<br />
<br />
They need to put at least 1 or 2 zones in here which contain primarily dark-blue-at-65 mobs so that people can have an alternative place to go. They also need to put in some decent loot that a single group can get, because the Tier1 planes in PoP are pretty lacking in this regard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At what level do critters stop being dark blue to a 65? Seems odd that there are only a few zones in game with critters that high.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Zardson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">My prediction<br />
<br />
- the new zone will contains experience modifier similar to PoV/PoS , but for level 35 to 60<br />
- the new spells like stoicism will be found in these zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Thew level 58 pet cons blue at 65 still, right?<br />
<br />
So why all the bitching? Any 60 zone is likely to have mobs up to and perhaps over level 60...so they'd still be blue to 65, correct?</div></div><hr />

Yes n00bs, whining, e.t.c., there are SO MANY ZONES. I could name maybe 10, that would be empty, that you can either solo in or get good XP, that would have not one person in it.<br />

Give us high lvl zones, not this crap. And not zones you need flags for either.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">At lvl 65 I think it's either 57 or 58 to be dark blue off hand. The problem that to get good exp you really want to be hunting something lvl 61+ if at all possible.<br />
<br />
I'm sure mill missed it but some of you probably remember when they first implemented the exp bonus for fighting higher lvl mobs closer to your lvl that they decreased the amount of experence that lower end dark blue mobs gave. People complained and the fixed it. It seems in my experience that is in effect for the lvl 61+ area making lvl 58-60 mobs fairly poor exp and making the realistic range for exp even smaller.<br />
<br />
As far as this expansion goes calling it a 35-60 expansion might just be an oversite. It might not be. If it isn't an there may not be any exp spots for lvl 61+ chars in there. Even old high lvl exp spots like Cazic thule and Umbral plans are pretty bad exp post 60 and especially at 65 in my experience. To really get good exp at 65 you need to be fighting stuff that would have been yellow to red at 65 and there just isn't much in the way of regular mobs of that lvl in previous content.<br />
<br />
Even so I still fully intent to purchase the expasion right now. The increased bank space, cartography skill and charms as an extra stat slot all sound cool and worth 18 bucks or what ever they seem to be charging for it.<br />

Since i've got dsl i'm not too worried about downloading the files.</div></div><hr />

As for the 35-60 thing...sorry, but W T F??? There are many many zones out there already for the 35-50 crowd. That the 35-50 crowd totally ignores them and only goes to a small number of more popular ones is their fault, and not the fault of the 65s. Plus, most of the people in that level range are twinks...their goal is to get through as quickly as possible, not to hang out and play.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
You said basically everything I was going to say, and then some. To add on to this point, the number of people in the 35-50 range is small as is, and is not increasing. It is probably shrinking, if anything. Meanwhile, every day more and more people enter the post 60 range. This game needs more high end content, period. Planes of power was a step in the right direction. If I was designing ykesha, I would make it similar to planes of power, only focus more on dungeons and single group content, and exp zones for level 65s. Plane of valor is probably bursting at the seams on all servers now, and it is only going to get worse. Meanwhile there are umpteen million level 35ish zones that go completely unused. <br />
<br />
More level 65 content, please. I sure hope the 35-60 thing was a typo or an oversight, and they at least meant 35-65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I kinda feel the same way, the amount of ignored mid level zones is positively shameful, do we need more?  Kaesora, Dalnir, Nurga, Permafrost, CoM...are there ever more than 6 level appropriate people exping there at any given time?  <br />
<br />
Whereas, at level 62, I'm stuck with the same 4-5 crappy outdoor PoP zones as everyone else.  If I didn't have access to HoH and CoD, it would nearly be unbearable.  <br />
<br />
Where are the wonderful high level dungeons?  Where is the 60+ Sebilis?  Sebilis, with the nice gem drops and decent shots for loot and really fun little camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">This extension will include some great new gameplay features, as well as new zones for characters ranging from level 35 up to level 60.  <br />
<br />
OK ... so I take things literally ... and I take 'up to level 60'   to mean that the zones were DESIGNED up to a lvl 60 player.    What happened to the 61-65 design issues ... I'm not sure.   Does this mean that ANY person that levels beyond 60 AKA Planes of Power is limited in DESIGNED game play to PoP ... I'm not sure but it sure sounds like it.    <br />
<br />
To those that are questioning this ... think about this for a sec.   For those of you that are below lvl 60 ... what does it really offer you to pass lvl 60 ... if any further expansions are designed for level 60 and below?   Sorry but I have bought all the expansions ... I plan on buying LoY ... and I want to think that the designers had a concept of the whole game in mind while they put together the story board and mob layouts of zones.   <br />
<br />
IS this is telling people that level 61-65 players are NOT part of the EverQuest game concept other than Planes of Power?   Surely it's just a error and will be cleared up by Scott Hartsman someplace.     Scott if you are reading ... set our expectations ... Please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Its funny how 50-60 is now considered mid level... <br />
<br />
I posted this in another thread but this appears to be the main ill repost..<br />
<br />
*******<br />
<br />
Here is how I see it. The levels of 61-65 is denoted as &quot;PoP advancement levels only.&quot; With the advancement system in place for this game this level range is now set to those &quot;uber&quot; encounters that come in the various dieties' repsective plane of existance. So anything 61-65 is set to this level of difficulty and this level of boss mobs and what can be bigger than the dieties? <br />
<br />
And so I think this expansion is a couple of simple things... <br />
<br />
*First and foremost it is to further the world story. The game is aging so they are adding content for people to explore with these new twinks that they will be creating. So this will in effect allow a Kunark level of zones for the old world and for character advancement for the other races. <br />
<br />
*Second they are fleshing out the old world. Youve seen the old maps of areas that dont exist because there was too little time to. This old world currently sits at 1-50s and is the birthplace for the majority of the races of Norrath. Norrath is one fo the most populated in lore worlds I have ever been a part of and they are adding to that to try to keep people in the game further. <br />
<br />
I know most people are just into killing the next big mob, but as for myself I love to explore new dungeons and to learn about the world that I was in. My first experience of this was Blackburrow. I can say how much I hate that zone because it was the first Oasis but back at release it was a beautiful dungeon filled with danger. I was always scared about getting lost in there and I did a few times. <br />
<br />
I think alot of these people that are pissed are so because they just went trough the game too fast, plain and simple. This results in a heaftier popluation being stuck to war over the same content that was designed for the upper 5% of the population. Sure the game is aging but there was a whole expansion, good or bad, given to 60+. <br />
<br />
Personally, I agree with the philosophy of getting there is half the fun and there is so much story you can pass trying to get to the &quot;biggest&quot; or the &quot;uberest.&quot; But then again I atually read the quest text and learn the stories. I can remember this one great experience of catching a GM or Guide telling the story of how the field of bone was created in detail as a bard at the entrance of Freeport</div></div><hr />

Most of you probably don't work in retail, but in my job (making TV ads) I've dealt with a lot of promotional stuff with vendors and suppliers.  It's TERRIBLY inefficient and knowing how much of your purchases especially for media goes into paying the guy who loads the vans or stocks the aisles, not to mention the guy who prints the labels and presses the CDs would make you gag.<br />
<br />
For a 30 dollar CD, about half a percent goes into the actual cost of the CD, and maybe 10 percent the cost of the packaging, the rest goes into padding the pockets of distributors etc.<br />

I has WISHING i could buy a key for sol or pop online for 15 bucks, not ony for the convenience but for the logical cost reduction as well.  I'm glad they're doing this online.<br />

<br />
If you are referring to me, you could not be more wrong.  Totally and completely wrong.  If you aren't, then I don't get your point.  <br />
<br />
I've only played Gart since early 1999, slowly plodding along, mostly grouping in various dungeon zones with occasional soloing here and there.  I don't like twinks, and I like being a shaman.  <br />
<br />
I've been a leader in my guild for 3 years, constantly running about and helping folks with stuff.  We've gotten about 80 epics in the guild.  But we are an older, more casual collection of folks from all corners of the globe with some power types and a lot of non-power player types.  Getting into a raiding &quot;groove&quot; just doesn't happen very consistently - and we never know if we'll have 1 cleric on or 4.  Do we disband? Should I quit? Do we change totally who and what we are?  Great options... why are they necessary?  Well, they are, but I don't really think they should be.  <br />
<br />
I will never have &quot;stuff&quot; like Chuk or Jenamdar, and I don't expect to, because I don't play the same style they do.  It's not about &quot;stuff&quot; per se, but maybe it is in part (and I'm violating one of my rules there).  I like a sense of progression and advancement and seeing new stuff as much as the next guy.  It's about goals.  Those are good.<br />
<br />
I accept disparities, and that unless I change my style of play those disparities will persist.  I am not content with the extent of the disparities, and I don't accept the reasoning for them.<br />
<br />
I've got a ton of goals in front of me now, but they seem increasingly unreachable, and my gameplay seems increasingly limited.  I know I can eventually claw my way into more zones, just as I have managed to claw my way through to this point.  <br />
<br />
But it's not just effort for me, but also constant effort trying to get others through to group with me, and then having the right collection/combination of us on together to be together.  <br />
<br />
Hurdles are fine, they create a sense of accomplishment.  This game has a history of that, and it's the key to its success.  Too many hurdles means too many folks stumble and get frustrated.  It's a matter of degree, and individual preception about what's reasonable.  I can appreciate that's a difficult game design tightrope to walk.  <br />
<br />
The game is great, otherwise I wouldn't have played it for so long.  It's because I think (or hope) the game can still be great that I offer my &quot;whining&quot;.  I'm offering my input based on my prespective.  If you or others or game designers don't believe it has merit, that's your, and their, call.  All I can do is offer my opinion based on my experience.  Ultimately I will decide if it's worth it for me; if I'm having enough fun to continue paying I will.  If not, at some point I'll throw in the towel.  I'm stubborn and slow, so it takes a while.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for new content I can do with my collection of friends. I don't see it existing in PoP right now.  I'm not interested in jjoining the latest collection of level 60s who have gathered the newest &quot;power&quot; guild that will last 8 months before it dissolves in acrimony.  How many of those have I seen?  A lot.  I certainly don't play enough consistent raid hours or times to join a more established &quot;raiding&quot; guild.  Part of me would like to, but I like my friends, and I have invested much into making my guild better.  <br />
<br />
Generally, I'm not impressed with the quality of play from folks in these new power guilds (some are good, some are awful) - but they thrive in PoP.  It's made for them, not me.  I have time, I don't have consistent time and that's the key ingredient that's overemphasized.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping for something more for me.  Who doesn't want that?  Obviously I think I am the voice of reason and wisdom, but I appreciate others will think I'm stupid and missing the point - or will say that PoP isn't made for me.  <br />
<br />
Well, if it ain't, it should have been made to include me more than it does.  <br />
<br />
This is a long diatribe (whine), so that's enough.  I may change my mind in a week, who knows.</div></div><hr />

Where is the part that you disagree with what I stated in my post?  And why do you think it was pointed at you? If you read my post you would know it wasnt, I actually agree with alot of what you were saying... well at least from what you typed.  My post was very specialized.  It was inteded for people whining there was an expansion that didnt include content for 61-65 when there is a new one in front of them.  That expansion is for 61-65.  This expansion is to do some fleshing out, which if I am reading your post correctly, you are for... so what is your problem with me then?  I mean if you dont like POP then you shouldnt progress past 60 IMHO and IMHO that is what VI intends.  I mean those levels are intended for those that take down Norraths gods.<br />
<br />
The evidence is right in front of you! For one the AAs are titled Planar Advancement, &quot;Class Type&quot; Planar Abilities and &quot;Class&quot; Planar Abilities.  And also you have to go to the planes to get your 61+ spells and assorted added spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>EverNewbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">Lots of people seem to be complaining about the new Expansion. I feel that it's a well argued point that they seem to be excluding the higher lvl's. BUT you can't go and say that they shouldn't included the lower lvl's in this too. Not everyone has the time to lvl to 60 or higher. And guess what people there in to sell the expansion! wow what a concept they wanna make money. Think about this for one second if they make this a expansion for lvl's 61-65 that will exclude a lot of more people then the now stated 35-60. Therefore a lot of their people won't buy it because it will be out of their reach and a waste of time. Why would they make a solely 61+ expansion when they would not have the vast ammount of people buying. They should add a high lvl section I agree also. BUT the PoP expansion was in essence a 46+ expansion because it mainly involves the places which are 46 to enter initally. By adding the other content they appealed to the lower lvls. I was just adding the &quot;there in for the profit&quot; for a differernt view on it. Don't flame me please cuz that was not to belittle any of your guy's thesis' on it. I'm hoping that this expansion helps everyone because it's not fair to exclude anyone. And whoever said that if you don't have a 60+ character your a newb you might as well been right. My main is currently a lvl 25. But just remember when you think your insulting someone because they don't spend X hours playing a game everyday you should really reconsider how much your lifes worth. Really so I have a grasp on the &quot;real&quot; life. Amazing eh? Anyway I hope this expansion is benificial for all lvl's. Can't wait for it to come out. Will enjoy getting things that will help me that i cant accidently eat. Well there's my 2cp. Thanks for listening.<br />

I'm interested in progression, advancement, seeing and doing more.  It's always been the focus of the game for me, and it is the principal design element.  <br />
<br />
I didn't plow through earlier content too fast, and you appeared to saying that those who didn't like PoP primarily blew through earlier content too fast.  That's wrong in my experience; in fact, it's the opposite that's true.  <br />
<br />
What's the fun in simply stopping at 60?  Why would I want to do that?  So I can keep hitting Sebilis?  I know every inch of Sebilis already.  I know Chardok, I know Howling Stones, I know HoT, I know the Luclin zones (except Grieg's really).  I don't know Vex Thall or Sleepers.    <br />

<br />
EverNewbie, there's so much content for you, you will never hit it all before you level beyond it.  The announced expansion suggests it covers up to level 60, not 65.  Maybe that's a typo, and all this gas from me is wasted.  That's fine if so.</div></div><hr />

Fraud = offering up game cards when you cant play the game. Or only paying for pieces of the game. NO its wrong!!

OH boy i smell Legal action here....<br />
<br />
Good one SOE your really smart here =D<br />
<br />
See guys they sold Game cards and the Gold box edition in stores, then offer up everquest to its customers by paying for it by CC and game cards. They didnt inform us that we could be ripped off part of the game 3 months in advance when a new addon came out. Instead they offer it to CC users and tell us game card users that your game might be ended sooner then later when we stop supplying game cards to stores. So thanks for your money now piss off..

<br />
My chief concern is that this new expansion doesn't take lvl 61-65 into account.   The outline clearly states  35-60 ... instead of 35-65.    If it's a typo ... ok cool ... a bit of wasted time posting.  <br />
<br />
BUT if it's intended content for lvls 35 - 60 ONLY ... that means that most of the higher end encounters are NOT designed for a raid group of lvl 61-65 ... or even a strong single group of 6 x 65's ... or maybe even a pickup group of 6 x 61 plus's.    See the point?   <br />
<br />
Lets make this clearer ... Kedge can be done now with a ok group of 60 folks all the way to Phinny and back.   It's not a big deal  then to add a couple ( like Warrior/Healer) lvl 61's trying Phinny.   Add up any old world encounter that a group of lvl 55-60's could do ... a group of 65's are going to do it better.   In EQ, it's all about &quot;The Level&quot; ... then everything else.    If the Content of the zones don't take levels 61-65 into account ... what is the challange for any level 61 plus player in this new zone?    To see how much of this new LoY content can be soloed or dueled?   <br />
<br />
There are TON's of level 61 plus people in this game ... and the number is growing everyday ... onwards to lvl 65.   The only thing anyone is asking is take the level 61 - 65 folks into account while designing these zones ... and throw in a couple high end zones that these people can play around in.    If that means adding high end zones with 59+ mobs ... all the better for everyone ... including the 50-60 folks because you can group/raid them just like anyone else.<br />
<br />
To recap ... I think people are just saying ... hey don't forget about all us folks that bought PoP , leveled past 60 , and still want to enjoy new expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">My perspective on levels has been...61-65 exists purely to move forward in PoP...not linger in those few exp zones in Tier 2-3. My guild raids and most are level 65...they are progressing through PoP. I on the other hand have very limited play time and cannot move forward with them, but I seen the writing on the wall and have chosen to stay 60. I can farm AAs -quite- nicely in PoV ect and this is my path. Staying level 60 Ive had -zero- problems exping in those first tier zones and Ive kept my options open. I do intend on moving up to level 62-63 soon just to use the spells in this range.<br />

Used to be my way of thinking till PoP squelched my lingering illusions.<br />
<br />
Progression requires some goal to aim for. The goals in PoP are out of range unless your guild is able to pull together 40+ people regularly to defeat boss mobs.<br />
<br />
Kind of liberating really to realize that there is no end-point and you can jump in at almost any point to have fun. These new zones sound fun.<br />

I can see a little of both... On one hand, progression in PoP is a real pain, and the game shrinks massively at 61 and keeps getting smaller.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the whole reason people want to race to 50 is because, well, low-level areas REALLY suck. I never had fun in Paw, Mistmoore, Droga, heck, even Trakanon's Teeth or Tenebrous Mountains until I was able to wipe everything out uncontested... But at the level those zones are intended for, they're crap. Stuff is hard to beat at those levels in most places, and the drops are pathetic (12 silver and a rusty dagger off a level 30 mob? sign me up!)<br />
<br />
It's the same arguments that were used for when Cazic-Thule was transformed. All the level 60's complained about there being nowhere to go aside from Sebilis, Velks, and Fungus Grove (After all, Siren's Grotto, Western Wastes, Akheva, Acrylia, Howling Stones, Skyfire,  Maiden's Eye, Umbral Plains, Katta, Plane of Growth hadn't been invented yet, or something), and nobody was using Cazic Thule, so it should be converted to a high-level dungeon... Which now sits empty.<br />
<br />
Folks, look at it like this... You're all going to cockblock the new zones by farming them for the first week all hoping to get your name on Allakhazam's attatched to every variation on Spiny weapons that drops. Then you're going to take your twinks through them to level, and post guides on how awesome the zones are. If you're 65, what do you need new zones for, EXCEPT item-farming and twink-leveling? More AA's to pull you that much closer to switching servers to Veeshan and trying to hook up with FoH or something? PoP is fine for AA. <br />

I still walk around the world from Steamfont to Odus occasionally just to feel the awe I felt when I first played in Beta. Getting more AAs, getting flags for more zones, killing x mob, and getting y loot -- they are prisons most people in the high end game constructed for themselves.

I for one don't mind exploring 35-60 zones, it'll be fun--solo exploring is always fun. Sure, I won't get any use from any of them in terms of AAs, but just the thrill of exploration is good enough for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't get it, do you? People are pissy because there are 200 people a night trying to cram their way into 6-7 camps in Valor, because EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREEN. New expansion is a perfect way to help solve this problem. What do we get instead? New zones for people who just want to level as quickly as possible so they too can languish in Valor LFG for 10 hours straight. There will be a flurry of activity as people explore the new zones. If they seem to be better than what's out there, everyone will go there instead of OT/DL...if not, they'll sit just as abandoned as most of kunark and the old world dungeons are.<br />
<br />
It amazes me how stupid the developers are. Do they not remember pre-kunark when every character who was 40+ was jammed into every corner of LGuk and SolB...waiting lists to get into a group could stretch for hours. I don't see why they would want to A) Recreate it, and then B) Perpetuate it. But that's what's happening.<br />
<br />
Plus, there is all this existing content that people go far out of their way to avoid. You'd think it would be easier to fix that than to add in more stuff. I appreciate all of the extra bonuses that will be in LoY...more bank space, more spells, armor dyes, guild tool, mapping...great! But rather than investing all the time required to make a new zone, how about going back and fixing the old ones instead? Lower the level of the dru/wiz Kunark portal spells by 10 levels or so...reduce the number of spellcasters (and especially shadowknights) by half in all of the empty goblin dungeons...upgrade the loot a hair, put in a (larger as appropriate) big ZEM. Fix pathing in such horror shows as mistmoore. Itemize some of the under-utilized hunting zones (like Seru...level 60 guards who drop RINGMAIL!?). So much they could do to spread people out and make the game enjoyable, and it would end up taking a lot less work than coming out with a whole new expansion. That then eliminates the need for more 35-50 crap. Put in more zones for the people who DESPERATELY need them - the 61-65 crowd.</div></div><hr />

- Of course the XP is way better in Tactics or Valor. And since Tactics is pretty much off limit of Average Joe, it leaves Valor as the best and easiest XP zone. So all Average Joe's are crammed into one single zone (Storm is avoided for mitigation issues). Just because a zone is blue, doesn't mean getting XP is efficient. Hell ... Sebilis reets/juggernauts are still blue ... but XP sucks major donkey balls.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the other hand, no level 60+ person should complain about this expansion/extension, call it what you want. EQ service is not paid by you, the 60+ crowd. EQ servers/service(or lack of) is paid by the Average Joe who is barely 45 in level and plays once ever few days. The below 60 crowd pays for you to be able to kill (insert dragon/god here), not the 60+ crowd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u81"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p81">The biggest problem is that yes, there are darkblues elsewhere, but none of them compare to PoV and are as easily accessable by the masses.  Even in PoN/PoD/PoI, the xp per mob is pityful compared to what you get in PoV for the risk.<br />
<br />
Imho the best thing VI could do is allow an additional xp modifier on mobs or regions of a zone, make things like Deep chardok (Dark blue to me at 65), Deep Sebilis (DB), and of course the higher mobs in PoD/PoN worthwhile to hunt for the 65 crowd that are not flagged for the likes of BoT/CoD/HoH.<br />
<br />
The only reason I step into PoN now is for spectral hunting groups, I simply don't bother with PoD unless I'm needed for Grummus and I miss PoI like hell, god I loved that zone, shame even the factory is crappy xp now.  If I have an hour or 2 free purely for getting a quick burst of xp, and theres no guildy groups going, I'll head straight for PoV.</div></div><hr />

Are you people so goddamn biased now that you let uber go to your heads? So shallow that only the MAX experience is good enough? They screwed up cazic, one of the best dungeons in EQ, ever, for the 3 year old characters, what about rerolls and true newbies again like me?<br />

Still can't get gator scale arms, shining metallic robes, etc legit with your own appropriate leveled character, because greedy sons of bitches are farming it 24/7.

I got an idea, how about restrict all players below 64 to newbie zones, oasis, dalnir, and lake of ill omen, make all other zones critter level 60 and up, bet people would bitch and cry then too. Disgusting.<br />

Listen to yourselves, you really do sound kind of spoiled. Playing a brand new toon untwinked really is no different then your level 65 mega-uber super hero, it is just a matter of perspective. You go to a challenging place, play above your ability, have fun. Oh wait, most people don't play above their ability, they min/max in safety.<br />

Forget about stupid tactics for a second. only one awesome exp spot in there anyway and if its taken there is nothing else to get decent exp from  in the zone.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have personally powered up in PoStorms. pulling mad exp from the desert. you can do an aa in a little over an hour.  The skeeters in  Disease are casters with no hp. you can bang them down fast and keep pulling more and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
And YES just becuase the zone is blue  it means you can pull down own experiance. Prepop my fav soloing spot was permafrost bearpit. i could kill a blue con bear in about a minute and change. each blue was 1% per kill.  figure in 30 blues an hour and you talking about a 3 hour AA solo in a PREKUNARK zone during luclin.<br />
<br />
When i see people say stuff like, &quot;well i cant find a group in valor guess ill log, see yas.&quot; i see someone who has given up. Even if the exp does suck in a zone, you are still getting  much better experiance than 0 which is what you get in Valor hoping someone will pick you like some virtual wallflower. <br />
<br />
Its really amazing to read so many posts from people who claim they are casual gamers and dole out sob stories about waiting for a group for the 2 or 3 hours they get to play a day. Heck i can get 2 AA in those 3 hours  in a NON UBER pop zone just by showing some BALLS and getting a group on my own .<br />

Principal races are Caucasoid, Mongoloid, and Negroid. <br />

Suicide bombing is seen by the Muslim world as a plausible option. When at a meeting in Malaysia last year, Israel was deemed a viable target.<br />
<br />
When a picture of a Palestinian baby, dressed in battle fatigues, and with two ammo belts made the circuit around the Middle East - the Israeli's were naturally quit upset.<br />
<br />
Want to know what the Palestinian Labor minister (Ghassan Khatib) said?<br />
<br />
&quot;The Army,&quot; he said, distributed the picture, &quot;to tell the world that the Palestinians are teaching their children to  HATE  Israel, and how to act against Israel -  and I just want to say that is correct.<br />
<br />
The Muslim religion is misogynistic to the extreme. Course ol Mohammed waited until his first OLDER wife died before he married a 6 year old.<br />

Tell me - what three things are the Arab worlds know for?<br />
<br />
1) Sand<br />
2) Oil<br />
3) Violence<br />

What do they produce? How many patents come from the collected Arab states? How many Nobel prizes have they won?<br />
<br />
This is a region where a 1937 picture of Franklin Delano Roosevelt incited recent riots in Tehran.<br />
<br />
This is a religion where last year in Nigeria, a newspaper comment that Mohammed would take one of the Miss World contestants as a bride caused riots and DEATHS.<br />
<br />
This is a religion where little girls are forced back into a burning building to be BURNED ALIVE rather than be seen in public without the &quot;proper clothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a religion with a HISTORY of violence against the United States and our people.<br />
<br />
Before you start that Euro-coffee-house-sycophant bullshet argument about &quot;American Nationalism / Imperialism&quot; being the cause of this violence you need a tall glass of latte S.T.F.U.<br />

Back to the violence.<br />
<br />
When in 1983 our Marines were blown up in Lebanon - who were the culprits?<br />
<br />
Male, militant Muslims between the ages of 18-40.<br />
<br />
When, in 1991 the WTC garage was attacked who were the culprits?<br />
<br />
Male, militant Muslims between the ages of 18-40.<br />
<br />
When in 1993 Khobar towers in Saudia Arabia was suicide bombed - who carried out this act against sleeping Air force types?<br />
<br />

But don't blithely dismiss Mills' claims because while he paints a wide swath he is not incorrect.  They are taught to hate Americans and they have carried out acts of terrorism against the United States on many occasions.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u98"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p98">Um it was not like he was unprovoked.  Doesnt matter but there are groups that will fundementally hate this expansion because it doesnt include them (mostly the 61+ crowd wah wah wah) and groups of people who like the new content and take it for what it is.  Mill had some great points but this pack of ravenous non sequiturs decided to attack the inflammatory parts of his posts to try to discredit him.  Any intellegent person should be able to see that.  Its sickening and it happens on this board every day by a certain group of players when opinions are posted, solid opinions mind you, that contradict thiers in some minor way.  But it is ok when these people come out of the woodwork I usually just leave the conversation like this one.  I mean how can you argue with a troll (web board version)?<br />
<br />
Edit: Since this is in the Grey I will post my opinions on the other stuff about handouts ect...  I am an Indian.  I was born and raised on the reservation and I am now back on the reservation trying to help my people.  There is no shame for saying the word Indian.  Indian did not come from the mistaken labeling of the peoples of the islands south of florida as East Indian but for the word In Dios, meaning with god.  <br />
<br />
To truely understand the poverty on most reservations you would have to go visit one.  True there are groups of surburban tribes that are making lots of money off of gambling but good for them.  There are lots of White and Black ect. people making money off of advantages they have.  The majority of the Indian population of this country is in poverty.  I know because I lived along side it for the majority of my young life.  It not only opened my eyes to the obvious gap placed between my peoples culture and the outside world.  It is a combination of isolationism and, for lack of a better word, ignorism by the outside world.  <br />
<br />
I went through school on my own merit.  I didnt use affirmative action but I know people that did and they made it through, with honors, in a university that they would have otherwise not been able to enter.  This idea of hand outs is a label placed on such programs to take away from the good they have done.  How do you raise the level of awareness and need to change whithin a community?  Well by sending back educated individuals that can help bridge the gap.  So GW can kiss my ass with his quota labeling.  But I wouldnt expect less from a republican.</div></div><hr />

And to the &quot;obvious gap placed between my peoples culture and the outside world.&quot;  ... that is the unfortune battle cry across the ages of every culture against any others.    Every race can and sadly DOES say the same thing ... time and time again.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u102"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p102">I'm not going to rant here, but the root of a lot of Muslim hatred for Christians is due to the actions of the Western Europeans during the Crusades.  Before the crusades, Islam respected and tolerated all religions.  <br />
<br />
During the first crusade, the mostly British and French soldiers captured Jerusalem.  As part of the surrender negotiations, the mostly Muslim residents of the city agreed to give up the city, if they and their families were allowed to leave for other lands.  As they were leaving, chaos broke out and the Christians ended up slaughtering the entire city.  Every single person in the city.  This included the sizeable Jewish and Arab Christian populations living in Jerusalem.  <br />
<br />
There are many other examples of Christian intolerance towards Islam during the period of the crusades.  The Europeans did a fine job of teaching intolerance, and although it was a long time ago, and is unfair to hold people living today responsible for actions of their long-ago ancestors, religion has a long memory.</div></div><hr />

There is so much regurgative conservatism in your post I am having problems holding the phlegm inside my throat and off the computer screen.  Have you ever been to a reservation?  Go visit one of the poverty stricken reservations sometime (Navajo or some in Oklahoma).  Its a 3rd world country in the middle of the US.  Also brush up on your history on Inians.  Isolationism and Ignorism are two major themes along that line... well other than death.  But yes I wouldnt expect less from what is an obvious ignorant city dweller.  There are gaps whether you choose to ignore it or not they exist.  Now the validity of your &quot;across every culture in the world&quot; is unknown to me.  But my first instict says that is a bit of a stretch.  2000 Census data on this hasnt been released yet but 1990 Persons in poverty % - 13.1 for Total US 31.2 for American Indian. I am done here now.</div></div><hr />

Yup, there's need for more content in the 63 - 65 range. I dunno about your server, but Saryrn still has a crapload more 40 - 60 people than it does 63 - 65... I guess when the majority of the players in EQ are crammed into one space like they were in the original game (don't give me that crap about Kunark, there was plenty of elbow room, you just didn't use it), then they'll expand that portion of the game. In the meanwhile, though, they're going to shell out to who holds the majority; the people in the 35 - 60 range. <br />
<br />
Would you be be moaning and crying about this expansion if there were no new zones coming out with it? No, you'd be happy to see a new race, more bank space, in-game maps, and what's potentially a way to keep ypu from looking like the halequin shaman that we all wind up looking like. But there's content coming out that doesn't serve you, in addition to all that, so that makes it the worst thing you've ever seen.  That's exactly like a newbie bitching about being unable to use PoP zones, despite the mass transit and damn nice quests / tradeskill ease that he COULD use with it.</div></div><hr />

I think you took me wrong ... I wasn't offering anything in way against the American Indian.   No ... my family doesn't live on a reservation ... they have been off a long time now.   I was trying to make the point that this is a age old story ... of one group pointing that another is ruling over them.   And American Indians don't have a lock on that subject ... sorry to say but it's been going on for thousands of years.<br />
<br />
But sadly ... what's really at issue is the gap placed between peoples culture.   This thread has broken down into this gap.   People have taken off into a slandering anyone that has issues with Mill.  Plus marching off into the whole Arab tension issues ... so you want to talk about culture ... there it is ... one culture against the other.   It's all about the gap between them ... and to some that post here  ... the gap is HUGE.<br />
<br />
I said that the race card is a unsettling and divisionary.  It causes people to label others as &quot;regurgative conservatism &quot;  or &quot;obvious ignorant city dweller's&quot;.   Or worse labeling others because they don't agree with you as  &quot;Let me gues too, Boing, gart, and darling guy, you are probably the people you see on the news everyday with signs saying &quot;America is the root of all evil&quot; and crap like that. Spitting on soldiers, etc. &quot;  What you can't discuss with logic has to become a insult ... why offer anything of value when you can demean someone?<br />
<br />
How about the following example of demeaning ... or hatemongering ...  &quot;This board is full of people with 0 sense of humor, if an Arab joke offends them. Move to Iraq you goddamn traitors. &quot;   You don't like Mill's jokes ... move to Irag ... some regurgative conservatism would come in handy about now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">And on the other hand... who is to say they won't continue to pop out quick expansions like this, possibly even with stuff geared to our level?   Would be nice to see them illustrating new storylines for us via new material instead of the oh-so-hated/screwed up GM events (where the highest level guild with most mobilization runs in and kills everything for the loot before finding out which ones they are supposed to kill, if any....)<br />
<br />
<br />
  I would love it if they made more progressive quests, like increasing thurg shawls to 10, making a new jewelry quest akin to Vervacity etc.   Or if they dropped more hints for/fixed PoM quests....   Revamp more zones to be higher level like CT and stuff like that would be nice too.<br />
<br />
<br />
  But really, when you look at stats on the Elemental plane armor, it becomes pretty apparant further expanding the &quot;top&quot; of the game isn't a likely option....  You can't go much higher than all that without eventually getting quite ridiculous.   At the point they start hitting 4 digit stats on items we know things are WAY out of hand....</div></div><hr />

It's ONE friggin' expansion people, and it's being released less than 6 months after the last expansion.  It seems to be focused on 35-60 level players.  Great..there are alot of players who are bored from 50-60 cause the ubers call them n00bs even though they've been playing the game for 3 years and just don't have 40 hours a week to play it and disparage them saying no one is going to care about mid-range content, give us more uber content.  What about the casual players..people who don't have the time to camp a mob for days straight to get a drop or to spend 10 hours at a stretch grinding xp.  What about people who have families and jobs and are lucky if they get an hour a night to play a game they enjoy.  Are they less deserving of something new and different after they've spent months getting 1 or 2 levels in the same 3 or 4 zones?<br />
<br />
Grow up and get over it.  Not EVERY expansion is gonna have more stuff specifically targeted for the 60+ powergamers.  PoP didn't have jack-squat in terms of &quot;content&quot; directed at the sub 60's either.  I'm fairly confident in saying that whatever comes after LoY will probly be targeted right back at you Ub00rs again leaving us &quot;n00bs&quot; who are working our way through the 50's buying another expansion and saying &quot;well, someday I might be able to use those zones&quot;..<br />
