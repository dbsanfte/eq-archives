<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’ve been trying to keep my offensive and defensive skills maxed as I advance in level, but the game doesn’t seem to want to let me.  When I leveled my ranger, my max combat skills were the same as my other skills, but that doesn’t seem to be the case with my shaman. At level 31 my evocation and meditation skills were at 160, but my offensive and defensive skills would not pass 155.  I noticed they were five points below my other skills for the two levels before that.  And at level 32 they started rising again but they’ve stopped at 160.  Is this the way these skills are supposed to behave?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spell skills    (Level * 5) + 5<br />
Offense/Defense  (Level * 5)<br />
Weapons Skills  (Level * 4) + 4<br />
<br />
Thus at level 31 your spells should be 31*5+5 = 160 and you offense/defense should be 31*5 = 155.<br />
<br />
So everything if normal :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks.  I was getting a bit worried that my kitty might be a bit combat challenged.  Its good to know that he’s normal.  Well, as normal as a mace wielding cat can be.  :D</div></div><hr />

P.S. Iksar and Kitty would be unknown variables in this equation - they don't have &quot;fingers&quot; in the conventional sense, so they culturally never created mathematics in the large-race style. ;)</div></div><hr />
