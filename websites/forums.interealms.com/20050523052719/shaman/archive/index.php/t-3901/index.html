<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just want to make sure this is a good idea.  I'm pretty sure it is, but it's hard to part with that thing.<br />
<br />
Someone is working on rounding up Pox, Tigir's, Malo, and Torpor in exchange for my Fungi.  Seems like with Torpor, the fungi would be much less essential, so the deal makes sense to me.<br />
<br />
Also, assuming I do it, any suggestions on a BP in toe 20k-ish range?  Here's my magelo profile (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=39867), although magelo seems to be down for me atm.<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think about this. <br />
<br />
How many times have you seen a fungi for sale?<br />
<br />
How many times have you seen malo, torpor, pox, and tigirs for sale?<br />
<br />
I don't think any more needs to be said, personally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh...  That's a good way to look at it.  I've personally seen Tigir's once, for 20k and Malo once, for 25k.  Thit's it for all of those spells, ever.  Fungis are pretty common, relatively.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Ig you get all those, it might be a good bargain.  I saw a shammy earlier on the board who traded his just for a Torpor.  Can't say I think much of that trade, but Malo and Torpor with Tigger's and Pox thrown in for the rare times you use tham ain't bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Armageddon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">- Torpor is game redefining.<br />
<br />
- Malo is close, and also very rare.<br />
<br />
- Pox is a nice spell for soloing, with the new efficiency and extended focus items, dots become extremely effective.<br />
<br />
- Tigirs I have found to be really situational, with only 8 slots, I never have it up, and I usually can't get it loaded when I need it.  However, for ae groups, and doing some of deeper chardok, it has some decent applications.  It's also far more common than the others, if you ask me.  Killing juggs seems to be a viable spot to get it.<br />
<br />
These four for a fungi tunic?  Easily worth it if you ask me.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, I'm the shaman ( or one of them ) that traded his fungi just for torpor. Maybe it wasn't such a great trade... but I got Torpor 4 days after turning 60, not 4 months. Not bad for a guildless oracle. <br />
<br />
If you just save your coppers long enough, you'll eventually get enough cash to buy a fungi - and there are plenty of fungis on the market. Cash = fungi = cash. <br />
<br />
Because Torpor ( and to a lesser extent the other spells ) is so rare and inherently non-reusable that it is fundamentally different. Sometimes you can't buy them for ANY amount of money. They just don't exist in the economy. So if you have an opportunity to acquire them, just showing plat isn't going to be enough to pry the item from the guild who has the spell. So trade what you can.<br />
<br />
Of course, one's circumstances may vary. If you kill dragons regularly and have just been unlucky, perhaps you should just wait and see. If you are small guild/guildless, do whatever you can to get Torpor. It's that good. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Trading your fungi for torpor is an EXCELLENT trade, unless you happen to have manaburn or belong to a guild that does VP regularly.  *chirp* *chirp*<br />
<br />
Trading your fungi for all the spells you listed is an UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sounds to me like you're getting the better end of the deal, some do a straight up trade Torpor for Fungi, but you're getting a whole package ! <br />
Tigirs<br />
Malo<br />
Torpor<br />
Pox<br />
You're getting the better end of the deal.......as Torpor makes a Fungi, obsolete (so I'm told). <br />
You're set, so go for it !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fungi = 60-70k<br />

<br />
So all told .... 130-170k &gt; 60-70k ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If it weren't for the fact that I'd lose the fungi in the process, I'd be tempted to switch servers to make a deal like that....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm on vazaelle with kamidari. /wave  fungi's sell at a standard rate of 80k on our server.  Since the market channel sees people spamming WTB Fungi 80k, everyone who is selling them demands 80k as well, and they usually get it.<br />
<br />
I personally think the trade is worth it, however, how are you going to find a person who has all four spells?  Would they want to trade a fungi for them? let's do some math:<br />
<br />
30k for torpor<br />
30k for malo<br />
10k for tigir's<br />
10k for pox<br />
-----------------<br />
80k for spells<br />
<br />
You could add these up pretty much anyway you wanted I suppose.  The point is it might be best to bank the 80k and have the money ready for that one person who has malo/torpor etc. I don't think your guild does a lot of kunark dragons (mine doesn't either) so maybe find out who our local manaburn group is and tell them you'll pay 20k for spell X when it drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">that trade is insane, i happily traded my fungi for just torpor, and fungi sells for 110k on sullon without much trouble at all, heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/wave Gooch<br />
<br />
Well, that's just the thing...  someone talked to me last night saying they think they can get them all if I'm willing to do the trade.  I guess time will tell.   :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I would make that trade in a heartbeat. I dont even use my fungi tunic anymore except for powerleveling twinks and stuff. Or for easy camps i toss it on the warrior for the regen. <br />
<br />
On a side note, it is interesting to see the prices for spells on other servers. On Drinal, its Torpor that commands the huge pricetag of 70-100k area. Malo usually can be had for 24k or so. Tigirs and Pox i dunno because I rarely see them for sale, and rarely see them being searched for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">On the usefulness of tigir: I keep it up in certain places and situations when I know multiple mobs will be incoming frequently. I use it quite often when my overzealous rogue brother goes out to pull in fg. I use it frequently also in ct when I know we'll be getting three or more mobs on a regular basis. I usually will lay one on a group of three or more mobs as they come in to spare the enchanter aggro and/or enough time to get the extras mezzed. It's fairly frequently resisted, but I still have a better level of survivability than most chanters so /shrug. The only times I've been killed because I got aggro from tigir were the times the whole group was headed for a wipeout anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>jsmaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My GOD...<br />
<br />
A fungi for tigirs, poxx, malo and torpor?<br />
<br />
On EMarr torpor or malo sell for more than twice a fungi's worth.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">doooooooooo iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiitttttttttttttt</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Trading just a fungi for torpor is a sweet deal..<br />
<br />
Torpor = better then any single(or hell multiple) item(s) all put together.<br />
<br />
If I didnt have torpor yet.. I would strip myself of everything tradeable to get torpor, I would empty my guilds coffers, and offer myself on a Freeport streetcorner for tricks. Torpor = your god.. bow to it.. worship it.. thank it daily for its presence in your life.<br />
<br />
Fungi.. pfft.. its junk next to torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>eamonn1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hiya Kamidara<br />
<br />
                       I dont know what level you are but at 60 Tprpor and Malo are class defining.However both are (relatively) easy to get.Malo is a frequent drop from the Emperor in Seb and I have had Torpor drop from a GW in Sykfire and from Sev.Sev is a part of the warrior epic and I often get tells asking for help with it.Guardian Wurms in SF are not difficult either (require a tank,shammy, and 2 clerics or a group with back up healers and non uber gear.<br />
<br />
                       My point is that the outrageous prices being charged for shammy spells are if anything an incentive to go camp them.The mobs that drop them are not difficult enough to justify the prices demanded.<br />
<br />
                                          The final part of the triumverate that defines a 60 shammy is canni 5.When it comes to gaining the requisite aa points to attain canni 5 a Fungi Tunic is invaluable.<br />
<br />
          Thus I would not countenance the surrender of a Fungi Tunic for the spells.<br />
<br />
    Best Wishes<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">malo a common drop of Emp in Seb? man you gotta be lucky or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">One point I dont think has been raised yet is that it appears Kamidari is already 60, so the benefits of Topor will be instantly apparent...oh yeah, its an awesome deal man....hope it gos through for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Traded fungi plus 50k for my torpor spell ONLY, back when fungis were worth only 35k on my server, for 85k value for torpor.  Which sold for 100k at the time, so I came out 15k ahead.<br />
<br />
Have NEVER missed fungi on my ogre with torpor.  Later bought another fungi and put it on my monk.  Never tempted at all to put it on the shaman.<br />
<br />
I'd do those trades in a heartbeat and be thrilled to death.  Any one of those spells is MUCH rarer than fungi; torpor is easily worth anything you own and your most personally valuable spell; malo is the most valuable for your guild and for raids(and can even make the difference to whether you are invited to either); all 4 spells together, for a fungi you won't even need with torpor?  Go for it.<br />
<br />
By the way, on my server torpor is still up to 100k, malo is anywhere from 40-100k depending almost entirely on your luck, tigirs is anywhere from 20 to 50k, poxx is 20-40k.  ALL of them are virtually impossible to find, and you may spend months looking for them.  Took my me months to find torpor, and took someone I know quite a few months to buy malo, and he was offering 100k.</div></div><hr />
