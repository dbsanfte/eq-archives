<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Me (55 shammy) and Bidaum (55 warrior) decided to try these guys out. We came in from the DP side. The outside guards were dub, and one of them was red, so we didn't try them. Inside, there's two guards, equipping sword and shield. We called them Sonny and Cher.<br />
<br />
First time, they aggroed us, so we zoned. Second time, we went in invis. I rooted Sonny and managed to slow both of them, but Sonny kept breaking my root and had me beat down to the point where I had to zone or die, so I zoned. They both hit in the 140s.<br />
<br />
Third time, after I rooted Sonny, I malosi'd him, and root held long enough for me to summon dogdog to help Bid with Cher. They finally scrotted Cher and Sonny fell afterwards. We were afraid they'd be pallys and LoH themselves, but they didn't.<br />
<br />
They dropped no rent sword and shield. I didn't know what they were for. I bent down to take a SS, then got aggroed by a gnome. He triple hit for 175. I managed to zone with a sliver of health left.<br />
<br />
Sonny and Cher had about 6 faction hits, but as far as I could tell they were all Seru related. 2 went down, 4 went up.<br />
<br />
Anybody else tried these guards? Was it worth your time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Hizzter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd be interested to hear any information about Seru guards as well.<br />
<br />
My necro partner and I have bottomed out our Katta faction by killing Katta guards near TS zone.  My partner had heard from another necro that Seru guards had higher MR, more HP, and were harder to get singly even at 60.  Can anyone confirm?<br />
<br />
If not, my partner and I should try it out....maybe we can repair our Katta factions that way ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes I soloed them a few times out in the actual city. They are pretty easy once you hit them with a Malx. They give great XP and usually drop really good cash. It is also easy to pull singles out in the city away from the entry hall.<br />
<br />
The only problem was that Sancti Seru has HUGE pathing and warping problems. More then a few times a guard would walk into a wall and disappear or they would suddenly run off in a random direction.<br />
<br />
The pathing problems might have been fixed in one of the recent patches, but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Epyx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The best xp spot is the walkway around the city. You can enter it as you walk into the city proper...to each side you will see a small raised platform with a floating square glass section. Clicking on this glass will teleport you to the walkway around the city. <br />
<br />
All gaurds here are blue to 60 and while tougher than Katta gaurds are about par with Gorangas/Toilers imo. All are slowable/rootable and can drop up to 24pp each. All in all a great spot to duo as you can make good xp and money. Shaman/Melee (of course) and Shaman/Necro work great here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What I'd like to know is how I became non-KoS in this city.  I went in the day that SoL was released and had some mob aggro me out of nowhere and beat me down.  I went in last week and everything was either dubious or amiable.  Seems to be at least two factions in the city, and probably several more.  My guess is that hunting in Griegs's raised my faction, but I wasn't paying attention closely enough to say for sure.  Honestly, the names in Luclin and which are the good/bad guys still confuses me.  Marus, Sanctus, Seru, etc.  I'm not sure which is which.  Does killing the guards in Sanctus Seru affect negatively my faction in any other zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are two factions in Seru. There is &quot;Heart of Seru&quot; and &quot;Hand of Seru&quot;. Generally most people are Non-KOS to Heart of Seru. I am not sure of the generality of KOS to Hand of Seru, but I know Ogres are KOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">no there are at LEAST 4 different factions in seru. Heart, Hand, Eye, Shoulders and one more I belive. I am max ally to all but one of them...everytime I turn around I got some worthless gnome quadding me for 200.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is that the Gnome in the near left corner after you enter the city? If so, man he was an easy kill. In general all the damn guards here were easy as hell with the root rot method.<br />
<br />
I even got so bold as to pull from between buildings, but that bit me in the butt with the pathing issuses. I would have loved to pull from the buildings as well. Maybe some day they will fix this zone.<br />
<br />
Pulling in this area is great as well since the 51+ mobs do no summon. It makes things a snap.<br />
<br />
Now that you mention it Krak, I remember the Eye faction, but I do not recall the Shoulder faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">of course the walkway around the city is camped exclusivley now for VT shards =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gaeadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Greig has a big +SS (all factions) hit, with no negatives if i remember correctly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Did the walkway guards with a 60 monk friend for awhile.  <br />
<br />
The exp is absolute crap like all other luclin exp.  I was running about a blue an hour in kunark, on these guards i was running about a blue every 2 hours or so.  The exp itself on em sucks, plus it takes too long to kill them as they have too many hp's, plus they hit too hard to be worth it.<br />
<br />
Only reason to fight em in my experience is for the faction hits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There are 6 Seru factions.<br />
<br />
Hand of Seru<br />
Heart of Seru<br />
Eye of Seru<br />
Shoulders of Seru<br />
Hand Legionnaries<br />
Seru</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm, your prejudice against Luclin renders the rest of your observations highly suspect, to say the very least.<br />
<br />
Paludal caverns, Marus Seru, and Dawnshroud are absolutely fantastic experience from the teens to the mid-40's.  Toilers in Maidens are very good experience, and so are shrooms in FG. <br />
<br />
The optio's in Seru are definitely a pain.  They are unslowable, and hit for solid numbers.  If I remember, my shaman couldn't root them, either.</div></div><hr />
