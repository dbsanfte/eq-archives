<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ivloney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">From the Dawnshroud zone in I went and explored the first few rooms. I could not see any real safe places to set up camp with out getting more then 3-4 mobs to aggro on me. I found one room with only two mobs in it and I set up camp in one of the corners. Got doggy and set out my line of spells. Each mob took like 10-15 minutes to kill and was giving me 2% exp aa's. The were caster mobs had alot of hp's but did not resist one of my spells. Malo, bane, pox, and spear were what my line was. like 2pox and 3-4 banes used spear for finally. Dreamweavers there are two types one is 50 and one is 53-54 but both are fairly easy with malo and torpor. There is a soldier of madness that sometimes pops in the midle of the room so you have to be on your toes for him he is lvl 54. Was not the best or worst exp but I did manage to have the entire zone to myself the whole time. This is mostly good for a person with only a couple hours to kill. Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />
