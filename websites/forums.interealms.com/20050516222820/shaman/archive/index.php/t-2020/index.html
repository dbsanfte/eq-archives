<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I searched for this info in older posts and found some info I'm skeptical of.  People say that the fastest buyable horse has a %70 speed increase, and that scale of wolf also maxes at a %70 speed increase.<br />
<br />
I'm lvl 60 though, and i've been running with scale and had horses go burning past me.   I realize it's possible every time that happened it was either a paladin's horse or one of the super-fast lootable bridle's.<br />
<br />
Is the chain bridle really only equal in speed to scale at lvl 60?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />

I heard before some pally almost got banned because a GM didnt have his horse animations on so he just saw the guy running by at ungodly speeds and assumed he was hacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know about absolute performance numbers, but I know that my brother has a chain bridle horse- and when I tried following him (with just SoW not Scale, and at 51 not 60) he was so much faster than me that it was literally embarassing.  I had to keep asking him to stop because I lost him- and it wasn't a matter of him slowly pulling away.  He was there one second, just a couple pixels the next second, then gone a moment later.<br />

Chain horses are very very fast once they get going.</div></div><hr />

Spirit of the Wolf stops getting faster at level 50.</div></div><hr />
