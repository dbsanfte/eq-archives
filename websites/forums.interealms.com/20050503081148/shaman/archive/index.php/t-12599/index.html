<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am still waiting to get my epic spear and can't wait to show off my glowing spear when I get it.  However, there is no longer a glow around the spear.  Friend of mine just got his and it now looks like your average dull spear with the feathers on it.  So why the change?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Because you turned particles off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Because you turned particles off.<br />
<br />
or set to medium/low , it only shows up if its on high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bug with the game; some people were logging in to find other particles and/or spells turned off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Also...particle weapons (epics..soulfire..) are classified under Other particles from the display menu.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">And one last tip, if you had your particles off and then turn them on, the effect still wont show until the person re-equips the spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When was the proc made from lure to regular magic resist check?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Always been checked against MR as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">always been MR, but used to be, if you could land an MR based spell on a creature at all, you could land curse of spirits on it np.  Now it resists on average for MR based spells afaik.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I believe splurt type spells have a hidden lure modifier(~-100) that doesnt show on pages like lucy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since it doesn't do an initial dmg it is resisted less than other MR spells, but still resisted more than when it first came out from what I used to read on this board.  Used to be would only resist on mobs that were 100% MR resistant from what people used to say.</div></div><hr />

... or zones.</div></div><hr />

Off topic.  What does afaik mean?  On a similar note, I have also seen iirc and am unclear on that one also.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

If I recall correctly<br />
<br />
For the lazy typists.  An no the spear has never been lure, and it still resists the same as always. I landed it on Lhranc just fine the other day to prove a point that he was soloable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its not exactly lure, in that wizard lure spells have a -300 resist modifier. I would say the resist modifier on epic is around -50 to -100 after testing root on myself and epic on myself with different magic resists.<br />
