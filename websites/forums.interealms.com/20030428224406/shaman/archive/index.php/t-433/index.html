<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok first of all, I know this might sound lame to some of you. In that case, dont do anything. Dont get offended or consder this spam. Dont flame me for being lame. I just thought that this would be  a great way to show what an strong online community can do. I saw someone doing similar thing at the Monkly business and at least there people didnt were glad to help, so I decided to give it a go here. However if you think that this is a no no, Sunmoon or Thantu, please delete this post.<br />
<br />
 Some backround info:<br />
<br />
A week ago my little brother and his friend took part in an Finnish Television show called Far Out. The format of the show might be familiar to you by some other name, at least I know that it's shown in other countries too. <br />
<br />
 Every week 4 pairs take part in this show and based on the studio audience votes one of these pairs wins a trip to some european country. On their travels they need to perform some silly tasks like playing rugby in Poland, selling ice to eskimoes, guiding japanese tourists in an unknown city and so on. These tasks are videoed and shown in next week's program. <br />
 All the time there's 2 competing pairs out there travelling, and based on these video's, their travel reports and audience votes people can vote which of these 2 pairs will continue travelling to some other city and do something different, and which one returns back to Finland with a comfortation price.<br />
In best case people have spent 4 months travelling around europe for free and had some fun on the way too, and that's what I would like for my brother too.<br />
 <br />
 Now my brother and his friend won last week and at the moment they are in Bristol where they need to do a Robin Hood'ish deed, and take part in Rugby game. The other pair is Paris at the Asterix park doing something different.<br />
  I have mobilzed everyone at my work, everyone I know, and everyone at my friend's jobs, and my whole guild, to vote for my brother and his friend so they could continue travelling and having fun. I was thinking that it wouldnt be THAT lame to ask help from this board too. Afterall what are communities for? <br />
<br />
 Soo... I'm asking all of you who sit at their works bored and thinking about which website to go next, to go to  *THIS*  (http://www.mtv3.fi/farout/) Web address, and vote for my brother and his friend. <br />
Of course this site is written in Finnish, so I'll add a  picture so you know were to click.  The idea is that the audience can decide which pair will be dropped out from the competition and sent back to home, and who gets to go on travelling for free. So please drop (pudota in Finnish) &quot;Antti &amp; Jaakko&quot; so my brother (Juho) and his friend (Eetu) can keep going. It's their first week so you can see that they are left a bit behind on votes already... (atm 64% would drop them before even seeing them. It's all about who can get most people to vote themselves... which brings me to here)<br />

<br />
Thanks if you bothered to use that second to vote, and thanks for reading this anyway. Thanks in advance for all the flames too.  I know I deserve some:)<br />
 If all goes well I'll tell what happened after the next Friday's show.</div></div><hr />

Do yourself a favor, post this also on Monkly-Business.  Just like here that's an amazing community.  I remember the poll you're talking about that we helped rig on MB.  If anyone can do it it's the combo of this board and MB.  So hurry and post it on there and we're good to go.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Wow thanks guys! remember this is just the first round, they havent even been in Tv more than the presentation. I'm really hoping they'd do ok, but there's some bad rumours in the air about this whole thing being arranged in advance by the Tv company that produces it...   Most of the votes are coming in Friday when they air the show, so lets all wish them good luck and keep the votes coming until that:)<br />
<br />
 And wow, Daek... Havent heard of you in a while! You still play at all? Or only DaoC?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Delirios</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Well the competition was tight, over 5 thousand votes were given, but my brother and his friend won! <br />
 So now they are going towards Andorra and another challenges. If you wish to see what they are up to, you can see the videos they made in bristol by clicking the &quot;Eetu &amp; Juho&quot; link, and then following the link that says &quot;Videot&quot;. I must say that you might need a Finnish sense of humour to understand them... <br />
The competition was very tight by the way, the result was 49/ 51% for my brother and his friend so I have to thank you all for voting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And to answer your earlier question. (I couldn't find the thread in the general forum, took me awhile to work out where it was) I play EQ and DAoC at the moment. I came back from DAoC for awhile, then about 2 weeks ago I went back to check on friends(most of them had ebayed lol), and made a twink, which I play on Lancelot/Midgard. EQ Grizzli is my main, though I think my guild would prefer I played my cleric. ;) I feel alot of pressure to stick with my cleric, especially for ToV, where we need a couple good clerics.</div></div><hr />
