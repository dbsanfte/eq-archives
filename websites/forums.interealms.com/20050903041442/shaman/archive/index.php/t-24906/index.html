<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So I FINALLY DL the game.  <br />
<br />
Make my Troll (Regen) Hunter (Track AND Pet), and go to town. (Literally).<br />
<br />
The interface is pretty intuitive.  Questgivers are easy to identify.<br />
<br />
I was level 2 before I discovered I had a bow.<br />
<br />
Do I have a clue what I'm doing? NO !<br />
<br />
Am I lost? YES !<br />
<br />
Am I having FUN?  Y - E - S.<br />
<br />
Lag, crashing, who cares? F-U-N!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow is the most fun i've had in a while. I keep pressing eq keys (i for inventory etc..) then finally working out that its a different key press, but this is more fun than i've had in eq for probably the last couple of years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I ADORE the WoW UI.  Now that I can play WoW and EQ2 in alternation it just reinforces <br />
<br />
1)  how easy it is to manipulate my character, inventory, equipment.<br />
<br />
2)  how easy it is to interact with the world - trading with characters, dealing with vendors.<br />
<br />
3)  how very very NON frustrating WoW is, particularly compared with EQ2.  <br />
<br />
EQ always has and always will make me want to scream in frustration on a regular basis, for all the fun I have with things go right.  WoW simply seems to be all the fun without all the BS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I would like to welcome you and um also.....It like doing heroin. Once you pop the fun don't stop. You are hopelessly addicted to this game now :P So are we :P<br />
<br />
It's over man :)<br />
<br />
The game is indeed amazing but one problem I have is only one toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Now i know i can switch but i am more a mouse person than a keyboard person. As the levels go buy you get spells and abilities that HAVE to be there all the time as well as potions and other special items. Like sleeping powder. I heard cosmos can do it but i'd rather not get frowned upon by others for using it. They should add an extra toolbar. Other than that the UI rocks. <br />

<br />
There are other UI mods.<br />
download: http://wow.warcraftstrategy.com/ctmod/<br />
comparison: http://wow.warcraftstrategy.com/forum/showthread.php?t=5240<br />
<br />
I haven't tried it yet, so I can't give you a thumbs up or down.<br />
<br />
Also, why would you get frowned upon, and how would anyone know?<br />
<br />
edit:  fyi, I am not sure what all Cosmos does to WoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been staying away from mods until retail.  On the off chance Blizzard disallows their use (which seems HIGHLY unlikely at this point - in fact they should be allowing open UI modding much like EQ did when they revamped theirs.  however I do know they had very specific concerns about certain &quot;features.&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Anyone know how to add an extra chat window?  And how to separate the ones that are already there (they are 'stacked' currently).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">just got in last night, and am amazed and pleasantly surprised so far..... it was a breeze to get into, and the combat and quest systems are very well done. lvled my tauren shaman to 10 in a cpl hours and haven't really tried any other races/classes yet. <br />
<br />
I think this is gonna do it for me :)<br />
<br />
.. about the chat windows Snap.... just click on the window name/tab and drag it to where you want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You can't resize the general chat window or move it, but you can drag the other windows and shrink/expand them.<br />
<br />
One thing to remember is that when you create a new chat, it seems to inherit the settings of the general tab.  You'll have two windows spewing the same stuff to you, so you'll need to click off what you don't want in each general and the new window.<br />
<br />
I wish they had at least one smaller font point size than they do.  I'd like the shrink the windows even further.<br />
<br />
I also want to be able to move the spell casting bar somewhere else.   I assume I can do this with a custom ui mod but I haven't looked into those yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kykha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You can't resize the general chat window or move it, but you can drag the other windows and shrink/expand them.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can.  You have to click on the tab where 'General' is written and click Unlock window.  After that you can move it and resize it.  <br />
<br />
You can also adjust the font, the lowest you can have is 12 pt though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thank yu Turc. I downloaded Ct mod cause I could not find a proper Cosmos download. (non alpha link is broken even on official site).<br />
But i am SOOOo happy. No more waitign for quest text to appear. No more 1 action bar i got 4 now. <br />
<br />
HAPPY HAPPY HAPPY my gaming experience just got 100x better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks man.<br />
<br />
PPL check out CTmod it's amazing. You will never go back to the old interface.<br />
