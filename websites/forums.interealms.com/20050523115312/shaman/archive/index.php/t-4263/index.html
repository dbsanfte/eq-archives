<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Huggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well My shammy is lvl 32 atm, and is pretty twinked out..not big stuff, though, I have a lvl 60 monk OR a 46 druid to plvl is to 50 asap, can anyone give me a guild line or a tips or anything which i can zoom really quick to 50 so i can duo with my 60 monk?.<br />
thanks in advance</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">32 -Con a MOB with your Shaman. White or Blue have Monk beat it down then FD.<br />
<br />
33 - 50 Repeat on blues.<br />
<br />
Realize at 40 you can group with your Monk and both get exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Huggie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice tips but do u know any good places? im doing it in Dawnshroud on Large Zelniaks since there white or higher cons to my sham but they only give 2% xp, which is half a blue per mob, any place better? with alot more mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorg Grimm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If u wanna avoid crowds and u actually have a monk then do Kaesora zone area(using the zone in to zone out circle falling to the 2nd level) through level 40.  At level 40 switch to City of Mist temple area.  Only do these 2 if u have a monk though.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">CoM all the way.<br />
<br />
once hes 40, just group and kill greenies(dblue for him of course).  Droga is good for this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Anithar AnachroniX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Might sound a bit strange... but if u can land the camp, (and have a monk to duo with)... I suggest Geo's in CC. (under ice orc camp in EW)<br />
<br />
Basically how it started was we wanted something 'different' from Kunark. I wasn't twinked too much either was the monk. Buff monk, slow Geo and u can run through them pretty quick.<br />
<br />
I started this around late 30's if i recall correctly. Thing of it is it's pretty nice cash, and they are really easy to single and take down quick. Awesome Exp as well. We were both ikky's and stayed there til bout 45ish and moved to CoM.<br />
<br />
You'll kill them so quick once u get it down they won't pop for 2 seconds before ur on them and you will have them to yourself, (hard for someone to try and take em from ya as well)... just gotta make the first run quick. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shoot, once you hit 40 go to Kedge.<br />
<br />
You can EB the both of you, throw a regen on him and sit back as he rips through MOBs like no tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Figure 2 rotations of the zone in 6 MOB + the two Pirahna's at bottom of first spiral plus the roamers on that level. (Per yellow at 40)<br />
<br />
Hell, you'll kill so fast you'll be waiting on respawn.<br />
<br />
Oh and make DS potions for him. Because of his level, they're much more devastating.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the druid I'd look at going to the sol a/b zone (sol b side).. pull them and use druid DS to do the damage.. the shammy just needs to do some damage to ensure xp.. The zone is just a few steps away.<br />
<br />
once at 40 I'd partner with the monk in Fungus Grove, KC, Permafrost basement (all those bears near vox's lair), solb still (FGs and imps) as these have low HP compared to kunark/velious mobs - that monk will rip them to shreads even faster with the shm buffs.<br />
<br />
Permafrost basement is easy as a) the shm can gate out and the monk can FD/run through vox's lair.. they've fixed the giants now as they used to cast ice comet once agroed - even when you where at the zone.. If vox is up the monk'd transport to zone is even quicker :)<br />
<br />
The kedge suggestion is a blinder :) kedge mobs have low hp and the zone is not overly camped on Tunare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">PL'ed my Ranger from 39-45 in Kedge using a Fungal, Faern DS potions and a 53 Cleric. <br />
<br />
Oh when the fish at entry start turning green / light Blue...<br />
<br />
time to head to Bloodgill Gobbos in LoIO. You have two choices, do the rotation and run around the dome, or stand in one spot and pull from the three statics floating up and above.<br />
<br />
Monk will continue to tear throught them like Oprah eating Chocolate Chips, only now the Shaman can do some serious contributing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">erm ???  why is someone with a lvl 60 monk needing advice on where to hunt!!<br />
<br />
dont suppose your monk wears any ebye aftershave?<br />
<br />
Thats the one with the sickly smell<br />
<br />
It kills gnomes at 10 feet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Slaiyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would suggest using the monk and beating the mob down until near death and then dd for the kill.  When he is high enough for the kill though I'd group with him.  Take him to Sol B and sit him in the corner soon as you zone in.  Go out with your monk while your shaman is parked at zone and kill every kobold you can find.  <br />
<br />
You can wipe all of the kobolds including king before respawn and continue while your shaman soaks all of the exp up.  I did this to pl my cleric and it was a piece of cake.  Normally I would start off bringing mobs to zone and fighting it until near death and FD and have the cleric finish it off for full exp.  When I ran out of mana I'd group up and kill every kobold I could find until respawn and start over.  Doing this you can get to 50 in no time with your shaman.</div></div><hr />
