A lot of us have or anticipate equipping a Time's Antithesis. It's a class item that is just as essential as an epic; however, the epic is a trophy, and, just being able to wield it lets you identify yourself with other shamen.  So why would it not make sense to allow the shaman to equip it as a secondary or ranged slot? A few other classes have that ability; why should they receive special treatment? Hopefully, Sony will get the message.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Only time those epics will ever get my use is the 0.8 seconds it takes to click and cast.  I'd equip TA over them if TA has 0 stats.  And yes, it is silly that some classes get other slots equipable (hi cleric &lt;insert holy trinity &quot;oh noes&quot; here&gt;).  Another way to help this dilema is to make TA castable from the inventory, but that would be too nice for sony to give shamans.</div></div><hr />

I have Epic and TA and HoH and....  point is that they are situational.  I equip my epic to cast the DoT then rebag it.  I Click my TA for Slow then equip HoH to add a little melee dmg.  What other epics eare multi-slot equipable?  and I don't mean primary and secondary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well from the poll I put up most seem to favor primary/ranged since it could keep the dmg/dly and still be useable as a weapon for those that want it or can hide the looks. Personally I think i'd prefer ranged over secondary since my ranged is more situational than my shield but either would be a definite improvement over primary only.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind switching items out at all.<br />

Necro's seem to be in an uproar over the aggro reducer on theirs.<br />
<br />
I tried to explain to a necro...<br />
<br />
'Don't equip it while you are casting DoTs'<br />

The way i see it , and i expect to get jumped all over for saying it , the epic 1.5 isnt really for TA equiped players , tis more of an item for casual / non time enabled players . BUT if epic 2.0 is far superior to TA then yes the TA should be make clickable from inv or made as a range/prim item . or make Epic 2.0 range/prim item . As it stands anyone whining about having to swap 1.5 with TA over is plain old whining and should get over it .<br />
sorry to offend the fabled few with TA :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Melkiah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think it would have been better as a secondary item.... no reason a shm epic can't be a shield. increase the ac on it, drop the melee status, and I bet most of us would be happier with it. I don't use my sof to melee, and I wouldn't use this either.<br />
<br />
someone posted that it would have been cool as a wooden shield with a lion skin stretched over it marked with runic symbols. put some beads and feathers on it for good measure.... tribal!<br />
<br />
realistically, they aren't going to change anything fellas..... get used to it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">It's kind of funny that a lot of clerics I talked to complained about getting a shield rather than a weapon, super proc hammer would have made a certain sense and probably been enjoyed a lot more by the class. Failing that I can understand why they didn't make an epic that would nullify one of the cleric class abilities by being equippable in primary slot. That's a good catch on the dev team's part.  <br />
<br />
While on the other hand, a lot of shaman would like nothing better than for their epic to be a shield but didn't have any class specific reasons for it. On a more serious note... this epic design is a cudgel, much like the iksar shaman quest mace and the mace was ranged equippable. They could make the epic ranged slot as well following the same logic.<br />
<br />
I'd still have preferred a shield though. It was obvious from the get go that the TA was going to be the yardstick this epic would have to measure up to.... The obvious solution is either to give it a similar or better effect or to make it equippable in another slot altogether. And really good looking shields that don't share graphics with a super common crap shield are hard to come by. <br />
<br />
Another possibility would have been a helmet that looks like a huge tiki mask..... that would have ruled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The idea for a head item that looks like some kind of shamanistic mask would totally rock :o<br />
<br />
I like the secondary and range equipable ideas also. <br />
<br />
As is now having a ta I will only be swapping in the epic (assuming i get it some day) in situational uses. Like say on a raid when there are two or more other shaman slowing or in groups where I am doing a lot of healing (thus having extra aggro from the heals on top of slow/debuff aggro and needing the boost from the clickie) Otherwise, TA is going to remain firmly anchoring in my main hand (probably 90% or more of the time i would use TA over the new epic)...<br />
<br />
The only thing about making it primary that really annoys me is that to use the effect on it you will have to swap it in a lot which is more than a little tedious. If soe did make it equipable in another slot or inventory clickable i would love them. <br />
<br />
I know they CANNOT make TA inventory clickable as then other classes could loot one and become slowers. However, I do not think other classes can complete the shaman epic 1.5/2.0 and as such if only a shaman can acquire one why not make it inventory clickable? If it cannot be exploited like an inventory TA could be then by all means I do not see why they wouldn;t do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know they CANNOT make TA inventory clickable as then other classes could loot one and become slowers.<br />
<br />
They've been able to make items inventory clickable with out being usable by everyone since kurnak at least. The example every shaman should be familier with is black fur boots. Works fine in inventory for shaman but won't work for anyone else. There are numerous other examples such as both pre and post nurf circlet of shadow(s).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The day after I got epic 1.5 i did both a /petition and a /feedback. What i wanted is as said before that we can either click the TA from inventory or use the epic 1.5 in another slot. It sucks IMO that i only have the epic out once with 10 min, i like the look and i the stats on it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Epic anywhere but primary pls :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I don't know why I can't copy-and-paste the URL, it's driving me crazy ... but there's another post on the forum here about how the 1.5's effect is now usable from inventory. This is a step in the right direction for those of us that just hate the graphic IMO. I'd still like a RANGE option to hide the graphic ... but inventory-usable is better than nothing, I suppose. <br />
<br />
/em reaches into the wild blue yonder of dream land.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we could convince SOE to let us benefit from the stats while the 1.5 is in a backpack inventory slot. :p<br />
