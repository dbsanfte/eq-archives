<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, this used to be THE place to get group focus and group Aegolism.  It was incredibly simple to farm spells here, and its amazing that more people never did it.   <br />
<br />
Paying 10k for group focus, or 40k for group aegolism is ridicilous.  I would say the spells were almost COMMON from this thing.  Its certaintly doable with 1 group, although my guild normally did it with 2, and it was kinda fun in the processs. <br />
<br />
Anyways, we havent been here in a while, and we were going to attempt it tonight in hopes of BOA dropping for a new 60 cleric.  However we got there and the high priest wasn't up.  Normallly the high priest is always up and you can trigger the ring over and over and over again.  Of course, this was a while ago, and they could have changed it on us.  So does anyone know if the ring was just bugged, or is the priest a rare spawn now?  I imagine that verant is retuning much of acrylia, and it wouldn't suprise me if they broke this intentional or unintentionally,  either way does anyone have some info here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sharden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dimly recall a post on safehouse about him being &quot;removed&quot; for fixing.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">one time bump, hoping for some more replies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah he was pulled a few patches ago. Never heard anything about him going live again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">He was up fine this weekend and we did the cycle several times.  Got 2 nameds.  The blessed grimling shield, mud smudged cap and a copy of natures recovery.<br />
<br />
He sometimes gets bugged.  We have arrived before with him not up, sometimes he stays that way until next patch, or whenever the zone is next reset.  Our server GM once respawned him for us.  The burrower in Acrylia is also another buggy piece of **** encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">no longer drops 60 spells - fortunately i got mu grp focus before that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think they changed a lot of things in Acrylia when they pulled the trigger mob for Tashakhi because we proved he was too easy. HP not dropping 60 spells was one of those things. <br />
<br />
Hey VI can we have Tashakhi back? Those keys we worked on for months aren't doing much good atm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">um, yes he does drop 60 spells.<br />
He dropped Natures Recovery Saturday.<br />
<br />
Natures Recovery = Level 60 luclin druid spell.<br />
<br />
Saturday, August 3.<br />
<br />
He also dropped Group Focus the previous time we did him, which was like 3 weeks ago.  I have them both, on our guild spell mule.<br />
