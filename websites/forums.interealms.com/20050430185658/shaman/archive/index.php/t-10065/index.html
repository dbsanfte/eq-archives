<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The question is should I or should I not put any exp into aa pts?  I know alot of you were already lvl 60 when aa pts came out so should I level to 60 then do aa or start getting them as soon as possible?    Thanks for any help you can give me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Get run3, then level up to 60.  Once you've done that, you have the option of levelling up to 65 before you get cannibalization, or you can go for can5 and then level to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Juujuu is perhaps correct about the most efficient progreshion to 60.<br />
<br />
I would simply say that if you find some of the aaxp abilities interesting, then do them.  Have fun.  This is not a job.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Really, if there is just no need to level quick, I'd gain a few levels anyway.  You get more power with them while still being able to xp in easy zones.<br />
<br />
I'd just put aaxp to 10 or 20%, then level as normal, spending points as you get them.<br />
<br />
I wish I had done that, because even at 30% aa, it looks like I'm going to do the cann5 grind /cry</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the replies fellow Shaman.  This is an awesome board and whenever I have a question you seem happy to help.  I guess it could be because since we play Shaman we are in the business of helping others.  I'll make sure I pass on any knowledge I gain from you to others who ask me.   Thanks again very much.</div></div><hr />
