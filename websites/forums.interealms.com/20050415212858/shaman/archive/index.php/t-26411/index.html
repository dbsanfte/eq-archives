<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Every post you read nowadays have someone complaining about there class in some way. Now latly its the panther whining for us.<br />
<br />
What I dont understand is why not just take a step back and think of what the panther spell really did for us.<br />
<br />
If you have 3 meles or pets you can cast panther on in your grp you have added by yourself 300dps or so, this is not something new and if we did alot of nuking/doting we could reach this before.<br />
<br />
Now however you take 10secs casting panther on your 3 meles and get agrofree dps and now for 1.5min you can debuff and heal your grp, with Breath of trushar or spiritual serenity and some spot healing I can be single healer in RS and other zones. Panther also gives you the time to use canni alot to get back all your mana.<br />
<br />
So alone you can heal your grp and still add dps, also with new spells I dont have room to add several dps spells. Champion, panther and AE slow now takes up the slots I had for dps spells before :)<br />

I dont have Panther yet but I can do this with Leapord.  It's all about your tank and DPS.<br />
<br />
Group had a Warrior, Rogue, Ranger and Bard.  When mobs die fast less healing is needed.<br />
<br />
Actualy in my case I keep it on 3 people plus my pet.<br />

After your other post, I'll start out by calling YOU a liar.  You knowledge of Shaman and BL's for that matter is VERY limited.  To say you can do something no other bard can do..I would think that is a lie as well.  <br />
<br />
I seriously will still stand by my claim that if the group is pulling at a fast pace, you aren't going to be able to keep panther on 3 people, slow/debuff and MH for very long.<br />
<br />
Having a deep mana pool is great, but if you are constantly in a negative flow, it will run out..maybe later than someone with a 6.8k manapool, but it will run out.</div></div><hr />

I got 14 songs going one time, but when I added the headstand I could only maintain 12 of them, and then when I reached for the water it spilled into the keyboard and everything crashed.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Every post you read nowadays have someone complaining about there class in some way. Now latly its the panther whining for us.<br />
<br />
What I dont understand is why not just take a step back and think of what the panther spell really did for us.<br />
<br />
If you have 3 meles or pets you can cast panther on in your grp you have added by yourself 300dps or so, this is not something new and if we did alot of nuking/doting we could reach this before.<br />
First off, if you are keeping Panther on 3 pets, its not 300 dps added, its closer to 700. For the sake of arguement, we use ~100 dps per Player and ~250 dps per Pet, with Panther on. Yes, the numbers may be off a bit, so lets say &quot;+/- 10%&quot; ok? <br />
<br />
Now that we have established that, I am not sure I fully understand what you are complaining about. I think the vast majority of Shamans posting here think that Panther is just fine the way it is. There are a few of us, mostly &quot;mid-high end&quot; who think its a BIT overpowered because the DPS is so high on pets. <br />
<br />
I feel that way myself. I think its a great spell, and a wonderful source of DPS for us, but I think its a bit too strong on pets (note, I think its FINE on players, maybe even slightly lowish, given the duration), and I won't complain a bit if the proc-rate is reduiced some on pets. Now, by &quot;some&quot; I dont mean reduced to some pitiful amount. 150-200 DPS when cast on a pet is pretty a pretty reasonable amount, and STILL makes it a very powerful spell. But right now, I think its just too strong, and it unbalances other classes and unbalances the game overall. <br />
So alone you can heal your grp and still add dps, also with new spells I dont have room to add several dps spells. Champion, panther and AE slow now takes up the slots I had for dps spells before :)<br />
<br />
Stop whining imo<br />
Again, this is about balancing the game, which means ALL classes need to have some &quot;value&quot;, so to speak. <br />
<br />
Heck, why not just give us a 90% XP rez, group ports and TLs, group Damage shields, Lay Hands, Defensive, Backstab, FD, and the ability to tank as well as Pallys or SKs? What would be wrong with that? Crazy you say? Why is all that crazier than giving us a spell that adds Wizard-like DPS in many situations?<br />
<br />
Sorry, but I don't LIKE it when one class gains something thats just too huge, even if its my own class. I think the spell needs nerfing, a bit, and to be perfectly honest, if you dont agree thats fine. But I am not &quot;whining&quot;, I am working to make the game better, and better, to me, is all classes about &quot;equal&quot; in their ability to function in the game, even though classes have different roles. <br />
What is it with the disbelief of others in this forum... he can probably handle his toon better than you. End of story.<br />
First off, I am with m9 on this one, if Gorlaan is claiming to be a main-healer in RSS and keep panter on 3 targets. However, I am pretty sure he wasnt saying that. I think he was saying his healing is strong enough to be MH or he can add a lot of DPS if needed with Panther. But not both.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">well atleast he is not a chanter telling us how much we are overpowered and need to be nerfed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stop whining imo<br />
<br />
My first thread was still correct... whining about whining is still whining.. sort of a vicious cycle that leads to &quot;Your mom is a Nazi&quot; and &quot;I pwn U wif mah l33t.... (or whatever the hell they come up with)...<br />
<br />
But to his defense... it's possible....  <br />
Case in point: Statue Camp!<br />
<br />
70War, 70Ranger, 70Rogue, 70Bst, *gimp* 70 cleric, and myself (all time flagged/Qvic flagged)....<br />
Gimp cleric had a manapool that screamed WoS but it was a friend so we managed...  Did have Darb though.... which is very handy on rough spots.  Cleric would go LOM alot so I stepped up and Main healed a full cycle which is.. 9-11 mobs depending on roaming door mobs.  If you check my magelo, I'm not a gimp shaman and have quite the AAs... so yes, your average shm may not be able to pull it off (which leads me into a side thought for later... what is the average shaman makeup nowdays?!?!?!)<br />
<br />
As ranger is pulling, I SS the MT, and sometimes get a Leopard off on the dog/bst pet... Tank gets a hit or two and I slow with Nihlis.. Rare is there a resist, but if there is, recast followed by a Fast heal.. If mob did not resist, finish the Leopard rot on dog, bst, rouge... Depending on the randomness of the DPS from mob, sometimes I have steady mana to pop the War.. though rarely the ranger....  I use our AA HoT as backup buffer and the ward as a steady regen(coupled with Tali of Perserverance).  Pop Cani(s) as often as needed...  My ability to sustain/lose/gain mana each fight is dependant upon the critness of my HoT/Heals and the Mobs DPS on the tank.. <br />
<br />
As for named, heh... if he doesn't charm us.. cake.. I can heal the tank as well.. but it is a mana drain at times... Charms... lol.. if you've been there, you know the chaotic nature that unfolds at times...<br />
<br />
However, without a doubt, I can mainheal RS statue camp with enough reliability that I don't need a cleric.... Question is.. do I want to... nope.. too much work.. but I'll do it to let cleric med or while we are looking for a replacement....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">what is the average shaman makeup nowdays?!?!?!<br />
<br />
Great question. I've never considered myself on par with hardcore raiders (which, to me, still means Elemental and above).<br />
<br />
Yet, I group with folks, maybe I have a rep, and they're like &quot;wow, you are great for a VT-level shaman&quot; - now what does that mean? I've been grinding AAs (355 now) and gear upgrades from the best one-groupable, non- or easily-keyed areas I could for the past however many years since Luclin came out.<br />
<br />
I don't expect my AAs/gear to be on par with somone who's guild farms Time... but what's average? I'm gonna think on this, then maybe put up a poll to see.</div></div><hr />

Fennin puts out a decent amount of DPS even from 15k+ tank (add in AE).  Figure you need 2 clerics to keep tank up, shaman for slowing, that leaves you 2 extra DPS slots.  Druids or Wizs would go OOM.  Mages could chain nuke there 2k magic nuke for a long time but thats still not too much DPS.  Melee?  Still got AE Ramp and AE's to heal.  Eventually they clerics would go OOM.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I dont think Fennin was 1 grouped.  2-3 grouped yes.  ! grouping no.  Fennin puts out a decent amount of DPS even from 15k+ tank (add in AE).  Figure you need 2 clerics to keep tank up, shaman for slowing, that leaves you 2 extra DPS slots.

Cleric, Shaman, SK, Necro, Ranger, Enchanter = easy win. Other combinations will work as well, but of course there always needs to be a certain level of gear and skill involved.<br />
<br />
Edit: Slowing is a process that takes up 10 seconds tops, which does not warrant a group slot imo. The Shaman in the group can slow and heal in place of a second Cleric for this fight.</div></div><hr />
