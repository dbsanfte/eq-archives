<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ppantherfoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all<br />
<br />
Back in the Days when leadership aa's came out i found them fun and novel so i put alot of effort into getting some.<br />
<br />
I got<br />
<br />
NPC Health<br />
Delegate MA<br />
Spell Awareness<br />
Mana Enhancement 3<br />
Health of Targets Health<br />
<br />
With so many new AA's out and lvl 70 to achieve is there still any Leadership aa's that is worth getting ?<br />
<br />

Are the 2 that everyone asks for, wouldnt bother with the rest unless you have run out of real aa buys. Ldr aa's steal 20% of your aa xp and not worth it in the long run if you have real aa buys left.<br />
<br />
I always ask in group if someone has more ldr aa's than me, I have like 5 things, if they do, i just /makeleader someone else. Probably 50% of the groups you are in, someone will have all ldr aa's. Which sorta owns so you can keep working on reg aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scylding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Question<br />
<br />
How does the Leader xp work.  If you are the leader and have aa xp off, does it take xp from your regular xp pool?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Leadership takes 20% of the exp that you get from every kill.  It doesnt matter if you have the AA meter set at 100% or at 0.  You have to be the leader of the group to be able to gain leadership AA. <br />
<br />
If you plan on doing leadership AA, I would suggest running either full AA or full exp when you do.  The math gets funny when you are trying to subtract a % from reg exp and a % from AA, and you often times will lose exp (at least as far as Ive seen).  So go all or nothing to AA when working on Leadership.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Personally I've got almost all the leader aa's done. Need to finish up offense enhancement and do delegate mark and find PC. I continue to work on these but only on raids. Leadership aa's seem to be strictly based on number of mobs killed. Turning it on first day of time when we're doing phase 1-4 + some of phase 5 will net me over an entire leader aa yet the regular or aa exp would be minimal. It's off for regular exp groups tho but costs so little on raid to not keep working on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what I do...turn leadership on for raids only...seems to work pretty well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And Mana Enhancement 1, for what that's worth. <br />
<br />
My groupies hate the mark npc, the target rings confuse them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Target rings? Mark npc puts a number infront of the name. Never seen it do anything with target rings.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">One of the Ldr AA's will put a target ring on the mob. Personally I like this one when working with an enchanter or bard. Let's them know which target I intend on beating on first or want down first if I get lazy and pull multiples. It also works as a semi-cheesy inc call as it announces to the group that a mob has been marked.<br />
<br />
Wastrel da Leezurd.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Delegate MA makes the MA's target have a special ring.<br />
<br />
Mark NPC not only puts a number up over the mob's head with the name, it also makes another special target ring around the base. At least for me, with default target rings.<br />
<br />
I can make a screenshot tonight if you like.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Agrees with Sam: Mark NPC puts a white ring around the targeted mob, slightly larger in diameter that the Main Assists target ring. It does also append a number to the name above the NPC's head as well.<br />
<br />
I have about 75% of all available lead AA, and I don't regret any of them. Sure, some of the benefits are small, but this is a game of small benefits, and cumulative small benefits make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I personally love HoTT.  If there just would be a keyboard shortcut to switch the 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye, I am a HoTT junkie.  I have LAA turned off now until I ding 70, but then it will go back on.</div></div><hr />
