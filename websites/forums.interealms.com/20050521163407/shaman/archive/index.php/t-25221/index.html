<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kradek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Fighting Girplan Scavenger tonight, rapidly eating through mana and Im thinking, no worries, got that nifty aa Spiritual Channeling.  OOM and cast SC and try to cast a heal and guess what-- insufficient mana?<br />
<br />
Why is mana checked at all when SC is in effect? Im not using mana to cast? Makes this AA much less useful, especially when you hava a mana dot eating away your mana.<br />

Yeah cast nadox many times during fight. You're still burning mana on this fight pretty hard which changes to the AA would make much more useful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Vulfgar Cloudstrider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It gets even worse.  So far, at least for me, SC only uses HP for mana 100% of the time about 1 in every 4 times I use SC.  Otherwise, about every third spell I cast still uses mana.  And yes,  it will check against your available mana  and no it doesn't take in to account mana preservation.  I'm less enthused about this skill than I was before I bought it, but it still has some utility.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I asked the AA designer about this issue during the Fan Faire. Rashere said that the ability should not check mana. I hope it will be fixed in the 15th patch.</div></div><hr />

That is like the worst waste of a timed ability ever, on par with using LoH to save the guy who trained your group and MGBing Acumen.<br />
<br />
Speaking for myself I have so far once used it to buff a raid - when I was the only shaman there after a wipe. I have used it several times when grouped when we killed difficult nameds to give me a second (and third . . and fourth . . and fifth . . ) mana bar. And I have used it on raids to be able to chainheal for the entire encounter.<br />
<br />
The mana check is annoying but not really an issue if you know it is there. Just hit channeling when you are at 30 mana, start casting, hit Ancestral Aid or the 1.5 epic to negate the first bit of damage and look for a lull in the action to cast a HoT on yourself in. As long as you find the time to get a HoT on yourself every now and then you can be chaincasting heals (or whatever spells you would rather be chaincasting) meanwhile and end up with full mana and health when spirit channeling wears off.</div></div><hr />

Many times? hehe... I kept a group cured quite easily and did heals etc... He doesn't chain cast it, and one cast of Nadox removes the DoT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Saying it's the worst waste of a timed ability is your opinion, my opinion is that SC is better than MGB.<br />
<br />
Buffing a whole raid as the solo shaman after a wipe was the only time I ran out of mana normally, outside of a few oddball encounters if I didn't cure or get cured.<br />
<br />
I suppose someones opinion is based on on your mana pool. Raid buffed my mana is 10k+.<br />
<br />
When I do use SC to buff a raid I am at either 80% or full mana.<br />
<br />
I don't think how I use it is a waste at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I will be the first to admit that Spiritual Channeling is one of the best abilities in its current state and will be the best Shaman ability after its fix and more importantly, that I was wrong.<br />
I purchased this ability the very second I got 70, even though I was not very optimistic in regards to its usefulness and remember being quite harsh in my responce to Tugela, who was advertising it as the nice ability it turned out to be. <br />
I purchased it as my first ability regardless, because as VM has already mentioned in another thread, an AA that gives me a new ability is almost always more useful and effective than just an upgrade to a current one. Granted I didn't really have to pick as I had 30 points saved up, so it was relatively easy.<br />
That said, in my defense, I have to say, and everyone who plays this game at the highend and has been during GoD, will understand what I am talking of, Spiritual has only been rendered so incredibly useful by the way Omens was designed. <br />
<br />
Spiritual Channeling would have been close to useless during GoD, just because chain casting a heal was often not enough to keep up with the damage dealt and no mana in the world would have changed that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I apologize, especially to Tugela, who back then was in the beta, because I couldn't think the developers would have designed Omens to be a downgrade to GoD and thus making this ability actually useful.<br />
<br />
Now to the topic: <br />
I agree that an ability like this needs to be used wisely. I try everything to avoid using it and NEVER use it to buff, it makes no sense for me, even with me being the only Shaman on the raid, but saying the mana check is irrelevant, if you know about it, is not true at all when fighting mana draining NPCs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">. . . even though I was not very optimistic in regards to its usefulness and remember being quite harsh in my responce to Tugela, who was advertising it as the nice ability it turned out to be. <br />
Bah, what about me, I think we had 3 or 4 PMs back and forth about it. I called it the &quot;2nd coming of Cannibilize&quot;. Heh.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I love this AA. I have used it to buff raids, in PG Trials, in raids vs tough named, in groups, soloing, etc. If there is any complaint from me, its my own tendency to &quot;save&quot; it, whereas with Canni 5, I hit it the instant it pops, or burn a spell to get my mana to the point that Canni 5 will top it off. <br />
<br />
The only time I have any trouble with it is when I use it to buff a raid, due to the high cost of Group Wunshi. Other than that, for every spell I would want to cast in most other situations, 20% mana and 60% health is fine. (Yes, Murtak, I use it to buff, because up until early this week, I was the only shaman in the guild with Group Wunshi, saves a BUNDLE of time and mana after a wipe)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i love this AA to death.  any shaman i have talked to in game feels the same way.  the issue i have with it is not only the check for mana bug, but the fact that it seems to randomly pick that certain spells will use mana instead of HP while the AA is active.  i have seen it dozens of times as have other shaman in my guild.  hopefull all the /bug /feedback about this AA will get it fixed.<br />
<br />
btw if you pop this with low mana, 1 or 2 casts of canni or even a canni v will put you back in the mana range to cast most spells you will be useing (heals most importantly...)  <br />
if you have issues fighting mana drain mobs pop this AA at the begging of the fight instead of at the end...for fights&lt; 5mins in length it will help a lot...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the issue i have with it is not only the check for mana bug, but the fact that it seems to randomly pick that certain spells will use mana instead of HP while the AA is active. <br />
I think this is a death-check bug. It wont use your HPs if using them will put you below a certain level. This is especially true of high-mana spells, like Tali of Wunshi. If you try to cast back-to-back Tali of Wunshis, without letting Serenity go a couple clicks to raise your hps into a &quot;safe&quot; range, it will take the mana, then you are screwed for casting anymore until you get the mana back (the no-mana bug portion).<br />
<br />
I don't think this ability should have ANY checks or safeguards. If someone pops it and casts a spell that will kill them, then they die (Canni 5 has no such safeguard), we all laugh a little, and move on. And it should allow me to cast ANY spell regardless of how much mana I actually have in my pool. I am pretty sure that is how the final version is going to be after this patch, although there may be a death warning of some kind, I dunno.</div></div><hr />

Once you are oom, Spiritual stops working, so it doesn't really matter if you pop it at the start or at the end, unless the mana drain is small. Then again, if the mana drain is small Ancient Cannibalize would keep up with it.</div></div><hr />

your mana will run out a lot slower without a cure if you are casting from your HP pool than it will if you are casting from your mana pool.  if you see what i am getting at.</div></div><hr />
