<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello!  Just thought I would share my experiences while hunting tundra yetis in Dreadlands.<br />
<br />
Hunted in DSP till I was 38, (started at 29) so I was quite bored with that zone and was looking to move.  Headed over to the Dreadlands and took up residence in the northmost Tundra Yeti cave (hang a left as you leave the cave from the combine portal area).<br />
<br />
The cave winds in for a bit, then you'll come to a crossroads.  To the left is a single yeti, up ahead is a room with 3 more yetis in it, and to the right is another room with 3 more yetis, and a Frozen Soulstone on the ground (not sure what it for, no drop and all that jazz)<br />
<br />
Pulling: was easy.  Take out the single yeti at the xroads, then have your pet guard in the middle there.  Once you've got that done, work one room at a time, pulling a single yeti from the hallway.  I preferred to pull with slow, but your own tactics should work just fine.  They're not social, but they will argo on you if you get too close.  Pull your target back to your pet and take em down however you prefer.  Rinse and repeat until you've emptied the two rooms.  Rest and med until they repop.  Easy!<br />
<br />
The Exp:  Exp was good.  I was getting about 4% for 3 kills (first 2 kills would get me 1% each, then the third would get me 2%).  Made for a nice, steady, worthwhile exp grind.<br />
<br />
The Loot:  Excluding the acrylia drops, this was some of the best loot I've gotten to date soloing.  In the two levels I've been here, I've netted about 300pp in coin and words/runes.  Also, I've gotten about 4 stacks of Frosty Daturas, which are high end rogue poison components.  They should sell for about 10pp per Datura in the bazaar.  I also got about a stack of Essence of Winters, a component needed for Northman cultural smithing.  Not sure on the price, but I'm sure they will sell well.<br />
<br />
The Bad:  Yeah, there is a bit of badness to this place.  First of all, its lonely and isolated.  I never saw another soul while hunting there, and its also a bit away from the zone if you get in trouble and don't have gate memmed.  A large problem is pathing.  I lost a few yeti corpses when they popped through the wall and my pet killed em, which sort of sucked, but no biggie.  The worst of it all though is pet pathing.  Sometimes my pet would pop through the floor or walls, and that was it, he was gone.  I could still command him, but it was hit and miss.  Sometimes he would pop back and fight, other times he was no where to be found, running willy nilly all about under the zone.  Who knows.  Still other times he would attack through the walls, and the yeti would not fight back if I had him root rotting.  Not necessarily a bad thing, but it could probably be considered an exploit if a GM was in a pissy mood.  Its impossible to reproduce, your pet just sort of does it on its own.  So who knows.<br />
<br />
The Fix:  The best way I found to control your pet and not have him get lost is to not let him chase a fleeing mob through the tunnels.  Bring the yeti back to your guarding pet, then when the yeti is almost dead, have your pet back off and finish the yeti off yourself.  I found that a quick dot like Envenomed Breath works well here, since I'm not exaclty a melee master.<br />
<br />
So thats it!  Quick, quiet and easy exp'ing for the masses.  If you have any questions, feel free to post them here or look up Briskor Tiboras on Veeshan, M-F 8AM till 5PM CST.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ramma2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Update:<br />
<br />
Decided to take them till level 41, worked out just fine.  After that, they were still drk blue but I was looking for a new spot to hunt in.<br />
<br />
Off to Echo Caverns!<br />
<br />
Watch the 40-50 for a short guide about there as well, once I learn the laws of the land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cudabarra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I started soloing here at 38, halfway to 40 now. Good exp as you said but I've found the loot to be poor.<br />
 I also found that the pathing of the yetis is horrible and made one change that made a huge difference. Instead of parking my pet in the crossroad area I take out the single yeti first. Then move on to the first 3 spawn room to the right. I park my pet just outside the opening to the room and pull with Torgor's. when they run towards me I take the first hit and let dogdog jump in while i back out of range, cast malosi followed by scourge. Then jump in and melee with pet. When the yeti is almost at one bub of health I root it with instill and finish it off. Same formula for the other two in room.<br />
 Then I take dogdgog down to the other 3 spawn room and use the same technique being concious of the single spawn that usually repops when im on the last yeti in the room.<br />
 I found by parking my pet at the crossroads I would lose 2 or 3 yetis in the walls, most would vanish but some would pop out of the wall or floor minutes after I had pulled them. This was dangerous because by that time I was usually engaged with another one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shubert TZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have found that if you park your pet before the x roads at the turn in the tunnel and pull to there, you can avoid walling the yetis.  There is one part of the wall they will fall through.  It is the left side of the tunnel ( the wall juts out a bit) if you are looking towards xroad and at that 3 spawn room.  Pull them past this and you will not lose them.  I would check the vendor prices on the flowers.  I was told they can go for a few plat each by a friend but have not tried it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Linanae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Great loot (not hg loot but good) averaging 6 plat per yeti in the cave not the brutes. The brutes drop maybe 6 gold. <br />
<br />
Nice steady pulls about 3-6 minute spawn (have not timed it myself yet). At least on my server beware of knuckle heads who train the giants to here because they are lost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grugnak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just wanted to say that even at 35 these are very doable.  Their resists were low enough that even the even/yellow didn't resist much (maybe 2 in every 35 casts).  They've taken me through to 37 easily enough and I expect I will do them until 40.  <br />
<br />
I pulled with slow, sicced pet, then eb.  Disempower if I felt like it, not really needed, as I found Scourge isn't either if you keep yourself and dogdog furied/hasted/str buffed.  If you're kei'd I suppose go for it, but without it's better to save the mana.</div></div><hr />
