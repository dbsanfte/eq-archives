<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am am still rather new to the Shaman class having only played to 45 so far.<br />
<br />
But I noticed that my Spec Alt had stopped going up at 200 even though Caster's Realm lists it as going up to 235. I figure that Caster's Realm must be wrong as has been know to happen.<br />
<br />
However, I went to the Shaman trainer in PoK and figured I would verify it.<br />
<br />
Well he let me train up 201 a week ago...and I tried again last night and it went up to 202.<br />
<br />
Today I checked and lots of the 65s in EQRatings that are authentic show only a Spec Alt of 200.<br />
<br />
What is going on?<br />
<br />
Is there something I am not aware of?<br />
<br />
I feel like a newbie and I have missed something obvious...sorry of that is the case.<br />
<br />
Thank You</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it is max for you now, will go up later (post 50?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Are you sure you aren't confusing Specialize Alteration with actual Alteration?<br />
<br />
If I'm not mistaken, Specialize only goes to 200  . . . ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes...I am sure.<br />
<br />
My Alteration is at 226. I levelled to 45 last night and have not had a chance to peak it yet. I would say to check my magelo which I normally auto-sync but with the patch a few days ago I have had to update it manually.<br />
<br />
But I am certain it is Spec Alt. Can someone else try it and see what happens?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no, the primary specialization only caps at 200. The secondary one (from an AA) caps at 100, all others at 50</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Now note it has not gone above 200 with casting spells.<br />
<br />
I only went up when I went to the trainer and trained it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I can confirm it, was able to train SPECIALIZE ALTERATION to 225 at the GM in pok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm...  Very interesting indeed.  I rather suspect that this may face the same fate as spell research and alchemy skills past 200, though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Im gonna say this is a bug.<br />
<br />
Perhaps related to OoW's 5 new levels.<br />
<br />
Typically the number is 5 skillups per level, if Tal was able to train to 225, that would make sense for a L70 character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've asked Brenlo whether this was &quot;working as intended&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'll let you know as soon as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Then why am I as a level 45 able to train it?<br />
<br />
I only trained 1 or 2 points because the that is all I had at time. I think it would let me train more if I had skill more skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As I said above, I'd say this is a bug.</div></div><hr />

Basically never trust Casters Realm.<br />
Was a fine site a few years ago but has gone down hill since.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Darguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I know. That why I wanted to try it for myself. Be cool if it is a bug and we were the first to find it.<br />
<br />
I quit EQ about 2 years ago and came back recently (Darguk is not my original main). Back then CR was cool. But when I came back I noticed right away that it had gone down hill bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Middle of June is when they broke caps for research, alchemy, specialization so they could be trained over 200, and non-gnomes could train tinkering to 20. Middle of July they reset research and alchemy, but you're saying you can still train specialization over 200? Then they forgot to fix it.</div></div><hr />
