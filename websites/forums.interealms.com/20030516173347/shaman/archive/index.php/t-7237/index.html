<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know you can use a keyboard with a PS2 (seems like you'd almost have to to talk to anyone), but is there a mouse too?  I mean, how would you target things that were far off?  I'm sure you could cycle through close targets, but what happens when you want to click on something way out yonder?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kalduin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At this time were not at liberty to disclose compatability of EQOA with third party software. However.... *cough* you can hold down L2 to pop up a mouse for quick screen movement *cough* (This feature is only *cough* used for testing and probably wont be in the final version *cough cough*).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
*cough*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aha!  Interesting.  Still, sounds like a major production to put down the controller and grab the keyboard to talk to someone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kikak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How do you 2 box, 3 box, 4 box etc EQOA? hehehehe.<br />
<br />
The FAQ said you can on thier offcial website.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oh man, buying a second PS2 would seriously suck.  I already dropped around $500 on the first one with box and accessories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There are two USB ports on the PS2, I wouldn't be surprised if you could use a mouse eventually.  I think I have read that there's no mouse support now, but it's still early beta.  <br />
<br />
On the other hand I can't imagine trying to switch between mouse, keyboard, and controller in order to play.  If they're going to do it they'd have to make it so you could play with JUST they keyboard and mouse and not need the controller or anything, if you so chose.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">...in which case you might as well get a damn PC and be done with it.  I guess the PS2 graphics will look nicer, but there's not THAT much difference between $200 PS2 + $79 kbd + $40 mouse + $40 network adapter and the cheapest EQ-capable PC.<br />
<br />
I guess if you're too stupid to run Windows like the guys in the Apple ads this would be a good alternative.  But EQ is coming for the Mac, too.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't think it would be TOO bad to switch to keyboard while in town and use the controller in XP areas.  You don't do that much keyboarding during the grind anyway, everything is hotkey-based for me.  So if the hotkey system is sufficient it should be OK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Damn, that's some pricy hardware you're buying. <br />
For something you're not going to be using much I can't see spending more than $30 total on a keyboard and mouse together.  <br />
<br />
That's assuming you already have a PS2, there's really no reason to go out and buy one just for EQOA.<br />
<br />
Buy one for Kingdom Hearts and GTA:Vice City, however.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Kingdom Hearts is a  great game.<br />
<br />
As for keyboard I found a nice logitech usb one for $15. If you are 2 boxing you don't want them so far away to use a wireless. Though wireless are nice the mouse is useless. Alot of cheaper USB network adapters also work with PS2 online games...thought the sony one that plugs in the back has a modem in it too so if you travel with it or live somewhere with no high speed internet available.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The USB adapters are not officially supported for PS2 games.  A few games shipped using the SN Systems TCP/IP stack - like Tony Hawk - and they work with specific models.  I would not expect games that ship with Sony Computer Entertainment International's TCP/IP stack to support USB ethernet.  <br />
<br />
SOE will be using SCEI's stack.<br />
<br />
The reasons given for this lack of support are that those USB adapters are subject to change without notice by the manufacturer and that change might impact the software driver.  Apparently that's already happened once and there are two batches of one particular USB Ethernet adapter that behave differently despite having the same model number - i.e. there's absolutely no way to tell which is which.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I doubt the graphics will be as good as the pc, Everquest is very heavily based on textures, the PS2 doesnt have memory to store / display all these at once (while keeping a high framerate).. They are going to be reducing the resolution of these and relying on more detail in polygons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">PS2 games are very high polygon count/relatively low texture, PC games are the reverse.  It doesn't make one better or worse than the other.  PS2 animations generally look smoother and special effects look nicer because the programmers know exactly what the hardware can do.<br />
<br />
More to the point, EQOA is a complete new game written to 2002/2003 standards, whereas EQ is limping along with a rewritten graphics engine that has to support a compatibility mode, running on a variety of old graphics cards and hardware and who knows what.  EQOA ought to blow the regular EQ's graphics away.  Whether it looks better than more modern PC games running on hot hardware is another question.</div></div><hr />
