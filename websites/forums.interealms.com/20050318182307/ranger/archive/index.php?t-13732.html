<br />
The result is that a group fighting at the graveyard suddenly will be on the aggro list of mobs far from zone in. They are instantly summoned to that far location and killed. If aggro mobs are still in the vicinity of zone in, zoning in to rez and clear the corpse can result in a repeat.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else seen this or have more details on what triggers it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earlier one night we were in the caves fighting with just one group.  This not a good idea, as we only had 5 folks.  Anyways some Reaper wipes us out and we descide not to go back.  We res corpses and go our different ways. The shaman sticks with me and we head out to kill stuff.  about 45 mins later, a major ass kicking happens as we both were sumoned to a quick death. This happened after we killed a mob we were just fighting.  We got summon to what looks like the cave.  My guess?  I was still on hate list and it never cleared.   when mobs got agro'd and attack and killed other folks there it continued to summon who ever else remained on the list and was still in the zone.</div></div><hr />

From zone in we had gone right and were close to the tinkering vendor in front of the door nearby.  Now, we had crawled as a group here and every mob between the ZI and this spot had been killed so there should have been no aggro on us.  All of a sudden about a half dozen mobs came around the corner and went straight for us full aggro(no one else was nearby at all).  Also was some /ooc earlier in the night about another group(in factory area) that had trained ZI, yet they were claiming their cleric had been summoned from out of nowhere and just ran to zone to get away(not even near their camp).  Something is messed up here with aggro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My guess is you aggroed somethign and somehowyou didnt zone out oir it wa sbehind a wall so it was still following you all the wayt ot inkerr and it ran throuh everythign to get you because you aggroed somethign on your side of wall. jusat my far out guess.</div></div><hr />

Strange Aggro Problems and What Triggers It<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 From what I've seen on this and other boards, quite a few people have been reporting odd aggro in several different zones. Well, I got to observe this today while my wife was hunting drakes for tailoring. I had her do some experimenting, and I think I see what triggers the weird aggro in certain mobs.<br />
<br />
First, there was my wife's experience. She zoned in, starting killing drakes, and shortly thereafter, Yvolcarn, who had been halfway across the zone, paid her an unfriendly visit. Not wanting the faction hit from killing the pest, she put a safe distance between herself and Yvolcarn and gated. She thought she had been trained, but I pointed out that she had SoE up and would have seen anyone running past her. I told her about the weird aggro people had been reporting, and we decided to take a closer look at what was happening.<br />
<br />
(Just a note -- my wife is dubious to CoV, but checking around the zone, we found that there were allies to CoV getting aggroed at what seemed to be odd times. So, faction doesn't seem to be an issue.)<br />
<br />
My wife zoned back in, tracked Yvolcarn down, and checked who Yvolcarn was aggroed on using /assist. She followed behind Yvolcarn as person after person was forced to zone. Finally, Yvolcarn decided to head back to his perch. My wife sat next to Yvolcarn and used /assist to see if Yvolcarn was aggroed on anyone. His list was clear. Then another druid my wife had been chatting with zoned back in and started to kill a wyvern way across the zone. My wife hit /assist again, and sure enough, Yvolcarn had that druid targeted. Yet, he wasn't going after the druid in question. A few minutes later (long enough for several people to zone back in and start hunting wyverns/drakes), the druid -- who was still targetted by Yvolcarn according to /assist, wandered into &quot;pursuit range&quot; (i.e., the range at which mobs lose interest in you and wander off). Yvolcarn took off after the druid like a bat out of hell, with the druid puzzled as to why and none too pleased about it. The druid headed to Skyshrine and zoned. Now, instead of going back to his perch, he proceeded to run around the zone, attacking anyone who had killed or was killing a drake or wyvern while he was sitting on his perch, waiting for someone to wander into range and trigger him to move. Once again, he returned to his spawn point only after everyone on this hate list had cleared aggro (zoned, died, etc.).<br />
<br />
Think of it as an aggro time-bomb. You get on the hate list of one of these mobs with this buggy &quot;zonewide awareness,&quot; but you don't know it, because they don't come after you immediately. Eventually, someone pulls this mob, it aggroes on someone else, or you wander into it's &quot;pursuit range.&quot; Now the mob is free to chase whoever is highest on its hate list, even if that person is on the other side of the zone. [Edit: Some more testing with Yvolcarn this morning seems to indicate that this last point isn't valid, at least in his case. Needing some pelts, I killed a few wyverns as far away from the pest as I could get and watched track to see if he started moving. Eventually, someone with aggro got too close to him, and he pursed them to SS. The person fleeing zoned into SS, and at that point, Yvolcarn should have came after me and a few others. But since no one was in his large pursuit range, he went back to his roost. Still, if a zone is crowded where this kind of aggro is in effect, a mob could easily ping-pong from one person to the next and end up ganking some unexpecting soul at the other end of the zone.] As that mob wanders close to other creatures it's social with, it passes it's hate list on to them, and the next thing you know, it's add city. From what I have seen in a few zones, it gets ugly FAST.<br />
<br />
I think this could explain the weird aggro in a lot of areas other than CS, such as ME and WW. I think that if those of us who have experienced the &quot;adds out of the blue sky&quot; phenomenon, I suspect many of us could see the pattern above at work.<br />
<br />
In closing, I'd like to hear from other people and see if the pattern I give above can be confirmed by anyone else in other zones. If this is a bug, Verant needs to take a look at this quickly, because it makes playing in several zones more of a pain than a joy. I certainly hope this is a bug, and not a case of &quot;working as intended,&quot; because how aggro is working in certain zones now is nonsense.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xthorn</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it has to do with lull.  This can and will cause major problems in PoP as well as the older world, as apparently there is a bug that will mess up the hate lists.  I've encountered a number of situations where the lull line of spells (not to be confused with harmony or harmony of nature) will permanently bug aggro until all the mobs involved are killed.<br />
<br />
First time I noticed this was in Crypt of Decay.  The bard in my group was using lull and fading memories to single pull down the right passageway through the bubonians.  We managed to snag Witchdoctor Oxkra, a named rat, and got him to 15% before he managed to gate back to his spawn point.  He started summoning us and the bard attempted to use lull and fading memories to escape the spawns in the path to the zone.  The bard and our tank die, the rest of us escaped and zoned out.  We rebuffed and attempted to work our way back in.  As soon as the bard got near some of the mobs that he had previously lulled, every mob from the area we cleared to the Witchdoctor (pretty far in) aggroed instantly, warping through the wall at once.  Our tank, bard, and cleric died this time.  We all tried logging out and back in in PoTranquility.  The bard did some CR to get the warrior and cleric out -- he said he was able to walk up to the named spawn with invis up (none of them saw invis) and did not aggro anything.  This time, he had to use lull on mobs even closer to zone.  When we rebuffed and fought to that point, the Witchdoctor again charged us from maybe 800 distance units away and killed a few.  We gave up on this since it's apparent that something was wrong.<br />
<br />
Second time I encountered this was in Halls of Honor where a bard decided to lull pull and also used fading harmonies to split the guards.  He zoned out at some point without having killed the first two guards... the next party to zone in was immediately charged by the guards upon zone-in.  Usually it is safe to zone in without invis up, but they even charged the graveyard.  A necro that heard about this and zoned in FD-ed, however after they returned to their spawn points, they charged him again when he got up.  We brought a group to kill the guards, and the next spawn was fine.<br />
<br />
Third time I saw this was in Akheva while a bard was pulling some stonemen out of Va'Dyn's lair while he was up.  Apparently he was using Fading Memories and lull and hit Va'Dyn with a lull once.  They decided to pull him to kill him, but failed.  Every time they attempted to pull anything remotely close to his room, Va'Dyn would rush out with the rest of the room and attack them.  This did not reset after they died and zoned.<br />
<br />
Basically, this bug could be used as an exploit to prevent people from succeeding in an encounter that might normally be trivial to them.  I hope Verant takes a closer look at what they've done and fix this problem as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

Leafy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Greakan_VF</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I witnessed something different in PoI last night. While fighting near the GY, I saw a pally pull a single robot from the spawn nearest to the GY. Shortly after he pulled,...about 5 seconds, another robot spawned. The pally was long gone with his pull but the new one aggroed him and went after em still. Instead of making a b-line to him however, it pathed down the way a bit and chain aggroed about three other bots. They ran around real buggy for a min or two then they finally gathered together and hauled arse right after the pally and his group. No one intervened through the entire process so I was able to observe exactly what happened. <br />
<br />
The group screamed that they were trained and everyone zoned. I kept the little secret to myself because I knew it wasn't going to make anyone feel better that it was actually an aggro bug and they trained themselves. Anyway, food for thought, PoI aggro is very bugged, beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">coruscare</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the critical difference between Harmony and Lull/Pacify is the PACIFY slot (see lucy.fnord.net for examples.)<br />
<br />
The PACIFY effect of a spell seems to be severely bugged.<br />
<br />
Tell your friends .... harmony is still the best pulling device :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sionach</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 01:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We had the exact same problem in PoI; we'd cleared down the left path, took out everything as we went.  It was a 60 Warrior single-pulling - there was absolutely no spellcasting involved with pulling.  We were doing fine and suddenly from the path *behind* us, where we'd just cleared, we had at least 6 mobs run up and wipe us out.  No one ran past us and we were far enough from the zone that anyone training GY from the right path would not have had their mobs in aggro range of us.<br />
<br />
No one was using any sort of Lull or Harmony spell that night.  We had no runners escape and no trains; the mobs literally came out of nowhere.  There's definitely something very strange going on with aggro and I think the use of Lull and Harmony in some of the above situations is coincidental.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buadyen</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I saw &quot;weird aggro&quot; happen in Western Wastes, too. I can't remember if it was before PoP was released (I'd have to check my logs later today), though..<br />
<br />
Anyway, I was hunting animals in WW to get my cleric bot to level 58. I had been wandering the entire zone, but mostly I was staying in the northern half. While I was hunting, a guild came in to WW to do the Benevolence quest encounter. I saw Scout Charisa's text (from halfway across the zone) and thought nothing of it. Shortly after, I was summoned from the northern part of WW to the SG zoneline by the giant captain. My cleric was, too. I managed to zone despite the captain and his cronies being there... my cleric wasn't so lucky.<br />
<br />
A GM had to come and train the giants away from the zone so people could do their CR. The captain eventually despawned..</div></div><hr />

 If you stopped reading the 1st post right there this would sound like a great thing! =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llyric</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is another side to it: zoning, evaccing and dying aren't clearing the hate lists. We had a bit of a screwup earlier going after the Manaetic Prototypes in the factory, wound up with 2 of them at once in the center because some people went the wrong way, so evacced. Before we got back to the factory doors, the Prototypes were summoning people inside. There were no lulls used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seomen</div><div class="date">11-12-2002, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">im almost willing to bet this is a problem caused by them tinkering with harmony/lull and somehow they have messed up the way agro works in outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
only other time i have herd/seen anything like this was about three years ago for about a week. it was right after kunark had just come out and if you were hunting 3 giants at the camp in FV. it was possible to get on a messed up hatelist by drolvargs and they would come running form as far as the bridge to FV to attack you at the 3 giant camp. the scary thing was they didnt stop coming drolvargs would just keep charging the camp nonstop till you wiped.<br />
<br />
i still put my money on the changes they made to harmony is causing this. whats prolly occuring is somehow the new spell(s) are not interacting with mobs correctly. only makes sense due to the fact that was the only major change made to agro recently in any patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eolair Strongbo</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ya know, if they changed it back, maybe everything would be ok? :p  Everyone send a feedback and ask them to just go back to old harmony and that will solve the problem. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seomen</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 05:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">well it would be one way to get them to look at it in the very least. the problem is they may just disable the spell entirely to fix the problem. /shrug <br />
<br />
who knows maybe they have improved the AI and mobs dont need to be agroed to hate you anymore. could be all kinds of crasy crap they could be doing for all we know. <br />
<br />
i still put my money on the harmony nerf causeing this somehow. because when they changed harmony they also boosted the lull spells. so they had to tinker with agro somewhere along the way. only make sense this is a bug caused by the nerf/change to these spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">keawen</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 01:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This bug might affect harmony too, last night I went to get some Mephit blood in PoN for a friend and after exploring the tunnels we ended up near Vhaksiz, so we decided to try him to see how hard he hits.<br />
<br />
I casted harmony on him to get close and position the group but got the immune message, after about 1 minute of fighting we decided to succor since we could not beat him with a single group and we already had the info we needed. When we got back to zone in, people from the zone were shouting that they were getting summoned randomly by him and being killed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katalaeia</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I had a Kael raid last night with the same aggro bug. PoZs were aggroing whenever any arena mob was pulled, even the top-of-the-ramp guys. Once we smacked them down the repops seemed to be normal, but we had several 2- and 3- pulls before that happened. Kinda scary on a raid with mostly low 50s people...kinda fun, too.</div></div><hr />
