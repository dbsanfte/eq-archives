<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zarlan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings fellow mystics!  I am soon to be lv 50 and I am wondering where I could go for some good xp.  I often have friends to group with so here is the party I constantly find myself in.  <br />

Any suggestions where we could go for some good xp?  We've been in and out of Sebilis, love the zone!  KC isnt an option for my SK friend because of the Venril Sathir faction.  Not to sure if we're missing out on some &quot;gem&quot; of xp zone.  Any ideas would be greatly appreciated = ) <br />

I did those levels during Kunark era and early Velious.  At the time, I found the best zones to be COM (Goos and Gazeboos) and SolB (Bats/Bugs and LDC).  I imagine Velks would be good at those levels, but at the time Velks was overrun by 55+ crowd so we avoided it till later.<br />
<br />
On MT these days, Velks usually has only 20 people in it, SolB has 10 people, and COM has 5 people.  So, getting a decent camp in any of these zone should be quite easy.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps.<br />

I'm getting good loot and xp dou here and really like the zone.</div></div><hr />
