<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just got back into the game and hope to push my level 37 Shaman to new heights. Only one problem, before I &quot;quit&quot; I gave away all my stuff. So now I have no money and a fine-steel morning star. Where can I fight to get some money to atleast afford the minimum equipment?<br />
<br />
Also, what did they do to CT?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Also, can a level 37 hunt in Sol A?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have Luclin you could go to Netherbian's Lair and kill the stuff there with your pet.  They don't drop many items but they drop 4-5pp each and are around level 24ish.  Doesn't take long to get a few hundred pp for you to start buying some gear again.<br />
<br />
The 3 items there you could use while farming cash are:<br />
<br />
Flint Hammer<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Skill: 1H Blunt  Atk Delay: 30<br />
DMG: 5  <br />
WIS: +2  MANA: +10  <br />
WT:  8.0    Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR CLR PAL RNG SHD DRU MNK BRD SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Flint Head Spear<br />
MAGIC ITEM  LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: PRIMARY  <br />
Skill: Piercing  Atk Delay: 35<br />
DMG: 8  <br />
STR: +1  WIS: +1  <br />
WT:  7.0    Size: MEDIUM<br />
Class: WAR RNG BRD ROG SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Soiled Breechclout<br />
LORE ITEM  <br />
Slot: LEGS  <br />
AC: 8<br />
WIS: +3  <br />
WT:  2.0    Size: SMALL<br />
Class: SHM BST <br />
Race: ALL<br />
<br />
Not the greatest items but better than nothing.  You could probably make 150-200pp an hour.  One or two days of killing there could net you 2kpp which would be enough to get you some decent gear.<br />
<br />
You could probably head to Karnors and pick up some rotting Jarsath armor as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After you've done that for a while, it would probably be worth going to Runnyeye for a while. The blackend alloy armour stuff that drops there isn't bad armour, and looks good too! I think you would probably need at least a partner to do this well though<br />
