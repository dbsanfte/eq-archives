<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone got info on the mistmoor revamp currently on test? I sent a testbuffed ranger in to have a peak. Everything there is deep red to a 25 now, with a few nameds on track. They started seeing invis in the tunnel just beyond the lake area (undead I think), with hits in the 200 to 500+ range (didnt live long enough to get a good sampling though). The old MM mobs are now out in LFay.<br />
<br />
So test people, lets hear some teasers :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wow! That really sounds like good news... Mistmoore is really a cool zone. Sounds interesting and alot of fun. It's about time no one really ever uses that zone anyways it's nice to see when they do stuff like this. I wonder if it will be a legends only thing? heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I wonder what this means for Black Dire? :o</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I expect that he will be in LFay along with all the other old MM mobs.<br />
<br />
I suspect that it will live at around the same time on both server sets, since we recently got an addition to the story line involving Firiona Vie getting a quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I wonder what this means for Black Dire?<br />
Buffed to level 75.  AE Rampages.  Quads for 2K+.  Has an unresistable AE that turns all cleric and druid heal spells in to their shaman level equivilant.  Spawns as part of a ring event, after (a buffed up) Mayong Mistmoore.<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, I would expect that he will be moved in to LFay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bergam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Black Dire is in LFay now, along with just about every other old named in MM.  He is unchanged.  Hes actually an easier encounter now.<br />
<br />
MM is indeed revamped.  Mobs are dark blue to a level 70. Nothing can be DC'd.  They hit from 400-700.  There are red conned named that hit from 2000-3000 and had massive AE's.  Few if any mid level named (ie Dark Blues).<br />
<br />
I did manage to 3 box a single Dark Blue named but it had 0 loot.  Probably not itemized yet.  Overall the zone is a heck of alot harder, but te aggro is still just as huge.  The zone geometry makes MM a terrible candidate for a revamp.  Pull one mob, always get 2-3.  If you dont have PAC/Hamo/Lull, prepare for a CC/multiple mob fight every single time.  <br />
<br />
As for invis to a camp, forget it, you have to fight in and fight out everytime.  Some require ITU, some are regular invis.  They are all mixed, you cant just run past 15 mobs invis since every other mob is every other type of invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm guessing there will be a flurry of folks to Mistmoore, (Along with cries in Pok &quot;Which zone is Mistmoore near?&quot; &quot;How do I get there?&quot;), lots of discussion about risk v reward and then it will be a zone for farmers only.<br />
<br />
Sorta like Cazic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Denorea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I just killed Black Dire 3 days ago in MM.  I'm just now working on my 1.0.  He was in the same spot that he was supposed to be.  Went in with a 66 sk and basically cleared the zone to the castle.  I never really hunted in MM before, so I was unsure what to expect.  Sheesh I need to explore more.  I must have gotten to him just before the move. Glad I did, because I wouldn't have known where to find him.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I can already feel the rumbling of the trains....  &quot;train to zone!!&quot; followed by a TRUE train.  No one has experienced a real fear inspiring train until they've seen one in Mistmoore.  And I'm not talking seeing it as a level 65 AE'ing the zone, I'm talking about when mobs were dark blue/white/yelow/red to you, when you dare not pull too many at once, when runners were very very bad...  man I can't wait to go back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I hope they leave in the &quot;Runner&quot;<br />
that was one of the things I absolutly loved about MM, on mob near the Gy who runs for the castle the second he takes any damage and sends everything he passes after you and your crew. <br />
yeah the trains in MM are amazing, I will miss my favorite pl spot though, nothing beats MM for a pbae pl session. take you from 20 to 30 in no time at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What does this mean for those that are Faction Hunting in there?  Going to AE/Slaughter in Lfay now?  Or they give better faction hits in MM?<br />
<br />
*sigh* better burn through RoS faction before the change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Anyone wanna bet they add new quests that require /ally Mayongg Mistmoore faction?<br />
<br />

Heh after all the time I spent in HS I might be getting close to Ally to Mayongg, I know I'm way KOS to its inhabitants though</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">What other zones are revamped?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Another one bites the dust.<br />
<br />
Can't wait until Blackburrow is Qvic +</div></div><hr />

I remember one time when I was a Guide getting a petition about a missing corpse in MM.  The CS zone in point there is the same as the normal zone in (that's not always the case) and when I zoned in, i was standing on all the mobs!  It looked like they had pulled everything all the way from the castle to ZI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Another one bites the dust.<br />

thought Paw was getting the revamp ot blackburrow<br />
right race to pound on though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Katgo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Man I only hope that with the upgraded mobs the faction hits for ROS will be upgraded as well. then again the idea of having  mistmore faction to do quests would be cool as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">thought Paw was getting the revamp ot blackburrow<br />
<br />
No point in upgrading blackburrow ... how would newbies travel to and from EF/Halas/Perma if they don't have PoP or LDoN if they have to run through a level 70 zone?<br />
<br />
Must be splitpaw ... which has some serious pathing issues still. (I was PLing my Rogue and got a train of about 12 off of a runner that resisted root.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I just spent some time there with a low level twink.  I hope they cleaned up the wierd pathing there.  Too bad to lose this for lowbies, but it might be nice for the rest of us, assuming there are drops decent enough to get folks in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I loved MM. The trains there were legendary, one in particular I remember there were so many mobs pouring out of the castle and over the edge it looked like a waterfall. The amount of mobs that ended up at ZI was insane, it took 20 minutes for them all to clear. Good times, good times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There was a patch a while back that made PoK available to all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>frynque</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">that would suck if they are revamping paw.  i hope its BB.  paw is the single best source of finesteel (HQ ore) for smithing purposes.  making it an uber zone would suck so hard, it would put nyc ho's out of business.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">After spending the last week or so for 2-3 hours a day in MM working faction up to finish various VP quests...zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.....I would be interested to see if the new MM mobs would be on the old MM vs. RoS/Bards faction system or something different.  Could be kinda fun to do factioning in a zone with a challenge and exp. to be gained. <br />
<br />
What is the lore behind Mayong Mistmoore and Ring of Scale being opposed anyway?  I never quite understood that...I mean, do dragons just have a thing against dark gothic creatures??<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway just thinking out loud.  Could be some fun trains in the making!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">To raise your VP all you need to do is sit in that house in Quenos with pooch on guard, and then go to sleep. When you wake up the next morning you'll be max ally to RoS (and surrounded by mountains of rotting bard corpses). That is, unless they nerfed the faction that guy gives.</div></div><hr />

That's kind of the point I think and why a zones like CT and MM are great for revamping :)</div></div><hr />

Yes they did.  Expect to spend 2-3 nights now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>ladikennoch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">THANKS for the info...will try this later...can you be a little more specific as to where in Q to find this house?<br />

:)  :)  :)<br />

(Fluffy will love this job...)<br />

[edit] -- found the old threads on this NPC, vicus nonad (I laugh everytime I say it) and Fluffy did indeed like that job!  I now have my http://lucy.allakhazam.com/item.html?id=69388 !  :)<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info guys--and still looking forward to that MM revamp.</div></div><hr />
