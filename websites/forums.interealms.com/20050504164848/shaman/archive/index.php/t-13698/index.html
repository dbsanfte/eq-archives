Ok seriously, this was supposed to be a 2 hour maintenance period, and EQ is still down 11 hours afterwards, what's going on?  Do these people have the slightest clue what they're doing?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have it on good authority that not only is that a picture of SOE staff, but it's actually the QA department.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That would explain why the servers are always down for. Because they are using gateway computers.</div></div><hr />

I heard they had to put that &quot;Computers&quot; sign there, because some of the QA department were trying to test the Urinals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The servers were up at the scheduled time of the original patch message.  I was playing for several hours as the only person on Fennin Ro from 5am PDT til aroun 7:30am PDT.<br />

Just had to use a login server that worked.</div></div><hr />
