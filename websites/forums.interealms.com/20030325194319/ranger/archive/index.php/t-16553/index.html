<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Corenia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've leveled a few levels since my last post, seen a few more things. This refers to something that happened not long after the incident in my last post (if you must, refer to femmes and rangers getting the beatdown). Where did it happen, you ask? You guessed it, the out of character capital of the world (or Kunark at least) - Lake Of Ill Omen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Honestly, I'm sick and tired of high levels thinking they're hot (dirty expletive here). I know most of them actually are, but some of them are total pricks about it. For instance, my silent enemy, Draicon. I will not mention the name of his guild, because the rest of them are pretty decent. One day, the same friend forementioned in my last post, Xzone, and I, were clearing out the inside of the sarnak fort. And on comes this level 65 airhead (who shouldn't even be there in the first place - as there was no raid planned for the day), bringing the Advisor and all of his cronies with him. Of course, he killed me, almost killed my friend.&lt;br&gt;&lt;Br&gt;I sent him numerous tells, petitioned him, sent more, and did he reply? absolutely not. now i'm sure he wasn't sitting at his computer chuckling &quot;hehe, i'll pull the advisor and kill these newbs..hee hee!&quot;, but the least he could do was apologize and if he couldn't even do that he could have had the decency to reply to my tells. whatever. i've moved on. it's just something that bothered me a lot then.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;so this is my request for all of the leveling fennin ro players out there: when you're a higher level than me, don't be an ass. as the newbies would say -- kthxbi.&lt;br&gt;&lt;bR&gt;(the level on my sig is wrong, i'm too lazy to change it =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You think that's bad, just try Rathe Mountains. I went there and got about 3 yellows/golds, then left. Couldn't stand the place. Events that occur there are :<br />
<br />
1.   Everyone will KS you without a second thought unless you can kill the HG in like 10 seconds.<br />
<br />
2.   Everyone will train you just to get you out of the zone.<br />
<br />
3.   Anyone over level 50 in the zone will steal your mobs. If you complain they will either duel you or train you. If you see anyone lvl50 or abovein the zone, leave. Because you will not be able to pull a single HG until they leave the zone.<br />
<br />
4.   Anyone having trouble with a pull will immediately run to you in the hope that the mobs will aggro you and thus leave them alone.<br />
<br />
5.   If you are too successful in your pulls, everyone will ooc/shout that you have KS'ed their mobs, even when they're on the other side of the hill.<br />
<br />
The moral of the story is, don't go to RM. Unless you really want to experience EQ at its worse that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In Nagafen's Lair, a Raid is forming to go kill Nagafen, when a level 65 Gnome comes on in. No one thinks anything of it, assuming he intends to kill the efreeti.<br />
<br />
I was not a part of this raid, I was actually in the window room with a few friends.<br />
<br />
The next thing I know, I see tons of ocs and shouts &quot;Who the hell pulled the BNB, half the Kobolds, and the LDC?!&quot; &quot;Ahh! Raid getting wiped!&quot; &quot;Zone Out!&quot;<br />
<br />
Apparently this Necro has enough spells, and skill, to pull the BNB, LDC and half the Kobolds to the entrance and train the raid, where he FD'd immediately.<br />
<br />
This kind of thing happened regularly for a few days. <br />
<br />
Nagafen's Lair is WORSE than Karnor's Castle for trains on Lanys. In Karnor's There is a train approximately every 5 minutes. In Sol B, there is a Train every 2 minutes on the dot, and sometimes thatv train doesn't LEAVE for 5 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dalantia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That sora thing is why I never visit lower level zones as Dal unless I have a purpose.  If I have a purpose, I fulfill it and leave.  No muss, no fuss..<br />
<br />
On a side note, the Chancellor of Di'Zok is something for the Howling Stones key.  I fought my way in with a friend, killed him, and got out fast.  That may have been what that 65 was after, but I doubt that.    &gt;_&lt;  The least he could have done was respond to tells, I agree, or try to find a resurrection.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ohhhh yes SolB, I remember it well. 1st time I went there, my wizy buddy and I zoned in an, guess wha ? Train sitting right at the zone. We zone out , wai 5 minutes, zone back in and guess what...yes, train at zone...again. We zone out wait a couple more minutes and zone back in, move around the corner and guess what...train. This proceeded to occur for the next hour at which point me and my buddy decided to just leave try Guk instead.<br />
<br />
I kept wondering why people kept on trainig the zone and then a 56 enchanter told me that usually there are mid-level players who cannot fight their way to the LDC or the SS but they want the drops, so they just buff up a tank and sow him, have him run to the targets and then pull back to the zone, at which point their group will attempt to kill the targets at the zone, loot and then zone out.<br />
<br />
After that I made it a rule never to zone in from the front of SolB unless someone I know asks me to help with a CR. That is my only exception to the rule.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">On a different note, my mate and I were killing Wyverns and Enticers last night and a Level 65 character accidentally trained a Drake onto me...very short fight that ended with the Drake picking Ashke-bits from between her teeth. <br />
  When we popped back in for the CR, lo and behold, the guy was waiting for us, gave us both a 96% rezz and some groovy buffs.<br />
  Just when you think there are only jerks left in the world....someone does something nice. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aranuil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Those of you complaining about Sol B...  There are 5 different entrances to Sol B.  If the zone in is trained, go through Sol A and enjoy a nice safe camp spot.  The only reason I say this is because I happen to really like Sol B, and I think it's probably one of the safest, easiest, best places to take a melee character from level 30ish to level 54ish (though I'd recommend leaving around 51/52).<br />
<br />
Regarding the lair, unless the traing consists of imps and lava guardians, if you can't handle the train (I am NOT advocating training here), your raid is probably doomed to fail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>clailya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">LOL. on tunare you cant even find more than 5 people in solb unless it is a raid anymore. tunare is so old, so over crowded, and we have 6 uber guilds now that can take kael and up.<br />
<br />
PoP made it so every high level dungeon cleared out and now you go to seb- not more than 15 people same with karnors same with velks same with kael. its paradise for people with out PoP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sure made soloing that last yellow to 61 in Velk's hella easy.</div></div><hr />
