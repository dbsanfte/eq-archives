Seriously though from what I've gathered from the few times I've actually got anywhere... They are having some severe network issues it seem, there is some problems with the servers and also at least one new bug which may bring the servers down. The faction messages are incorrect. The first faction message is being reproduced for the following lines of differant faction messages.</div></div><hr />
