<br />
For those who don't know: Healing Boon is an OOW AA (3 ranks, 3/6/9 AA, Required level of 66) that will allow our HOT's to have a crit tick.<br />
<br />
The question: Have any of you actually seen a crit tick? I have level one of Healing Boon (had it since the week after OOW came out), and have yet to see a crit tick. By &quot;see a crit tick,&quot; I mean the crit showing up in parenthesis like exceptional heals do on our direct heals (Tnarg's and Daluda's for example). Does Healing Boon put the crit tick in parenthesis, or does it just quietly double that particular tick with no notification to the player?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.<br />

I haven't checked HP bars close enough to see if it has silently doubled, but I get the sense it might have a time or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I assume that HoT crits are handled like Critical Affliction in which you do not see a message indicating a crit happened.  It would be nice of SOE to add crit messages to DoTs as well as our HoTs.  Or, at the very least, have HoTs display heals per tick.</div></div><hr />

The extra spam wouldn't be that much appreciated. Granted to keep them timed out nicely it would be a good bonus, but in general not sure if I'd actually want it.<br />

I would want to see a message really put it as something you can filter out if you don't want I would like to see a message so I could at least do some parsings to see exactly what the %'s are that it does crit.<br />
<br />
Although I think once I get spiritual serenity with those 1640 heal crits it should be more noticable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xilrasis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have seen it crit but it doesnt tell you anything, Only reason i know this is i have seen my BoT (630 base) Heal in one tick over 1k. Its really hard to spot cause i dont watch my life during every tick but it does work and i have all 3 lvls and it makes a huge difference. I normally run around with 9.5k hp unbuffed warrior, being the main healer it was a great selection for me. As for acutal %, i couldnt begin to guess.<br />
<br />
Also for those shm on pvp servers HoT's are your best pvp defence. I always keep it ticking in mass pvp. And no caster can out dps ur HoT's in small grp battles.</div></div><hr />
