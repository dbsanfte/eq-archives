I know its funny to read and I found myself laughing until I got to the Shaman part.  It made me stop laughing almost instantly.  Maybe I am just too bitter.  /shrug. <br />
<br />
It just pisses me off.  The average player really has no clue when it comes to Shaman.  Really though, why should they?  As long as the buff icons are in front of them and the &quot;Slowed Mob_001 with Turgur's&quot; flashes by when they expect to see it,even if it is only for partial effect.<br />
<br />
Had a warrior ask me the other day what Partial slow is,  He thought it was like 70% slowed.  Then the group started spouting what percentage they thought it was.  Nobody got it right.  I didnt say anything.  Cleric said, &quot;Couldn't tell ya, I normally dont even have a slower in my exp groups any more.&quot;  <br />
<br />
/Weeeeeeeee<br />
<br />
Off to solo everything!</div></div><hr />

Where in the name of the Tribunal is he hunting? Sol B?<br />
<br />
I can't remember the last time I DIDN'T have a slower in my group................<br />
<br />
Oh wait...<br />
<br />
Anyway, if the MOB isn't slowed, somebody is getting violated.  This includes when we used the &quot;CPOD&quot;(*) (tm).<br />
