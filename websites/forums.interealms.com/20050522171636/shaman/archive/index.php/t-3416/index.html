<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Doh...before the smithing nerf I made:<br />
<br />
Metal bits<br />
toolboxes<br />
skewers to 115<br />
banded boots to 135<br />
banded cloaks to 175<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how to do it since they redid the trivials.<br />
<br />
Check out eqtraders.com  this site is amazing for tradeskills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Oh. my. God.<br />
<br />
I just went and looked at the new smithing trivials.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">it's well near impossible. give up now. <br />
<br />
just kidding, but prepare to spend an arseload of money on it either way with the new trivials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Astjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AHHH u guys wouldnt belive how much ive spent. Plz someone atleast gimmie something other to make the chainmaill crap. All im going to say is ive spent over 300pp in this already and im not gonna stop</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Agree totally Gloriana, toolboxes were the ONLY way to fund  your smithing skill before the nerf unless you had higher level chars to dump some cash on you.  I'm not sure if / what the new smithing toolbox equivalent is.  If your pottery skill or baking skill is decent there are a few recipies similar to the toolbox (I wont go into detail to avoid the nerf stick but do some research and you'll find them).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">300pp?!?  What the heck?!?  To raise just about any tradeskill to the 200ish level, better be ready to spend 10,000pp or more, except for maybe brewing.<br />
<br />
300pp is NOTHING for smithing.  Heck, 3000pp is nothing. :p  I spent that getting to 190 skill before the nerf.  It's horribly expensive now, and time consuming.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Best bet is to go here -----&gt;EQ Traders (http://www.eqtraders.com) <br />
<br />
Great message board, every recipe out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You're not gonna like this...<br />
<br />
Banded up to 115<br />
Ornate Chain up to 142<br />
Fine Plate up to 188<br />
<br />
Post fine plate, you really only have 3 viable options:<br />
<br />
Acrylia Chain and Plate<br />
Shadow Scream Steel Armor<br />
Old Cultural<br />
<br />
These three all require significant farming for temper/material components.<br />
<br />
Remember, EQTraders is your best source for Smithing info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Estopidiera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Actually 116 is easy to get making arrowheads from chunks of condensed shadow in Akheva. At that point it gets tougher though, and I'm still making the darned ornate chainmail.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">The good news is, that post FS plate, you hardly spend any money on smithing. The bad news is, give up on the idea on getting experience or going on raids &amp; quests.<br />
<br />
Even though I'm spending about 90% of my time farming for smithing supplies now (skill 205) I'm finding that peeps like the froots of my labor, like Acrylia Plate. The BP alone is AC 30 plus a few stats. Makes the wearer look like a death machine robot.<br />
<br />
Looks like I'm currently the higest troll smith on my server, so I'm hoping to attempt new cultural weapons before too long. Plus, the SKs in my guild are jonesin' for Black Acylia Halberds. Forget SoF, I want that uber smithing hammer!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Luxo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Just so you non-EQTrader board trolls (like me) know, a Black Acrylia Halberd is:<br />

<br />
Seriously, if you are concerned with spending 300p on smithing, you need to look into either marketing what you can make at your skill level to make more money, or marketing another skill to make more money to skill up on smithing, or leveling and finding other ways to make money to skill up smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think the best thing to make from 150ish to 182ish are components for the mistletoe sickle for potc.    The blade isnt that expensive at like 2 emeralds per attempt plus a few minor items.  The only hard part is finding a tunare folllower to imbue emeralds for you.  The other 2 parts are a bit more expensive requiring a ruby and sapphire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Alandrel Mesmer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can make the curved blade portion of the mistletoe sickle using only 2 emeralds, 1 mistletoe temper, 1 curved blade mold, and 1 celetial essence. In addition you need to turn one of the emeralds into essence of tunare which requires a tunare druid or cleric to imbue the emerald, a jar of acid, and an additional celetial essence.<br />
<br />
After all is said and done this will take you to about 188 trivial level but it will cost you about 37pp per try.<br />
<br />
And keep in mind the curved blade itself is useless without the hilt and pommel. The hilt requires a ruby in place of one of the emeralds and a hilt mold. The pommel requires a sapphire and a pommel mold.<br />
<br />
Combining all 3 of these to make a sickle is not trivial at 250 skill and the success rate is about 1 in 3 tries at 250 skill.<br />
<br />
eqtraders.com has all the recipes and sub-recipes.<br />
<br />
Not a way to skillup for the faint of heart. A good estimate on using sickles from 188 to 250 is about 900000pp.</div></div><hr />
