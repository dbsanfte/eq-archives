<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>n0id</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a guide somplace that has a guide thru at least the first 8 rings for shamans...i know of a druid one, but couldnt find a shaman one<br />
<br />
Looking for a guide for the solo shaman, (i know the higher rings require a few extra bodies)<br />
<br />
Any help to links is appreciated :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'm working on a solo shaman guide. Hope to have it here by this weekend. I'm lvl 55 and have soloed the first 7 rings so far with VERY mediocre gear, a lot a patience, other people's general guides and more than a couple of horrible, horrible deaths.<br />
<br />
It's been a blast. 8)<br />
<br />
I'll give you the basic rundown so far though; you might have to check a general guide on the quests to understand some of the references. It's 1:30 in the morning and I'm about to crash, so might be a bit vague. I'll try to fix that soon.<br />
<br />
Assuming you're level 55. Can't say much prior to that except that the quests definitely scale in difficulty as you get farther into the quest. <br />
<br />
Ring 1: the blanket. Time sink city, but easy enough if you're patient. No real point in creating a guide imo, but the tailoring part kinda stinks. So, get someone with a good tailoring skill to MQ the 2nd ring for you if you don't want to bother getting your tailoring skill up. I wanted to SOLO these (with the exception of C3 being cast on me) to see if it could be done, so I farmed all the spiders and kittys and got my tailoring skill up to 82. Blanket was trivial and had no problems.<br />
<br />
Ring 2. Easy to clear the front of the giant fort and the orc fort and the two guards at the prison. Just takes forever to follow the little baggage around. Rabid Kodiak was light blue and died with 55 dogdog an ebolt and one blast of venom cuz i was already bored.<br />
<br />
Ring 3. Another easy timesink. I forged nothing but javelins to get my smithing skill high enough. <br />
<br />
Ring 4: Summon a dog. Turn off his taunt. Start the quest by talking to Tain. &quot;I will help.&quot; LET THEM KILL TAIN. Target a NONnamed giant and root him. Flee. Target another NONnamed. Root him. Flee. Rinse repeat till all the other giants are rooted, then fleee some more. When you're WAAAAAY out of their aggro range, slow the named and kill as usual. Tank in teh face, root/rot, dog kite. Whatever floats yer boat. This one's pretty easy. Loot the blue vial. Come back a couple hours later. Find Tain. &quot;I will help.&quot; hand him the elixer. Boogy on about your business.<br />
<br />
Ring 5: Buy invasion plans in the bazaar. Go to camp. Whip up a dog. Park the dog OUT OF AGGRO RANGE. I suggest several hundred yards to the East of the camp. You WILL take damage doing this. The last thing you want is the dog jumping into things at the wrong moment.<br />
<br />
Turn in plans. Target NONnamed. Root. Run AWAY from the dorf camp. You don't want them KSing you. Rinse repeat until only Scarbrow is chasing you. If dog is nearby, sic him. If not, dot, dot and NUKE this sucker. He will hand you your arse if you give him time or if you don't get away from the others that spawn with him. You need to watch your health bar. These are all casters and they will all try to nuke/debuff you. This was deaths 1 and 2 for me.<br />
<br />
Ring 6: Kill Rodrick Tardok. Don't even try to slow or dot him. When you find him up, summon a dog, HP buff and regen for dog and yourself. Haste and project alpha. Pull rodrick (away from the emmisary's path if he's still up cuz if he adds you'll end up zoning them.) then play cleric for your dog. Just heal, canni, heal, canni, heal canni. Loot head and dagger. Death #3 when I realized he was a ROGUE and I had cannied myself too far trying to land a bunch of useless spells on him and went OOM so I turned to run. LOADING PLEASE WAIT. Light blue at 55. Don't believe it for a second.<br />
<br />
Talk to Korgain. Follow icefang. Park your dogdog at IC bridge. Let icefang die. Root nonnamed as above until only Poxbreath is left. Run to dog. Dog will aggro root him. You dot, dot nuke etc. Again these are all casters and will gladly show you what your spleen looks like if you mess around. Watch the hp bar (Death #4. Are you seeing a pattern here? /grin). Loot the note. Go see garadain. etc.<br />
<br />
ring 7: At the prison. Summon dogdog. Buff with all ya got. Project alpha. Park him in the trees in the depression where the hut with the warden is. Don't get TOO far away. Warden runs toward the ocean when he's low health. If he's too far from spawn point he gates. Pull the warden with burst of flame. Might as well save the mana cuz you're NOT GOING TO STICK ANYTHING ELSE ON HIM. I tried ID and PoI, Ebolt, Plague, Turgurs, VoS the first two times. I wasted a whole lot of time and mana. Play cleric for your dog. That's your mission. Loot key. Clear all the stuff near Corbin. Hail him. hand him the key. Follow him. When he says, &quot;They are on us.&quot; AGGRO him and run East and slightly north immediately. The giants and orcs spawn and just stand there looking stupid. run due east to water, then south a bit. That's the camp. Root him. Camp, come back. Follow him to camp and wait. Eventually Dobbin will ask for the ring. Give it to him. you get a note. Give that note to Garadain, and you have your 7th ring.<br />
<br />
I realize this is hard to read and incomplete. I apologize, but I have to get some sleep now. I'll try to tidy this up and get a guide up.<br />
<br />
Nite</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I found the monk guides helpful when I solo'd my rings.<br />
<br />
http://www.monkly-business.com/articles2.asp?ArticleNum=97<br />
<br />
There's some info on this post on how to solo ring 8:  http://pub147.ezboard.com/fmonklybusiness43508frm2.showMessage?topicID=390.topic<br />
<br />
Of course you can't do things like use FD for ring 7 but just follow Haed's guide.<br />
<br />
The only other thing I have to add is I was able to single pull most of the named mobs so you won't have to do the root parking thing depending, I think I was around level 59 or 60 when I did this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ring 8 solo at level 60.  turn in marching orders.  invis.  run to fort.  pull chief (dark blue) when he spawns (easily single pulled at 60).  slow.  dot. root.  loot his head.  invis.  run over the hill and wait for the dwarves to fall in and buddy to give his speech. wait til dwarves are given charge order.  hand in head. get ring.  go home.<br />
<br />
you can hand in the head asap but the war will never happen and the giants at the fort do not despawn anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Nzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">For 7th Ring quest, Get a FDer save you alot of Time. as monkly bussiness guide tell you how to do it.</div></div><hr />
