<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I had some good ideas and help yesterday in /gu, but nothing I tried ended up working.  Posted to EQ's tech support board but it doesn't look like anyone there cares or has an idea of what to do, so I thouht I would try here.<br />
<br />
Everything in the game has been working swell but yesterday when I went into Echo Caverns to farm some plats I noticed that the outcast mutants looked extra mutated -- to the point that their graphics were broken.  Also Crazy Pete looks about the same if you are familiar with that mob there, and the bogler aliens look like they are wearing blue suits instead of being a solid red-violet color like usual.  Mobs elsewhere in the world, as far as I can see look ok.  I've posted screenshots below.<br />
<br />
I used the repair tool on the Luclin CD but that didn't work.  I updated my video drivers, no luck.  I deleted all of the echo caverns files from my HD and repatched - nope.  Zoned and camped a few times - nada.  Asked a few people if they saw what I did, and everything looked normal to them.  I even scrubbed my ram and had 80% free to work with and that didn't help either.  It's not a major issue, but it's kind of strange to look at, andif it's started to happen here, I'm hoping it doesn't spread.  If anyone has any ideas as to what to do I'd appreciate some help :)<br />

Thanks!<br />

Look for some S3D files that have the word Global in it.  These are global textures that these creatures most likely are part of, and not particular to Echo Caverns.</div></div><hr />
