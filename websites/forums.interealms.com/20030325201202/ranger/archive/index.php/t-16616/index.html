<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ranga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I play a 63 ranger with access to 3 PCs and a 60 cleric and 60 shaman.  I've only done limited dual-boxing to this point, but at 63 there isn't much I can solo so I'm looking for suggestions on spots to safely tri-box for aaxp.  Obviously no crowd control with this setup, so a place that can be single pulled and that is away from the common 'train tracks' would be convenient.  Suggestions?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">All I know is your pretty much limited to PoP only if you want to get XP for the ranger (which I think you do) so your all gonna have to go to PoP.<br />
<br />
IMO though get the 2 other comps flagged for Tier 2 or 3 (best you can) as the Cleric and Shaman are in high demand, just let the ranger come with em as an xtra dmg dealer and you'll get groups (prolly need to start em) fast. Unfortunatly that is the exetent of my knowledge</div></div><hr />
