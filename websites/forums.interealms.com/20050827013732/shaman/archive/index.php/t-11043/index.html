<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wanedorf Arcticbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well i started a warrior shaman duo with me and my brother.  Was wondering if this is good at higher level, we play on sullon zek so pvp tips are helpfull.  Any tactics and stuff i should be aware of?  We are both almost to level 9 thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I am not a Zek player but sham war is a good combo.  Not the best dps but the war has lots of hp and lots of gear that you can get for cheap. <br />
<br />
You can duo to 60 easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">excellant choice , perhaps the most over looked duo in the game. the warrior can take a beating and the shaman can keep on healing for a fairly long time with can1/2/3/4/5  thats a duo you can take beyond 60 easily</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman/war will work just fine if that's what you want to play. <br />
<br />
I'd recommend you to chose a shaman/hybrid duo, tho'... for a similar duo but with a bit easier future on a Zek server. SK, ranger and paladin (depending on what team you went for) all are excellent partners for a shaman both in PvP and PvE, and they complement the shaman in PvP better IMO than any pure melee type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wildane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shaman + pretty much any melee is a good combo.  With the slows you'll get, even a ranger can tank :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My roommate plays a warrior. I'd say for about 70 percent of our exp gained we duo'd. Level 58 now. Could another class have been more effective? Possibly, but its still quite fun. I gain exp better with just him than in more filled out groups. Recently we added a mage to our duo, and that worked quite well also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Nothing wrong with a warrior but on a PvP server an SK would probably be a much better choice. Hell even on a non PvP server I prefer an SK because they make such a great aggro magnet and complement us so well with snare, fear, FD splitting. DPS is lower than a warrior but it's worth giving it up over the utility and far superior aggro control. They can also summon your body in case the dung hits the proverbial fan.<br />
<br />
High level SKs are just plain scary PvPers. They have the complete tool set and plenty of toys like the prenerf circlet of shadow to drive you nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wanedorf Arcticbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First choice would have been sk, but we are on team neutral so thats not available.  Went warrior because of the sick hps he can garner, and cheap good equips.  Sham buffed warrior is pretty sick.  Hehe thanks for all the replies, keep em comin!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Shaman and Warrior is a workable duo but not the best.  You're better off with a knight, but if that isn't an option because of teams restrictions, then warrior will work fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm surprised not very many people (or any that I have seen) suggest ranger/shaman.  Rangers are able to buff themselves up pretty well, almost everything stacks with their lines, and they have a nice 10-minute snare to boot.<br />
<br />
Sure, rangers can't tank as well as warriors and knights, but with slow I haven't had any problems.  A good ranger with decent AC (mine's only 1100ish with 3k hp) does pretty well against xp-grind mobs, and doesn't need too much healing.  Add damage shields and you've got yourself a party!<br />
<br />
I just can't imagine a situation where the extra ac/hp of a warrior would be so much more useful that I would ditch my ranger for two-boxing, and I will readily admit that warriors are better than rangers for many things.  The only class I would consider trading my ranger for would be an SK...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jinin Raine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I 2 box with a warrior/shaman combo. Works great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Any duo works great with a Shaman, except cleric.  Even dr00ds (snare kiting) and wizzies (they do the heavy damage, and we keep the mob in line) work.<br />
<br />
Personally, Monk, Chanter and Mage are my three fave combo's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Enkidu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I started a warrior and it's a nice combo BUT at higher levels I hate the warriors gimped ability to take and hold agro. Pallies are great for holding agro and their heals and rezes are nice at higher levels. SKs are almost as good at pulling as monks if not better due to their ability to snare which makes splitting mobs easier. Rangers have great DPS and buffs but are not good tanks IMHO (which is about close to worthless but I'm offering my opinion anyways :P) due to their lower AC and HPs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xanden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Heck, when a mob is 75% slowed, my pet tanks well.  The ranger's lack of hp/ac is not as important as his ability to keep mobs on him using flame lick/snare, and with Regrowth my ranger tanks slowed gorangas and usually loses only about 10% hp through the fight.  After all, high hp in an exp group is usually only useful when you have someone who can CH... otherwise, it's just a larger buffer before death.  My Superior Heal heals 583 damage if my ranger has 3k or 6k hp, and I don't feel like his AC is causing any undue hp loss.<br />
<br />
Snare, DS, and fast, cheap aggro-gaining spells are strategically more useful than better pally heals and controllable stuns, in my opinion.  I mean real snare, not that fake Inny snare.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">No question it makes for a great combo. I'm still surprised at how under rated Shaman are. I have to admit that even with a Druid Main, a Shaman to me seems to have much better advantage game wise over most casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Warrior can hold aggro just fine in a duo with a shaman, if the shaman knows how to control aggro in the first place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like to group with druids the best.<br />
Charm + PoP = 45 minute AAs thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">even with a Druid Main, a Shaman to me seems to have much better advantage game wise over most casters<br />
My old main was a druid.  When it came time to kill the corrupted seafury cyclops in OOT for his epic, he died 3 times trying.  He was level 60 with superb gear.  I took my monk out there, he too was level 60 with superb gear.  First try I had to FD.  Second try I busted out the slowstone (rare drop in PoH, 3 charges of chanter slow) and made it, but by the skin of my teeth.  Even slowed he did a lot of damage to me, and I had to use ID alot.  I would have died but for my last ID attempt working (if it had failed, R.I.P. me).<br />
<br />
My shaman killed this guy very easily solo at 52, with low-mid end gear.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
K now, as far as a duo, I'm in the same boat.  I've narrowed the choice down to Ranger or Shadowknight.  I would prefer the utility of the ranger, but am a tad concerned about his tanking ability in upper-end places in PoP.  I would think that without a CH, hp total wouldn't matter - but many people say it does.  Will a ranger be able to tank for my 2-box setup in PoP, or will I wish I had gone SK?</div></div><hr />
