<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shavas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I decided  to do this quest  for the extended affliction 3 effect now on the bracer.  I was allied to dwarves and scowling with the giants.  I killed coldains until they were all the way down to scowling and the giants were all the way up to amiable(after I had done the dwarf parts of quest)<br />
<br />
Now even though most giants are amiable, the ones near bank are still scowling.  What faction are they on?<br />
<br />
And the larger problem is that the Giant Wolf Tamer is not there from what I can tell.... does anyone know where he is if not under that ledge with all the drakkel dire wolves near bank?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
