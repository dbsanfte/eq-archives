<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since the unexpected patch on Saturday afternoon Pacific Time, I've seemed to notice an increase in NPC resistances.  Before that patch we were hunting in City of Mist and things were going reasonably well, with what seemed like normal amount of resists on slow, root, and JBB blasts.  However, after the patch I've had serious trouble landing slow (more than once slow got resisted five times in a row, for example), Enstill either gets resisted or breaks after a few seconds more often than not, and JBB resistance is almost as bad as slow resists.<br />
<br />
In effect, the drain on my mana pool has increased, and the fights are more precarious ... or so it seems at least.  Has anyone else noticed anything similar, or is it just my perception?  I've spoken with a few people who say they've noticed an increase in the NPC mobs' resistances, but nothing's been said here.  Any comments?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yup.   Died twice at the entrance to Hole.  Pulled 2 mobs, one light blue, the other dark blue.   1 resist on dark blue, 3 resists on light blue, root stuck but broke right away, root resisted, died.<br />
<br />
Cleaned up mess, got rezzed, cleared my way back, pulled one elemental &amp; rock golem, 3 resists of slow, 2 resists of root, died again.<br />
<br />
Not a fun night<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Anything that could be classified as a &quot;summoned&quot; creature just got a huge boost to resists.  Skeleton pets of Conscripts and necro snarks are now FAR more resistant than their NPC owners.  I suggest you avoid &quot;pets&quot; whether they be elementals or skeletons or dogs.  Pets got a big upgrade with the patch.  The Hole is one place where a druid can cast &quot;Banish&quot; on most any elemental in there and instantly poof it.  That means they count as summoned creatures and summoned creatures got an increase in resistance . . no idea of what exactly the mechanics of increasing the resistances of pets were.  I just know that it made pets far more resistant than they truly ought to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I seriously wonder whether it's an intentional nerf or a bug;  some of the fights we've been in have been next to impossible since the changes, so I dearly hope it's not an intentional nerf of our already resist-prone abilities :( <br />
<br />
Incidentally, in that patch that seemed to start the resist issue, VI changed something with the pets, and it's awfully close to the time when they messed with the pet resists.  Maybe they did a haphazard job of re-adjusting the pets in that patch and increased NPC resists as well (or instead...).  Weird logic, I know, but it's plausible :)<br />
<br />
Landragoran, the mobs in City of Mist tend to be either undead or golems, and both seem to have similar resists, so it's not just summoned creatures in general.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How do you know they aren't classified as summoned mobs in CoM?  I must say, I refrained from commenting on CoM mobs because you didn't give specific examples.  If you'd mentioned a golem or a wraith or whatever, perhaps I'd have more insight.  But you just said mobs in general.  For all I know you're trying the reavers, in which case you will never land any spells on them that aren't flat out unresistable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I was having great trouble with Coterie in Tenebrous last night, which given that they're all light blue to me, was surprising, and annoying.<br />
<br />
Can't see them being summoned though, either they just have innate high resists or I was having a very bad night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The Vamps in TM are all undead, and being Luclin undead have stupid poison/disease resists. Don't even bother to try and think about memming spells to DoT them... or at least that's been my experience. The 200 lifetaps suck too.<br />
<br />
If summoned creatures don't have a master, like the elementals in The Hole, how do they get a boost in resistances? I understand that high level SKs with newbie pets would have some rather buffed pets now (if the resist change went in on NPCs too) but stuff that doesn't have a master should just work on it's normal resists right? Please correct me if I'm wrong...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A had a noticeably horrible time in Lake of Ill Omen against ANY mob last night...  I was getting resisted on dark and low blues prob 60% of the time... and Malise only landed once.  I made sure I voiced my displeasure to the guild, so they're all aware that there's a resistance problem with me.<br />
<br />
I was getting royally pissed, to say the least.  Light blue goblins resisting Slow 4 times in a row?  C'mon!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Unknown_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">54 shammy in The Grey last night.<br />
<br />
I was getting resists on maybe 1 in 10 casts against snakes, Golems, Worms and Rocks.<br />
<br />
Never hunted there before, so not sure if this is &quot;normal&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Those rock things in the grey have always had high resists, as far as I remember. Nearly everything in the Grey is summoned or undead.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and those Coterie, have you noticed they FLURRY!? Ok, it's not a very impressive flurry I'm sure, but when they happen to proc their 200hp lifetap on each hit, it sucks the big one.<br />
<br />
Revenge will be mine. Plus good katta faction I hope :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">green guards resisting epic dot last night,,.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Well, we just logged briefly to City of Mist to check if the mobs there are considered summoned, by trying to cast druid/ranger anti-summoned spells.  For each of the skeletons, shadows, and apparitions we tried, the spell gave the message saying it couldn't be cast on a non-summoned mob.  While we didn't specifically try golems or wraiths, I hypothesize that they're not summoned either ... hence, the summoned NPC resists should not apply to them, yet each one of them resisted every spell quite vehemently.<br />
<br />
Again, I must stress that we'd been hunting in City of Mist before that patch and hadn't encountered any unusual problems.  Also, we didn't start to notice problems after the patch that brough the pet resist changes, but rather after an emergency patch on the weekend following the patch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I hunted 6 hours in CoM last night and noticed no changes in resist rates on my end. Slow resisted maybe once every 6 or 7 mobs (I pull with slow) and stuck second go on the ones that did resist.  Maybe good luck for me for once?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Ok here's my speculation here on the MECHANICS of this pet change.  <br />
If the master of the pet isn't present, then whose resists does the pet use?  This can be the case if the master is LD or charmed at the time.  So I'm speculating that there was code written to give a base default to a summoned creature's resists, and that this default was higher than normal.  <br />
<br />
As for CoM mobs, I'm glad I didn't speculate.  Looks like merely another case of someone having a bad night (resist wise) due to the random number generator's not being that random.  &quot;streaky&quot; is the adjective I'd use to describe it actually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rakyn Vaeltaja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The random number generator must be really messed up for me, then, because out of three rounds of clearing the stable area in CoM tonight, Enstill didn't last longer than 10 seconds even once, and two or three resists for slow on majority of the mobs.  I did not get resisted that much on our previous bouts to CoM :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Inqubus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My 34 pocket chanter i keep around for clarity and alacrity (saves me mana) was even able to charm an apparition for full duration two times to help me out of a particular nasty pull on my part.  Didn't even tashanian it, i was in that much of a hurry to get 4 mobs off me.  Apparition was yellow con to chanter.  Gotta be the RNG was particularly kind to me while trying to pop the courier for my student's logs :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">no problems in 4 hours of doing mushrooms in FG.</div></div><hr />
