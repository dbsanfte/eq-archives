<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, <br />
<br />
It's been a while since I posted last. Partially because<br />
I moved and partially because my internet connection<br />
would kick me off EQ after about a half an hour. It<br />
was very annoying. Well, after getting a cable connection<br />
I could play again. It's nice to be back.<br />
<br />
But the problem I have is that I don't know where to<br />
go. I'm level 51 and guildless. It's difficult to get into<br />
a group in Seb when there are level 55 - 60 shamans<br />
LFG. Chardok is a crapshoot if anyone needs someone.<br />
I have Luclin but don't know beans about where to go.<br />
<br />
So, what can an independant level 51 do to get through<br />
this slow crawl without the aid of a guild? Should I<br />
solo OOT? Try Kael? What? <br />
<br />
It's getting so frustrating that I often just log out and<br />
play my monk alt or fire up Warcraft 3.<br />
<br />
Still, it's great to be back after too much DAoC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, if you want to just get back into the exp grindstone I would go to OOT &amp; seafurbies (BTW, it's REAL EASY to get there now so they're camped more often.  See note at bottom).  Personally I would look for someone you used to group with &amp; try to hook up.  Otherwise I would go hang out in some dungeons &amp; try to find people exping there on a regular basis, try to get in their group a couple times &amp; you'll build up some hunting buddies.  From there you can hope for a guild invite.<br />
<br />
-- Easy way to get to Seafurbies:   TD Firepots are now bindable.  Bind there, take the firepot to E FP, you'll end up on the docks.  At the end of the dock is an NPC who will teleport you to Sister Island.  Short swim from Sisters to the seafurbies.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good solo spots (if I remember correctly):<br />
<br />
Burning Woods, to about 57.  Stay away from Ancients and Wurms, but everything else should be fair game at 51.  Plus, you're near Chardok.<br />
<br />
Hole entrance, but I can't remember what level you need to be to solo pull the elementals.  They start greening out around 55, I think.  (20% exp bonus here-- level in 4/5ths of the time)<br />
<br />
Skyfire, but the chromo's are a royal pain if you don't have a tracker that can pull around them.<br />
<br />
Maiden's Eye, for when you get a little older, or get really well equipped.  This is where I spent most of 56 and 57, mainly because it is so close to the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
Wakening Lands, if you have your epic or a JBB.  Sentient suits are decent xp, without too many HPs, and can be pulled solo if you know how.  But they are totally PR and DR.  <br />
<br />
Groups:<br />
<br />
Karnors--If you are forced to go to Karnor's, get in the Hands or Basement group.  You can solo at the zone line while waiting for an opening, or just stick your head out into DL and kill some ragers.  (Hands/Warlord camp is the best (non-AE) exp I've found from 51-55.  Once you get it broken, and if you have a good puller, it's non-stop carnage.)<br />
<br />
Velketors-- Gimp city, but you can almost always get a group.  <br />
<br />
Hole-- take a group there, still the best dungeon in the game.  Stay in the pit till you get to 55.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.   Welcome back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Falora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the help all. Especially for the link, there was some great information there.<br />
<br />
I'll probably keep trying for Seb groups and do some OOT hunting as well.<br />
<br />
Also,  my best friend who is a level 60 cleric just got his clickstick last night. He's part of the local uberguild and his next major plan for life is getting me to 60 with an epic. Hey, I can go along with that.<br />
<br />
One problem I have found on a lot of the soloing posts is that the posters usually have JBB and/or the Pigsticker. I'm far from uber and don't expect either of those too soon. Hey, I'm happy that I won Jar Jar Pants the other night. So, are places like Echo Caverns, Cobalt Scar, Seafurbies, etc...still worthwhile by us non uber shamans?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help for all the years,<br />
It's great to be back!<br />

<br />
I always found duo is best if you are seeking fast xp, especially with no toys ;)<br />
<br />
Find a monk ya like, then go wherever ya want, CoM is good in the low 50's, quiet and fast xp once you know the ropes..</div></div><hr />
