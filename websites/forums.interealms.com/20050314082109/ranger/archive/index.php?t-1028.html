<br />
As  I said in  a previous thread, I am trying to find different and interesting places to hunt for my guild (comprised of mid-high 40's, and low 50's).  Thanks for the feedback btw :)  On to my question...<br />
<br />
I run through the Waking Lands a lot, and never see any groups set up around the sentient suits and giants.  Would this be a good grouping area?  I was thinking of setting a group up along the North wall and pulling giants and suits.  Anyone have any experience with this?  Is it even worth it?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />

Drop velious armor gems one in 8 suits maybe though, and about the same rate for the sentient armor.</div></div><hr />
