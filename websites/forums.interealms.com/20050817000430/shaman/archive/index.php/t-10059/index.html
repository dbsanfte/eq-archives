<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes, and yes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes and yes, but remember that the Shawl 8 focus effect has a spell casting time limit on it. It will not work on spells with a cast time of less than X seconds. I cannot remember off hand, i just know that the shawl does not work with torpor for example because torpor's cast time is too fast.</div></div><hr />

It's not cast time it's duration for the spell. Yes extension aa stack with extension focus items. Buff haste also stacks so qb + focus item = faster casting altho haste is capped at 50% of normal cast time.</div></div><hr />
