<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just a question/comment.  I was soling in maidens eye, and didn't have a mages pet kit to help ould rover.  No shiny ore stuff was dropping either.  Needless to say rover's damage output was marginal at best.  Well to make a long story short, mob dropped one of those no drop monk clubs.  No noob monks in zone hollaring for it, so I figure what the heck and loot it.  After a few minutes, I decide to give it to rover and see if he eats it, either that or just destroy it.  So I give him one.  He startes to do slightly better damage!  A little while latter another one drops.  I loot it and give him this one.  To my suprise he took this one too!  And his damage output goes up a little more.  Needless to say I was slightly suprised that he took both lore no drop weapons and used them to good effect.  :confused:  So did he use them?  Is this normal?  I think he used them because he was doing more damage than without.  Any comments would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Give the dog a dagger and you will see &quot;Jabobre pierces xmob for 60 points of damage.&quot; Give the dog a 1hb weapon and you should see the bashes message.<br />
<br />
Give the dog 1 of each and you should see both messages if he is duel weilding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pets wont use no drop weapons, do what above poster said to see if hes using the weapons you give him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Remember when you could give stuff to an NPC, then kill that NPC and loot the stuff you gave him? You couldn't give no drop stuff back then either, because otherwise you'd be able to exploit that to trade no drop gear. Same thing with pets -- if you try to give them no drop stuff, it poofs. Pet weapons must be droppable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pets can use no drop weapons.<br />
<br />
I give my pets Broken Blam sticks, which not only are no-drop, but they are also Lore.  And he goes Alpha hitting for a max of 72.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If they changed this (the reason for pets not keeping no drop items is pretty much gone now), I'll be questing that barb necklace with the no drop hammers now, thankyouverymuch.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LIES!<br />
Pets do not use no drop weapons.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Broken Blam sticks are droppable (also primary only, pet will only equip one, and in mainhand)... Best thing a broken Blam Stick is for is PLing a pet class ;) nothing like a focused, hasted levle 8 mage pet that crushes for 60 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Panou Balou</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LaughingWoman : unfortunetly it doesn't work, useless necklace.<br />
it will be sooooooooooooo cool, no ? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, Broken Blam stick = droppable.   Regular Blam Stick = NO DROP.   It is nice to see a pet hitting for 72 though, I try to keep a Blam around for when I have no mage gear to proc with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well, at least I had a lovely fantasy ALL WEEKEND.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">the reason the hammer does not work for the dogs it that it's shm only.  Has to be warrior equipable for the pet to use.  That's why you can't give the chanter pet weapons to your dog.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Dang, thought for sure it no drop.  <br />
<br />
Oopsies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, the pets can use non Warrior useable weaponry, I have on many occasions given my pet items that are ROG only for the proc and seen it use the effect.    I am pretty sure I have done a couple of SHM only weapons as well, but can't recall specifically.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The reason the hammers won't work is because they're no drop (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=6307).</div></div><hr />
