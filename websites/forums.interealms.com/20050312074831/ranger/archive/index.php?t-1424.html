<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spjamir</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">O.k. So I dinged 58 the other night in Velks (blah). I am wondering what the best way to get to 60 is the quickest. I hate velks, but, you can always get a group there. I was in velks for 3 hours and got 2 blues yesterday and I was wondering if there is a better spot. I hunt in HS whenever I can ( have a couple regular groups) but it is tough to get a group there every night.  <br />
<br />
Is it best to solo or group?<br />
<br />
Is FG better than Velks XP wise? <br />
<br />
Basically I just want to grind it out and get it over with. <br />
<br />
Suggest what you think is best , I am mainly just looking for ideas.<br />
<br />
Here are some of my stats ( in case there is some great solo spot) <br />
<br />
1010ac 2500hp Self buffed<br />
Swiftwind and earthcaller<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any input.<br />
<br />
I also want to know how long it took you to do 58-60 :)</div></div><hr />

I have 1120 ac 2800 hp self buffed and have a click haste item which makes a huge difference.   I have heard of some rangers fear kiting stuff in ww.  You might wanna try that.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sanbas</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am 58 also, with both epics and similar ac.  I have just about given up on groups on my server since its so hard for me to get into one.  The best place I have found to solo is in karnors.  Some of the mobs are light blue, but i still average a blue an hour there.  If it's starting to get crowded, grab a shaman and you can handle almost any camp in there just the two of you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Andruil</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IF you have a tolans bracer and make the thurg gate potion....<br />
<br />
Bear pits in Perma.  At 58 you can solo pull them every time.  Dire wolves and bears are animals (fear kite) and will be almost all dark blue to you up to 60.  Spiders are NOT animals and you will most likely have to shoot them full of a couple hundred arrows to effectively kill them without buying so much downtime as to be silly.<br />
<br />
The camp isn't TOO hard to get down, and with the XP modifier in that zone, you'll zoom up to 60 (and through the AA pts).  I'm still getting good xps there.  It's a bit of a pain to get to at times, and it takes a friend cleric to come rez you if things go wrong (and they will eventually), but if you bind in Halas and just gate there during down time, you can pick up plenty of xps on those days when groups just DON'T happen.<br />
<br />
Again, great xps.  Downsides include awful loot, lonely (if such bothers you -- if you do this with more than 2 people it's really not worth it..the xps just drop off), hard to get rezzed, and a pain to get out (unless voxy is up ...  she'll boot you outta zone every time if she is, just run to her lair).  Personally, I love it.  Been told that I should petition to get one of the barbarian bear hats from all the time I spend down there.<br />

I'd LOVE to try this out.  How does one get to these pits?  Anyone have some good instructions?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spjamir</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually my favorite place to group is HS but chardok is a close second..  I guess I started this thread becuase I have seen friends do 58-60 in Velks in quick time.. I do not see how , the XP really sucks there IMO.. The permafrost thing sounds interesting .. I basically want to park myself somewhere ( besides velks ) where I can log on for an hour or two and XP or log on and XP while waiting for a HS/chardok group. At a blue an hour it seems every minute is precious time lol..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falkeids Darkholme</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK here's the secret, and some rangers on Terris Thule are going to kick my arse by letting it out.  You  know those dwarfs in EW the blue ones near the giant fort? They have no faction hit ;) which doesn't matter since I'm on giant faction, so dorf killing is an all out affair.  Well I can get a bubble of blue an hour easy(KEI helps in this endeavor) on them, take no faction hit, 3 of the guards hit like sissies, top hit 70pts, but most hits are in the 9pt range.  <br />
<br />
Harmony Stone Beard, the captain and the rest, then single pull one and your off!  Never pull Stone Beard as he's not one of the easy ones and if your not prepared he will make you retreat but his buddies, they go down faster than cake.<br />
<br />
I used Switfwind, Earthcaller and Dark Cloak of the Sky so I can easily mow through them, they all have 12khp, Put up Chloro, Force, DS and my regular buffs.  Lose about a bubble of health on each of the easy ones, takes me the time of a regular snare to drop them.  If two come, snare em both, ranger mezz one(root) and deal with the other, you still will only lose about 2 bubbles of health.  <br />
<br />
Now be warned the camp becomes boring fast and you will can get sloppy, but if you want to power through 60 fast or blow through a blue of AAX in 6 kills this is the spot.<br />

Take all rights when you go thru the door to the giants, you will eventually fall down the pit and you go up a ramp, stick along the right wall and you will come to a rock, sit behind the rock and you wont ever get agroed there.  You can actually fight anything there also and nothing else will agro. I would leave the spiders up and just pull to that rock and fear kite, if it gets too close to the spiders just wait for fear to break and drag it back =)  I was getting over 1 blue an hour easy in 59 there. It is boring there but you almost never have to worry about it being camped and its great to log in for an hour or 2 and camp out each night. If you die you either get a cleric friend to come rez you or suck it up and take the exp loss though =(  Make sure you have a thurg gate potion or a shaman gate also as Vox is dead alot on my server as least.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sanjuro</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've never spent any time in Perma to be honest.  I've never killed Vox nor have I even been past the door to giants.  Not once in 3 years.  heh  Anyway, I'm assuming nothing sees invis on the way to pull spot in Perma?  One could gather that from what has been posted so far....but I was hoping for a for sure answer not an assumption.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeffr</div><div class="date">04-18-2002, 12:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are 4 giants and 1 spider on the path I described.  1 is the ice giant diplomat so he is easy normally doesnt see invis, the spider does not see invis either.  The other 3 can see invis but are not overly tough.  The first room right after the diplomat has 1 giant on each side of the room(2 total), either of them can sometimes see invis so you may need to clear them, they are weaker than the ice giants outside and I could take them both at the same time melleing(I have both epics, DCoS, 1050ac 2600HPs) so they shouldnt give you any trouble if you con them and move past.  The last giant is after the spider and around the corner before the pit.  He is a magi and I was told can sometimes see invis, he never has on me so I cant comment on his difficulty.  But once you drop down the pit nothing see's invis until on the way into Vox's lair there are 2 tentacle things that see invis.</div></div><hr />

i just helped a 60 warrior friend get 60.   My necro just hit 60.  I hit 60 with my cleric there, and am helping a 59 shaman get 60.<br />
<br />
The exp there rocks and the number of ppl in the zone is not so dense as to be prohibitive.  There have been times though when alot of ppl come for raids and run over the top of you.</div></div><hr />

Will I get owned with adds or how are the spawns spread apart?...I have quite an extensive history of fear bouncing mobs (DS raptors!), so I can probably manage two at a time....Not sure if anyone else has tried this at level 57...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calador Stormblood</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 10:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hmmm, made 58 this weekend, I normally two box a 57 cleric, I have swiftwind but not earthcaller, rather a mithril edged short sword (10/18 +2 mgc dmg), and a DCoS, I have about 1050 ac/ 2600 HP self buffed.  I prefer mobs I can strait up melee with 1 CH from the cleric (zero down time).  I made 58 on Sun Reavers/Revenants in Scarlet Desert, and am currently still there, but it's old, and I'd like to move someplace new.  How many HP do the mobs in perma have, and how hard do they hit?  Sounds like it might be a good place to look into.</div></div><hr />

I always see people talk about how great the exp is but all of them seem to have both epics and clickable haste.

I also play my cleric at the same time, so I've got a bit of healing/nuking power with me as well.  I like the idea of Perma because I know that place is dead.  I notice people mention a gate potion.  Is that because there's no way to walk out, or is it just to difficult to walk out?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I blasted through 59 there but left because I was bored to tears.  You will never run out of mobs to kill that are at least light blue.  Bears and Dire Wolves are easily fear kiteable.  Spiders can be a pain, but I just kill them anyway.  <br />
<br />
One other thing, if Vox IS up, you get a free ride to the zone whenever you need it.  There is no loot at all and either bring alot of food/water or be prepared to forage alot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if u dont wanna group and still get sick exp find a cleric to partner with and watch the exp fly in.. velks is excellent place for exp cuz mobs hit like wussies (i get hit for like 25-50).. and they only have like 4500 hp<br />
<br />
thats why yer friends lvl so fast.. once you get &quot;used&quot; to the velks thing u cant stay away... also, if u can get in frenzy watch yer bank account get bloated too cuz tons of uber loots drop there where u can sell anywhere from 4k-10k ... i twinked out my monk with about 30k of items by just hunting in velks for about a week. heh.  i think i got a little lucky though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mortok</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This post confused the hell out of me for a sec cause spjamir said he just dinged 58 but in his signature it says Warder (even Magelo does too).  Then I realized that the initial thread was started over a month ago.  People dig up the strangest posts   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sirenia Brighteye</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think im going to have to try those factionless dorfs... How does a warder far against those wihtout the sllow element of the earthcaller??? (still no freaking stone drops in PoH)<br />
<br />
Frenzy in velks is great xp. Yesterday i did 1.5 orange in 60 in just about 5 hours i think (damn 60 xp is such a relief over 59 xp :) )<br />
<br />
Also fear kiting in WW is good xp. The limiting factor there is: are there any animal type mobs up???<br />
<br />
Anyway, if there isnt, try to get a duo partner to kill wyverns with (no faction hit at all, so dont worry about your CoV factíon). After about 5 wyverns, you can be pretty sure animals will start popping again.<br />
<br />
Also The Deep is great xp. I finished up 59 there in a guildie group. Downside is that if you want to do anything other than ZI mobs, you gotta have at least a decent group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">spjamir</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 03:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">BTW , to follow up, I pretty much solo'd in velks in between groups.. Was the best XP rate I could get..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spritle</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 04:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a few warnings about Permafrost I'd like to add to save some people a lot of heartache.  <br />
<br />
Once you drop into the pit, there are only three possible ways to get out, gate/port/TL, Vox boot, or exit through Vox's lair back to elite goblin room.<br />
<br />
Do NOT drop into Vox's room if she is not there.  You will immediately be jumped on by several Ice Giants and a Priest of Nagafen.  In fact, don't even go up the ladder leading out of the pit area because the only thing up there are two Icy Terrors guarding Vox's room which are a pain in the rump.<br />
<br />
Also, if you die in the pit, getting back to your corpse can be difficult since many of the IGs will see through camo.  Sneak might hold long enough to get around the corner to the pit hallways, but you may end up dying more than once.<br />
<br />
If you are unfortunate enough to have died in Vox's room then the real screwing begins.  The two Icy Terrors guarding the entrance see right through camo as do the giants waiting just inside where your lifeless corpse will be.  To get to it would require dropping once again and being aggroed by the party of giants waiting below who will also see through camo as well as rogue sneak/hide.  You'd better have a necro handy.<br />
<br />
Perma can be good solo exp, just be warned not to go exploring beyond the pit.  The only emergency evacs for a lone Ranger are a Vox boot or Weapon Shield/Thurg Potion.  If those fail, expect exp loss and a challenging CR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Canaras</div><div class="date">05-31-2002, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thank Falkeids on the dorf info.  I've always heard about them for awhile but never got over there.  With KEI up, I have vertually no down time and saw blue movement with almost every kill.  I must have gotten a blue in about an hour and a half(amazing in 59).  When KEI ran out, I just moved my clericbot there to CH me and MoR the dorfs.  Had I been here for all of 59 instead of SG, I'd prob be 60.</div></div><hr />
