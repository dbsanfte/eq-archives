<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So we get Wailing Haze at level 10. I upgraded to Apprentice II as soon as I got it, and have tried the spell without much success until around level 15-16.<br />
<br />
I'm noticing a modest slowdown in the DPS of the mobs when using it now. I'm even considering getting the parts to make Apprentice III and maybe even trying to get my hands on a copy of Adept 1.<br />
<br />
I've noticed a pattern for spells. When you get an &quot;Upgrade&quot; for an older spell, it's not really as effective as the prior version. So when we get Keening Haze at level 24, Wailing Haze (Apprentice III or Adept 1) will probably outperform it for a few levels to come. Probably until around level 28.<br />
<br />
Are these assumptions accurate?<br />
<br />
If so, then I'll go through the trouble of hunting down a copy of Adept 1 Wailing Haze.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Am I the only one who isn't impressed by Grey Wind? (Under a similar vein). My apprentice 3 smite almost never is resisted and deals 40 dmg per strike. As for grey wind... well, at adep1 it gets resisted far too much and seems to come in at around the same damage but for more mana.<br />
<br />
I'm level 21.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />
<br />
I would prefer to use grey wind, over smite, but it just doesn't seem worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My Gray Wind is almost never resisted and deals upwards of 60 damage.  Dunno what you are seeing.<br />

Adept I Wailing Haze is definitely noticeable.  Wailing Haze does NOT work on mobs over L30.</div></div><hr />

Grey Wind supposedly has a slow component as well as the nuke, so in theory it's supposed to save you the trouble of casting Haze + Smite. I'd be interested in finding out if the slow percentage is better than W. Haze, though. I don't believe that it is.<br />
<br />
Oh how I miss Lucy's. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glaani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Are you sure that it's a slow and not a snare attached to Grey Wind?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It might be a snare, most descriptions I've seen have it listed as a slow, though.<br />
<br />
After digging through the spell list thread (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=24700), I see Mystics get &quot;Touch of the Grey&quot; at 33 and &quot;Ire of the Grey&quot; at 45, both of which are listed as Cold DD's + Snare. So it's entirely likely that all of the spell list information on Grey Wind that's been floating around came for one source which was incorrect.<br />
<br />
In anycase, I'll try it out again tonight and see what I find out.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Grey Wind has a snare, not slow. Not very useful though in EQ2 because you get lesser xp for kiting than tanking it, and I have yet to see a mob run away from me unless someone is using a fear based spell....<br />
<br />
I'll do some more testing with Grey Wind tonight. I didn't use it much during the first 3 levels I had it because it was so pitiful, but I haven't really done much testing now that I'm into the 20's.</div></div><hr />

I've got a Lapis and the recipe for Wailing Haze Adept III.. should I make it? Or use it for Spectral Ward Adept III? (Single target ward)<br />
<br />
I'm thinking if the slow is that much better, and I can use it up to level 28ish that I'll go with WH.</div></div><hr />

60 damage from Grey Wind?  What level?  I just upgraded from Grey Wind Ap1 to Ad1 but haven't used it yet.  At Ap1 it was doing just as much damage as my Smite Ap3, between 25-35 for non HO casts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I noticed a marked difference between App 2 and Ad 1 WH.<br />
<br />
As I've often said, this difference is most noticeable when facing a single, very strong mob and less noticeable when facing a group of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmmm, true enough. We face groups of mid level mobs more often than we face single high level mobs, so Adept III Spirit Ward would go further towards keeping our tank up in general than a higher slow.<br />
<br />
Btw, I've got all the scholar books for 1-9 including the advanced alchemy and sage ones (And some of the 11-14 ones too) so if anyone needs an Adept III spell made on Najena server and they have the parts I'd be happy to do the combines for them.<br />
<br />
Level 15 Alchemist and level 14 Scribe. (I know they're the same, but my Scribe has a 75 scribe skill, and my Alchemist has an 85 chemistry with racial bonus, so it works better for me that way.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tested Adept 1 grey wind at level 21 last night, and ok, I was wrong. I'm hitting between 51-55 damage, where as smite apprentice III is capped at around 40 for me. However I did get two resists during my playtime.<br />
<br />
I'm going to retire smite I think. Still trying to find the perfect 10 spell combo for my taskbar.<br />
<br />
As for Wailing Haze, I still don't think it's worthwhile if your group is doing multiple mobs, it just takes too long to put it on when you've got four or five in camp - the mobs are nearly half dead by the time it goes on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Oh my, only 10 ?<br />

I had to create a second row of 10, for a total of 20 and I'm not sure that's really enough yet.  Let me get a few more levels and see some of my upgrades and I'll know better.</div></div><hr />

Glad to hear that Wailing Haze Ad1 is a good one!  I hope I can find it for sale again. :)<br />
<br />
No doubt that our debuffs work best on the larger mobs, which suggests they are percentage based like our old slows.  However, slapping slows on 4 blue or white mobs still makes it a lot easier for them to be tanked by one character - I do this religiously when duoing.<br />
<br />
Hmmm, true enough. We face groups of mid level mobs more often than we face single high level mobs, so Adept III Spirit Ward would go further towards keeping our tank up in general than a higher slow.<br />
<br />
My Ap2 Spectral Ward is already showing serious age fighting orange^^ mobs at level 21.  It lands and is gone in 2 or 3 seconds if cast on a plate tank.  I know that the ward is still being useful, but I don't know exactly how wards work quite yet.  Do we know for sure if they have a max hp or max hits or something and run until either a) all hp are absorbed, b) all hits are absorbed, or c) duration expires?<br />
<br />

<br />
Wow!  Damn j00! :)  Where did you find the 5-6 scholar books?  I did manage to get refining 4 but it's sitting on an alt in freeport and my main is in Qeynos, so I might have to coordinate a quick bazaar sale. :)<br />
<br />
Level 15 Alchemist and level 14 Scribe. (I know they're the same, but my Scribe has a 75 scribe skill, and my Alchemist has an 85 chemistry with racial bonus, so it works better for me that way.)<br />
<br />
The same?  Isn't the alchemist the level 20 scholar class?  EQ2 Traders isn't loading right now. &gt;&lt;  I am almost level 12 scholar, but are there 10+ alchemy books I can scribe?<br />
<br />
I'm going to retire smite I think. Still trying to find the perfect 10 spell combo for my taskbar.<br />
<br />
I use Smite and Grey Wind if I'm doing solo HO's since they can be cast back to back for a much faster HO (fighters and priests don't stack well doing 2 class HO's).<br />
<br />
I use almost 3 hotbars right now.  I feel like I have a giant diablo2 belt. :)  What I really like is the new ctrl+key activation, so you can have say three of the same spell line on three different activation keys, such as: 1 = Spectral Ward, Alt+1 = Eidolic Ward, Ctrl+1 = Ward of Spirits.<br />
<br />
As for Wailing Haze, I still don't think it's worthwhile if your group is doing multiple mobs, it just takes too long to put it on when you've got four or five in camp - the mobs are nearly half dead by the time it goes on.<br />
<br />
I try and cast Wailing Haze if I'm waiting for another spell to cycle.  I might start with a Ward, then Wailing Haze, then a heal or Contagion, then maybe Weakness, then another Wailing Haze, back to Ward, then another Wailing Haze, and so on.  What makes debuffing multiple mobs difficult is the targeting!  I find I practically *have* to use the NPC cycle keys and even then it gets tricky, especially if the mobs like to move a lot or jump up and down in their animations. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Horomen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I use close to 3 bars worth of spells on a regular basis..I'm not cool enough (read: lazy) to make extra bars to have em all up at once though. Fear my l337 switching skills.<br />
<br />
First bar: Weakness, wh, gw, contag,Spec Ward, 2 heals,(totemic aid and i dont remember the other one) as well as some of the basic crap (sit, sprint)<br />
<br />
Second Bar: Buffs (Courage/badger/bull, SOW, Group heal/rune, Smaller (our first) heal since I can cast it out of group on lowbies...)<br />
<br />
Third bar- Eidolic Ward,Spirit guide, call of qeynos, the various cures (nox, elemental, etc), bear form, hawk form....<br />

<br />
Yeah. At level 10 if you are going to follow the path of Jeweller, Sage or Alchemist you select the &quot;Scholar&quot; tree. From level 10-19 anyone in the Scholar class can scribe any of the books labeled &quot;Scholar&quot; or &quot;Alchemy&quot; or &quot;Jewellcraft&quot;<br />
<br />
Once you hit level 20, you select one of the three branches and are closed off from the other two professions forever. (With the exception of still being able to make the 10-19 recipes.)<br />
<br />
The reason I already classify them as &quot;Sage&quot; and &quot;Alchemist&quot; is because my Barbarian Shaman has worked on Runes and Essences exclusively since level 10, and my High Elf Summoner has worked on Spell Scrolls exclusively since level 10.<br />
<br />
Thus each has a greater skill in their given field at this point. (Since the sub combines and final combines take so long to do, I haven't bothered to increase their skills outside their field much, I'm trying to level them in adventuring at a reasonable rate too lol!)<br />
<br />
One last reason is that as a Barbarian I get +5 to my Chemistry skills as a racial trait at level 18, and my High Elf gets a +5 bonus to the Scribe skill at level 18, making them naturally more adept at making the items in their profession.<br />
<br />
I could have overlapped their skills, but it would have taken more time and effort, and wouldn't have been as efficient in the long run.<br />
<br />
Hope that long winded explanation helps!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. The merchant-sold books are called “Scholar essentials volume 10” etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
The dropped versions will be called something more specific like “Advanced Scribing somethings volume 11” or “Advanced Arcana” or “Advanced Alchemy refining volume xxx”<br />
<br />
There might even be other terms besides “Advanced xxx xxx”.. I know before level 10 there’s “Artisan’s Escheuteron volume 6” or something obscure like that.<br />
<br />
Anything that’s dropped by mobs and has something to do with Scholar, Alchemy, Jewellcraft and such will be usable by you. I’m not sure on the names of most. Just make sure not to buy anything that says “Essentials” off a player merchant. They’re just buying the books off the vendors and trying to fool people into spending huge money for a book that cost them 4 silver. (I bought Scholar Essentials Vulume 11 for 15 silver off a guy because I was so excited to see “Volume 11” in the search window.)<br />
<br />
The reason you aren’t seeing most of these books for sale is because a lot of big guilds are buying them all up so they’ll be able to make all the nifty spells/runes/essences and such for their guild.<br />
<br />
The drop rates on the books isn’t too bad last time I ran around a dungeon killing stuff, so the prices will drop soon enough.</div></div><hr />

Ahhhh OK I think I got myself all mixed up earlier, thanks. :)  I have seen the vendor 10+ books and have a few of the 11+ dropped books, but I thought you were saying that there was a whole different set of 11+ dropped books for specifically alchemy!  Whew, that would be a lot of books!  I have 12 so I can make Spectral Ward Ad3 if I can get the ink, yay!</div></div><hr />

Just about every good Ad1 spell on Everfrost in Qeynos is 40+ silver and in Freeport they are even more expensive.  I think Freeport zones create a lot more currency than Qeynos zones do, but just a hunch. :)  I haven't payed over 50s yet either though, but I have had the chance and I have only been able to upgrade my buffs.  I did pay about 40s for Feign Death Ad1 and saw Minor Arch Healing Ad1 and Wailing Haze Ad1 for ~50s.<br />
<br />
If I found Spectral Ward Ad1 for 50-75s I would buy it.</div></div><hr />

It's my biggest gripe in EQ2 atm: players not realizing that they can't play effectively with low level skills. Probably because tanks in particular never had to worry about spells like casters from EQ1. But it's a real downer when a tank runs in hits app2 taunt and i drop one ward then end up tanking for the group for the whole fight. <br />

Check out the 3/4 size hotbars at http://www.eq2interface.com<br />

No problem and thanks, yes I meant to say Ad3. :)  I've been making sure to upgrade all the spells and skills I can for myself and my monk duo partner, but there are only so many available.  I'd upgrade my ward when I have the chance. :(<br />
<br />
On the plus side, now I'm only 4 trapping points away from finally getting the heck out of Qeynos and harvesting solely in Antonica!  yay! :)  I swear trapping is stupidly bugged since the badger dens seem to be the rarest node type and I get maybe one skillup in an average of 10 spawns. &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
I'd actually say that gear makes a much larger difference than skills and spells at this point in the game except for maybe one or two per class, at least for myself and my monk partner.  However, neither of us have any Ad2 or Ad3 spells or skills yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I think I went as many as 18 nodes without a skillup the day I maxed it.<br />
<br />
The nice thing is, it goes up MUCH faster once you get to Antonica, because most people don’t have the skill, so there are dens all over. ;)</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I think I went as many as 18 nodes without a skillup the day I maxed it.<br />
<br />
The nice thing is, it goes up MUCH faster once you get to Antonica, because most people don’t have the skill, so there are dens all over. ;)<br />
<br />
Ya I've been very pleased with how fast my other skills have gone up in Antonica.  I went back to finish off trapping and foresting because I kept running out of nodes and seeing all the dens and logs around in Antonica! :)<br />
<br />
Oh, and I just found this wonderful link and site for anyone who hasn't!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Zeltaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">*LOL* me and my hubby ran around a whole day doing skill ups in our gathering/foresting/trapping stuff, he just had trapping left to finish, and I was working on amost all of mine. We'd actually been working a few days getting them up and I swear I'm gonna go crazy before I finish mine. It's bad enough when I dream about picking up question marks off the ground, but when my Hubby starts arguing with me about something he was trying to gather when he's sound asleep is just bad, we've gotta draw the line somewhere so I stoped playing for a few days. *LOL* (yep useless post, but thought I'd share the humor)  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Coren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">So we get Wailing Haze at level 10. I upgraded to Apprentice II as soon as I got it, and have tried the spell without much success until around level 15-16.<br />
<br />
I'm noticing a modest slowdown in the DPS of the mobs when using it now. I'm even considering getting the parts to make Apprentice III and maybe even trying to get my hands on a copy of Adept 1.<br />
<br />
I've noticed a pattern for spells. When you get an &quot;Upgrade&quot; for an older spell, it's not really as effective as the prior version. So when we get Keening Haze at level 24, Wailing Haze (Apprentice III or Adept 1) will probably outperform it for a few levels to come. Probably until around level 28.<br />
<br />
Are these assumptions accurate?<br />
<br />
If so, then I'll go through the trouble of hunting down a copy of Adept 1 Wailing Haze.<br />
<br />
Based on my experiences, I'd say your assumptions are exactly correct.  It'd probably be a level or two (as you get closer to the &quot;mastery&quot; of the skill) before the new slow is at it's peak efficiency.  In addition to that, the upgrades will make it even more so (I think the for the slow, the upgrades (ie, App to Adept) reduce the mana cost a tad. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong and way off base on that last part about the mana cost, though, I'm kinda drawing a blank.  I'm wishing I had recorded those details like power cost in my notes.  =/</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Jaidin made one comment about harvesting, but aside from his one comment (which you didn't even reply to), there is nothing else to be said about harvesting in the entire thread. Well, until your poor attempt at a troll.<br />
