<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently went through a HUGE overhaul in my gear. <br />
Literally...went from like, full arcti wyvern (all I could afford/get ahold of) to my current state.<br />
<br />
I still need some upgrade ideas. I'm pretty poor atm (saving to  the big two...just in case), but I have a few loyal friends to help me camp the good stuffz0rz.<br />
<br />
I know the neck slot/arms have go to go (esp the neck slot since EE3 hardly goes off any more)<br />
And lastly...as much as I'll get smacked for it...I am a fashion nerd.  The month I wore Emerald dragonscale i was miserable.  I'd like to keep in line with my class and go with chain, otherwise the stats have to be pretty nice for me to get over it :p<br />
<br />
Give it to me straight doc...am I gonna make it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would agree, replace the neck (tracking wolf collar 10ac 5wis 40hp 40mana), arms (no good suggestions) and range (also no good suggestion, still using goranga idol myself).<br />
<br />
Additionally I would replace the boots (barbed dragonscale-dont have any yet myeslf so not sure what they look like 19ac 9sta 30hp) and head item (slime covered rubicite coif 16ac, 65hp).  Just those two would give you a lot of extra ac and hp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kaninfrenzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">A Large Smoothmetal Torque is an easy to obtain and fairly cheap neck upgrade. Crystal Chitin Armplates are fairly cheap but have a plate look. Deteriorated Arm Links are nice and shouldn't be too hard to get or buy but I don't know how they look. You should be able to get a pretty even trade on the Coldain Skin Boots for Polished Tin Mail Boots or Tribal War Boots which would be much better. If your group of friends are around your level, you may be able to get the OoIV fairly easily. Other shield alternatives are the Bone Braced Buckler and Skull Marked Shield. Both have good hp vs. the kitty shield but look nowhere near as cool ;). As a matter of fact they are two of the ugliest looking shields. One is the yellow round n00b shield and the other is the red n00b kite shield. Both make you look like you just mugged a mummy in Nro. Personally, I'd rather use a Goranga Idol than an Eye of the Griffon because it has no AC. Talisman of Benevolence should be an easy quest depending on your CoV faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not sure what faction you are on, but if you have CoV faction I would highly recommend the Circlet of Falinkan.  Fairly easy quest, the whole thing can be done with less than 1 group.  Hp and ac on it arent the greatest but it gives a good boost to the mana pool, and the effect is great (2 second Turgurs rocks :) ).  Has no visible graphic btw.<br />
<br />
Boots I guess barbed dragon would be good for hp, or SS/Kael if you can get em.  If your guild does vindi his boots are rather nice too.  <br />
<br />
Not sure about the arms, maybe crystal chitin or grey flesh, or again SS/Kael?  <br />
<br />
For neck slot, the smoothmetal torque suggested is quite nice, or if you are after hp maybe you can pick up a ribbon choker for a few k.  Best droppable I can think of is the tracking wolf collar suggested, but those tend to be abit pricey on my server at least.<br />
<br />
Range slot, again the talisman of benevolence is pretty good if you have CoV faction, can be done with 2 or 3 people.  If not, maybe Divine inspiration from ME would be good, should be solo campable by a 60+ shaman I imagine.  Sharp claw ahlspiess is another good one, great focus (Affliction efficiency 4) but again pricey.<br />
<br />
Hope that helps a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have barbed dragonskin boots....<br />
<br />
And they look.... yuck.<br />
<br />
yuck yuck yuck<br />
<br />
I look like someone threw some leather on my feet and stitched them to keep me from bleeding. yuck yuck yuck. I've had guildmates ask me, what's that ugly thing on your feet?<br />
<br />
I'm first in line for HoT boots. Everyone agrees - barbed dragonscale are ug-ly!<br />
<br />
Loving my green look... just need a decent BP and I'll be one fashionable kitty.</div></div><hr />
