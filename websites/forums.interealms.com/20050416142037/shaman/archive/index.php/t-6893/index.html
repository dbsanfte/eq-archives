<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After last patch and the new verant logos where implemented I have had troubles with the computer crashing totally. The screen with &quot;SOE Sony online entertainment&quot; on seems somewhat garbled and all I can do is reboot the computer and try again. Happens often and is very annoying.<br />
<br />
Using Windows XP and a Geforce card.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />

<br />
With all the l337 testing that went on with this expansion, the GM-picked guild, etc, I am totally suprised that there is a glitch.<br />
<br />
OTOH, I run WIN 98 and have experienced 0 problems connecting, however, the servers seem to be down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you tried doing a thourough file check under the advanced options on the patcher?<br />
<br />
It sounds like you've got some corrupted files.</div></div><hr />
