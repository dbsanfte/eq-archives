I also would like to know what traid skills i should start working on for the quest it looks like i need to use some for the quest. thank you for any info you could give me<br />

Honor to you all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just look up Thurgadin quests at Allakhazam's. The Shawls are pretty poor Shaman items, in my opinion, for the amount of work that must go into them. I did up through the third quest, to get the range slot item that is a by-product of it, but with Luclin you're better off just getting a Ceremonial Smudging Stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The 7nth Coldain Prayer Shawl is the only item that i could see that had flowing thought on it with out being in some uber guild or spending 150k and a qust i could do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>HalusJustbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">This LINK (http://www.eqtraders.com/quests/intro.htm) is an excellent guide to the Shawl quests.  I haven't started the quest yet, but my baking is at 142 and pottery is at 135.  They were both very easy to raise.  Apparently tailoring is the most difficult tradeskill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snt_asher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool thank you just what i was looking for )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">shawl quest isn't worth it, imho.  up to the 5th quest is fairly easy, but the tailoring required for the 6th and 7th shawls is brutal.  Not worth it unless you have serious time and money on your hands.  The reason tailoring is so hard is because you have to BUY all the ingredients in order to practice.  You can raise it to 21 via your guild trainer, but then its time to start farming silks.  From there you go to HQ bear pelts for backpacks, etc......   I gave up trying to be a tailor and LONG time ago.  It's just a huge time and money sink.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree Jinheim<br />
FT I is only 1 mana per tick anyways, which is nothing.  Might be ok for other classes, but shaman don't really need this. You'd be better off spending the time for a coldain ring 8 or 9.</div></div><hr />

<br />
According to reports over at www.eqtraders.com the 8th Prayer shawl quest is now live on the TEST SERVER.<br />
<br />
It *should* go live on regular servers after the patch on the 8th.<br />
Expect a few days for someone to have a successful combine and report the stats.  So don't count this out just yet if you are a die-hard tradeskiller. ;)<br />
<br />
btw, Smithing is one of the next tradeskills employed, making Velium Armour for the Dorfs.<br />
<br />
Take care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Here's a report from personal experience up through the 7th shawl:<br />
<br />
I'm one of those lunatics that actually like doing quests and tradeskills.  If you're not seriously into both of these, you definitely want to skip this series of quests.<br />
<br />
One piece of good news:  failing on a combine does not destroy the shawl, so you never have to start the series completely from scratch.<br />
<br />
The tailoring skill required for the 5th shawl is roughly 135.  You can get to that skill level doing the Crystal Silk armor using the silk you get from spiders in Crystal Caverns.  This shawl requires you to combine Crystal Silk Threads (no-drop, stackable - drop off of the transparent spiders in Velk's Lab) into silk fibres and then into glowing silk.  To make all the glowing silk you need for the final combine, you need 75 crystal silk threads (assuming no failures.)  That's a lot of spiders.  You also need 5 Glowing Wurm Biles from the wurms wandering around in Great Divide - not a common drop, but if you hunt at night any wurm carrying one will glow in the dark.<br />
<br />
The 6th shawl is the make or break point for most people doing the quest series - the trivial on the final combine is up around 200, which means your success rate won't be great.  I was at 158 tailoring when I completed this quest (same for the 7th - 158 requires making Wu's Fighting Armor to achieve, and it requires a metric truckload of regular spider silk, 2 metric truckloads of Heady Kiolas and a really patient enchanter willing to make a huge pile of mana vials).  I failed on the first attempt, succeeded on the second attempt.  The items needed to make the thread used aren't that hard to get, just a bit tedious - patience pays off.<br />
<br />
The 7th shawl requires a fairly high level in almost all of the trade skills (all but smithing, which evidently is used in the 8th.)  The other tradeskills basically just require lots of cash and lots of patience - you can buy everything you need to raise the skills from vendors.  All of my tradeskills were in the 180-190 range.  I had no failures on any of the combines, but even at that skill level you always have at least a 5% chance of failure on any combine.  The trivial on the final combine (tailoring) to make the 7th shawl is a lot lower than the trivial for the 6th shawl, so  odds are a lot better of success (reports say the trivial is 162, only 4 points higher than my skill level at the time.)<br />
<br />
From the looks of things, the 8th shawl will require smithing Velium Armor.  Reports put the trivial on the armor close to 200, and it requires numerous Velium Tempers (at 26pp a pop) and Diamonds and other expensive gems which are processed using jewelcraft again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mirabilis Dictu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tailoring is indeed the hardest of the tradeskills, speaking from personal experience.  :)<br />
<br />
The skill is BY NO MEANS a big plat sink until you get to the point where there's nothing left of higher trivial than velious leathers and ice burrower silk and so forth.  In fact, it's cheap, money-wise, but very expensive time-wise.  Count yourself lucky tho... not that long ago, pelts didn't stack at all, and it took even longer to skill up because each of those stupid pelts weighed 5 pounds (hard to carry very few of them)!<br />
<br />
Am I sorry I did the 7th shawl?  Not at all.  I wear mine with considerable pride, in fact.  I didn't get this item by the luck of the drop or the roll, I got it by my own hard work :)<br />
<br />
I outfitted myself and my friends in patchwork armour below level 5.. I was a master smith before level 25 (on my first character no less).  Would I do it again this way?<br />
<br />
NOPE.<br />
<br />
Here's why:  Your skillups are dependent on wis/int/str/dex, depending on what trade you're talking about.  You likely won't break 200 wis until after you hit level 50.  You can buff yourself to the nines, and you'll still spend far too much time and money doing the skillups, much more than the high levels who already have the wis gear to make the difference.<br />
<br />
If you want to skill up on cheap easy stuff before 50, take a look at pottery, baking and fletching.  These are relatively cheap and easy.<br />
<br />
Fletched goods sell back to vendors for not much less than the cost of the materials.  <br />
<br />
If you want to raise pottery skill cheaply, DON'T buy firing sheets.  You get your skillups on the wheel, not in the kiln.  Destroy the unfired stuff.  The firing trivial is very low.<br />
<br />
Bake fish rolls.  They trivial at 135, take one fish (use your fishing skill.. you need it for the shawls anyway) and one batwing (from freeport mage's guild or shadowhaven) and combine in an oven.  Not only dead cheap, but lucrative.  A stack can sell for up to 10pp.<br />
<br />
Keep those old world wolf, cat and bear pelts until you're a bit higher level.  Same with spider silks.  You'll thank yourself later, when your higher wis leads to faster skillups without all that tedious hunting of greenies.<br />
<br />
Also, spend some time at http://www.eqtraders.com.  You'll get a good idea of what's required for the trades.  Make no mistake, tradeskills are going to be a focus in the next expansion.  It's a good idea to be a tradesperson, but get your levels and make it easy on yourself :)<br />
