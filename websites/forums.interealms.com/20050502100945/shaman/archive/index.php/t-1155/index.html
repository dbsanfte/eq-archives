<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all, <br />
<br />
       Just a quick question , there is a eb quest that comes from Katta where you get 3 shisshar (sp?) organs and turn them in to get the item. I have the 3 items but my questions actually is since i am iksar how do i raise katta faction and who gets the organs? Ive heard about the quest from people mentioning it so went and got the organs but am kos in katta and no clue who to turn into. thanks ahead of time<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The Coterie in Tenebrous give some positive Katta faction hits. I have no idea which faction Drenic is on but he might be affected by the Cotreie. <br />
<br />
As to where he is, enter the castle in upper Katta, near the Tenebrous zone. Take the right hand corridor all the way back, last door on the right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you wolf. I realized i wasnt awake yet and felt like i was being lazy asking here first so i went and looked it up and found the guys name but hadnt find the location yet so thank you again. Think i am going to try to do the invis to open trade widow and invis again see if i can get the item because i have no idea what faction he is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Iksar are KoS to the hand in guy with default faction. I tried various approaches a few times to get the necklace but got chased out with my tail between my legs each time so gave up.<br />
<br />
Good luck, let us know if you manage it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Disclaimer: This is 2nd hand info, so I cannot verify that it works.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere (probably here) that it can be done while kos with a druid/ranger helping.  <br />
<br />
1. KoS questor enters Quest npc's room invis.<br />
2. Druid harmonies the local npc's<br />
3. KoS Questor stands at max turn in range (which with harmony is outside aggro range of quest npc) and puts organs in trade window to turn in.  This causes invis to drop.<br />
4. Druid reinvis's KoS Questor, which moves faction back to indifferent, and Questor clicks trade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Could an enchanter charm it?  I know there's other quests where you have to have an enchanter  charm the KOS mob.  Our Cani2 spell used to require this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well my progress report was bad both times lol. Asked my wife to cast invis on me with my wizard on the other puter. As you all know though invis only works really well when it isnt that important. I just got to the hand in guy when invis started blinking said for her not to do anything i was going to zone out and try again. Invis pops i hear the quest giver start winding up a nuke and for some reason she cast invis again on me while he was attacking. As i am running to the zone line see my wizards health dropping fast. Wizzy dies for some silly reason i see i am invised and not thinking it was cast on me i stop right at the zone without zoning to go look at why wizzy is dead. I get to  other computer the guards and other npc's all catch up with me so now dead lizzy and wizzy. <br />
<br />
    Second time just didnt seem to be enough time to cast invis again after getting the trade window up soon as i put the organs up he starts casting. Also about a chanter charming him. Not sure about that he is red to lvl 53 and forgot to con him with my 55 wizzy but he hits for 180 and over if i remember right so if charm fails good chance a chanter will be dead fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hand the three shissar organs in to Drenic Garrison in Katta, first floor of the huge cathedral next to the zoneline to Tenebrous.<br />
<br />
Faction is incredibly horrible, and all faction hits are miniscule.  Frankly, I wouldn't bother if I were iksar unless you are enjoying the experience of killing the mobs.  Coterie vampyres give a vanishingly small faction positive faction hit, killing in seru gives tiny hit, and turning in pyrrohitite stones to Berk Thurstone(dwarf) one at a time or vampyre ashes(unstacked) and blood 4 at a time and handing a guy in the warrior guild the shrieking substances 8 at a time, combined into the little box he gives you, are all quests that raise faction.  Shrieking substances and pyrrohitite drop off sonic wolves.  Berk Thurstone is the only PC you can faction with on these quests till your faction makes dramatic improvements.  The pyrrohitite is unstackable and weighs 10 each.<br />
<br />
Iksar can still do the EB necklace quest.  My iksar friend ran into the quest room(either invis or FD flopped his way in, I forget) had a chanter he was grouped with first charm Drenic Garrison.  Then the iksar handed in the 3 organs but DID NOT click trade.  Chanter invised him, THEN he clicked trade.  Boom, got necklace.<br />
<br />
My Rallos Zek ogre shaman did more than a solid month of insane hours camping faction items, in addition to having killed MANY vampires and killing a fair amount in Seru, too, but even though he didn't start out KOS in the first place, he couldn't get the quest.  So he had a bard friend do the charm/invis trick, boom got the necklace.<br />
<br />
By the way, you can do this quest over and over again, for more faction hits.  Might as well load up on organs while you're getting them; they start to rot in any prolonged killing session.</div></div><hr />
