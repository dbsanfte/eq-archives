<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gandilain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so I was pulling for us while we were in UP.  We were situated about 3/4 the way to VT from the ME zone.  So .... we have pulled a whole bunch of stuff and then the RL/MA (who is a SK and also my guildleader) gets the idea that he wants to pull the elemental looking Guardian things that are all around the VT zone.  So he goes up and tries to split them and it doesnt work very well.  After a while there was just one that I tagged and was able to single pull for about 10ft before his friends beat me down.  Because of the heroic jesture (just another death in the life of me) we were able to dust one guardian.  I am not sure why he wanted to pull these guys, but I said that I would be able to single pull them after I tried for a while.  I didnt have a bow on me (shame on me I know) so I couldnt do the sneak thing and I am not sure what kind of aggro they do.  Like some mobs have to see you beating on their friend to help while others 'sense' it.  Any information at all would be great right now.  I just realized that I never tried to harmony them but I doubt you would be able to anyways. Thanks</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ulvian Stormweaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Simplest way to do it would be to have some druids snare kite the adds while the rest of your raid force kills each target one by one, just a thought.</div></div><hr />

Oooh what's the sneak thing?<br />
<br />
And yes, shame on you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">UP is an interesting zone, aggro wise with DA's having LoS aggro, and the Elemental's but i think it works well IMHO, something a little different and a challenge pulling.<br />
And i am shocked and offended you had no bow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you dont have a tolan's bracer, then bows aren't really economical ...  I didnt carry my bow around until i got a bracer @ level 55.  And i lived.  :D You dont deal good damage before then anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Norwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Below when a Bow becomes a damage dealer I used my bow all the time for pulling, the fact your don’t have to STOP, or get CLOSE enables you to pull so much faster that any non-bow class and most of the time other Bow classes neglects this so much they can only hit their foot. <br />
<br />
As for sneak pulling its cool to be able to run up mash sneak and increase your chance of a singe pull. It can be something that works great in some situations... unfortunately not a lot of situations.</div></div><hr />
