<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just picked up a Hammer of Spirit Calling in the Bazzar for 2k.  Stats as I remember them are 39/46  +15wis  some other stats and a proc that is about 75 damage over 3 ticks as well as a 65% snare for 3 ticks.  WhenI looked it up it said it was from a 60 mob in  Cazic.  Oh yeah, need to be 51 to use it.  Was this a good buy, or is there something about this hammer I don't know?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you got very lucky :) a good 2hb is fun to play with, does nice damage between JBB blasts, and this one goes for 10k normally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">39/43, 50 hp/mana, 15 wis/sta, 7 mr/cr/fr.  It's an awesome weapon, but it won't be too useful to you until you hit 51.  I've got one now and love it.  The snare isn't too reliable, it doesn't last very long, so unless you proc right as a mob starts to run, it's not gonna keep them down long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its a nice hammer, I sold mine for 20k thanks to the bazaar.  I never thought anyone would actually buy it for that much :p .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Got one myself in Bazaar for 1k.  Anyone know a good way to raise 2hb quickly?  even using dex buff and then stacking rage i dont get very many skill ups.  Have yet to get one since i have bought hammer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Just go pay a trainer if you want fast skill ups. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get an enchanter friend to hit you with VoG.  It's a nice haste spell for 45 minutes.  Now go melee a shroom in FG to death!  ;)<br />
<br />
Best way I know of to get skill increases at high levels!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A very nice 2hb.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fastest way to raise 2HB sans spending money on the trainer - grab the Abandoned Orc Shovel from Lake Rathe (groundspawn inside a tent in the Orc camp on the shore between the SK and RM zones).  It's a very fast 2HB, so you'll get more attempts per fight.  Then max your speed - borrow a speed item, celerity yourself, etc - and offer to slow somebody's pulls if they will let you bang it its rear end with your shovel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, the orc shovel...billions and billions and billions of swings with it. 2hb is a major pain in the ass to raise. But when you finally swing and (200) shows up, pass the shovel on! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I recently maxed out my 2hb with this hammer. The best way to get your skill up ....<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kanad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">20k for a Hammer of Spiritcalling? where are you from? On Mith Marr this hammer goes for 2k and less (mine was 1.4k).<br />
<br />
This is a good situational piece... not good for working 2HB, but if you have a good 2HB it hits hard. I get 120-110 hits but the average is alot closer to 55. Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
The snare proc is situationally useful too, but I've found it to be unreliable. One fight it might go off early and then not again, and the next it might hit just before the mob runs. In either case the short duration makes it not so useful, but I like it.<br />
<br />
Enjoy it if you have it, but once I have my epic I doubt I'll ever use it again. Just my 2cp :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">At 39/43, 50 hp/mana, 15 wis/sta, it's a nice beat stick. The proc is generally worthless tho. The nice thing about it is that I find, statwise, I don't loose that many hitpoints but bagging the OOIV and epic for this.<br />
<br />
While I don't use it much, in situations where cold/poison attacks are ineffective, or ones where I need my mana for patch heals and cold based attacks don't work (read: can't use the JBB), I'll equip this, get a SoS and melee away. Fun in pvp against int casters too, especially if it procs and it sticks :)<br />
<br />
A good acquisiton pre epic, and worth keeping until you get a better way to deal melee damage.</div></div><hr />
