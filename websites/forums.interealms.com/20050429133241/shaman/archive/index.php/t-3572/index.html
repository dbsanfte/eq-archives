<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Odaya Cliffhopper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is where all 10 to maybe 15 shaman should go, it is sorta bring a group though.  My warrior went here at 11 in a group of 4 on Kane bayle and we blasted through exp, i hit 12, and got almost 13 in about 45 minutes (had to sleep). The exp is good and bone chips are plentiful for selling to necros and shadowknights who need for their pets.  It has a dungeon exp bonus in it and goes about twice as fast as dervs.<br />

Just though all should know about this great place<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Crug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I loathe Befallen.  I have had many a bad experience in that dungeon.  The only time Befallen was a good dungeon was when it was overrun with dark elf necromancers.  They dropped REALLY good loot for their level (Cracked STaff, robe that sells for 1-3pp each) and they dropped it every kill.  Best spot to be for the level.  Why'd they have to change it back? =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Befallen can be deadly because it is riddled with traps.  If you do go make sure there is someone you can call on if you end up getting stuck.<br />
<br />
To go through the first door you need a key, the key drops off the shadowknight located directly across from the locked door and down the hallway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ihopp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">FYI- I followed this here advice and let me tell you it is solid from top to bottom. I took a 10 warrior and shammy there....The camp is free all the time..I mean no one goes there anymore. =)<br />
<br />
Granted, I am only going to duo (warrior and shammy) on the first floor only. Once me and my wife get 2 levels and then we will go site see' another area. Along with leveling up I am showing my wife some of the more unpopular (pre luclin) areas.<br />
<br />
Regards,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hehe, befallen still makes me cuss. Worst CR I ever had was in Befallen. Me and a cleric buddy, both 17 at the time, got through the door on the third floor, and aggroed the entire hallway. Needless to say, we didn't make it. Now, we had 2 naked noobs with no key with two corpses at the bottom. Hail, 3 hour corpse run, multiple deaths, even with some higher level help.<br />
<br />
Now, when I'm bored, I go run through there and kill everything just because I can for vengeance. I must say though, it was a fun night, even if it was frustrating. Good place for lower levels to learn dungeon crawling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is nothing quite like sitting down to med in the room that is being camped, and then two minutes later about 20 skeletons, mummies, ghouls and necros pour in through the door to pound you into oblivion.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, I go to Crushbone instead. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Befallen rules for PLing. Wouldnt want to be there alone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rraand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">hmm, i level all my alt's in Befallen now. even at lvl 14 the lt blue mobs usually give 1% a kill soloing. You have to be careful tho, The mobs like to add big time. Plus i can always go get my main (62 warr) if need be to clear out zone to get my corpse.</div></div><hr />
