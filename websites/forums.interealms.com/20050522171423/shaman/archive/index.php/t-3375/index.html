<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just got home from the movie Road to perdition I think it was not even 10 mins in and I left. The movie seems really good and well low and behold behind me is a moron who props his knee up on my chair and chats loudly with his girlfriend or whatever and after about 5 mins of listening to that bull**** I turn around and ask them to stop talking. Then I get impatient after another 5 mins of the ass talking himself to death so I turn around and tell him to shut his damn mouth. I swear where are peoples manners anymore I just got up and left the movie theater, and yes there was no where to move it was packed.<br />
<br />
I can't stand it anymore ppl are rude everywhere, no manners and if you try for help you get none so taking matter into your own hands isn't any good because in this now namby pamby society you will get arrested for flicking someone in the nose.<br />
The world is a coldhearted pos place and being a ******** doesn't help.<br />
<br />
my rant for the day full of grammatical errors do I care? NO CUS IM MAD GRRRRRR 7 bucks down the drain for nothing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm.  I probably would have moved, or fetched the manager.  Friend of mine would have 'accidentally' flipped his drink over his shoulder...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Manager will take care of it for you.<br />
<br />
And yeah, it kind of blows, way to many laws against kicking people's ass who desperately need it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree. Why can't you just slap the piss out of some people who really need it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree. Why can't you just slap the piss out of some people who really need it? <br />
<br />
Mainly beacuse people like me vote.  If it were legal for peeps to slap the piss outa those that needed it I wouldn't be able to go out in public. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Braxton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">All you would have had to do, was inform the manager that you wanted them to shutup, be removed or refund your money.<br />
<br />
Your other option would have been to jump over your seat and beat the piss out of him in front of his girlfriend. :p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bah im one of those guys who talk during most of the movie. i laugh at scenes that probably arent meant to be funny. (i laughed for about 10 minutes at that scene in Twister where the dude is trying to hold the cellar door closed and  gets sucked up into the tornado  while still holding onto the door.) <br />
<br />
i dont do it to be mean its just my way. Although i dont sit near the middle i always sit up front so the movie screen covers my entire field of vision and the sound is loud enough to talk and not miss anything.<br />
<br />
If im in the middle i do whisper but i do have some coutesy not to talk in others ears unless its to ask to pass the popcorn. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dagor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That is one of my pet peeves as well.  In the past I have made real scenes and such, usually revolving around what happened after I tell them the &quot;Shut the #$%^ up&quot;.   <br />
<br />
My favorite bit of moviehouse chatter was in the movie Dances with Wolves.  This Idiot woman in front of me on a date with some helpless schmuck, and the woman is one of those who couldn't follow a plot if it was dragging her behind it.  She was asking all these stupid questions, but was really much better after I pointed out it was bothering me.   Then the scene comes where Kevin Coster goes to the indians in the middle of the night to tell them a Buffalo herd had arrived.  Coster is reduced to charades for communication.  It went something like this.<br />
<br />
Idiot:  What is he doing?<br />
Poor Date: quitely &quot;mumble mumble mumble&quot;<br />
Idiot:  quite admanatly &quot;That's NOT a buffalo!&quot;<br />
<br />
Sent me and my friends rolling.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kakkaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I got it! I can say in court that I was defending myself from the gobs of stupidity coming out of that dumbasses mouth...besides he looked like he could see the movie better from that position on the ground instead of his seat. This was one of those ppl that during a movie go...ooo I wonder whats gonna happen next then start blurting out a bunch of hypathetic questions and then answering them at the same time. GOD I wanted to just dump all the popcorn salt I could find in his eyes then scream WHAT IF YOU SHUT UP ANSWER: THEN EVERYONE COULD ENJOY THIS MOVIE MOSTLY ME YOU !#@$$#@#$!$!@#$!@$!@ AHHHH /rips out hair.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It is one of the reasons why I will only go to the movies to see films rated 18 (am in the uk).  I refuse to see anything rated less as it is normally full of kids in groups trying to impress each other and it takes all my self control not to rip their heads off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Remember &quot;Titanic&quot;?  I was a loud ******* for one particular scene in that movie.  The scene when she's posing nude for the artist (caprio) to draw her and the camera zooms in on her eye. <br />
Then it pans out and she's all wrinkled, and it pans out slowly onto her face.  At that point i just said:<br />
&quot;Please don't be naked! Please don't be naked!&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Like everyone else has said I'd have got the manager, and get him to sort it out.<br />
<br />
My pet peeve is when people leave their mobile phones switched on and they go off during the film. I was watching a film a few months back when this guys phone went off and he answered it. About 5 mins later it goes off again and someone behind me shouts if you f**king dont switch it off I'm going to shove it your arse. It didn't ring after that... shame really would have been fun to see!<br />
<br />
As for people talking during films the worst thing I've ever heard was from my mate sat next to me. We were sat in the front row. Watching Single White Female, and it got to the scene where Jennifer Jason Leigh was masturbating with a cushion when Bridget Fonda enters the flat and see's her through the open door. Now if you've not seen the film it's silent at this point. My friend said &quot;It's a well known fact that 79% of women masturbate&quot; He said ths load enough for half of the cinema to hear him. I just wanted the sink as low as I could into the chair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I usually just stand up and make my irritation known.<br />
<br />
My best friend and I both played college football (offensive lineman) so If my size doesnt shup them up my friend will stand up also :)<br />
<br />
But if you cannot intimidate the manager is your best shot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Pity you can't just beat the snot out of 'em isn't it and, sadly, not all theater managers have the balls to boot someone disruptive out. Which is why I'm a big believer in projectiles. Those little cinnamon flavored Hot Tamales fly surprisingly well and, when pelted enough times, the idiots either move or stop talking. The key is to be inconspicuous so no laughing ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ssik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">7 bucks down the drain for nothing <br />
<br />
yeah, anytime you leave a movie early you can demand a refund ... and in this case, you would have wasted your 7 dollars even staying through till the end.<br />
<br />
But I know I'm in a huge minority on that one  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Heeoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Seven bucks for a movie?  Where the hell do you live, Topeka?  It's over ten bucks here in NYC and by spending that ten plus dollars I have the right to enjoy a nice quiet environment.  The problem with mouthing off to a nuisance in NYC (and most other cities) is that you never know just how crazy the idiot might be.  The key here is to act even crazier.  Start mumbling how you are going to gut the big mouth ass to mouth and then you are going to decorate his/her companion with the entrails.  That usually gets them to shut up.  Try mumbling to your companion (loud enough for the offender to hear you of course) &quot;hand me my piece so I can shut this a**hole up for good.&quot;  <br />
<br />
The truth is, if you were being bothered by the noise, others were too so you can only hope that by telling the offender to shut up, they will loudly agree.  This will let the loudmouth know that a theater full of angry people who paid good money to see the movie are all pissed off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kerran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Lets see... <br />
<br />
Mall of america, I was with my g/f, and one of my friends - long story short, we got into the movie theater and he decides to chuck a stink bomb. Lo and Behold, about 3 minutes later a fully armed police officer came into the theater, walked up behind my friend and said, &quot;Hey you!&quot;, followed by the officer making him, me and my GF empty our pockets... Lucky us, it was his last stinkbomb and he had chucked the package before he went into the theater.<br />
<br />
Oh and -<br />
<br />
In Black Hawk Down, there was a lady who REFUSED to shutup. Her damn phone kept ringing!!! Plus, Not only did she talk throughout the first 15 minutes, she didnt speak english, and she was loud. About 1 minute into her conversation, someone went to go get the manager. The manager ended up coming back into the theater 3 times, and she still wouldn't shove it. Finally I got ticked, stood up and said, &quot;Would you please shut the F*ck up - Some of us are trying to watch this movie&quot;<br />
<br />
Yaaa... She didnt say another word after that. I hate that I had to resort to that kind of language in the movie theater tho, but it did silence her. :cool:</div></div><hr />
