<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ever wonder if perhaps the people who post up here really stupid ideas on how to improve classes are Devs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hah!<br />
<br />
Considering some of the ideas that have come out in EQ over the last few years (Hey! I know!  Lets make this place require a key, and lets have the key require random drops from semi rare mobs and scatter them all over the whole expansion!  Thats good for weeks of fun!  Oh, and spells,  Lets put s spell that 5 classes can use and all will need on ONE mob in the game) it wouldnt really suprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At this point in EQ, I wouldnt put anything past them, lol :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No.  If devs listened to classes before rolling out changes, we might actually get some decent changes instead of the slow class mitigation by expansion and unimaginative AAs and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There are a few people who seem to have a penchant for trashing<br />
any ideas for improving our class. Granted, not every idea is doable,<br />
after some thought. But the ones that trash good ideas get a negative<br />
raiting from me. These are the one's I suspect may be devs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">What's driving me nuts ATM is trying to help a ranger friend get his drop from Hate to finish his Epic.  Must be a very very very small chance for it to drop.   At least at this point Hate is still fun.  The enchanter drop is very common.   At least I might have time to do the FT3 quest there .....................</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mage friend had like 2 drop while he was awaiting his drop in hate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Funny, I been thinking of this for a while now. First came to me when I was reading a post in EQTraders where Absor responded (twice even) to someone complaining about something. Idea is...<br />
I see a lot of posts where people are venting frustration about things that are legitimately wrong with the game, and then you see post after post of arguments saying everything is alright and you should stop complaining. I NEVER see people in game express these ideas, but it is very prevelant here and on other message boards.<br />
These posts are never made by people I recognize, and sometimes the post seems to be extraordinarily similar to something I've read before in similar topics. Just occured to me that since we know they do read message boards, would it be beyond them to make posts in favor of the game when they see people complaining just to hopefully sway public opinion in their favor?<br />
A little bit off topic from what you (half jokingly?) originally posted, but something to think about just the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mathi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I doubt they read class message boards and am pretty certain none of them actually play the game.  I get the impression they (the devs) are more busy playing other games and swiping ideas from them.  EQ is a money machine.  It is also well known that people are happier with stuff to bitch about.  If they had a regular patch for 1 hour every Sunday night at 3AM PST where they fixed and rebalanced everything that was broken on a weekly basis...how dull would that be?<br />
<br />
Where would all the threads go?<br />
<br />
People like bitching.  Visit the necro boards among others, hell even look at some of the threads here &quot;omg shaman don't do as much DPS as a beastlord&quot;.  Some complaints are legit, as are some ideas, others are just people saying they want a &quot;god mode&quot; or to be more powerful than any other class in all situations.<br />
<br />
If you post an idea, there will be positive as well as negative posts.  The fact that anyone replies at all means that SoE is doing a better job of keeping people hooked into their world than most people give them credit for.  As it is, the designers would rather give you loads of new broken stuff to play with and complain about than to fix content you have already seen (and probably beaten) even though things are somewhat out of balance.</div></div><hr />
