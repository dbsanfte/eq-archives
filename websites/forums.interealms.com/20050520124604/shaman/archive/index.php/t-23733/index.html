<br />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Purchased extra spell gem, HG, HA, RM and have 12 left to spend (saving for lvl 1 on ancestral aid and who knows what else). thought about purchasing the FT, but it's not an issue for me right now so am waiting on that one. <br />
<br />
HA gives me an average heal of a bit close to 2100 so far...HG gives me a crit of (3 crits out of 5 heals on average) as high as 4570...I love it since I am usually saving some clerics butt in group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Only had three saved, got the ninth gem. Will just level up until I can't stand it any more, then get some Reflexive Mastery and HGM stuff.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Bartmeista</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">bought Healing Boon 1 and Ancestral Aid 1.  Have 20 (and a 1/2!) still banked which will be used for Spir. Channeling and Rez (after that last 1/2 aa point is done!) upon lvl 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I just got OoW today. I wasn't able to log on yesterday due to RL obligations. I had 30banked. I got the extra spell gem right away, for 3aa, its a winner, imo.Then I got HA1 and HG1(always looking for the healing aa's). Then I decided to go with the LR upgrade and the ID upgrade, mostly because I found them to have a significant impact on my survivabilty once I finished the orginal versions of them. That leaves me with 11 unspent, I'll hit 67 tomorrow and I will spend 5aa's on the group HoT and save the others for the group HoT upgrade in 68. I am going on the assumption that aa's will fly by at lvl 70 so the next purchase once I hit 70 will be the rez. I'm on 100% regular exp. until I hit 70, then i'll get 6% insurance and go 10/90in favor of aa exp.<br />
That's the general plan as of right now anyway, but it is subject to change as we learn more about the impact of the various aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Bought the extra spell slot and HAM1. Saving the rest of my AAs for Call of the Wild and Ancestral Aid. That should cost me all my saved 30AAs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I had 22 AA banked.<br />
I spent 3 for the spell slot (no brainer) leaving me 19 left.<br />
I raid a lot, and have a bunch of clickies I have up a lot, on top of other hp buffs and mana buffs and resist buffs, so more buff slots is where I went.<br />
I bought 2 more buff slots, and I have the 9 left to be able to get shaman res when I finally hit 60.</div></div><hr />

Also got the HoT crits, and while I have no numbers have seen it work several times...just too bad there is no message for it giving a heal crit (should be and I am feedbacking this daily).<br />
Going to work to 67 ( 1 yellow down so far, done most of my grind in Wall of Slaughter) and then net a safety net, then go straight to work on the group HoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Looking forward to Ancestral Aid, saving my AAs for this for sure. Still got 9 ish I think. Might even grind out a few moer for the 2nd step of the healing one, and the crit-HoT tic one. Looks like I can main-heal in WoS, spell runes are dropping like water there, so I can see myself spending a LOT of time there.</div></div><hr />

Just a warning, don't try to pump str to see how high you can get melee's stats with ancestral Aid..  They don't stack, or at least that's what i'm assuming blocked it.<br />
<br />
Got 67 last night, bought Ancestrial aid, Droped Talisman of Diaku to max everyone's str in my group, poped Ancestrial Aid, and got 6 did not hold messages...  Fo7 was also up so it could be that giving it problems with the stacking i'm not sure.<br />
<br />
I haven't gotten a chance to check lucy yet about this though as it was 2AM when i got 67.  I'll check in in game tonight if no one beats me to it.</div></div><hr />

WHAAA???? What about the +STR on Focus and FA? Are they gonna block this? <br />
<br />
Need some confirmation on this one, anyone with AAid got some testing-stacking time?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I'm pretty sure it wasn't FA blocking ancestrial aid, I was keeping that up on the melee's but not casters, and Ancestrial aid didn't hold on anyone.  Though it could be it wasn't stacking with any of 3 spells FA, Diaku, Fo7 (i really hope it isn't FA and Fo7)<br />
<br />
If it doesn't stack with diaku just gives me a reason to never do this buff again!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I had 12.5 AA banked. I bought the extra spell slot first. I'm saving the remaining 9.5 for Ancestral Aid. I'm working on getting to 67 so I can get the first level, and will complete the last AA after I get the level required for the 2nd level of Ancestral Aid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">extra spell slot<br />
healing crits 1<br />
extra healing 3% - 1<br />
Direct Damage improvement - 1<br />
HOT crit - 1<br />
FT - 1 &quot;was sitting on extra FT on equipment&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm very pleased that I was able to do all these at once.  I will get the pet zoning (camping) AA as soon as it is available and then probably level to 70 and get Call of the Wild.<br />
<br />
On a side note, my goodness leveling is slow - especially for Iksar.  I am truely amazed that a few peeps were able to hit 70 from what I hear was 22 hrs after release at Fire Tables.  Now that's some grinding.<br />

Looking in lucy yeah talisman of diaku wouldn't stack with ancestrial aid. Levels 2 and 3 of the aa would overwrite it but the first won't. It appears to have lost the endurance regen and gained stats over the cap http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5933&amp;source=Live</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>GrishMT</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Sigh, what good is overcap stats gonna do for a few tics?  The Endurance regen was a nice plus.  I'll be getting it anyway because it's a group heal but that's just stupid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Frejadotter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Well, 30 banked aa turned out a little different than I thought...<br />
<br />
...Got Mnemonic Retention, Healing Adept Master, Healing Gift Mastery, Healing Boon and Resplendant Cure, all of them the first tier...need to level to spend the other aa i have banked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gumurok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i havent bought any AA's yet, going to get level 70 then pound aa for 20 hours straight  :D Want to collect most of my spells and get some exp into 70% then for 2 weeks i will have no life while i pound AA  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">So far I have bought the upgrades to LR, ID, Healing Adept, Healing Gift, Crit dmg increaser, New Spell Slot and Ancestrial aid. I can't really tell yet if the defense ones helped a whole lot. There were a few times in PoFire at the 2nd castle that I got missed for 2 full rounds (8ish hits) but then the very next mob I would get hit 8 times in a row without a single miss. The crit nuke increaser I can't really tell either, but it doesn't seem to be that much of an upgrade. However, as I posted on another thread, I absolutely love Ancestrial Aid. I have wanted a group HoT for some time now and with a 12 min refresh it comes in really handy. Now if only it stacked with druids SotW :\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Korelen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I purchased the extra spell gem, first level of healing boon, and first level of healing adept.  I still have 10 AA left, but I am going to hold off on purchasing for now unless I get the first level of LR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Just tested level 1 ancestrial aid.  To stacks with FoS and FA, but does not stack with diaku as predicted.</div></div><hr />
