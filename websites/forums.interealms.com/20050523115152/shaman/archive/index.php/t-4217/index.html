IKS; WAR, SHD, SHM; Cazic-Thule, recommended level 45, wt 3.0<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind when considering the pricing of these items that each of these pieces costs up to 3 blue diamonds, depending on the piece, and several other pain in the butt components to farm.  That is per attempt.  (Also, the BD combine can fail before you even get to make the combine attempt at the armor)<br />
<br />
Several races got left with a more difficult route to 250 when verant changed the smithing trivials.  Barbarians were one of them.  The northman ringmail now trivials rather low, leaving only luclin items (farming greens and uncommon drops), mistletoe cutting sickles for POTC quest (~350pp per combine), or these high end recipes (/cringe)  for us to skill up on.  <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, there are smiths making a lot of cash of these new items.  In my experience, however, most of them are not barbarians, as barbarians have had little reason to smith until now.  I would say the prices you were quoted are fairly reasonable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Is this stuff really that much better than TOV armor ?<br />
<br />
3 BD's go for 6k-7500. Now what would it cost you to MQ the comparable piece of ToV / Kael armor instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">8-12k for artificier's ringmail armor is HUGELY cheap.<br />
<br />
Smithing is UNGODLY hard to raise now...worse than tailoring for several races (as an important note, all shaman races but ogre are one of these).<br />
<br />
Each combine is non-trivial at 255 skill.<br />
<br />
At maximum skill, the success rate across all servers (for the armor for all races) is just under 50%<br />
<br />
Each combine eats at least one blue diamond. If you can supply the smith with all of the ingrediants ready for a final combine (which will mean a not-inconsiderable amount of tradeskill work yourself in tailoring, brewing, and smithing), you could probably get them to press the button on the combine relatively cheaply, since they aren't risking any cash of their own. Be sure to group with the smith when they do it so you can see the success/fail message, and anticipate failure, cause that is likely what will happen.<br />
<br />
As for Iksars....if there is not already a GM iksar smith on your server, don't *EVER* count on seeing one. Iksar blood is one of the rarest drops in the game (Making torpor/malo/pox look downright common), and is one of the temper ingrediants required for every combine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good point Faern, how much does it cost to MQ ToV / Kael armor?<br />
<br />
I doubt I'll ever see the Fearsome skyiron, as I was only at 137 skill in smithing before the trivial change ... I don't know why I didn't just get to 180+ before :(   <br />
<br />
Oh well this would be an amazing accomplishment to make a full suit..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gooch Gooch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Iksar blood can be had rarely in dalnir off of specific iksar mobs, and is a rare drop off the iksar bandit lord in warsilisks wood.  I managed to get one to drop about a year ago and have had it in the bank ever since (on an alt) cuz of it's rarity.  Ain't no way on earth yer gonna find a GM iksar smith, especially with the fact that a lot of better armor (CC, SS) is plummeting in price.<br />
<br />
If this change to skills had happened 2 years ago, we'd have every race/class desiring these pieces.  Too many folks are at the end game at this point and have trivialized many of these armors.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Iksar blood also drops off the iksar necromancers in the jail in OS.  I had no idea it was ungodly rare, I've sold to vendors/destroyed it before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">/EM thinks she must have done something wrong then to be a GM smith.<br />
<br />
Actually BD's are coming down in price again to the 1K range.<br />
Iksar blood is not that rare in the necro jail in Old Sebelis<br />
Raising your smithing aint difficult it just costs a ton of money. (go go PotC Sickle)<br />
<br />
And as far as the Iksar armor goes the bracers are decent and that is where it stops. Smithing as an iksar is a Hobby</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it's extremely expensive and timeconsuming to make this stuff, 8-12k is like at cost :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It depends on your server situtation really.<br />
<br />
The higher the cost of blue diamonds the higher the price you can expect to pay for the armor. On average i figure 3 blue diamonds per ring per peice I need to make. That covers enough blue diamonds for some fails processing them and at least 2 tries with an occational third try. That makes my cost on blue diamonds per bracer to be something around 3-5k usually since I try not to pay more than 1250pp per blue diamond but they are listed as high as 2k per in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Add on to that the gathering of temper components, ivorys for tribunal stuff, velium and processing all the items requiring either the smith is also a compitent pottery and brew or highering someone elses services and it becomes a rather time consuming process even once you have the skill.<br />
<br />
As someone mentioned also if there wasn't a barb smith on your server at least over 200 if not over 230ish before the trivial change i wouldn't count on seeing one any time soon. We have no cultural option for skilling up leaving only acrylia and shadowscream both of which are very time consuming at best to try combines at or sickles which are very expensive skill option if you can't sell them off.<br />
<br />
Supply obviously is going to effect things so if you are lucky enough to have multiple barb smiths on your server who can make the peices it will be cheaper than if you only have one who isn't really interested in making it.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm able to make these items but I'm not premaking anything right now. There is at least one other barb smith on my server possibly more and the one smith is actively making items and then trying to sell them and in turn dropping his price to try and sell and forcing prices to the point where it's not worth my effort to make anything even tho i already have all the peices required since they are hard to sell and I have no major need to raise cash. I'm still making some sales tho since people know i'm a smith and i make peices to order.<br />
<br />
As to are the peices worth it? Personnaly i think the stats on alot of the peices are great altho a bit low on the ac. Bracers are really nice with 30hps/mana, 5 wis and 5 sv all on them. Belt is a nice peice at 15ac 5wis 40hps mana. I also made for myself and wear the arms because of the 30hps/mana on them. Both bracers and arms where keal quest armor till i smithed my replacements. My belt was a girdle of reflection.<br />
<br />
It does depend on what your looking for tho and what your other stats look like. Personally I didn't mind the ac hit on the bracers and arms too much since i'm still at almost 1100ac unbuffed even with them on but for someone with lower ac items else where it might be more of an issue. The 10 sv all and 90hps vs no saves 15 hps and 7 sta has been more than worth the loss of ac imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would've snapped it up, but I'm saving my pennies for Torpor, on the assumption my Guardian Wurm groups aren't gonna pay off. :p  That, and I have friend who's getting close to being able to make Artificer's. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The iksar stuff is a waste of time imho, the chain isnt bad, but for the plate wearers (war/shd) its insultingly poor.  Since skyiron armor's vendor value got nerfed, theres not much good reason to smith as an ikky anymore imho =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When figuring price, please remember that this stuff isn't yet trivial at 250.  Even with 250 skill and a geerlok, it fails...sometimes a lot.  Just the other day I blew 15 blue diamonds making a set of the plate equivalent (helanic tundra) legs.  They might be harder than the chain (this stuff) but there isn't enough data to say for certain, all we know for sure is neither is trivial at 250 and both fail on a regular basis after that.  I've had people inquire about buying artificers from me, but most are shocked by the price for something that is made with tradeskills rather than dropped.  I flatly refused to make someone the gloves because coldain skin go for 3k easy and are actually better, while the artificers take 2 blue diamonds to make.  I'd have to be lucky to come out of it at cost on the bds alone.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, a few of the pieces are really nice and worth much more:<br />
<br />
Arms: AC 16, WIS 5, HP 30, mana 30 <br />
Greaves: AC 22, STR 10, WIS 5, HP 40, mana 40 <br />
BP: AC 30,STA 5, WIS 10, HP 40, mana 40<br />
<br />
Compared to what else is out there for barb shamans, this is pretty nice.  For those of us for whom Velious quest armor isn't an option (or is a very slim chance), it's downright wonderful.  <br />
<br />
When setting my prices I simply look at what else is out there and what it sells for.  For example, on the BP, I'd say it's not quite as good as, but close to, JB and the various dragonhides.  Those sell very roughly for 30-40k based on my quick research.  I'd say this is the same or better than a Phase Spider Carapace or Emerald Dragonscale Tunic, which go for 13-20k each, so I'd probably aim for 20k.  At 3 blue diamonds a pop, and 1.5-2k each per bd on my server, and the demand for them making them hard to find at all, just a few failures (entirely possible) would wipe out any profit so I'd probably aim for 20-25k.  I'd be willing to negotiate, though, if the customer wanted to provide bds or wanted to buy at least a couple other pieces, so that I'm more likely to profit even if I get unlucky on a piece or two.  The one or two blue diamond pieces would naturally be proportionally lower because of the reduced risk of losing as many blue diamonds and a hope that the trivials are lower.<br />
<br />
That's my thought process when I'm trying to set a price, at least.  When I first started selling I encountered a LOT of resistance to the idea of selling a tradeskill item for prices equivalent to drops.  I've had people call me every name in the book (and some creative new ones) for selling an item for twice the cost of a single attempt, in spite of the fact that they often fail multiple times.  But if an item that it took a few hours and some luck to acquire is worth a given price, I fail to see how an item of comparable stats is worth any less just because someone made it.  The combine took just a few seconds, but acquiring the components may have taken much longer and required a phenomenal investment of time (months at least) and money in acquiring the skill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think the bazaar has a lot to do with the undesirability of artificers to the savvy consumer.  The old standard prices for dropped items don't apply anymore.<br />
<br />
For example, dragonhide tunics now start out around 15k (one has been sitting up there for 20k all weekend), barbed ringmail arms (ac 20, +3 wis, etc.) are available at 3-4k, and dragonlegs start around 5-7k (I got my JB legs for 18k, and I feel like I overpaid.)  I'm not even taking Velious armor MQ prices into account- which I believe can be cheaper still depending on the item.<br />
<br />
I'd originally thought about buying a bracer, a helm, and the leggings... but instead grabbed peerless dragon bracers (4k- still keeping an eye out for a well-priced Bracer of Sense), slime rubi helm (3k), and the JB legs.<br />
<br />
I love the idea of high-end player made gear, and have no problem paying similar prices to dropped gear of equivalent stats... it's just that the price has fallen through the floor for dropped gear.  :)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Hiya Bigguss :)<br />
<br />
Ugh...well, that about shoots the market for artificers completely then.  <br />
<br />
I keep holding onto a faint hope that they'll up the stats to make this stuff equivalent to the helanic tundra plate that I can make for barb warriors, much of which is close to or better than ToV, but that's a very faint hope.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">the price of dropped stuff is i guess why i have a problem with the price for the artificers. BDs go for 3kish on 7th hammer and seem to have stabalized there with the smithing changes. jb peices are around 500 now. CC arms and gloves are around 3-4k.<br />
coldain skin gloves are around 2k. by the time you get to the point where you can afford artificers there are other comparable pieces and less than half the price. although the wis/hp/mana boosts would be nice.maybe if i get lucky on a drop and come into a ton of cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>kronas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I sell alot more plate armour then i do the artificer armour.  I think ppl do not realize the full stat and their effects.  The plus five wisdom is not an end all.  The big bonus is the hp and mana addition to every piece.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Artificer and any other culture chain, needs to be upped in stats.<br />
Not saying it should be the same as plate, but the difference between the two is too large for all the work that is put into it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">They need to put in a rallos zek version of the barbarian cultural stuff. And an agnostic version (with reduced stats of course).<br />
<br />
Tribunal worshipping warriors are REALLY rare.<br />
<br />
The disparity between the chain and plate stuff is pretty gross (in AC primarily, but in the fluffy stats too). Artificier ringmail bracers are *really* good...arms and belt are quite nice, but the rest is mostly so-so.<br />
<br />
Currently at 209 smithing (I just needed ONE MORE FREAKING DAY before the trivial nerf, and I would have been in the high 220s), and working on shadowscream, which means unless I score the hammer from the Creator, it'll be months before I can make serious attempts at the armor. I'm stockpiling BD's until then. There is a high 240s barbarian shaman smith on Luclin, but he barely plays, and when he does, it is mostly to make shissar and seru banes for his guild (With a geerlok hammer, you can get max effective skill with 242 base skill....a creator hammer lowers that to 222).</div></div><hr />
