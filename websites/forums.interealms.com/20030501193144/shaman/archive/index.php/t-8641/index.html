<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thantu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know the best way to get a Renoir i.d.'d?  This thing has been hanging in my house for years, and in my mother in law's basement for years before that.  I can't find the name of it anywhere on the web, and I've viewed an unGodly amount of paintings.  Any art connoisseurs out there that would have a decent idea how I would go about finding the name of this thing?  It has a blond girl facing left, probably young teens.  I get the feeling that it is actually his son Jean, but obviously it is kind of hard to tell.  Marcy just took a shot of it, so I can post it if anyone wants a look at it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest taking it to an art museum or an auction house. The would be able to give you some information about the picture or they would be able to point you in the right direction of who could I.D. it for you.<br />
<br />
If you know for a fact that it is genuine then just email a picture of it to some of the big auction houses (either in New York or London) and they should be able to tell you.<br />
<br />
Good luck and let us know how you get on.</div></div><hr />
