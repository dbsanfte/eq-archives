<br />
Can anyone confirm whether you have had a recent parchment turnin result in a vendor spell?  Or has this been ninja-fixed now?<br />
<br />
I currently have a parchment, but am sitting on it in the hopes that the vendor-spell fix will be in place before I turn in.<br />
<br />
BTW, someone mentioned that with soul-marking, it should now be impossible to receive multiple copies of a given spell.  Can anyone confirm this?  That would be important to know, so folks don't do something like give away their one copy of Call of Rathe / etc to someone, not realizing they won't be receiving any more.<br />
<br />
best,<br />
ao</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Generil</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have turned in 7 parchments so far...4 last night.  And so far I have gotten 4 copies of Strength of Tunare and 3 copies of Circle of Winter =( <br />
<br />
I spoke with a GM at length about this last night, and explained that Hybrids would be greatly hurt by this.  I explained that if we were going to be given easily obtainable spells for our parchments then we would be less likely to recieve them from our guilds.  The GM explained that the best way to get this point across was to do a Feedback...so basically I did my feedback, but I assume it will not be changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its hurtful and wrong with how much labor goes into aquiring a parchment for it to turn out a spell I already have, and got before PoP was even released.  New content, new rewards please.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotane Shagaminn</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 12:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree Circle of Winter should not be in the distribution table.  It can be purchased on my server for 100pp in the Bazaar whenever you want it.  <br />
<br />
Out of all the positives I can say about PoP, this is one of the few things I don't agree with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llyric</div><div class="date">10-28-2002, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't the initial news with the release of PoP say that they had a new system that allowed NPCs to tell what items you had/things you had done, and react accordingly? Just make them check your spellbook, and not give you any spell already scribed. Or, in case you are hoping to get a spell you already possess to pass on to someone else, have it not give you any spell you already have a scroll for. At least that way you would not turn in 2 parchments and get Circle of Winter twice...</div></div><hr />

Only looting copies of parchments cause i solo and by the time a caster got there to loot it someone woudl prolly allreayd have ninjad it. Hopefully ti keeps giving me CoR and SoT so when the other rangers have parchments drop they can let the casters have<br />

When on raids omg i wish i didnt have them. everyoen and their mom want sthem now and i am only ranger in guild with them lol. ANd that damn brells is still cursing us as it overwrites SoT so i am rebuffing the same peopel over and over again cause of it<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevaran</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i have a suspicion that is is only giving you spells that are NOT scribed into your book. I know i bought circle of Winter and all my level 61 spells already and scribed them into my book<br />
<br />
I did the turn-in and got Str of Tunare.... If this is true, here is what i could recommend.. If you are 61, do not turn in the parchment yet.... buy all your 62 vendor spell... Ding 62, scribe them and THEN turn in the scroll..<br />
<br />
My guess ifyou will get a 62 dropped spell you don't already have.... <br />

<br />
Just the other night I was 62, had all of my 61 spells scribed, including Circle of Winter, as well as all of my 62 spells that I could purchase.<br />
<br />
Result: Circle of Winter</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevaran</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 11:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">okay, that is just idiotic...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Muvandog</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 02:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Turned in three parchments this morning (Tue. Oct. 29), I had all non-PoP spells scribed.  Received Circle of Winter, Strength of Tunare, and Call of Rathe.  Now I know why WP only costs 4pp... doesn't look like I'll be casting it much anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerKeaianea</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 03:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On another note, this is not a &quot;bad&quot; thing if when you get to the higher level parchments you get the VERY rare Mask of the Stalker.  =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*sob* send one of those extra copies of SoT over to BB!  Friggin circle of winter.<br />
<br />
I'd not been looting for a long time, but I realized that with store bought spells still dropping on Velious mobs this isn't going to get fixed.<br />
<br />
Plus as I level I was just getting further behind in the number I need.  Good news is parchment drop rates were upped 2 nights ago. <br />
<br />
Last night I turned in 2 parchments, CoR and Frozen Winds, yay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bobpork</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 06:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, thats 2 scrolls turned in....2 copies of circle of winter....very, very not funny.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aoenla</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, it's worth noting that Circle of Winter, in spite of the fact that it's common and readily attainable in the bazaar or from friends, is not vendor sold (to my knowledge anyway).<br />
<br />
If that is true, it appears that at least the vendor-sold spells are being excluded from the reward list.  I am going to be sorely disappointed if I receive Circle of Winter from the parchment I currently have, but at least I don't ahve to also worry about receiving another copy of Counteract Poison or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a good point, hope it's true.  But I'm pretty sure I've heard of people getting Counteract Disease.  But I haven't seen any confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RangerKeaianea</div><div class="date">10-29-2002, 07:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, turned in two parchments on different days.  Got a copy of SoT each time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, and Alchemy was working perfectly fine the first 9 months of release, Holy Avenger quest was in the game since day 1, etc and so forth.  Taking what they say with a grain of salt is still giving them too much credence.  Believe something when you see it, the only way to keep your sanity in this game.</div></div><hr />

How can be proactively get this fixed?  I am going to have to guess that the spell given is random based on the vendor flag and spell level.<br />
<br />
How can we contact the powers that be to let them know this is not acceptable?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elindel</div><div class="date">10-30-2002, 03:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You know, looking at it more I don't think it's such a problem.  Sure CoW and CoS are easily obtained, but they are dropped spells, and that still only means 4 spells we can get with our parchments. <br />
<br />
But rumor is this is getting fixed in the patch on thursday.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thurgen</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 06:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">woot, look at the patch msg :)<br />
<br />
<br />
- Spell drops were updated in the first two tier Planes of Power zones.<br />
<br />
- Classes with 61+ level spells from other expansions will find they no longer receive these spells as rewards for turning in scrolls in the Plane of Knowledge.  Spells that can be purchased will no longer be given as rewards either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mirklin Darklander</div><div class="date">10-31-2002, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, should be fixed today!  hooray!</div></div><hr />

Now we can be confident in knowing we will get new spells.  Some people before were passing on the parchments just cause it was unsure of what we would get.
