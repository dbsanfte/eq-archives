<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, so I've got Canni V, have Spirit Call, but now I'm not sure where to go next.  Obviously the guild wants me to go for MGB (which I'll probably do), but I'm seriously tempted to go with Improved Natural Durability, since extra hp=extra mana.  Not in a hardcore raiding guild (and will likely never join one), so while MGB would be nice to have, not sure how vital it is.  Would love to hear the AA path other folks took post Canni V.<br />

Thanks,<br />

When searching for AA - I use 2 words in quotes, such as &quot;AA points&quot; or &quot;AA skills&quot; or &quot;AA help&quot; or &quot;AA advice&quot;  or certain specific AA's.  Like SCRM.<br />

<br />
Notice &quot;AA advice&quot; etc in quotes scrm not in quotes cause there is a 3 letter minimum.. anyway.. why would I ever search for anything if people will just do the search for me and post it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Innate Charisma and Innate Intelligence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I would advise training innate wisdom, suspended minion, and channeling focus first.<br />
<br />
Actually one thing I will add (I'm presuming the above is sarcasim, ignore me if I'm wrong =), channeling focus 1 and 2 seemed to do absolutely nothing for me, if anything I found I was getting interupted more on average.<br />
<br />
However with maxed def aa + channeling focus 3, I find theres not that much that can actually reliably interupt me, I've tanked 65 monks with mid to high end weapons (IE Rebb and earlier pop/sol 1 handers) toe to toe and managed to malos/dot them down without slowing np, if I wedge myself against something, short of getting stunned I find I'm pretty much uninteruptable.  Another interesting note is that CA3 seems to greatly increase your chance of channeling through getting bashed/kicked, if I'm not stunned, theres roughly a 50% chance I'll channel regardless.<br />
<br />
Its not in the same league as CA3 etc, but its a much better AA than many give it credit for.</div></div><hr />
