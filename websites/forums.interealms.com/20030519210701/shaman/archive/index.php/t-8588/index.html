<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm making a new Shaman and I can't decide on a Vah Shir or a Barb. Since it's sorta of a toss up between the 2 I was wondering how the quests compare between the 2. For example is there some kind of newbie armor quests for the kitties that there isn't for the barbs? I've been reading about the barbs' quests but there isn't much about the vah shir. So which has better quests the kitties or the barbarians?<br />

The only drawback now for kitty shammies is we can't wear a fungi /shrug<br />
We have higher starting AC, too, and natural safe fall.<br />
/purrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Go with the kitty. We have tons of quests from level 1 up. Not to mention we get a nice vah/shm only cloak. Dont worry about Fungi there is a regen breastplate in fungus grove for the kittys.</div></div><hr />

I decided to go with a barbarian. Which is totally against every thing you guys said but I was really worried about an exp penalty and I heard that the cats have one. Maybe I'm wrong about that though. I'm still young, only 14, but i'm having a good time. I'm not twinking myself (that's why I asked about quests),  but I'm wondering if I should be meleeing at all? I find myself medding most of the time then doting and slowing, and some times nuking. So should I be meleeing at all? or just dotting and nuking? I have a 1hb is that the best for me, or should i look for a piecing? I'm just so confused. Also should I go for higher ac or wis?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Cats have no exp penalty lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">What?! I read that they did. <br />
<br />
Silly me.<br />
I think the kittys are just to sexy for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ysgwyrthyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hehe... cat's hav no exp penalty and Barbs hav a 5% penalty.<br />

Yu shud definately melee IN TEH FACE so ta speak.  Da important ting is ta keep yer combat skills, particularly Defence, maxed.  Uddawise, wen a mob breaks root, it gonna cum wailing down on ya wif yu as tuff as a Barbie doll.  Latah on in life, it gets harder ta keep skills maxed so best ta start early and keep da habit.<br />
<br />
In terms of weapons, der be a few 1hb options until ya get ta 40+ or so.  Den dem seem ta dry up.  Methinx da last time me used a 1hb woz wen me woz about 30th in (da old) Cazic Thule.  Yer best bet be ta try and keep piercing and 2hb maxed each level.  Der be sum fun 2hb weaps out der (nuttin like hittin fer 100+ regularly :)).  Melee ain't one of our strong suits.  Our main reason fer bein IN TEH FACE is ta tank fer puppy.  At higher levels, startin at about 29-34, we get haste and slow and our melee is just like anudda DoT.  Even latah, wen yu get yer beloved JBB, yu'll hav one swing in atween each blast so might as well make it a gud'un wif a meaty 2hb.<br />
<br />
As fer yer question about AC or Wis, da answer be most likely HP, den Mana, den AC, den Wis.  It all depends on why yer dieing however.  If yu be dying wif mana left den HP and AC be da way ta go.  If yu constantly runnin OOM, den Mana and Wis be da answer.  It'll change wen ya hit 24 and get Cannibalize but until den, yu probly best ta go HP and AC.  Wis drops outta da sky latah on so dinna worry 'bout it.<br />
