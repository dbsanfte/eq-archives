This ability provides a previously unheard of level of stealth. The Rogue is able to draw shadows about himself so completely, even creatures that are normally not fooled by such trickery are frequently unable to see him. You may train in this ability upon reaching level 63.<br />
<br />
Nimble Evasion<br />
This ability grants you a chance to hide or evade while moving. Each rank provides an increasing chance. You may train in this ability once each level after reaching level 61.<br />
<br />
Technique of Master Wu<br />
Under the tutelage of Wu, Monks are able to hone their skills to the point of being able to execute a second and sometimes even third strike when scoring a hit with their special attacks. This ability grants a ten percent increase in the chance of scoring multiple special attacks, per rank.<br />
<br />
Host of the Elements<br />
This ability calls an assault of elemental minions into existence directed at a target. The minions attack the target without question until they are called back to their plane 6seconds later. The initial rank of this ability calls five elementals. Additional ranks add two elementals each. You may train the ranks of this ability at or after levels 63, 64, and 65.</font></p>

Or at each level you will need additional AA points to train each thing you want... The first way is too easy (unless the levels are all worse then 59 or the result of completeing really rough encounters in PoP) and the second makes me want to tear my hair out. Do one level, then earn 10-25 AA points, then do the next level? Auugh! heh.</font></p>

<br />
Guardian of the Forest <br />
This ability transforms you into an exceptionally bloodthirsty wolf that attacks with lightning speed, for a brief time. You may train the three ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65. <br />
<br />
Spirit of the Wood <br />
For a brief time, you are able to commune with the woodland spirits who provide you r party with exceptional regenerative abilities and a protective shield of armor and thorns. You may train in the three ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65. <br />
<br />
Other than the archetype looking ones, these appear to be our new class skills...<br />
<br />
Definitely need a TrueShot and Weaponshield refresh reducer to be in line with the other "hastened" abilities.  Also if Knights are getting Triple attack on 2handers, we better darned well get it on Duel Wield.</font></p>

This ability transforms you into an exceptionally bloodthirsty wolf that attacks with lightning speed, for a brief time. You may train the three ranks of this ability at or after levels 61, 63, and 65."<br />
<br />
I'm actually happy with this one.  Those times when archery isn't an option and damage discs are called for, I'd like to have something to add to the fray.  This is almost exactly what I was hoping for.  It's not a /disc as I'd have liked, but it's close enough.</font></p>

I thought 2handers was already more damaging than dual weild?  Yet 2handers get a bunch of enhancements leaving the duel weilders in the dust.  Oh well <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

i'm kinda worried about this myself, the wording seems to indicate some skills can be trained "at" and some can be trained "at or after" but it isn't clear that the first type cannot be trained later.  <br />
<br />
maybe VI is trying to avoid everyone rushing to 65 within a few days of PoP coming out by only allowing skills to be trained at certain levels.</font></p>

	<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">I'm just a little worried because knights were already outdamaging us in some situations with their great 2handers.  Now their being given increased chances to double attack and a chance to triple attack which will up their dps over ours in nearly all situations.   Which is great for pal/sk's, I mean I love our pal/sk's in our guild but...I don't want to get left in the dust.<br />
<br />
I must say, if they get those two abilities then rangers should get a chance to do an extra attack per round ( read: triple attack ) and a flurry of some sort like Vladimirr mentioned.<br />
<br />
I guess it depends tho on what class the vanishing blade is for,and what the Guardian of the Forest really does.</font></p>

i'm kinda worried about this myself, the wording seems to indicate some skills can be trained "at" and some can be trained "at or after" but it isn't clear that the first type cannot be trained later.  <br />
<br />
maybe VI is trying to avoid everyone rushing to 65 within a few days of PoP coming out by only allowing skills to be trained at certain levels. </b></td></tr></table><br />

i seriously dooubt that..<br />
<br />
the same wa they said we'd have custom titles for having "certain" aas, in reality meainingif you have 42 aa you vet a class title haha<br />
<br />
so they mean you just have to be those levels or over to get those skillls.....  if they do limit it by level and you cant get mre if you pass the level then that would be ungodly retarded... i would be levle 61 forever hahahahah</font></p>

First lvl:  Increase attack speed by 50%, increase ATK by 100<br />
2nd lvl: Increase attack speed by 75%, increase ATK by 120<br />
3rd lvl: Increase attack speed by 99%, increase ATK by 140<br />
<br />
Only problem with this ability is if it doesn't break the haste cap.  In raids it would be really nice to do a melee dmg offensive disc, but your more than likely to be at haste cap anyway.  Thus this ability wouldn't do much in that situation besides add ATK.  That doesn't completely stink, but when you consider it's only for 48 seconds...  yeah it does kinda.</font></p>

	<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">So what if it turns out these skills are open to ALL classes at each of thier designated levels.So then you gotta decide what to choose.Ya know a path that takes you down certain skill trees each level.You may choose casting,healing,combat,or a mix(hybrid).So you can in effect over the course of the 60' reshape your charcter to lean more towards of of these archtypes in your class.<br />
<br />
For example you follow the spell skills and become a more druid ranger casting spells alot now.Or perhaps you would go combat and be come more of a warrior type.If I'm right and VI gets smart and does it this way the game could become much more intresting.Allwoing everyone to bring something to the raid enviroment that they know EQ will become completely.I figure 90% of the accounts will have a 55+ character with in a year.Vi is Looking to catter only to that audience by the time EQ2 shows up.This way they can go back to old zones and "creat new content there" keeping all these higher ups that can now spend tons of time grinding all the aaxp,levels and these new post 60 style levels.Everquest is starting to show her age.She's gonna wither down to a small elite group of fans who will play her to the days of new games and new types of MMORPG's that will come.So they will only need to pander to this type after next year.EQ is gonna be all raiding before long.<br />

<br />
 "Guardian of the Forest seems to be our only class ability, seems pretty cool, but, I would trade it in a sec for a shorter refresh on WS or TS comparable to what Knights are being awarded. <br />
<br />
Kinidyen"<br />
<br />
   First saying you should get a change in refresh time on WS because shadowknights are getting lower on HT is  kind of silly.  First HT is resistable and can also be partially resisted after the recent changes...second it will take 18 aa points using something close to the current framework to get a HT every 48 minutes. I don't know of a shadowknight who would actually buy this ability unless they had the points just lying around or were some form of masochist. Comparing Weaponshield to HT ..I can't even begin to say whats wrong with that. Tell you what I'll gladly trade you HT for Weapon shield <br />
<br />
   Second Two handers do NOT usually outdamage people with dual wield. Once again they do NOT usually outdamage an equally equipped dual wielder. The whole difference in the damage equations comes down to gear plain and simple. You have higher weapon caps,dual wield,and double attack. A PERCENTAGE chance of an extra attack does not equal better. I hope we do get this ability,after the aggro nerfs it would be a welcome upgrade when it does work. At least a little soothing eye candy for us Knights.<br />
<br />
  I agree rangers should get some form of trueshot upgrade or something "rangery". Heck I think you guys should get the flurry ability or maybe even rampage. Being the dual wielding double attacking kinda guys(and gals) you are. I am not in a great position to judge what rangers need not being one myself <img src="images/smilies/tongue.gif" border="0" alt=""> <br />
<br />
  All I am asking is lets be happy for one another and work to get everyone brought in line...not brought down.<br />
 <br />
    Just my opinion<br />
   Sorchek Ebonmoon<br />
 60th rank Knight of Shadows<br />
"Sexiest SK on Fennin Ro"<br />
<br />
P.S. Tae I catch you trying to get them to remove our AA abilities again I'll have to feed you to Otis   <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""></font></p>

<br />
The only problem with the gear argument is the horrible disparity in luclin on ratio of ranger usable weapons versus other classes.  Knights have some sick 2hs ratios and on high ac mobs like in luclin, well....my offhand dmg counts for nothing.<br />
I'll be curious if the trend continues in POP.<br />

	<p><font face="arial, helvetica" size="2">I'd say Gaurdian of the Forest would HAVE to stack beyond the haste cap, otherwise there would be no point in them putting it in.  Most of us are already at the haste cap with Enchanter buffs and Swiftwind.  I seriously doubt they believe +100 ATK for 8 ticks is worth the effort of getting the skill.<br />
<br />
As for Dual Wield improvements.  It seems to me that Ferocity is definitely a skill available to Rangers given the wording.  Adding that to Ambidexterity seems like quite a significant increase in damage using Dual Wield.<br />
<br />
If the haste on Guardian of the Forest stacks with other forms of haste (and so far Lucy shows that it does) and fully surpasses any haste caps then I'll be happy with our PoP skills as they are.  Since I have no idea how they plan for us to obtain them, I'll reserve my opinion on that.</font></p>

  It definitely looks like some of them do.  And I wouldn't be surprised if that's how they prevent people from progressing as fast.<br />
<br />
  I saw the new finishing blow ability, and immediately thought i had wasted my points in it that I've already spent.  If, on the other hand, you can't train in the new PoP version until you have FB3, it might add an interesting twist to some of the skills.  <br />
<br />
  A lot of the other class abilities specifically state they work with an already existing AA ability.  I wouldn't be surprised if that trend is more widespread than we expect.</font></p>

   I agree there is a gear disparity,hence where the change should come not in the abilites themselves. Of course I think they have been watering down all the classes in the gear department. for SKs who want to go sword and board they are pretty much pigeonholed into the 2 Hander. I think the new AA abilities as posted just go further that direction.<br />
<br />
   Anyways we have had this discussion before <br />
