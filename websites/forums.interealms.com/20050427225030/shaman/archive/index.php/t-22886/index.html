<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Webbie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all<br />
<br />
I have a friend who duel boxes a 61 druid and a lvl 59 (almost 60) warrior who I play with often.  The druid is basicallya buff/healer bot while the warrior and I do the fighting.  The druid also just got animal DC if that helps any.<br />
<br />
What I'm wondering is, what zone would be good for us to play in, a combination of both exp and drops?<br />
<br />
I've been reading a lot here about Droga and Nurga.  I checked out Droga a few lvls ago and got a pretty good beat down, but was wondering if it is now doable at my lvl solo, or with my friend.  Or should I stick with trying out Nurga for a while?<br />
<br />
Recent zones we have done:<br />
     City of Mist - exp starting to falter<br />
     Fungus grove - exp sucked <br />
     Nadox - OK exp, but getting really bored here<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your suggestion.<br />
<br />
edit - trying to fix my sig to lvl 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think Droga and Nadox are about the same difficulty-wise.  My suggestion for better xp would be to find some more bodies to fill up the group and do PoV.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Droga is probably in your range.  Check out the areas closer to the Nurga zone-ins.  If you are having an easy time of Nurga then step into Droga and start working there.<br />
<br />
Also, consider Nadox.  Would be very good for your level.  Decent plat and XP.<br />
<br />
Peace,<br />

You still can use upgrades from the Nurga free slave quests.  Go hunt tier 4 and 5 in Nurga.  I have some info in the Quest section that I wrote a thread on.  At the bottom is a link to the Nurgalopedia which gives more detail than any other zone reference I've ever found AND a level 60 Shaman Magelo using only Nurga/Nurga quest items and Chardok quest items (you get positive chardok faction in Nurga).  Not there are no Chest or shoulder options for a shaman but I think that there will be plenty of upgrades for both you and your friend.  Droga is great, but hard and named take a while to spawn.</div></div><hr />

Velks wasn't bad XP at 60 in Velious.<br />
ME (the alien fort) / Akheva Ruines / Acrylia Cave you could try but could be a bit rough.</div></div><hr />
