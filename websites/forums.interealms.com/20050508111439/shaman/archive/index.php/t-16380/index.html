<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in a LD pick up group, a few of the players were in guilds together.  We were having so much fun that somone said he was trying to think of excuses not to raid the following day so he could do more crawling.  Another player says yeah this expansion will really mess up some guilds.  I gave my shaman away at 62 and rolled a twink due to limited play times and left the guild I was in, so I havent really thought about it much really.  The million dollar question is, if people are having more fun doing dungeons crawls, will it hamper the major raiding?  Kind of an interesting thought.  I guess maybe will have to wait and see what the loot is like coming from LDoN Raid encounters 1st.<br />
<br />
Uberguild rule # 5690 NO Dungeon Crawling on raid days!  Those days are not for fun!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>lordkaldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Heh. LDoN is fun I will admit that much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">no. In the crucible channel someone linked a ring with elemental stats. FT5, 140 hp/mana, resists all around and great stats. Where did it drop? on a LDoN raid.<br />
<br />
LDoN removes some of the bigger pains of raiding, &quot;Is xxx mob up yet?&quot;, &quot;Oh sh*t, so-and-so guild is mobilizing for our mob. We have to form our raid faster.&quot;<br />
<br />
Basically it makes raiding convinient You can decide when you want to raid down to the second, it's at very easy to reach locations, and you have zero competition whatsoever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well this is a normal pattern during the first few weeks of every expansion.<br />
<br />
People want to do the new, the fresh stuff and the old places to raid are not bringing as much fun as the new zones.<br />
<br />
However after a few weeks you will see that things go back to normal, except this time there is a place for the non 90+ raid to raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well the annoying part is not being able to leave your group in the middle of an adventure.  You can't just get a replacement and leave for a guild raid.  <br />
If anything, this will being guilds closer together because they will only want to adventure together so they can leave easily when a raid is called.  <br />
Sure makes pickup groups harder to commit to though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I hope nothing.  While guilds are about attaining end game loot, they are also about progression.  I doubt that I will sit at an exp camp anymore, however I will still raid as much as possible with my guild.  <br />
<br />
The fact that there are some guild events may allow for something worthwhile to do lootwise if you get fcfs'd.<br />
<br />
I can't see this being as issure with some of the more serious raiding guilds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">People want to do the new, the fresh stuff and the old places to raid are not bringing as much fun as the new zones.<br />
<br />
<br />
And generally there are a couple of guilds on each server that use the break to snatch up what are usually heavily contested spawns. EQ goes on. It will do nothing but good for guilds who don't raid as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kujoh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My raidleader already said he just knows that LDoN is gonna drive him crazy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For those of us not in raiding guilds, LDoN can only be a plus.  I’m a member of a small guild.  None of us are in the guild for raids.  We are in the guild because we enjoy each other’s company.  We do get together from time to time and take on different dungeons, but those are usually scheduled and we aren’t after a particular mob.  So if the time restrictions of LDoN don’t prove too constraining I’m sure this will simply give us new locations to explore and new ways to have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Our raidleader and guildleader got together and decided that they couldn't compete with a new expansion, so they put a halt on most raids for a week.  We still ahve one planned today, and one later this week, but others have been called.<br />
<br />
This is the week that we are going to be doing some backflagging, mainly easy ones like Hedge and Factory, as they dont take more than a group that knows what to do and another group or two to tag along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Since you can bring raids into LDON dungeons, it<br />
shouldn't affect raiding guilds too much. Although,<br />
I read something about only being able to raid <br />
every five days. Is that per each of the five camps,<br />
or does that mean you can only raid ANY LDON<br />
dungeon every five days? If the latter, then a guild<br />
that raids more often will just need to put raids on<br />
the back burner for a couple of weeks, until the<br />
novelty wears off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can see one big problem:<br />
Most PoP raid require 50+ peeps (to be more realistic 60-72). To get this number most guilds recruited as many new members as they needed. Now LDoN is only for 18-36 peeps. I guess at least for us it will be late night raids or a quick raid if we don#t have the numbers for a PoP raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Having to recruit a lot of people to swell the ranks for an elemental god killing guild to be successful, and then this expansion comes out with the 36 cap is a dick slap to the face.  <br />
<br />
They should make the raid content have another harder difficulty rating and put the cap at 72 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oooh, penis references - you sound just like Furor, here, have a cookie!<br />
<br />
Since your dungeon group has to stay together, and focus on the goal, I'd imagine this should help guild cohesion in a way, since your best shot is to take a reliable bunch of guildies in with you.  I've heard only horror stories from friends and guildies who've done pickup dungeons - there's always at least one (non-rogue) twit opening every crate until he blows the party to smithereens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">And Whipped together the 6 that were on and available for a LDoN Adventure. <br />
<br />
20 minutes later 3 more folks got on. I had to tell them Sorry will probably be 2 hours before we are done here.<br />
<br />
That part I dont like. Where in Tactics pit We could just say come on down. And swap up a mini raid or something.<br />
<br />
The hard time limit is good in that it gives you a concrete setting for each run. it is very bad that If something comes up you are in for a loss if you need to bail or people get on.<br />
<br />
Another thing that will hurt is, the whole thing of sorry I have 6 here. Find something else to do. Well if you dont have a group leader in that mass of people that are there, well then. I have seen them log to get on an alt rather than try and get something going. <br />
<br />
(By a group leader I mean someone that will start and run a group somewhere, many many people just don't know how, can't or won't start a group for themselves. Leader/follower dynamic is a big deal now with LDoN)<br />
<br />
I am trying to get some folks to be group leaders in my guild but it is hard cause the proper support groups are not there.<br />
<br />
If you have a leader and 17 Followers you can have a good small raid somewhere in any of the old zones but With LDoN you need 3 Viable coherent groups with three Leaders. Very very hard proposistion to be honest. Else people fall by the wayside and feel left out.<br />
<br />
Like My guilds main cleric logged last night cause he got on 4 minutes after we started an Adventure, And without another slower and a very high distaste for grouping with non guildies, it was easier for him to log and watch a movie than wait around for folks to get done. (Other shaman was on an alt in an Adventure, Beastlord and another guild ranger were in a pick up group adventure, My hot box Enchanter was hanging out at the adventure zone in spot. Third shaman was snagging some food after having just finished an adventure. Just bad timeing but a few more and he will get discouraged)<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all it is going to be very intresting cause the classic Uberguild makeup is not a balanced one. It is one of Min max and what is availabe with certain leadership people of varying classes that might not work with the LDoN dynamic. And Like Furor said between talking about his pecker and such, It will form Cliques and in an uberguild of Egocentric people who are used to being the best of the best (Or some such thing) Being told Nah we dont need you for at least 2-3 hours sorry. Isnt going to fly to well.<br />
<br />
I dunno if this makes sense Or not. Just rambling away on some of my thoughts, but While the adventure last night was fun Deciding who got to go with me certainly was not. <br />
<br />
Oh and Won one and lost one last night. And Yes it was a blast, but the stress of watching people get frustrated cause they couldnt join in sucked. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I bet it will have an impact, and I love that the top end raids in this expansion are capped at 36.  This means that all the people who zerged for PoP will find themselves having to do things with a lot less people.<br />
<br />
So far this expansion could not have worked out better for my guild.  There are about 6 of us who play regularly and we all run from 3 to 4 characters each (Around 22 total characters online in zerg mode).  So for 6 person dungeon adventures, we pick and choose the classes that are needed that night and just go play.  And if someone comes in late, we just log an extra character out and they play that character.  Just plain awesome. <br />
<br />
At some point we're going to try one of the raids and see if there are some named we can take out for some decent loot (doubtful that we can finish a raid with only 20).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The really weird part is that the LDoN raids are tuned against people with gear you need a large raiding guild to get (VT,Time).<br />
<br />
So if you're a casual guild you can't do it at all. If you're an uber guild you can't all do it. I think it's going to be nasty.<br />
<br />
But I like grouping, so I could care.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sssive O.</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Anyone do a raid yet in LDoN?  How did it go?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">well thi gonna really hurt the guild im in and it has the GL getting aggrivated and logging. I think the leader board and win loss rations should not have been put in because people are gonna grinch if you have the adventure (which i will do for guild raid).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Secs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I haven't raided in LDoN yet, well I havent raided at all since the release, raids were put on halt, which I think gives everybody the amount of time it needs to explore, and see what you can get for your points, although, the person who said it should be raised to 72 people is wrong.  Firstly, 72 people + indoor zone.... is not a good idea, 36 is a good number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Yodelroy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A more apt question is what will it do to non-LDoN xp zones? I think it'll harshly close them down. Who the hell would goto BoT, HoH, PoV, PoS, etc when you can get the same xp and adventure points in LDoN? Soloers+duoers yes but groups? No, IMO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Its not the same exp, PoP is still FAR better exp then LDoN dungeons.  No comparison.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">For Fun Family Guilds...<br />
<br />
OMG ! Finally a viable playstyle for more casual guilds that doesn't lead to a glass cieling. You can get exellent gear from the adventure merchants if you work at it. Small guilds will probably love fielding one or two groups in these dungeons. Levelling up as a guild will be sooo much more fun. This would have saved my old guild if it had come out 2 years ago. It might still give it a boost today. (the creation of epic quests for all the classes was the first step to destroying small fun guilds) The 18 - 36 man raids will be perfect for these guilds as people work up to being able to do the adventures on hard setting, which has Vex thall quality drops (or very close) from what I've seen. I also predict it will raise the general level of competence in the game due to players who will once again be getting real dungeon experience and teamwork.<br />
<br />
<br />
For raid guilds..<br />
<br />
Our guild leaders have already stated we won't be doing official Ldon raids... PERIOD. Don't bother asking for em. In a guild that usually fields 50 - 70 people for those nasty PoP raids there's no way they're going to leave 20 - 30 people behind because of the idiotic 36 people maximum limit that isn't consistent with what high level content and especially POP has forced (yes...forced) guilds to become. It just wouldn't be fair to those getting left behind and quite frankly, I don't blame the leadership for not wanting to deal with the tension something like this is bound to create. <br />
<br />
Incidentally if you think 70 people raids = zerging... You haven't raided in POP. Numbers mean nothing if you don't have exellent strategy and perfect execution. This isn't Old world where a semi decent complete healing chain is the answer to every problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For Xp zones...<br />
<br />
Pop rendered all other zones obsolete for xp grinding with it's insane experience modifiers. If you're wanting xp, it's still much better than LDoN.<br />
<br />
Pre-pop Soloers will still solo wherever soloing is soloable... LDoN still requires certain classes to be doable and the hard time limits can be a constraint. It will likely free up many good xp zones but I doubt it will completely replace them. It's an exellent alternative with good risk/reward for people who are willling to go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Having to recruit a lot of people to swell the ranks for an elemental god killing guild to be successful, and then this expansion comes out with the 36 cap is a dick slap to the face.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Ooh yeah that's the ticket.  Since the last expansion catered to big guilds, this one should too.  Since small guilds are very limited in POP, why add anything for small guilds in LDON?  Dammit, they should have COMMITTED to doing content solely for large guilds after POP!  Screw the casual raiders, screw the people who hate the large guild scene, LET'S HAVE MORE OF THE SAME!<br />
<br />
Big guilds will continue to exist as long as people want to do the large encounters.  But big guilds had their turn, it's someone else's turn now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I disagree that the 36 limit is a slap in the face to raiding guilds.<br />
<br />
Uber guilds can still get out of this expansion much the same things that anyone else can - fun 6 people groups. Maybe none of the drops there will be upgrades, but who knows what huge numbers of points will buy, and adding augmentations can improve the most uber of gear, albeit slightly.<br />
<br />
The raids... well, that's not the main focus of LDoN, but I imagine most of the uber guilds will do what my guild did last night - form up a raid outside normal guild raiding hours, and take whoever wants to come along, as a non-&quot;official&quot; raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I really don't like the 36 person limit on raids in LDoN. Or, rather, I think it's inconsistent with the apparent difficulty of those raids, and the other game content. Raid guilds have expanded to the point where they can regulardly field 60+ people for their raids. What do those guilds do, when just over half their force can go on a raid? It's going to get ugly. <br />
<br />
And then there are the small guilds, who don't have the gear that is required to do even the normal difficulty raids in LDoN. If the raids scaled in difficulty based on raid size, and had an easier setting, it would be nirvana for casual guilds. Now you could actually PLAN when you're going to have a raid - which is what those guilds need to do to get the people online to have a raid force, even a 20-30 person raid force. But those guilds can't do the raids, because the lowest setting is too hard. Maybe in 6 months or a year they can gear up via LDoN adventures and then have a chance. Maybe. <br />
<br />
I really don't see how the LDoN raids are good for ANYONE. Well, perhaps for people in a PoT-capable guild that is losing membership. After a bunch of people get bored and quit, and their raid numbers shrink, they can turn into a LDoN-raiding guild, if they don't keep recruiting except for required classes to maintain 36 person raids. <br />
<br />
It really seems like something has to change here.</div></div><hr />
