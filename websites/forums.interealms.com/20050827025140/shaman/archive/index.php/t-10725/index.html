anyone else see that ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Higher level frogs (dark blue to lvl 54) are spawning at Guk entrance and getting trained by players to Grobb.   Of course, they keep getting trained to the PoK book too.  Haven't seen anything really cool dropping off them but they do look nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like guk is about to be reworked.  If you want anything of the old guk stuff - better get it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">People participating in the event talking about it have been saying the frogloks took over Grobb, killing every troll.  Trolls now spawning when created in Neriak some place.  Hope you didn't kill wizard brothers and necro in third gate!  They don't have faction with too many people, but...<br />
<br />
Guk frogs on different faction than new frogloks.<br />
<br />
There's some funny dialogue supposedly.  Trolls have been imprisoned, and one wonders if the Frogloks are gonna eat Da Bashers.  A froglok guard answers that he doesn't know if that will be more unpleasant for the trolls or the frogloks.<br />
<br />
A 62 cleric and 52 warrior fighting frogloks got owned quickly; supposedly mobs level 54-65, though I'm sure the levels vary depending where you are.<br />
<br />
The question that comes to my mind is -- what's the loot like?<br />
<br />
And -- are trolls with bad neriak faction REALLY gonna have to KOS in their own home city -- er, part of a city, that is?  And are dark elves that killed trolls now going to be KOS to part of THEIR own home city?</div></div><hr />

<br />
So because of a change that Sony is doing - I'm going to suffer to something I did over last 2 plus years.   I'm going to have to work on my DE faction just to get in to my NEW city home in some backalley of Neriak?    <br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like guk is about to be reworked. If you want anything of the old guk stuff - better get it now. <br />
<br />
Why would you say this ... surely SOE is going to move those quests and race forge to Neriak.      Right?   SOE is going to take care of this stuff?   /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Something tells me cultural smithing, the snare necklace, and every old Grobb quest is about to become broken.<br />
<br />
At least my Spiritstone still takes me near Oggok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As much as I hate losing my home (I killed many frogs today) why does this really matter gamewise? I mean unless you are newly created (and seeing as you said you spent 2+ years gimping Neriak faction I assume you aren't).<br />
<br />
Why do you need shamans from Grobb? Spells are available in Oggok (not sure if kos never tried), in Cabilis (they like me more there than they did in Grobb), SH, should be np there, PoK (no one kos there). There is also a shaman trainer that is not kos in PoK and herb vendors all around that are not kos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">im just happy they changed something and a story is progressing and not remaining stagnant as it has been</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Buuk<br />
 <br />
I've seen the light - why not turn off all starter cities and make them all Frog leg zones.    PoK and SH can service everyone ... we don't need cities at all.   <br />
<br />
Of course we don't NEED these cities from a game prespective but from a player side of things ... I liked having my own city ... and I was very comfortable with Grobb.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure this is true anymore.  Found this on EQTraders...<br />
<br />
Additionally, ogre and troll shammies, please note that the Spiritstone of Innothule is now Spiritstone of the Banished, and it ports you to Nektulos, not Innothule. We expect to see the storyline explanation for this change &quot;soon&quot;)<br />
<br />
I guess it's  nice that trolls will be able to get to their new city easily enough, but that really sucks for ogres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">All I know is that I have been kicked out of my home and I don't like it one whit. <br />
Does it truely matter to my gameplay- not terribly, but some. I liked grobb and the swamp. I'm really hoping it goes back to the way it was once the new zones go live and they can actually put the froggies somewhere.<br />
<br />
 Heck maybe they can use the occaision to put some decent quests in Grobb. Somehow my Grobb Cleaver and Helm of Hukulk seem dated. <br />
<br />
But overall, I'm decidedly annoyed. <br />
<br />
As for faction.. I used to loose faction with the broken skull clan ages ago doing quests, I wonder if that's going to matter with LoY?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Buuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Honestly, I personally would prefer it if there were more dynamic events and cities were taken over (e.g gnolls cream halas or qeynos, orcs take over kelethin or freeport ) as long as there is at least 1 starting place that is safe, and 1 place to train/buy spells later it won't matter.<br />
<br />
As a troll I hate the change of course (role playing that is). I fought the invasion for all I was worth, but alas I was overpowered in the end. Maybe me and a few other powerful trolls can gather soon and lay waste to the frogs. <br />
<br />
From a non-rp point of view it's like this. With pop your spells are just as easily available as is a trainer. I seriously don't think I ever went to Grobb since level 34 or so (prior to the invasion). Sure it may be *slightly* annoying if you were used to go there, but all you have to do is go to 1 other place for all the technical game-play needs. I am actually glad they did something dynamic that has consequences in the game world.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">After helping the druids and rogues in my guild with their epics, I am KOS to Inky warriors in Neriak. After soloing in 3rd gate, I am KOS to casters. I have to gird up for battle to use the bank in Commons.<br />
<br />
AND WHAT'S MORE THE TROLL NPCS IN FOREIGN QUARTER GOT NO FACES!!!! WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO MY RACE?!?!?!?!?<br />
<br />
So in revenge I took the PoK book to the swamp and then got jumped by a bunch of frogs. I hightailed it for Feerot, saw some guards at the zone, ran through them, healed/medded back up, came back out with guns blazing, then saw light blue cons RESIST 75 PERCENT OF MY SPELLS!!! I zoned back out, rethought my tactics, went back in AND THEY WERE GONE! COWARDS!<br />
<br />
So I went over to the newbie guard area. Saw some other peeps attempt to kill guards and get owned. I gave it a shot, managed to get a guard down to half, but had to zone because I went OOM.<br />
<br />
You know, I read the chronic complainers posts here from time to time and laugh. I picture them in their own little playpens, throwing temper tantrums when the planet doesn't revolve around them. SLOW GOT MITIGATED IN TOP TIER PLANES! WAAAH! AFFLICTION FOCUS ITEMS GOT NERFED! WAAAAAAAHHHHH!!!! NOW I'M POUNDING MY LITTLE FISTIES ON THE FLOOR AND BAWLING JUST LIKE THE REST OF THEM! WWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!</div></div><hr />

I'd like to see these kinds of events continue, but fairly.  For instance, the Trolls take over Rivervale next week.</div></div><hr />

Make it dynamic and actually have something like player involvement.  Example - there could be a takeover of Halas by trolls.  If the barbarians successfully fight off the trolls on that server, then the takeover shouldn't happen.</div></div><hr />

Yep ... I'm all for that one too.   I'd kick them all to live in a EQ version of &quot;A van down by the River&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Irda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">They may change the factions upon release for those who have killed their faction with Neriak before, but this is just speculation.</div></div><hr />

It has made life very nice to be able to bind in some very out of the way places knowing I could gate to the swamp and run to the book or sell.  Bastads!!!  I know its a game - Im taking this attack on Grobb very personal and im pissed!<br />

Slamdooley</div></div><hr />

Cleric Frogs buff and Heal out of melee range.  Shaman frogs attemtp Malice and slow then melee<br />
<br />
I hate being chased out of my home but lots of frog blood was on my spear before the night was over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The frogs took over Grobb on Innoruuk last night.  They kept swarming the entrance area and bashers kept spawning to defend it.  Eventually the frogs began spawning in side.  The killed every troll and froggy guards spawned and settled down in position where the old troll guards were.  Their were paly, shaman, and wizzy frogs that I remember for sure.  Naturally being an ogre I was KoS.  This all took place on the Innoruuk server anyway.  All I got were wooden shield and rusty from the frogs.  <br />
<br />
The new models were pretty neat, some good color combos.  They did the flip casting and their drowning graphic is pretty neat when they get hit with the epic.<br />
