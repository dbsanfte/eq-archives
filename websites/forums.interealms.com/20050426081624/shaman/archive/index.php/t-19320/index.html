<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am currently splitting time between LDoN, PoV, and BoT for my group hunts. Any other idea where to hunt in a group to make it from 64-65?<br />
<br />
How about solo? Like today I had about an hour an a half to kill and was unable to land a quick group for experience before I had to head into the office. /sigh  So I would like to have a few solo options as well....<br />
<br />
<br />
Any insight you can provide is much appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KudorWolfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I personally like to solo a bit for experience before i head to work and school as you said. Placed I tend to hit up are the hidden caves in PoJ. Not the best experience but pretty easy kills and chance to get stuff for trade skills. That or head up to PoV and just pull whatever you want in on of the courtyards. Just keep Kei up and you can get pretty decent exp. I Personally hit up fire in field 2 alot usually for 20 min or so but dont know how your flags are</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hoh<br />
cod isn't bad<br />
frogs in pos<br />
there are massive posts in this section on soloing. search them out and try stuff.  there are very specific explinatoins for some things...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont' go any where else but BoT and PoV is you are wanting to group for experience.  Yep they are full of idiots but for the level and ease of getting started I know of no other zones that beat them.<br />
<br />
PoV is good for experience solo NE wall on Golems but you have to be KEI/Virtue buffed and it can be dicey.  I guess it is about 5% a kill.  An easy place with in 2 zones of PoK is Droga.  I get about 1.5 AA% a kill and average 10pp.  It is not going to move your regular experience bar much but it is EASY, Gives Moderate experience and good Cash.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Currently I am nto flagged beyond normal for any ofthe planes, but that is soemthign I will be workign on.<br />
<br />
I have used the search feature a bit and level 64 seems vague for information, it may be possible I am not qualifying my search properly<br />
/shrug<br />
<br />
The search feature doesn't allow search of just two characters either.. such as 64. I did look around a bit before posting, but there is a host of information here which is a GREAT thing it means there is an active community, it also means extractign that information within reasonable tiem frames can be a struggle. <br />
<br />
I also prefer to ask questions a good bit sometimes I  personally find you learn more through your own dialogue than reading an old post which may be dated, and may or may not be relevant to your situation. But hey thats just me.<br />
<br />
That having been said thanks all for the information I am going to check into a few of the spots mentioned.<br />
<br />
 I am a huge fan of the PoV experience, while nto being so fond of the palyer population there. Same with BoT it has become the high end answer to South Karana, Lower Guk, The &quot;Giant Fort&quot;, Karnors, and every other zone that is demed the &quot;place to be&quot; by every arse in the game. That having been said I don't mind a few arses if the experience I gain is coming at a decent clip.<br />
<br />
Thanks you lot, I do appreciatethe help.</div></div><hr />
