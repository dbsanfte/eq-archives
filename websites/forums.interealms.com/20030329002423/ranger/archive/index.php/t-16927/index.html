<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>OntargetPovar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have hit LVL 32 now and was wondering if anyone know of a place where I could make some good plat.  I just moved to Povar, so this is my main char.  I know there are places for higher lvl chars to make plat but are there any for my lvl.  Thanks for the help.</div></div><hr />

I am level 44, about 1000hp, 800 AC and ATK unbuffed with PAoVB in main and CLS in off and a Stinger bow.<br />
<br />
When I go to CC, I get my butt handed to me by the multiple adds that ALWAYS join my pulls.  Even with my lvl 46 druid partner, we have serious problems.<br />

Anyone care to comment?  Is it just style?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bindamel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have yet to see 100 pp/hour in EF.  I play mostly U.S. prime time, so there's a lot of competition.  If there's an average of 1 tusk per mammoth, I have to kill one every 6 minutes to make 100 plat per hour.  I haven't been that fortunate on spawn or drop rate to do that.  On the other hand, my RL brother has done them during off hours, and has gotten close to that.<br />
<br />
You can do the highland kobold camp in Stonebrunt for 100 pp/hour if you get KEI.  You'll still do decently well without it, but you'll have downtime.<br />
<br />
You can do bandits in WK, as well.  They probably are the best plat for their level when you add in the sash quest in Qeynos with Chesgard (?).<br />
<br />
Never been there, but Aquagobbies are easy cash in Butcherblock, but my understanding is that they are permacamped as well.  I always look when I'm there, so I can &quot;loot parse&quot; it, but it's always been camped, and never by anyone of an appropriate level.<br />
<br />
Another no fuss option is the warrens back door (i.e. Stonebrunt side).  At 32 you should be able to kill non-stop and just sell the junk.  Not as profitable, I would guess, but very easy.<br />
<br />
If you're willing to do the bazaar trader thing, and patient, then spiderling silks, spider silks, pelts, and just about everything you forage is sellable in the bazaar.  You can get 10 pp for a morning dew on a lot of servers.<br />
<br />
If you want xp too, fear kiting in Stonebrunt leads to the Wak quest, which sells for 200 pp regularly on EMarr in the bazaar.  You'll get the occasional jewlery and gems, as well, and pelts.<br />
<br />
Your probably just getting to the levels where you can hunt heretic invaders in Stonebrunt.  Four heads yields a Swiftclaw Sash (rare, worth 1-2k), or a Kejekan tribal headband (70 pp in bazaar).  They spawn once a game day, though, so it takes a while.<br />

There are some guides in the New guides section you may want to check out as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gaeathorn, where are you pulling in CC? <br />
<br />
I have played there on and off for 15 levels. I find soloing best in the cave that runs from the well to the coldain town. Just follow it and pick off the straggler orc miners and casters. Also learn to use root. Snare first. If an add comes, you can root the first, then take off down the tunnel. The other will follow and you can clean his clock before the other shows up.<br />
<br />
Also referred to as &quot;ghetto mez.&quot; As soloists, rooting comes in handy with adds, and it is something we can contribute to a group as well.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaeathorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I have always done the spiders and the terrors.  You pull one, you get 3-4 or more, depending.<br />
<br />
Me personally, trying to root 2-4 terrors while they are all beating on you... it hurts! lol<br />
<br />
Anyway, I have been doing the root and shoot for many levels and do the &quot;ghetto mez&quot; regularly... both solo and in grps.<br />
<br />
I guess I will keep working on it. )<br />
<br />
Thanks for the response.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Habermas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you are looking for money, try the orcs rather than spideys. Less experience, perhaps, but a lot more cash.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaelyn DiMathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I agree with the orcs for cash.  Should be able to pull in a nice haul in a good night of hunting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>nekoken</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">In CC, sneak-pull is your friend.  I leveled my rogue up sneak-pulling orcs, then stalag terrors one at a time.  I never had a single over-pull doing this.  Made good money too.  This was untwinked at level 39-40 if I remember right.  I know I did more than a full level there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ok, Mammoths in EF are great at 32, but there may be a lot of competition for them, 100pp an hour is easy from them once you learn the ropes and you will get exp until about 35.<br />
<br />
CC is great, but I seriously wouldnt go there at 32, especially solo. Wait until 34 or 35. If you get a friend to help then do Orcs, if you find a group then get geonids. You will get exp in CC until about 51 or 52 (I still get exp at 50). But again, this is a heavily camped zone.<br />
<br />
My suggestions, that I have discovered recently are:<br />
Foraging, go to Gfay and help newbies, forage and farm spiders silk all at the same time....no exp for you though.<br />
or<br />
Get a friend or two and kill the funny looking guys at the southern zone of Dawnshroud peaks. These can drop Acrylia and that stuff sells very nicely. You will get exp here as well.</div></div><hr />
