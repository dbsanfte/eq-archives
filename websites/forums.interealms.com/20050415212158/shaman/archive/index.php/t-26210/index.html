<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The main problem I see is for all of you that pay for the new expansion when it comes. After an expansion is so old does anyone think SOE offer it at a much reduced price? Or, even free. I would like to come back to EQ.. miss it a bit some of my friends still play, but SOE puts out so many expansions I'm around 4 behind I think maybe 3. The only way to get them cheaper is watch the clearance rack at target.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">or order them online for $9.99 from sony, as I did for GoD 3 weeks ago</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Link to help (https://store.station.sony.com/game_index.jsp?gamecode=EQ)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the old expansions get bundled with basic EQ as soon as the next big release is out.  Only the most recent expansion costs any additional $ from the starter box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">omg I want to buy the everquest lighter!. Seriously though I wonder if they would be collectable in like years to come.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought this would be about helping players already in the game that are several expansions behind.  :)  When I retired I had barely broken into the Elemental planes, and had less than 100 AA.  Will SoE bump me to 350AA, fully Time flagged (with items), and fully GoD flagged (with items) to get me back?</div></div><hr />
