<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone knew of a site that listed the average, sustainable DPS of the different classes? I know this wouldn't be 100% accurate due to gear differences, but it would help me in picking a partner for some longer fights.  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Watch it - someone will send you to the graph paper of that crazy bard with no clue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Class dps is not that easy to measure. There is of course that little jackass bard who amde the graph.<br />
Many classes have items to improve dmg or add dmg. Jbb comes to mind. Then there is the luck of wether spells get resisted or hits are missed. Not an easy job to average somethign liek that. Don't think anyone has ever truly done anything liek that.<br />
<br />
As for Hypothetical-no-shaman-has-ever-done-this-dps. I am sure thott's graphs are quite accurate.<br />
<br />
He forgets that shamans smoke weed and eat mushrooms. We may be a lil twisted but we don't do crack. We don't stack 8 poison dots on one target and live to tell the story. In fact by the time we are castign our 3rd dot we will be beyond the help of the best SK taunter. But hey thott knows better he is the leader of a respectable guild and has played the game for a while he HAS to be right.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aye, was thinking about mage or BL... would mage DPS be bettr than BST pre slows and mana / hp regen? And would either one be any better than an SK tank for taking down big mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My experience was with an sk and with a rogue friend.<br />
<br />
I have to say i liked both but since the rogue was more ubah ut went easier.<br />
I pulled with slow then crippled then poison dot. Had aggro 80% of the fight whiel rogue was stabbing. If i lost aggro (it started to happen as levels went on) i reaplied poison to remind the mob that it has to hate ME :)<br />
<br />
With the sk it's also quite nice. I am scared to try mage cause of zero crowd control on their side. Roge does not have much but they can evade and they can take hits better than a robe class.<br />
<br />
I wanna try a necro partner my friend is too high and was doing all the work when grped. I need to find a encro my level :P<br />

<br />
Personally I think the most powerful Duo in the game is Necro/Shaman (or Necro/Cleric if fighting undead)<br />
<br />
<br />
When you talk about soloing high end mobs there are only 3 classes that really come up (other than charm soloing)<br />
<br />
Necro, Shaman, Bard.<br />
<br />
Bards soloing methods dont work well duoed (mostly) ...<br />
<br />
But...<br />
<br />
Necros main lacking skill is slowing.(non undead mobs)<br />
<br />
Shaman's main lacking skill is DPS.<br />
<br />
A necro/shaman duo could solo things no other duo could.<br />

I had to reply to this.  I 2 box with my 56 Shaman and 62 Paladin.  Let me tell you a palidin is great to have as a tank.  Sure his damage output doesnt come close to some of the other tank classes, but he holds his own.  More importantly he can hold the agro on pretty much any mob while I have my shaman sitting back casting debuffs and dots on the mob.  In my oppinion I would rather have a tank that can keep the mob on him while I do the majority of the damage.  Another bonus to 2 boxing with a pally is he can heal me at the end of a fight after I canni my hps down, so I dont have to waste mana healing myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ranger : good dps ,good enough tank with slow ,snare ,best puller outdoor.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Enchanter with CoD.  260-290 dps with PoP mobs.  More than most 6 person groups can dish out.  <br />
<br />
No 3 melee classes in average gear can match that.<br />
At least not the ones that are not raiding elemental planes every night.<br />
<br />
Mages would be next.  They outdamage any 2 melee classes in average gear.   They are the kings of trials groups imho.  <br />
<br />
Necro's are probably good but their damage is not easily quantified with parsing prog's etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Yay game balance. So far the only thing they have done about this was nerf affliction focus.. Well among other things that reduced shaman power a decent amount, but I wonder about the risk vs reward equation with CoD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">With pop, no melee is worth it to duo with.I duo Tactics Pit mobs with SKs and Paladins fairly often without much trouble, and I'm only 62, thus I'm stuck with Kraggs/tnargs and no Quiesence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">At 65 duoing with a Paladin is awesome.  Pally buffs all stack with shaman buffs, so I'm running at around 5k HPs, and the pally at 7.5k.  Plus they can heal themselves for the most part on a slowed mob hitting for 500s, leaving much mana for me to stack all my DoTs, for some very nice DPS.  (Make sure you pay/bum a KEI before fighting though, the pally needs to be able to get his mana back).<br />
<br />
The bottom line is Shamans are great partners for nearly every class.  I admit in PoP with mobs hitting for 500s its more difficult to duo with the PURE melee classes, but with our versatility you can make almost any duo work.<br />
<br />
Duoing with charming enchanters is best, but only because charming enchanters are so completely out of wack.  Solo they get more xp than duoing with us anyway (although we can help reduce the number of deaths), so if you have a chanter that you can duo with, do it.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I'm 65, not 60...one of these days I'll get around to changing that Sig.</div></div><hr />
