<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kabuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know where Bowlord Rorn spawns in Ruined City Of dranik?<br />
<br />
From sifting thru Allak, I found a post on another mob in the city that talked about the Bowlord and and the Item below dropping off him.  However there's nothing on him as of yet on Allak, or even this item.  But these stats came from Lucy.  <br />
<br />
If anyone can provide information it would be great.  Thanks in advance.<br />

Pulls weren't that long so I imagine he spawned in one of the rooms nearby, there was another name we pulled a few times as well.</div></div><hr />
