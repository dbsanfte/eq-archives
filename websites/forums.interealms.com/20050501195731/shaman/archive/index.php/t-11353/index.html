<br />
Has anyone tried frog shammies? Im making a shaman as my new character and was wondering how life as a frog seemed to be. Not too bothered about starting stats but am interested in newbie quests Any newbie quests implemented and such? <br />
<br />
On a similar vein, how does LoY seem? Even tho its not a lot of money, with VI's track record im very undecided whether to give them more of my money for yet another poorly churned out expansion.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any &amp; all replies:)</div></div><hr />
