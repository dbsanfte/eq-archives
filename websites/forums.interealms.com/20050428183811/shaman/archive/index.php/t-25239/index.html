<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Not sure how many of you are familar with the 'unique' band Oingo Boing.  You've probably heard lead vocalist Danny Elfman's musical scores to movies like Men in Black, Sleepy Hollow, and Spiderman and TV shows like The Simpsons, the animated Batman, and Tales from the Crypt.  I sound like Troy McClue there.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I started an undead warrior and one of the quests sends you down to a wagon and tent with the follow four NPC's.  Doing this from memory so the spelling might be off.<br />
<br />
Daniel Ulfman - Danny Elfman  (leader, songwriter, lead singer, rhythm guitar, co-arranger)<br />
Steven Bharteck - Steve Bartek  (lead guitar, co-arranger)<br />
Samuel Fipps - Sam &quot;Sluggo&quot; Phipps (horns)<br />
K-something Grayves - I *think* the fourth npc is a reference to early band member Carl Graves.<br />
<br />
If you stand next to Daniel for a while he'll say:<br />
<br />
&quot;Where are the rest of the guys?&quot;  -- Oingo Boingo has performed with as many as 20 people.<br />
<br />
&quot;Every bodies is coming...&quot;  --  From the song Dead Man's Party.<br />
<br />
&quot;He didn't mean to do it...&quot;  -- From the song Only a Lad.<br />
<br />
Boingo broke up a few years back but I really enjoyed running across this small tribute from the WoW design team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hah, all I;ve heard from them is Wierd Science.  Funny song.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I can't believe you didn't mention Nightmare Before Christmas.  But yeah, OB was a great band and Elfman is a humongous talent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I liked Oingo Boingo (not a super fan, but I have 2 albums!  :p ).  One song I saw them perform live was a remake of the Beach Boys &quot;California Girls&quot; and remains one of the most hypnotically intriguing songs I've heard performed.  They never officially recorded the song (I'll bet they never had permission to perform it in the first place  :eek: ) so it's a tough song to find.  Has anyone here ever seen a copy of this floating around?  I won't even try to ask for a &quot;legal&quot; copy since the song probably isn't legal anyway.  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">After completing the 4th blacksmithing quest from Omosh Something in Orgrimmar, he gets all weepy and stuff for being so happy you've made him all this gear and will continue his legacy.  He then gives you a quest to learn his dance.  So, being an orc, he dances in the MC Hammer style, and at the end he says something to the effect of &quot;Stop!  Omosh time!&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>drib</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Especially in the Undercity there are a lot of references to dead people or things related to death.  One of the bankers is Ophelia Montague, which is a mix of two Shakespeare characters.  Ophelia is from Hamlet, who commits suicide by drowning herself and Montague is the head of Romeo's family in Romeo and Juliet. Romeo Montague committed suicide by drinking poison.  I haven't walked around there much, but there are probably way more things like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sumitso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually check the bankers names again they have a striking similarity to the main characters in trading places ;o)</div></div><hr />

They played his dorm party in Back to School .</div></div><hr />

He also did the music for the Batman movie, and Pee-Wee's Big Adventure.  Don't forget Beetlejuice!  In fact, he almost always does the music for the films of one of my fav directors Tim Burton.<br />
<br />
Edit - Forgot to say: Good find!</div></div><hr />

:)  I have volume 1 &amp; 2 of Music for a Darkened Theater sitting on my shelf.  I could have listed a LOT more  -- the sake of brevity and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At the Wizard's Tower in the Mage District of Stormwind, there is a group of mages at the bottom talking about some experiments.  One of which concerns a Portal.  At one point one of the mages says, &quot;I thought you said crossing the streams was a bad thing.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok, it's not an Oingo Boingo easter egg, but it is an easter egg none the less.  :)  (Ghostbusters)</div></div><hr />
