<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ryko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I gave Perrir (sp?) the four woven necklaces and he tells me I have yet to prove myself.  I've got amibly faction with him..  What am I missing here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just do something else to raise faction: either deliver the note again (you can get it in the Freeport underground if you don't want to run back to Grobb), do the woven necklaces quest again, or collect Halfling Raider Helms. I don't believe he'll give you the quest until your faction is good enough to receive the Initiate Symbol, so you might just want to talk to him before turning in any more woven necklaces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ryko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, I'll try that again.  Thanks<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, where do the Leatherfoot Raiders spawn?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">They changed Nektulos Forest recently, so I'm not certain, but I think they have all been moved to the Halfling pedestal immediately south of the river, on the western edge of the forest. Be careful as there are now more than half a dozen Halflings there, with healers and nukers, plus the wandering Leatherfoot Deputy / Medic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had to hand in around 10 leatherfoot raider caps in order to get enough faction to get my necklaces. I followed this path:<br />
<br />
- Grobb note to Perrin quest<br />
- Turn in leatherfoot caps to Perrin (x10+)<br />
- turn in necklaces for initiate necklace<br />
- do halfing mask quest from N'Ryt<br />
- get disciple quest from Ithvol<br />
<br />
I plan on getting regent necklace at 24 when I get a more powerful DoT.</div></div><hr />
