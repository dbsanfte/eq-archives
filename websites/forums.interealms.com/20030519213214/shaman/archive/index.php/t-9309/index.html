<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I am a fool. I thought the effect Carnage on the 8th Cudgel was group primal essence.<br />
<br />
I'm a bit disappointed to find out it's a mini avatar, happily without an emerald cost, but with only a 6 minute duration. Six minutes! Who has the time to click that every 6 minutes?<br />
<br />
What I want to know is, those of you who got the 8th cudgel - and I just completed my 6th when I found this out, I lack the bones from VSR and the skulls from HS to complete it - was it worth the time and the effort to you?<br />
<br />
Also, how do you use the effect? My guild tends to take a long time buffing, which annoys me greatly - things like celerity etc run out before the order is given to move in. Clicking carnage over and over just sounds aggrivating. Plus with all the buffs and the fact we are always running out of buff slots, how useful is carnage in a raid situation?<br />
<br />
What I want to know is, how do you use it without driving yourself crazy, and was it it worth it to you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I love the item.  The stats are good, and on Druzzil Ro its rare enough to still attract attention when people note you have it.<br />
<br />
I do use the effect from time to time.  The duration sucks, but its free, so all it takes is time.  Its not a raid buff, imo.  But I do use it in xp groups.  Mage pets (heck, any pet) with a proccing weapon love Carnage.  I always keep it up factioning in Droga, and often use it on my pet in normal groups so that I can clock Carnage to the wear-off message from my pet.  As for players, I'll usually tag the group's MT with it, or some other damage dealer like a rogue if the MT has Primal/Prismatic.  Its not something that I am necessarily dedicated to keeping up ALL the time, but if I've gotten the mob slowed and have enough mana ... I'll click the cudgel.<br />
<br />
Besides, the quest is an achievement and a matter of pride.  Even without the effect, I'd be glad that I have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What's it stack with? Anything?<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'll click some of the mele on a raid with it right before we attack whatever we are going after, otherwise I don't really make it known on raids that I have it :) <br />
<br />
<br />
in exp groups as long as its 3 or less people i'll try and keep it on them.  Doesnt stack with avatar, PE, or some ranger self buff I believe. Otherwise it stacks with most everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I usually wait until just before we charge and hit a couple rogues or monks on raids.  In exp groups I have a warrior friend who begs for it all the time, so I try to keep it up on him, but otherwise I don't bother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It will stack with most anything.  Or so I hear, still waiting on my guild to help me do the final fight &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssabre Spiritscale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh,<br />
<br />
I have the second cudgel. . .I dread starting this in earnest!<br />
<br />
;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bones from VS fell into my lap last night.<br />
<br />
Wizzie in my group says, Gotta run, VS just popped and I've been waiting 2 years for my epic.<br />
<br />
To make a long story short, he needed a shaman, so I went and got my bones.<br />
<br />
Just need the bits from HS now.<br />
<br />
I guess whether I like it or not, I'm stuck with this damn quest and it's stuck with me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Carnage stacks with most everything except Avatar, VoB, PE, and a couple other classes +attk buffs.<br />
<br />
The only real uses I have found for Carnage is to tag ranjahs with before a big fight to get them procin' their bows and to buff pets with.  I constantly dump it on pets because it is free and it makes me happy.  If it did not overwrite PE, I would prolly use it on players more.<br />
<br />
The quest is very well done and worth doing IMO.  The storyline is a bit goofy in spots, but it gets better from cudgels 6 to 8.  Anything after Kurn's is a joy. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SneakyB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I sure wish I had the 8th Cudgel....* /em looks at Shabura*<br />
:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd gladly go through the damn quest to have the weapon without a clicky.  The stats are very nice IMO.. too bad they let you soft skins wield such a weapon as this! ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sssythe Malosepsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The cast time on the cudgel click is looooooooong.  Like krak mentioned I try to conceal that I have it :)  I dont mind clicking a mt in an exp group or raid, but clicking 4 melee with it in an exp group is maddening enough, much less trying to do it for a raid<br />
.  You could get 20 people clicked before you would have to start again :)<br />
<br />
I do wish the effect on this was a little bit longer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What is the cast time?<br />
<br />
Lucy lists it as 0 (instant).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Purtyoogly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">it is a formidable range item.<br />
<br />
the cast time is 15 seconds.<br />
<br />
carnage is not bad but somtimes cumbersome to cast in groups.<br />
on raids i use a ceramic skull of decay these days so its a pain to switch around if someone wants carnage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Skab Wumpuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Pfft Gorm, your just jealous!:D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The effect is awesome imo.  Give my pet some velium weapons mage mask and haste and watch him go.  :)   <br />
Is very nice to have hotkeyed so i dont need to have avatar memmed if i need a slot, i can just click the range hotkey, no memming any spells and waiting 3 min.  :)<br />
i wanted it for so long because it was like a racial(iksar) epic for the shammies, sk have the sword, etc., but now that anyone can do it takes the uniqueness out of it.</div></div><hr />
