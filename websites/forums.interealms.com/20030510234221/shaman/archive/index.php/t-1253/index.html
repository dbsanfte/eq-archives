<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm about a yellow into 45 and bored out of my mind hehe. <br />
So wondering on ideas of where to hunt? Preferably in a group as soloing is getting a bit dull now. <br />
<br />
I heard Sol B was a good place for my level but I'm on a PvP server and it's full of lighties so that restricts my access to the zone. So I also have problems with places like Dreadlands and Velious unless I want to pk my way out as well as attempt to gain exp. <br />
<br />
So any other ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smylee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hate to show my ignorance, but if you can't go to solb, where can you go? I found lguk was great mid 40's, if you can get a group. HEAPS of things to kill, only thing that is usually camped is lord/am/hand and frenzy. But wow, there are SO many other things to kill. If lguk is a darkie zone, then try it. it's hard at first, and make up/buy a coupla 10 charge invis to undead potions, and always keep root loaded. <br />
<br />
Aside from that, how bout KC? 45 might be acceptable, but then it's prolly the same thing again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hemmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You might try Eastern Wastes, I think some of the Ulthorks there are light blue to a level 50, so they should be in your range.  The Giants in GD might also be decent xp if you are on Dwarf or Dragon faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As PvP enviroment makes it bit hard as I do not know what zones are controlled by what side.  Though I would think the suggestion for Guk being valid as that from my understanding is in dark territorry.  Another place you might try is over at the FEAR portal.  Not positive but pretty sure the Specs there should be nice and blue to you.  There is also a nice little lady sitting on the portal steps that was blue to my 55 wizzy.  Though buff those resists as she is a caster.  Dont think there would be many groups in this area though might be some cleric there interested in grouping.  Might try timborous deep too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Halycona</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I ended up dinging 46 with a combo of lguk, TD and careful soloing in sol b. <br />
Sadly Velious is an even worse light controlled area on TZ so I'm avoidng there for the most part unless I have a group. <br />
<br />
I think I'll probably stick to sol b and TD for the next few levels, lguk is too confusing to stick around in for long.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the advice :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On Vallon Zek, Rathe Mountains is pretty much Darkie Territory. You can get good experience and great loot by capping Hill Giants for  days and days...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I might be misremembering the level, but I thought that around that level I did a little soloing in EJ, near the trak zoneline.  Almost every time I go to CoM it's utterly empty (okay, non- primetime, I'll admit) and the entrance stuff was all going lt blue and green by 50, if I remember right...<br />
<br />
Other vague thoughts - what level are the yeti caves in DL?<br />
<br />
Couple of nice camps in FV way out northeast away from town (where they'll obviously kill ya) with some giants and drolvargs.  Again, stumbled on em when they'd all gone lt. blue and was wishing I'd seen em there earlier.<br />
<br />
ToFS - 3rd floor.  Was pretty nice partnering up there thru 45, so it should be a decent solo spot after that.  Good exp bonus, end up with a nice amount of cash.  And if you have sow booties, zoning out in an emergency isn't a frying-pan-to-fire kind of situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rulaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ew is a great hunting place for the 45+ levels<br />
<br />
there is a spot of Man-o-war and walrus in the southwest of the zone this mobs should be blue to you and its never camped (on Vallon Zek). <br />
<br />
another good spot is the City of mist. Clear the entrance and go throug the gate at the right side, the mobs here are blue till 53, 54 and you can single pull and get no roamers when u hunt them near the water. You can park your pet here and its easy exp and very fine loot (got 2 wus trance sticks there).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Konnen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You might want to give Scarlet Desert a shot.  Quite a few of the mobs in that zone are dark blue to level 53, and there are some yellow and reds over by the plateau, if you feel frisky.<br />
<br />
When you are done with that zone, try out the Grey.  I have been there a couple times and it's pretty nasty but it's doable. ;)</div></div><hr />
