<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aiyrra Verin'sarol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some of you encouraged me to post here so here goes... I've been working on my ragebringer for awhile and am at the point where I need to get my Cazic Quill.<br />
<br />
I either need the Quill itself or a Shiny Metallic Robe and a Kedge Robe.<br />
<br />
Please let me know if you have these maybe we can work out a trade of some sort...<br />
Goods, Plat, Time, My Body... I'm JOKING!<br />
<br />
Well maybe :P<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drolgin Steingrinder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For the Kedge robe, I would suggest that you make friends with some wizards, mages and bards who are working on their epics. Phinigel (or &quot;Ole Fishface&quot; as he is known to many of us) drops several needed quest items, and is killed fairly often - to the extent that some people have tracking gimps parked out in Kedge. Try talking to these people and having them contact you when he pops or when a raid is scheduled.</div></div><hr />
