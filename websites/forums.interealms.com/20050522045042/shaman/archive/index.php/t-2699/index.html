<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally completed my epic monday night, and went out to try it out.. and realized.. hey.. I havnt solod a damn thing since I was 51st heh.<br />
<br />
Im a tad rusty needless to say. <br />
<br />
What Im looking for is some info on where, and tactics for soloing at 58(now) and 59(soon). I have Epic(as of monday.. yay!) and jbb and a horsey. My other(somewhat mediocre) gear is in my magelo(linked at the bottom).<br />
<br />
Any good info/suggestions would be great.<br />
<br />
PS:Have bane of nife, dont have pox(for when I hit 59) if this info is helpful in what I can/cant/should/shouldnt try to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WM231NIKE</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like to solo in Velks, and I can find a group there whenever I want.  Alsoi heard ME is good, and just tried Ahkeva entrance earlier today.<br />
<br />
I pull with slow, when the mob is on it's way to me, I sick pet with taunt on.  It gains agro and I epic, I have pet tank here since it is tough to channel epic.  Then I JBB the mob to death with pet on it's back.<br />
<br />
As far as buffs go, I try to get a Clarity, and I just haste pet, and regen me and pet.  Almost nonstop kills if you can find enough mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Solo spots.  Maiden's Eye, DSP side, goragas.  The Grey if you have some type of permanent EB item.  Sebilis zone out, upper one, not the shroom one.<br />
<br />
Also, imo, get yourself an Ivory Imbued Collar, JB Vambraces, and a JB Helm.  If your going to solo, especially in SoV or Luclin where the hps on the mobs are higher than Kunark for the most part, your going to need your AC over 900.  The closer it is to 900 unbuffed, the better off you are.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One spot I was used to solo at that level was kc basement down well off lcy.  If you go left, there's a 4 spawn room that with a little skill u can manage to single pull one by one.<br />
<br />
When Luclin first came out, I soloed a week in fungus grove.  At 60, everything was still light blue/blue, and could single pull those goranga thingies and those beetles pretty easily.  The Grey is nice too if you have an eb item and know where to hunt to avoid adds.  <br />
<br />
Might wanna give othmirs (cs) and sentient armour (wl) a shot too.  Phase Spiders in Dragon Necropolis are feasible but sometimes their phases warp you to the wrong place, you get adds, and bleh, LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
One place I havent tried too much but I heard that was pretty good is chardok.  In old world, there's Hole by zone in and kedge with eb item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Sentient armour have too many HP (for their level) to be worth soloing - I could solo them at 54 but the xp was never great. Hunted them in a group quite a lot for the drops.<br />
<br />
I also don't like ME much - whenever I am there I seem to get trained, maybe if you move away from the zoneline a bit it would be better.<br />
<br />
The Grey is good - I haven't soloed here yet, but with my regular group we've been doing nicely there. Casting EB every 30 mins isn't too bad, as long as you keep a timer and refresh it while you're not fighting! Personally I avoid the front of the temple during peak play hours, as uber people are always running to Ssra without caring that they train people on the way.<br />
<br />
Another place I like to solo is Skyfire - at 55 everything is still blue to me, not sure how you'll do at 58. Kill mature wurms and wyverns, nice spell drops, plus rare high value trade skill items. Avoid the chromodracs though!<br />
<br />
All these places are outside too, so you can use your horsey.<br />
<br />
As far as tactics go ... I don't do anything fancy. Pull with slow, send in the pet, cast epic (I don't seem to have a problem channelling it with the mob slowed, but if the pet distracts the mob even better). For tough mobs I add in a Plague and maybe an EBolt, then poke them with my spear till they fall over.<br />
<br />
If you have a horse, consider not poking, as that negates the med benefit, I haven't quite decided for myself which is the best choice here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sent suits are indeed slow.  But can drop quest gems.  You can also single pull them, slow them and fight in a relatively safe area against the wall.  They seldom resist JBB or Epic.  Though totally DR and PR.<br />
IMO; a very nice place to get used to soloing again before moving on to ME and the Grey etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe better gear than me for sure, i need to work on mine at 60 :)<br />
<br />
Yeah just pull with slow, sic pet and drop epic on them, then jab them with JBB if suitable. I generally can channel epic ok. I use BoN if i have C3 otherwise I burn too much mana with the slow and constant killing.<br />
<br />
Suits are bad xp and go light blue at 59 :( Velks is my fav at the moment, one blue per hour there in 59)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">That's true about the suits - I forgot that last time I tried soloing them I didn't have my epic. That's why it was so hard :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I live in Chardok for xp typically, but FG is also a cake walk for xp.  With pets not aggroing anything anymore it's even better soloing nowadays, although still boring as hell IMO.  <br />
<br />
Fungus Grove:<br />
Find an unclaimed patch.  If you havent screwed up your bug faction there, then back in the back near the Twilight portal is a good area that I find open quite often.  Park yer mutt, pull with slow from max distance and hopefully get 2 or less shrooms.  Typically they spend the majority of the fight trying to cast on me which is fairly easy to resist with Epuration up.  (NOTE: buff DR ;))  Epic Dot, Bane, and Bracer them to death while mutt chews on their backside.  It's so simple and easy as to be ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Chardok Zone Out:<br />
Typically not camped since there aren't enough mobs to support a whole group in the tunnel, but an easy solo spot for a shaman.  Should all be dark blue still at 58, some will go light blue at 59/60.  I typically invis and run up to the top of the ramp, you should be on a crest with 2 spawns behind you and 2 more just ahead of you.  Pull the nearest mob behind you with slow.  at 58 the other one shouldn't aggro and the 2 ahead of you (closer to the zone out) will still be out of aggro range.<br />
<br />
Tactic here is to root the mob and slap epic dot on to whittle it down while you summon yer pet, buff it with regrow and haste.  Sick DogDog and cast a bane, then follow up with JBBs until root breaks.  Rinse and Repeat clearing your way to the zone out, then park pet there and pull at will.  Super easy.  Let the mutt tank since your ac is kinda low, just keep the mobs rooted and stand out of range while you JBB.  With Epic, Bane, and JBB nukes the mobs should drop fairly fast and after slowing your pet can tank these pretty easily.  Regrowth plus naturally fast regen on pets will get him close to full just standing around in between pulls.  Hell, with JBB you might be able to skip the Bane and use next to no mana other than reapplying root and a heal here and there. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Padraic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Before I got my epic, I solo'd some at 54 and 55 in the Grey.  I usually stuck with golems.  They aren't very resistant, and aren't hard to kill.  I stayed away from the Shissar.  They are as bad as the Sentient Suits in Wakening lands as far as poison and disease goes.  With an epic and/or jbb they probably wouldnt be to bad though.  The rock guys have way to many hp's to really want to xp grind on, although I got one down to 40% health once when I wasn't prepared to fight him (started with 50 mana and 70 health).  Never bothered with the skeletons.  Some were already light blue at 55.<br />
<br />
Maiden's eye - toilers are pretty easy at 56, especially with epic.  Not terrible experience I guess.  I havent tried solo'ing the Gorangas, but I think they are doable.  Some are fairly high level, and kind of resistant.  My only advice - If you fightin ME, solo or grouped, never, ever right at the zoneline.  This place actually has more trains than Karnor's, and that's saying something.<br />
<br />
The plateau in Scarlet Desert is good xp at 56.  The Revenants are still blue to the 58 shaman I partner with sometimes.  We went up there camping the burning priest several times, and pulled all we could while waiting on his spawn (I think all reavers spawns are about 30 minutes)<br />
<br />
Skyfire - there are light blue mobs to a 56, quite common on the side of the zone near the druid port in.  Opposite side is pretty much all blue.  Some of the mobs are alot easier than others.  I aggree with a previous poster.  Stay away from the Chromadrakes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Graal the Dorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Akheva zone in is pretty nice. ME toiler hill is nice xp as well. The Grey is good if you have a partner, otherwise they are too PR/DR.<br />
<br />
Chardok is very nice. Low resists, low hp, and fast enough respawn to keep you going for a long time.<br />
<br />
HS can be good too. The mobs there have such low AC and hp that your pet will eat them up if they are debuffed properly. Slow and cripple on the mobs, and regen and pet buff on your pet = xp. You will take a few HTs though, so beware.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Alot of great info, thanks!<br />
<br />
Another spot I have found is good are the Tro Jeg guys on the scarlet desert plateau. Really have to go without dogdog and just root/rot em though.. they proc a *nasty* dd proc.. even buffing fire resist I rarely resist. The PP isnt bad though, and was getting 1bish an hour or so. Usually pull with malosini, plague, epic jbb jbb jbb jbb jbb re-epic then go get another while the first one dies.. can pretty much keep going non stop.<br />
<br />
Regarding my neck: I do have an ivory imbued collar, but really I figured the 65 hps would do me more good then 8 ac.. non?  I certainly dont need the wisdom from it.. have more then I like at the moment heh.<br />
<br />
Regarding hat: really the jb is like 2ac more then the shissar headband when you figure in its 15agi.. plus its got 25hps =)<br />
<br />
Arms: yeah.. I do have jb arms but really just wear em solo.. forgot to mention that and they arent in the profile.</div></div><hr />

I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but it seems like there's at least one or two responses to every post out here that basically say &quot;Ya lazy n00b, the answer is here, and here and here and here.  If you weren't such a stupid, lazy n00b you might have found it for yourself...&quot;.</div></div><hr />
