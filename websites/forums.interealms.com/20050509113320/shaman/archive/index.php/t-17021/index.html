<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Long ago, maybe three and a half years ago...but it could have been a little less. I started my baby troll shaman. I was wandering around on the outskirts of froggy island and was trying to figure out a way to nail just one of those white con Frogs and actually win the fight. This was in the days where having a tarnished 1H peircer that I had sharpened myself was ooooo-bur! Heh. Anyways, there I was sitting and thinking about the pull when up runs this troll. Blart by name and newly founded of a PK guild called Flowers of Happiness. He sat down beside me and started talking to someone in the zone. In the conversation he mentioned a PK situation and how he had put dogdog on them, and bla bla bla about Pking someone. I<br />
 : pets dogdogs furry head<br />
Blart was amused by the fact that I knew his pets name and buffed me to high hell, then followed me around healing my for an hour.<br />
I got to 8th lvl that day.<br />
Anyways, the question is, do any of you know who started calling our pet dogdog? Could it have been famed Blart?<br />
I wonder.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yep, he's the one, there may be other origins, but theyre pretty close to dead wrong.  He also had some amusing stories of his and dogdog's exploits posted on the FoH site.<br />
<br />
Also, i believe blart later went on to make Fansy, the famous good team bard, he was a member of SZ FoH iirc.  I was a low lvl good ranger on SZ when Fansy came on the scene, he was uber, had the biggest effect on SZ ever, heck, they had to change the rules of the server drastically to stop him from keeling all the evils.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grackal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hehe I remember Fansy. The sand giant stories...super funny.<br />
<br />
My favorite quotes from Fansy...<br />
<br />
'SIR THIS IS MY PROFESSION, I DON'T JUDGE YOUR PUMA KILLING SKILLS'<br />
<br />
and<br />
<br />
Fansy: 'Is the zone clear of evils today?'<br />
some other guy: 'yes, no evils here, all is well'<br />
another guy: 'everyone is good, now go away'<br />
<br />
and so on and so on....<br />
<br />
heheh<br />
<br />
Luv to the Blart/Fansy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">While I agree that Blart probably introduced dogdog as the &quot;official&quot; title of our pet, I think people just call their dogs dogdog.  Some guy in a dominos commerical thats running right now even does it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Blart is a rogue named Fonso on SZ.  Well he could be fansy ans his brother is Fonso, I'm not sure.  They're both funnier than hell.   Fansy doesnt play a whole lot atm, but I talk to Fonso a lot, I'll ask him if he or Fansy is Blart.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gaafgarion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I've always found the term &quot;dogdog&quot; for our pets excruciatingly annoying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's good for people that lack the imagination to think up a real name for their pet.</div></div><hr />
