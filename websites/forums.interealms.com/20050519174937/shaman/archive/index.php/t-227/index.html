<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Monscrot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey now I currently own a glowing wooden crook.<br />
I am lvl 21 just wondering if this is a good enough weapon for me to stick with for a while or start to update my armour which is all banded exept 2-3 peices....<br />
just wonderin....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That's a decent weapon for that level. I would focus on armor, now. You can just about start doing some of the totemic quests while grouped with friends. If you happen to see a Drakkel Icegrinder, a Howling Harpoon, or a Spine Chill Spear, you might decide to buy it.<br />

Argoth of Drinal</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yep - <br />
for the untwinked shaman, that is/was a darn good weapon at your level.<br />
only real negative is that it is 2hb, and high end wepons for shaman do not favor 2hb.  There are good ones, but not good enough to put down an epic/water sprinkler and a shield.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Head over to Luclin.  Go to Netherbian's Lair, its an awesome xp zone at your level and you can get a few nice items from there.<br />

The weapons are EXTREMELY common, and because they are LORE you could easily get one.   Legs drop off The Trog King, a semi-rare named, but common enough you could get him with a full group (he's level 28 or so).  You could level to 29 there very fast.  And the mobs there drop a ton of coin, usually 3-5pp each.<br />
<br />
For melee friends The Swarmleader (another semi-rare named) drops this:<br />
<br />
Netherbian Chitin<br />

Looks like warrior planar armor (the tan colored armor)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice cheap one handed weapons:<br />
<br />
Blunt:  <br />
Wraithbone hammer (8/28, +wis) - 100 pp or so<br />
Smoldering brand (9 dmg, 22 dly, 14 dmg proc) - couple hundred pp<br />
<br />
Pierce:<br />
Slime covered harpoon (10 dmg, 25 dly, +5 wis, +10 mana) - couple hundred plat - and rangeable for when you upgrade (or switch to blunt)<br />
<br />
Also keep your eyes open for a clay guardian shield (ac 25, +50 hp) - I saw on the other day for under 200 pp.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That weapon is fine to use as your primary weapon. You should focus instead on slowly improving your armor: Blackened Alloy, Totemic, Ry'Gorr, etc. Just be sure that you do have 1H Blunt and Piercing weapons and that you devote some time to keeping those skills up. (They don't have to be good weapons: I was using a Fine Steel Spear and Forest Giant Hammer until around Level 45).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Bigguss, For someone still in mostly banded they can't afford to plop down 200pp for a weapon.  They would be much better off getting better armor.<br />
<br />
If you have Luclin there are a lot of nice weapons and armors dropping in zones your level that would be a nice improvement for you.  I'd highly recommend Netherbian's Lair.  The xp is insane and with all the coin that drops there you will make enough cash to buy new gear fairly quickly.  Also its a very safe zone to get to, its right next to the Nexus and The Bazaar and there are roaming guards that will help with some of the creatures in there if needed.</div></div><hr />
