<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Northbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK I am on Fennin Ro.<br />
I have a Tolan's Bracer, Velium Swiftblade, Titans Fist, and a Fishbone Earring.  What can I net from these?  I really don't know the price on these items.  I have auctioned the Fishbone Earring and Titans Fist for 3k, but get no buyers.  I am farming silks when I take breaks from lvling and sometimes check for iron oxide spawns.  I am hurting bad for cash lol.  Cause on Fennin the going price for a JBB is between 20 to 30k+.  Anyone give some ideas or prices?  Trying to sell off the gear from my former main.  Love me shammy to much to quit <br />
:D .</div></div><hr />
