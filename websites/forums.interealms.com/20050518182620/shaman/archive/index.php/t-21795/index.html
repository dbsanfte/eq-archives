<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mafia INC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok heres the deal.. I just got back into EQ. I had some old friends and they hooked me up with a fungi tunic and lots of other shaman twink gear. I have NEVER played a Shaman before(but have lots of XP with eq in general)<br />
<br />
I am currently level 16(yes, I JUST started <br />
<br />
Will I be disapointed at how easy it will be to solo once I get cannibalize 1?<br />
<br />
I can imagine Fungi+ regen+ canni would equal very good soloing till at least 45 when I can get KEI.. or am I wrong?<br />
<br />
I play on sullon zek and it is hard to get groups which is why SOLO is VERY important... should I reconsider this choice and go monk, ranger, ect?<br />
<br />
I have very good gear+ fungi regen so I am hoping some other people with Shaman twinks can let me know how easy it gets at 24, because at 16 melle is not working as well anymore!<br />
<br />
THanks for any help</div></div><hr />

why is it not worth it in the long run? I heard at 54 shamans become solo machines??<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">But since you're new, I'll give you the five best tips there are for the new Shaman in EQ:<br />
<br />
1. Read the Medicine Cabinet threads that sound like they cover something you're interested in.<br />
2. Read the Medicine Cabinet threads that don't sound like they cover anything you're interested in.<br />
3. Level to 50, then go back and reread all the Medicine Cabinet threads. But this time, actually read them all.<br />
4. Level to 65, then go back and reread all the Medicine Cabinet threads that sound like they cover something you're interested in.<br />
5. Use search.<br />
<br />
Being not much of a soloer and not at all a pvper, that's the best I can offer you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you play 24/7 ? <br />
<br />
1 - 54 in 3 months, solo was nerfed HEAVILY.<br />
<br />
its all about grouping now, so don't expect to burn up the track with a fungi on.<br />
its a nice thing to have, but you should be more worried about what your class will be like once your above level 54, and what you will be doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I meant searching in general. I wasn't trying to imply anything about this post in particular.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I didnt start using my fungi till around lvl 50 when i started soloing in Katta.  I did have a Fungi staff that i used somewhere in the 30s for a bit, but it was never needed.  I guess it woulda been nicer at lower lvls but imo it was never needed.  There was never a situation, solo or otherwise, that i would have been able to control better if i had the fungi on.  My mana regened pretty fast, trolls got low wis but that makes for fast med times hehe.  The shaman solo tactics are basically, root...dot...dot...root...dot...dot...root...dot...dot and so on.  Never used too much mana to have to worry about healing myself.<br />
<br />
I did start using the fungi in Katta later on cause i needed the hp regen. Those guards break root way too fast, and resist slow pretty darn well too.  But to answer your question i would use my fungi all the way i think.  There's no harm in it, you are just making your downtime faster.  Just remember to cast other spells then your dots, sometimes you are gonna need to heal yourself :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman soloing is somewhat slow until you get the first pet at 34 (or it was way back when I was starting), and this assumes you aren't being PL'd up.<br />
<br />
If you are thinking that at level 24 you will have so much mana you won't know what to do with it, you are going to be very disappointed.<br />
<br />
Assuming you can get to decent places to exp, I would say you can count on doing a level every 2-3 hours of play on average up until level 51.  After that it slows down quite a bit.<br />
<br />
PS I don't remember becoming a soloing machine at 54.  Whoever told you this was wrong.  Either that, or our definitions of what a soloing machine would be aren't quite the same.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Fungi makes leveling ridiculously trivial from 1-40 anyway. After that you may need to be a bit more careful, but its still kind of a joke. At 53ish or so, you will want to swap out the fungi for a Tae Ew I think, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">With LDoN you can level insanely quickly.<br />
At lower levels you will use it to help with big pulls and tank mobs, as you get higher level, it will mean you have more mana available. Blazz is right with the reduced effectiveness. <br />
My tip: use LDoN points to get the second highest level of shaman armour. It's called Black Mire (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=black+mire&quot;) and is pretty decent stuff. At or above the level of Scaled Avatar (Ornate) (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=scaled+avatar&quot;)  If you have a LOT of LDoN points, and I mean thousands and thousands of points, go for Incorporeal  (&quot;http://lucy.allakhazam.com/itemlist.html?searchtext=incorporeal&quot;) gear from Everfrost. That will gear you up to a level just below elemental armour. <br />
<br />
Hope that helps :)<br />

<br />
Can anyone confirm this?? Fungi+ Regen spell SHOULD = more mana then I know what to do with... RIGHT? if not I think it is time to roll a ranger :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The limiting factor is the rate at which you can turn HP into mana.  With a Fungi and Regen you will have plenty of HP but canni 1 is not a very fast way to convert it to mana.<br />
<br />
You will have more mana than someone that doesn't have a fungi but it still takes time to convert it.  You will get tired of pushing the canni hotkey very quickly.<br />
<br />
Once you get to 44 and get the Stoicism spell you will realize that the fungi is just a convienience and not a neccesity at high levels.  And get canni 2 as soon as you can use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Its more to do with the high mana cost of shaman spells. If you want to solo, and solo quickly, you have not chosen the best class.<br />
<br />
Playing on Sullon Zek means you will be PVPing, and atm, shaman are just not the kings of that arena.<br />
List what your goals are, so you can get better advice from the Crucible. I still want another shaman around though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mafia INC</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">what is the recast/cast time..? I never even thought of that</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1. Shaman are weak in PvP, even at high level, almost any class with comparable levels, gear and number of AA can either kill us, orstalemate us. There are rumors of changes around the corner, but for the time being at least, shaman are not the PvP force that they once were<br />
2. Levels 16 - 23 are probably the hardest levels of a shaman's career for soloing.<br />
3. Yes, getting canni1 and regen will make a big difference to your ability to solo, but frankly, soloing for decent exp returns is never a stroll in the park - soloing is fun becasue it is risky<br />
4. Do a search on &quot;cannidance&quot;. Learn how to cannidance, how to hotkey it and how to love it<br />
5. Soloing is still a viable way of levelling for a shaman, but you will get significantly more exp/hour grouping than soloing. Personally, I think it is important to do a bit of both<br />
6. LDoNs are your friend</div></div><hr />

Cannibalize (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=265&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
20 mana every 3.5 seconds may sound nice but combined with the high mana cost of shaman spells it really doesn't add up as fast as it sounds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Soloing) You will not be disapointed at how 'easy' it will be to solo if you are playing the game for the fun and adventure of actually seeking things out that are new and exciting.  Not just playing the 'how fast can i get to 65' game, that game isn't really fun.<br />
<br />
Fungi+canni)  I have never used a fungi, i was never a twink, hell i dont have any alts cause i dont belive in twinks and i hate being lvl 1.  I am not sure about the 'insane' amount of mana you will get from this.  I can say though that most sham will rarely ever (after getting canni and learning the dance :p ) be OOM (unless in really tight spots of 'oh **** the cleric, the chanter and the DPS are all dead..its me and the tank and 2+ mobs....HEEEEAAAAAAL and root...but by then we are usualy dead or running)<br />
<br />
I play on the nameless, so i have no experience on other servers so i cant help you there.  I personaly think that PLing asap makes for bad, unknowledgable, and well...bad players.  My biggest peice of advice is dont play just to PL to what ever lvl, thats not what the game is about (its bad enough SoE makes it so damn easy to do so anymore), play your char, lover you char, take your time and LEARN your char...take the advice of the 'Elders' of the shamen community....and above all...Take REAL pride in your char, whatever class you end up with.  Its not how fast you get to the end...like in life..its the journy that got you there in the first place.<br />
<br />
If you PL your way to lvl 65...no matter the class (esspecially shaman) you will be truly dissapointed with the end result.  The fun of the game and the love of the char comes from the endless hours of painstaking time and effort into the grind and reaching those goals and being able to say...i did that, right (that an knowing what the **** you are doin at lvl 65 because you know your class helps a lot too :) )<br />
<br />
In the end its up to you, and like San said...read the medicine cab. it will teach you most of the info that the shamen community has accumulated over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">All I can say is horse + fungi is the ultimate leveling equipment till 50 or so.<br />
<br />
Sure maybe its not the best solo, but get a tank and up till about lvl 45 you will out heal/slow/buff/dps any priest class through the combination of canni, regen, fungi and horse (important so you still med whilst casting). Post 45 Cheal will start to become seriously mana efficient on a decently hp'd tank.<br />
<br />
However your fingers will be worn down from hitting the canni button so many times.<br />
<br />
The issue is you will have choice, more choice than available to many others. Solo or group.<br />
<br />
Go with it and be happy. ITs about the best single set I have come up with, two boxing is a different story, but thats cause you cant type on two puters at once so canni gets less used.<br />
<br />
PS, if you have choice, make a troll, the snare neck will save you a lot of angst, and do the reagent symbol of innoruuk quest.<br />
<br />
Rowf! rowf rowf!<br />

 i did this, and it took about 2 days (rea life) to max at lvl 58.<br />

<br />
I've grouped with people who PLed to 65 in a week or so...i will NEVER EVER EVER group with them again.  MOST (not all...BUT MOST) people who PL their way to 65, SUCK at thier class.  <br />
<br />
You're right..its not nuclear physics, and spending 1000's of hours on an mmorpg can 'be about as gratifing as sticking your head in the toilet' IF you dont see the fun in grouping or soloing in new places, exploring cool zones, or getting to know and take pride in a char that you have worked on.  I find that people with the attitude of 'need to HURRRRRY to 65...F getting to know how to REALLY play my char..i just want 65!' arnt people who get groups that often (because once you group with someone who sucks..you tend to /ignore them for the rest of your EQ gaming life.)  Im sorry, but i dont think i have EVER met anyone fresh into the game, OR playing a new char that PLed to 65 and actually knew much of anything about their class at all.  <br />
<br />
AGAIN, granted IT IS up to you in the end, i cant dictate how you play your char or what you do with your time.  BUT please for the LOVE OF PETE...dont become one of the many PLed retards running around out there.  A guildie of mine grouped with a shaman who REFUSED to FA(and yes he spent the 40k on the spell and had it in his book) any of the melee because he said that 'it would cause them [the player] more damage', that person was PLed to 65.</div></div><hr />

Outdoors with a horse you don't need to canni-dance and mana will come back faster, but you still need to learn the dance for indoor use.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 65 shaman with 100 aa points is one of the best soloers in the game, but at low levels you are not as good a soloer as a shadow knight, druid, necro, mage and maybe other classes.<br />
<br />
Which is fine though, or was for me, but might bother others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">A fungi won't help you level any faster. The fastest exp will still be grouping.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Granted I don't solo. Well, I solo'd some greyhoppers last night. But as a general rule I don't solo. I don't think there has ever been a time when I &quot;had so much manna I don't know what to do with it.&quot; Even now with CanniV, FT6, MC3, Drogmore, VoQ, SD and 9s I'm always busy actively regening manna. The life of a shaman is constant activity, cast, cast, cast, cannV, cast, cast, cast, cannIV, cannIV, cannIV, cast cast etc. We've got to be second only to bards with number of key strokes. I had a fungi for a few levels, 48-53 I think. I ditched it cause the regen just simply didn't make that much of a difference to me. I needed ac and hp badly. That lousy 15pts a tick didn't amount to crud once I had stoicism and the mobs in poI were hitting me in the 250's (note that in pvp you're gonna see some paladin around level 50 that heals almost as well as you do, and he'll be smacking you with a windblade in right around the same range) I think that you'll probably enjoy your fungi for the first 45-50 levels or so, It will certainly make you significantly better at staying alive and regening hitpoints for canni. At some point you're gonna be dying for some hp/ac/stats and your chest piece is gonna look like the suck. If you can afford it, then keep it in your bag : ). Whip it out durring downtime. If you're like me, and those 55-65 spells are chewing a hole in your pocketbook, then hock the stupid thing and get something really useful like torpor, malo, Quisence, malos (I still can't afford). Like some of the other posters said, enjoy the ride man, that's all any of us are here for!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">As was pointed out, check other posts. Fungi is not the end all item at all for a shaman. Check out other gear threads.<br />
<br />
My personal journey as a troll shaman was periods of tough going early on. While your spell lineup improves dramatically from 24 and up, the buff duration is short, the dots cost lots of mana for the level. Canni-dancing will be your friend forever (or horse canni.)<br />
<br />
Shaman can solo well - at all levels. Well = attack mob, kill mob, live, increase xp. Learning which mobs/zones are easier to do the above is key. Kind of pointless casting dots that are resisted on mobs consistantly ... and there are a number of zones where that is just how it is.<br />
<br />
Mellee defense/offense skills should be a priority to max at every level possible.<br />
<br />
Grouping at least 1 level for each spell level cycle is strongly recommended. Shaman are versatile group additions. There is a lot shaman can do and based on the group makeup it is important to learn what to do with who against what. Yeah, you are going to be the slower - 99% of the time. Yet there are groups where you may not be ... as your talents are better used doing other stuff.<br />
<br />
By the time you can get KEI you don't need KEI. It is a nice buff, but you are not a caster or druid or cleric. Canni/regen more than makes up for KEI. And, even with KEI, you are still going to be canni dancing just as much.<br />
<br />
Once again - gear. Look up some threads on this. Think tank with a set of spells. HP = mana (more to canni.)<br />
<br />
Soloing, I found 49 the magic number for my shaman to break away from the pack and solo effectively and efficiently. 49 spells are a major power boost. Before that, 34 pet is a big step ... though you learn quickly the pet is not your tank.<br />
<br />
An additional bonus now, that negates the value of the fungi later on, is the increase in innate regen the longer you sit.<br />
<br />
To answer one of your base questions: will soloing as a shaman become too easy? No ... cuz what you can solo is above what other classes of your level can solo, with a few exceptions. If you want easy, it is there. If you want challenges they are also there. Your choice. Your call.</div></div><hr />
