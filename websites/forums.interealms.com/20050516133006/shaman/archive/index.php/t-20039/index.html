<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I get these all the time, even before I ever used paypal.<br />

I also get similar notices claiming to be from visa, even though I don't have a visa card. <br />

It's all crap, part of being online nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I got one, and so did a friend who has never heard of EQ let alone this site. I think they just send them out to any email addresses they can find.</div></div><hr />

funny that &quot;paypal.com&quot; is using an &quot;hotmail.com&quot; account to verify your identity :)<br />
<br />
/warning mode on<br />
<br />
but be very carefull as it is often with such fake emails that hackers can get your personnals informations, like credit card numbers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been a member of payPal for many years and I have gotten these emails almost from day one.<br />
<br />
From payPals website: http://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=p/gen/email-security-outside<br />
<br />
Protect Yourself from Fraudulent Emails and Websites <br />
 <br />
 <br />
At PayPal, protecting your account's security is our top priority. Recently, PayPal members have reported suspicious-looking emails and fake websites. These emails are not from PayPal and responding to them may put your account at risk. Please protect your PayPal account by paying close attention to the emails you receive and the websites you visit. <br />
<br />
Please use the following tips to stay safe with PayPal: <br />
Safe Log In: To log in to your PayPal account or access the PayPal website, open a new web browser (e.g., Internet Explorer or Netscape) and type in the following: https://www.paypal.com/<br />
<br />
<br />
Greeting: Emails from PayPal will address you by your first and last name or the business name associated with your PayPal account. Fraudulent emails often include the salutation &quot;Dear PayPal User&quot; or &quot;Dear PayPal Member&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Email Attachments: PayPal emails will never ask you to download an attachment or a software program. Attachments contained in fraudulent emails often contain viruses that may harm your computer or compromise your PayPal account.<br />
<br />
<br />
Request for Personal Information: If we require information from you, we will notify you in an email and request that you enter the information only after you have safely and securely logged in to your PayPal account.<br />
<br />
Often, fraudulent emails will request details such as your full name, account password, credit card number, bank account, PIN number, Social Security Number, or mother's maiden name. <br />
If you think that you have received a fraudulent email (or fake website), please forward the email (or URL address) to spoof@paypal.com and then delete the email from your mailbox. Never click any links or attachments in a suspicious email. <br />
<br />
To learn more about protecting your PayPal account, please review our Security Tips.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Received the same thing here, it's a funny one too...<br />
<br />
Sign up   Logout   Help<br />
<br />
Why the heck would I need to sign up if I was already logged in? Besides, you are never automatically logged into Paypal.<br />
<br />
And that link buried in the middle of the rest of the ones that are legitimate is a dead giveaway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">just checked my email, had one also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">funny i got one too just now when i checked my e-mail. i deleted it without thinking though lol.<br />
<br />
Looks kinda real though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That stuff is so scary, I'm pretty net savvy and can recognize this particular email as a scam, but I worry about my mom!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We all worry about your mom<br />

<br />
Looks kinda real though.<br />
<br />
 <br />
<br />
<br />
only reason it looks real is cause they link most of the stuff right off of the paypal website if you vew sourse you can tell :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>OldOne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">that is an extremely alarmist title.  i would recommending changing it to &quot;paypal scam&quot; or something like that, as this problem is not specific to interealms.  it might give people the wrong idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">How about that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Just makes me wonder how this person got my email address.<br />
<br />
Isn't IGE a Chinese based company? I'd be a bit ticked if they are using my email address from here to try to scam me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've never used paypal, and I got one.<br />
<br />
This is really lame, seeing as how PayPal is the premier website-payment service.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">i had a few of these but delete immediately.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
I doubt it, I'm getting the same spam on 2 e-mail addresses, none of which have anything to do with the crucible. It just seems to be this week's common spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">kowalsky,<br />
<br />
How does one check stuff out like that?<br />
<br />
got a link?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i am not sure, but 1 good rule to remeber is that most companies if they do want you to change stuff, will not use a link to form, but ask you to log in via their website. if fact alot will expressly say that they will never ask you to send any detail to them via email. it will always be you having to sign in to their site first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">jenguran,<br />
<br />
just use any WHOIS database to know &quot;who is&quot; behind an @ip or website. :)<br />
<br />
i'm using http://www.geektools.com/whois.php as it's pretty simple and do a global search on severals databases.<br />
<br />
you can find others WHOIS sites at http://www.traceroute.org/#Extras (with many internet tools too)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sir Yakk, I already shot down your thread over at the Glade and I see you've started it here. This has nothing to do with Interealms databases and I don't sell/lease/give any access to my verification email addresses.</div></div><hr />
