<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cailte Canmore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The loc of the kennel's is 0,600 on the second chardok map  you have in that link.  It is down the  hall from the &quot;Herbalist&quot; shack and directly behind the building with the merchant in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have roamed around the mines before with a dru,shm,sk and cleric all 60 with full spellbooks.  VERY fun and great experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">To do the kennels you definately need a good DPS group with crowd control.  There are lots of mobs, some casters.  I did it with a 60 SK, 56 necro, me 58 shaman (at the time), 56 cleric, 54 chanter, 56 druid.  Our DPS was too low and eventually after a couple spawn cycles of non-stop action we had to evac when our SK pulled 4 and we got 2 on respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Galamann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Man, i wanna try it this weekend, now if only people weren't allied to chardok :(</div></div><hr />
