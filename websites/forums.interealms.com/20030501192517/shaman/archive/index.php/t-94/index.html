<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd rather put points into metabolism than Alchemy master.  It's similar to my protest against Gems, waiting time and med times are so painful they have to start some stupid game to pass the time, alchemy is so painful they have to make it better with a class skill, why not just fix the darned skill!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Before the site was redone, someone mentioned getting a philosopher stone from griegs.  That would raise skill to 198.  I would rather do that instead of putting how ever many hard earned AA points into AA alchemy mastery.  But im just jaded atm with alchemy</div></div><hr />

I'm a 180 skill alchemist, and the only useful potions I make now are the same useful potions I could have been making when I was at 120 skill (SOW, Shrink, and strong DS).<br />
<br />
Alchemy Mastery is good for what ? Failing less at potions no one will buy anyway?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zoichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well spoken zug.  My thoughts exactly</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I am currently goingt hrough about ten potiona  week to Bone field.<br />
<br />
My normal group doesnt include a porter, so the meele get gate potions for howling stones runs.<br />
<br />
Plus they normally keep 1-2 on them for the fast ride to seblis if they need to get there quickly.<br />
<br />
Expensive but we can go do howling stones with no thief and just me a cleric and a warrior if we want and get amazing xp and an uncrowded area in north or west wing. <br />
<br />
I am thinking about getting a 10 charger made for each of the three warrior and the thief and ranger than I normally group with. They basicly pay me 200 plat for one. That covers the fails I do have now and then. So 2 K for the ease of mind knowing that if you have to leave you are 30 seconds from getting the hell out of there.<br />
<br />
That I think is worth it.<br />
<br />
The main tank for my guild also purchases 40 of the good damage sheild to help with his duties on raids. And I regularly make the 40 a tick Mini torpor potion. (Since I dont have torpor yet. (God damn drop rates)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jhendlasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Me? Absolutely not.  It'll be a *nice* thing to have.... after I've finished with MFG, SCRM, Cannibalization, Quick Buff, and even Rabid Bear. :P<br />
<br />
I don't plan on getting it except as a conceit after I've gotten all the skills that actually have a real use.<br />

Alchemist?  Apothecary?  Drug Dealer?  YOU decide!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Think im gonna go the solo route when i do AA points ... why bother with dumping into alchemy. <br />
 <br />
i for one want to have fun and actually do a little damage and not buff all the time... thats what the other 2 shammys in muh guild are for. <br />
<br />
spell casting fury + rabid bear are my goals. <br />
quick buff and some of the others will be nice also<br />
cann5 etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zcul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">regarding expensive potions; <br />
<br />

herbalist in Chardok tonight :)<br />
<br />
thought i'd let you know if u are low on coins you can<br />
have luck there.. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rathelon Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not yet. Havent done any AA yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Forty-SoN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've got 1 lvl of Alchemy, plus a stone.  Prolly average 7-8 successes out 10 for the mana potions whereas I was doing maybe 5 or so witha 180 skill level.<br />
<br />
I know I know....but the clerics in my guild like the mana potions so I figured it would help keep costs down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mystipul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree with the last poster...<br />
<br />
Right now my fail rate with clarity potions and the infusion potions is astronomical... at 180 alchemy.. my average cost for clarity potions is 287pp PER SHOT... which is like a 60% fail rate.. cover that with needing to supply at least 10 clerics Per day.. for 8 hours... well.. costs add up and anything that will cut my costs ... i'll waste the time for it. :).. besides.. what else I got to put my aa points into...   Alchemy mastery should get this fail rate down to 40% i'm hoping. if not less:)... <br />
<br />
So to answer the main question.. Unless your in a Big Raid guild that would use these potions for big fights.. don't waste your time with it.  If your the main shaman providing these for the guild on a day to day basis.. then Yes.. put points into it...</div></div><hr />
