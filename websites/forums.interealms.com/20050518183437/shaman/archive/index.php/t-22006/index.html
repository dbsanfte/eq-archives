<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5249&amp;source=Live<br />
<br />
Any one know the reason behind this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Maybe so that res effects actually have some noticable effect?<br />
<br />
This is a new spell though, and not a change to the existing one, so I wonder if it's actually being used.<br />
<br />
This almost seems like something that could be used to possibly give other classes some sort of rez ability without annoying clerics too much...  ie: Shaman can rez, but with really bad rez effects that last a while, so nobody in their right mind would take a shaman rez if a cleric could get to them in a reasonable amount of time.<br />
<br />
...and no, I'm not campaigning for shaman rez - it was just a thought that popped in my head after seeing more than one res effect on lucy. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kami that makes sense to me.  5 minutes would not be good to be all glued up in a raid situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hmm, maybe SOE is trying to halt the &quot;hospital&quot; method in large fights.  Although, I'm not sure if many use it that much these days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Wow, shaman are getting a rez, i hope its for more then 75%.<br />
<br />
/hides</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">/em shakes his fist at Litgruv!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I think the new rez effect is for PvP. I seem to remember reading last month that they were going to change rez effects in PvP. Could be blowing smoke though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah it has to be the beta pvp effects.</div></div><hr />
