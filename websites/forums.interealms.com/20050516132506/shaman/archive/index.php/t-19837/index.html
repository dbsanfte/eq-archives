<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok i hear of bards / druids / wizzys getting aa's by the hours soloing .. is thier anything in the game for a shaman to solo to get quick aa's? my play time is limited right now and cant ever get in a quick group when i log on for a short time .. and am falling behind in AA's<br />
im lv 65 , full spell book besides GOD 6400 hps, . any suggestions?</div></div><hr />

Which is Hunting Grounds for level 60-65. Lots of good soloing spot advice to be found in there.<br />
<br />
My first question to you would be.. what PoP flags/access do you have?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">im time flagged .. full access</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shaman dont solo fast and thats your core issue.<br />
<br />
From what i hear PoF is good though. GoD wasnt too bad from what ive tried, they seem to have considerably less HP then PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
I guess there is 2 places you can atleast check out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sorry to hijack but you need to fix your magelo :)<br />
<br />
From everything I've heard stick to PoF soloing there.  Disease debuff, VP, Dots, sit, drink beer for 2 minutes, reapply dots, vp,  drink beer.... rinse and repeat till dead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dekurgen Heyokah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Full access, then its PoF tables all the way. root/rot, dont get hit.<br />
If tables is occupied: you can either ask to pull through tables from courtyard to fro bridge(assuming trigger isnt up)if they are just doing mobs at tables OR you can do magma guardians back at castle#1(they take longer and there arent as many of them though). Root/rot, dont get hit a lot.<br />
14% aa exp per kill, thats about as good as it gets for shaman anyways afaik. I swap out Rosey pants for ornate and keep them perma rooted while I dot them with BoU,(Pox from rosey pants),Bane,BoS,Scourge of Nife,epic, refresh Bane and BoS until they fall down(They usually die just as or just before BoU ends). You may want to skip epic except when they are close enough from a broken root becuase its a pita to move into range on horseback and cast the sloooow weak arse dot while doing a perma-root rotation.<br />
I keep tables area cleared when Im there alone, it's not as fast aa's as a good group-but you can still do fairly well.<br />
&lt;shrug&gt; hope that helps. Good Hunting :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwedo18</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">kk . thanks for the advice .. was just hoping someone knew something that i didnt where i could get a ping every hour or 2 per hour like the dame quaders ;o(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">By 6400 HP do you mean unbuffed?<br />
<br />
Either way, PoFire is the place for you.  Read this thread: http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=19680</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I get one about every 40-45 minutes at the tables without using dots with a DD component (BoS, BoU, Bane, epic). This was before I picked up Caff2 so that probably speeds it up a bit. I think I keep seven clear before respawn.<br />

Making 2 groups and form a mini raid to make exp also works wonder, but you need an excellent constant puller.</div></div><hr />
