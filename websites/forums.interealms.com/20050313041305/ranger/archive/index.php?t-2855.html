<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lilucia</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 04:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tonight my guild took down Ulump for a guild druid in Swamp of No Hope. I got ported to EJ then went through TT to the river zone area that goes to SoNH. Well upon zoning, in that dark cave with the river inside it (same cave where Dugroz spawns for the Howling Stones/Charasis key quest) I noticed something vastly different. Rather than seeing the several low level Iksars that normally stand on the shore, they were all dead on the ground, and several new monsters called &quot;a black ravenger&quot; had replaced them. They look like the other ravengers from Kaesora (yes, the little spermy things with teeth) except they were black. Note that the spelling &quot;ravenger&quot; is intentional, as the Kaesora ones are called &quot;ravener&quot;.<br />
<br />
They were red to me at 52, and yellow to a 57 warrior in my guild, who accidentally drew their agro and was subsequently shredded by them. They apparently hit for around 200-250. They do not see invis, however. Out of curiosity I put up camo, ran into the cave where Dugroz is supposed to be, but he wasn't there. Instead there were three black ravengers. I looked on track for Dugroz, and as I had suspected, they moved him somewhere else in the zone. He now spawns just outside of the froglok city toward the center of the zone. <br />
<br />
I asked around a bit, and from what I heard, some guild fought them for 2 hours without a single drop coming off them, not even a common. Interesting. These things came into the cave, killed the Iksars who guarded the TT zone, and don't drop anything. My guess is that they haven't been itemized yet, but I think they must be a quest of some kind, or else a rare spawn must come off of them.<br />
<br />
The Iksar corpses, when targetted, make your target field blank, and when conned, they con green and return &quot; regards you indifferently&quot;, with no name showing up. They also show up as blank spaces on my track list. There are about 14 ravengers, however, many of which spawn somewhat close together.</div></div><hr />

They all conned Even with me at 55. Luckily I was invis at the time along with my 51 Wizzy friend or we would have been wiped. Tracked Dugroz to the same place as described in the previous post. Woe to the unsuspected would-be HS key recipient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Benji</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 09:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">yea, i noticed these the other day.. Half killed me from over 2k hp in 6 hits.. was testing if they were animals or summoned, which they arent</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arkus</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 11:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting.  So where do you get keys made now?  Or do you even still have to?  I certainly hope you do.  There is something nice about a deserted dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbok of Xegony</div><div class="date">05-12-2002, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Dugroz got moved to a Froglok camp in the zone.   I don't have the exact loc on the top of my head, sorry =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dhiemn</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 12:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why does Verant insist on putting crap mobs near zonelines? or along paths people take to go places?  I remember level 40, hunting the named cycle in TT with my old guild.  Now with these things in that cave.... man I don't even want to imagine the pain in the ass they will be on people trying to get to TT.<br />
<br />
We have Vekis in FV, we have that other Iksar in DL, near the FV zoneline.  We have these things.  What crap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Delyth</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 01:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">:/ you folks complaining about all these guys must have had a lot of bad experiences with these baddies...<br />
<br />
I never have. Vekis the time I discovered him conned only dubious to me, who knows why and the other guys I saw on track and camoed to investigate before running headlong into them.<br />
<br />
Might be a pain to other classes but not to a ranger.  We are smarter than that. &lt;G&gt;<br />
And as for the getting people to TT just get ported to EJ and go from there. No one says you have to go by way of  SoNH. :)<br />
<br />
I would love to know what the odd new mobs sprouting up are for...beast epic?( I havent bothered to look at that one as  our guild doesn't have a beastlord in epic range yet).</div></div><hr />

They resist root and snare at level 60, (they conned blue at 60 as well).. Multi-hit for 250, and SUMMON.  Yep, they summon.  Didn't even have the time to get off a thurg gate potion.  Luckily DL is closeby-- enticing a cleric to give me a rez wasn't a problem.  Point is-- don't play with them solo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fredescu</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 06:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's easy to get around them without invis as long as you know where they are. You can see them through the water too. Doesn't make it impossible to get to the swamp from TT. You just have to know the right way.<br />
