<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I went to UP last night with a druid. We decided we would root/rot a few for exp and maybe a drop. The first one we pulled (goranga thing) beat the snot outa us by summoning. We took turn taking a beating on him as agro switched and he would summon us over. I don't see how you can solo these guys. I have Torpor, epic, jbb, horsie. Any advice on how to or if it was the wrong mob to solo would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very doable solo.  All the goranga should be about the same (other then named).  Have resists up for the shaman ones.<br />
<br />
Dark Assasins are tougher for two reason, first they tend to snare you during the pull unless your magic resist is high enough and secondly dots are a lot tougher to land even if debuffed.<br />
<br />
When bored I would pull to zone, torpor tank, dot and have pet do its thing.  Always pull with slow.  If it does not land on pull root the mob in the general area you will be fighting and cast it again.  If you dot while rotted it more then likely will summon you.  If you outrun the mob too much it will turn around in tunnel and backtrack a bit before coming back for you, let it do this it will come back solo.<br />
<br />
I believe the standard mob takes 2xepic, 1xPoX, 1 or 2x Bane.  Not the quickest fight but pretty safe, some gems drops (a lot less then in the past) which range from 1 plat to about 180 plat each to a vendor and the potential for some decent Plate armour, the shaman pieces are a joke for the most part...but droppable.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I solo there all the time and my gear is far from great.  I hover at 930AC and 2600HP buffed.<br />
<br />
The cavemen are very easy because all of our dots work.  Assasins are a pain cuz you have use epic and nukes which is inefficient.<br />
<br />
Pretty much everything summons in UP so get used to tanking stuff.<br />
<br />
You do not have a magelo so I don't know what gear you have but maybe you need to go solo Kael Arena or Bank and get some Thurg armor to upgrade your AC and HP some ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 960ac and 2400 hp buffed. I do need to turn in my SS guest armor for my boots and bracer. Maybe I just thought it would be easy for a shaman and druid to duo them. I didn't even get fido out for the fight cause I thought we could root/rot em. Maybe I will try again sometime now that I know what to expect. Just seemed to me that I spent a lot of mana trying to keep my heals up with his damage.  I do also have pox and bane for damage, forgot to mention that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Baludien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Assassins also move quite fast, cannot be rooted, and will backstab you for 500s if you turn around. Nasty, avoid pulling these. <br />
<br />
Assuming you have torpor, tanking a slowed goranga really shouldnt be that difficult for you or the druid. After tanking PoP mobs, stuff in UP doesn't seem so badass anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>pokalow998</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">around 950ac + , 2k+ hp more(self buff) you can tank(slowed) mobs in UP, i got 1040AC,2.1k hp self buffed , i can solo gantro easy in UP, just take care slow worn off , if you tanking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">you can solo some named in UP too and duo most.<br />
I can solo the dath sakor warlord and radulkhulan (sp?)<br />
Can duo with a monk the dalkhai (big named moktor, 100k hps), corrupted elysian elders(nuke like anything).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was soloing there at 57, and I only had a JBB. Unless something has changed since I quit I dont see how you have problems. I was twinked, but still no fungi or epic. I usually used my pet, and root/rot, and called pet off once health was low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A moktor is like 1/3 of a yeldema, and yeldema is a puss.  It is easily doable.  You have all the tools you need, all you need is the technique.<br />
<br />
Here's what you do:<br />
<br />
Pull with malosini (you didn't mention malo so i assume you're missing it)<br />
Slow it (set a timer or look at a clock.  You need to reslow in 5 minutes).<br />
Hit him with epic, poxx, bane, ebolt (if your mana is a bit lacking, skip ebolt)*.<br />
Torpor yourself.<br />
Canni over and over again until it is time to reapply a dot (this is very important.  When soloing you ALWAYS have to be cannibalizing unless you are casting something else or you are very low on health).<br />
Reapply dots.<br />
Torpor yourself.<br />
Rince and repeat until it is dead.<br />
<br />
Tip:  Back yourself in to a corner near the ME zoneline.  You won't get pushed around and its harder to be interrupted that way.<br />
<br />
* Damage dealing is really the only tricky part of soloing a mob like this.  A shaman with torpor can tank a mob that hits for 400 (probably a lot more, my last big solo kill was stomples before PoP came out) indefinately, but sooner or later, you have to kill it or it will kill you.  If you have a large mana pool, then you can simply apply every dot you have and burn it down quickly, ending the fight before you go oom.  If you have a smaller mana pool, though, you might go oom from dots before the thing is dead.  Here's my magelo http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=383384.  As you can see from the screenshot background, my gear when I first killed yeldema was pretty crappy.  2320 hp buffed and 161 wis.  Back then, it took me about 15 minutes to kill yeldema.  I used a few dots in the beginning, but after that all my mana was for healing myself and keeping a little extra in case my reslow attempts were resisting.  The only damage being done to yeldema was epic, pet, a little JBBing, and DS potion.  Now, with my new gear, I simply apply plague poxx ebolt and bane, canni5, heal myself, dot and nuke some more, and finish the fight in about 6 minutes.  I have the mana to do this now, whereas I didn't before.<br />
<br />
That being said, your offensive tactics when you first start killing moktors should be to primarily rely on epic dot and pet, while you use most of your mana for keeping your health up.  Moktors can be a real pain on interrupts and a few interrupted torpors means that you might have to tnargs yourself, which is a serious mana hog.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I always pull with malo.  These guys hit too hard and fast to be messing around with resisted slows.  Slow virtually always sticks after a malo; at the most I take a hit or three.  <br />
<br />
The trick is to root after that.  Every time root breaks, you will get summoned, unless you're lucky or a great deal of aggro has been built up on somebody else you're with.  (or someone with low hitpoints is in the vicinity -- anyone's mob will charge anyone else in that case)<br />
<br />
After I root, I malosini -- I want my DOTS to stick, but even more, I want my roots to stick!  Then I swap in my DOTs; if duoing, I swap in torrent of poison somewhere.  Somewhere in there I put on a torpor.  I have ALT-F3 as my very well memorized key combination for casting root, so I don't have to mouse over to my spell gems.  If torpored when summoned, after root is on, I click topor off and run away.<br />
<br />
While I've been getting hit, doggy has been munching the mob.  I keep him hasted and HP buffed, and with STR too.<br />
<br />
Doing this, it's only a matter of time till I can do what I really do there almost all the time, which is not solo, but duo with my bot.  Either monk or new warrior bot.  Once the melee takes the aggro, I can torrent of poison almost at will.  Sometimes the mob will be not quite dead when slow wears off, so I'll have to reslow.  Just depends on the luck.<br />
<br />
I really recommend malosini on these guys, as well as malo.  What makes it all work is getting root to stick.  Once rooted, they will not summon you if a melee(or pet) is attacking them unless you cause a huge amount of aggro somehow, perhaps by putting in so much more damage than your pet or melee partner that even when root is intact, your aggro is too high -- or if you break root.<br />
<br />
The robes are bad news because their snare cancels out your SOW, so even when it drops, if you're not alert, you won't be able to run to zone quickly if you haven't noticed SOW is gone.  And the snare can last a long time.  They tend to reapply it instantly.  Also -- they backstab!  Sometimes for darn good amounts.  They're fast too, so run backwards.  P.S. -- many of them see invis, and they have a very big aggro range.  Gantrus are better to fight, as their aggro range is really tiny, and only the nameds can see invis.<br />
<br />
The shaman gantrus - shojen and shojilen -- cast bane of nife, slow you and doggy and friends, debuff you, etc.  I think of them as &quot;spoiler&quot; mobs and tend to let other people kill them. ;)  <br />
<br />
By the way, park a plate tank there if at all possible -- yours or your friend's or whatever.  If you've been thinking of starting one one day, start it now, and park it in UP entrance.  Gantru moktors can drop nice plate, including AC 21 legs, for instance.  There is also Radulkan armor from, of course, Gantru Radulkan(the very resistant but otherwise easy mob -- low DPS).  There are a number of pieces.  The plate BP has like 15 sta and 100 hitpoints, plus lots of other stats; AC on it is not superb, but considering the hitpoints on it are raid-level, it's well worth hanging around to load up a twink with this no-drop plate stuff.  There is also other stuff around for one, including various droppable items that are great for either selling or twinking.  <br />
<br />
The corrupted elysian elders drop the Death Watcher's Shroud, which is a nice druid (and other) shoulder item, and the Death Mask of the Elysians, a nice mask that I wear now, as does my druid.  Unfortunately, these used to sell like hotcakes, but barely ever sell on my server now.  Be careful here; the corrupted elysians, like all elysians, see invis, but pulling them is more dangerous than other stuff there, as they can chain cast DD's, root and snare you, and debuff you too.  Being snared and rooted and debuffed and chain-DD'd is not exactly easy to handle.  They can get rid of 2 or 3k hitpoints very quickly with their-chain casting.  They tend to hang back and just blast you till they run out of mana; if you want them to follow you, often you have to melee engage them, and coax them back to somewhere safe by running very close to them.  There are pathing problems around the druid corner too -- they sometimes run right up to it and then turn and run away; in general, you have to do a lot of coaxing to get mobs over there.  Once you do, though, you're safe until some druid kites on top of you and dies, leaving you with his overpulls.<br />
<br />
Look for the hivefiend, shak dathor warlord, too.  You can get nice stuff off either of these; sometimes it sells, sometimes it doesn't.<br />
<br />
My best advice for you if you want to make money, though, is to get a second account and PL a melee to take the hits for you and leave you with a far greater margin of safety and DPS per minute.  You don't even have to have two computers, either....<br />
<br />
I've made 100's of thousands of plat in UP; it's well worth putting up with the noob flood there at least sometimes, to try to get some loot.  Good luck to you!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you talking about the little orange things?  I pulled one once and couldnt land a single dot on it, and never messed with them again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">No, the orange guys are the netherbians.  He's speaking of the shak dathors, the black alien-type guys -- like the alien type you see in Maidens End or Tenebrous or such.  As he says, they don't cast -- pure melee.<br />
<br />
They are indeed the best experience there for the amount of effort.  Though if you do them or anything else in UP for experience, there's much better experience to be had elsewhere, to say the least.  Virtually anything and anywhere in POP, for instance.  They do drop Dream Weaver armor for pure caster types though; the pants and head and I think cloak are good, and I think the rest is garbage.  It's no-drop!  So park a pure caster friend there if you're going to be doing them.<br />
<br />
Sooner or later you'll get trained by druids there or just get an elysian add, so park a druid friend there too to loot the elysian druid-only no-drop armor.  <br />
<br />
Plate drops are at the zoneline off moktors and the rare robe guy, as well as nameds.  Once again, virtually all of it is no-drop.  Radulkan armor is very nice; moktor is not bad and much more common, but your plate twink friends will outgrow it much quicker.<br />
<br />
I've suited up a lot of people or their twinks with all the no-drop I've gotten in UP; nice way to make a few folks happy if you can.  Not a bit of it is any good for shamans except perhaps the bracers, which are only ok for shamans -- the saves are nice and one of them is plus 15 wisdom.  One is plus 15 stamina; the rest are junk for shamans.  They all sell sorta reasonably quickly tho, but the market is getting much more flooded with them now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I havent played for a while (~4 months now) but xped in Umbral quite a bit.  I was 60 with jbb, epic, affliction effeciency 3, mana preservation 3, horse, torpor, malo, pox, bane, and canni5.<br />
<br />
Dont bother pulling to the ME zone.  You will spend too much time on the pulls, just pull off to a wall where there arent any other spawns.<br />
<br />
I only bothered with the monkeys and zebra things, all the other mobs in the zone are entirely too poison / disease resistant (or even immune).<br />
<br />
I would pull with slow and root as soon as its in range.  Apply malosini, epic and then sick puppy as I hit it with plague, pox, bane and would have to swap spells in for ebolt too.  I think I had around 2600 hp self buffed and ~1k ac, but doing these guys isnt about your gear its about your toys (epic, jbb, torpor, etc...)<br />
<br />
Just torpor tank, jbb canni a little and reapply poison dots.  Make sure to use lev and back off puppy when they enrage.  It should be dead after about 2.5 mins.  With canni5, the horse, and easily getting a c3 and / or aego from the nexus, I had just a few seconds of downtime in between pulls.<br />
<br />
At 60 this was by far the best solo spot I had found, better than my best tries in pre-nerf fungus.  Something like a full aa yellow in about 17-20 minutes.  On average the monkeys and apes would be 6-7 kills for a yellow aa (100% to aa).<br />
<br />
The named monkeys arent any harder than the normal ones, actually the lesser named one (that drops the charm) is even easier as hes a caster so he will spend a lot of time casting rather than pounding.<br />
<br />
The big named one (that drops bracelets, 100k hp's) is cake too, just takes a while.  Under 3 slow refreshes when I would do him, but DO remember to refresh that slow.  You will probably want to canni a bit more during that fight so you dont go OOM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I had a very hard time soloing in UP recently. I'm a 61 Shaman, no Torpor, Malo, Pox, Epic, or Fungi. <br />
<br />
However I had Virtue, C3 (or C5 can't remember) and JBB. I had roughly 1025 AC, and over 3700 HPs. I had pet buffed fairly well and hasted. I pulled a Gantru with Malosini and then Slowed it and backed myself into a wall. I casted Plague, Bane, and started JBBing while pet was attacking from rear. When I got low on health, I backed away and casted a few Superior Healings. I then casted Cripple on the mob, and reapplied Plague and Bane when they wore off. I casted Bane of Nife at least 4 times, maybe more. I would get summoned when Instill would wear off. I eventually got low on mana and health and lost pet when slow wore off on the mob.I had to zone before getting beat to pulp, mob was at 8% health or so. I tried doing this several times, with different varying tactics and only killed a few, but it was extremely tough. <br />
<br />
I read the above posts, and it seemed easier than it actually was, at least for me. I guess it may be because I don't have Torpor, Pox, and Epic Im guessing. I thought having C3 and Virtue on me, I would have no problem.  I don't know but I'm lacking something, as I solo pretty well and soloed 90% or more of my levels.<br />
 I eventually went back to soloing Wraiths in Plane of Nightmare at the Hedge zoneout, which takes most of my health and mana, but I'm able to come out 95% of the time with a kill and gain 1 blue bubble of AA (4%) per kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Yes, doing it without those key spells is the problem.  <br />
<br />
I generally cast torpor on myself at least two or three times during a moktor fight, to make up for damage and to help regenerate mana.  Superior heal is just not good at all at your level.<br />
<br />
Pox I also find quite useful there.  As is epic of course, for the stats etc as much as the DOT on it.<br />
<br />
You should still be able to duo there, but superior heal is getting to be way too underpowered for what you need to do to progress in the game.  You really need to see about torpor ASAP(as well as malo).<br />
<br />
If you cannot foresee ever getting it, I'm not sure you wouldn't be helped by leveling high enough to get Tnarg's mending.  It could totally turn your gameplan upside down by making it impossible for you to get good experience in Umbral or most anywhere else, unfortunately.  But somehow, somewhere, you have to get torpor or a good substitute if you want to continue to prosper at your level.<br />
<br />
I found that duoing there was much easier for me that soloing, so I duoed with my bot monk or bot warrior, or with a friend of mine who is a paladin.  That let me cast torrent of poison(they don't seem to come after you much for torrent of poison, yet it does lots of damage cheap) instead of getting aggro from dots, and rarely put my health in danger.  You might want to try that, as if it was much easier for me with torpor/malo, duo'ing must be a huge boost if you have neither spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Ahh cool thnx for the info.<br />
Guess I need to get that Torpor spell afterall. I know for one, I probably will never be able to buy it, as I have never had over 30kpp and likely won't anytime soon. I will have to do the unbearable camping for it. I'll try the Guardian Wurms or whatever they are called in Skyfire, and try to jump on some Kunark Dragon raid/kills too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Did you try using Kragg's mending? With Virtue, you have  plenty of hp to cast early and ride out an interrupt or two - or just root, back off, and heal while Gobaner takes a few hits. I do find KM interrupts a fair bit but against slowed mobs its not so bad, and its certainly a lot cheaper than torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Any other Shaman solo effectively against Wraiths in PON at ZO2?  <br />
<br />
jvrebi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've done tons of wraiths there, but again, it's much easier with a melee partner.  First of all, you can get repops running after you as you're dragging your pull back -- that's why my monk was great there; he could either FD or handle one mob torpored for a second or two while I tried to root the add.  These guys can resist root a lot, by the way.<br />
<br />
Out of the literally hundreds of wraiths I've killed there, I got exactly one ethereal scroll.  Don't bother going there for spells.<br />
<br />
Watch out for backstabs too!<br />
<br />
And stay away from banshees; they're horrible experience.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, you'll overall get just as good experience splitting it with a melee there as you will soloing but taking longer and being less safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah, I used Kragg's Mending and it did help when soloing in UP. I think the few times I did manage to kill the Gantru I used Kraggs instead of Sup Heal, but the fights were still close calls, with less than 40% health and less than 10% mana at the end. <br />
<br />
However, I did those fights with my 55 pet spell (36lvlpet), and not my 61 pet spell (58lvlpet) which I aquired yesterday. Might have made a signifigant difference as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
on a side note, I bought True Spirt and Tigir's Insects for a total of 5,000pp in the bazaar yesterday. Pretty good deal IMO hehe.<br />
<br />
I saw Talisman of Raptor for 20,000pp, and I couldnt think of why it would sell that high. I guess because its one of the uncommon to rare spells, but just not that useful.</div></div><hr />
