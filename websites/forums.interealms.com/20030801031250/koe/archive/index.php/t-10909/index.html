1. After getting an MGB KEI and MGB Ageo in nexus I got random ported to my bind spot<br />
2. My Acrylia Studded Leggings look like a vampire stake<br />
3. I lost my guild tag in Guk<br />
4. I saw this orge guard sparing with another guard in PoK and as he kicked his armour flew off of his body, I got a screenie too.<br />
<br />
OMFG, if you look at my majelo profile it shows the stake on my profile on my leggings. http://www.magelo.com/eq_item_info.html?num=6092<br />

What bugs did you get hit by last night?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, after the morning patch, my friend who plays on my account was crashing on every zone-in. Even after the emergency patch, it still happened. Finally uninstalled/reinstalled..and it seems to have fixed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Acies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Likewise, everytime I entered a new zone, desktop :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Meiwyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you have a custom UI I highly suggest you remove your UI from your EQ Files and then run EQ.  It should load the default UI and then you will not have the zone and crash problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Soriathus Serpentine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Not necissarily. I don't get any zone crashing and I have a completely tweaked out UI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Acies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Only thing on mine that is differant is the Hitpoint/Mana/Stamina box.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you copied the original EQUI.xml into your custom UI folder, you will need to place the new one in that folder. Ideally, you should only have the custom UI files in your custom folder and leave all the others in the default directory.</div></div><hr />
