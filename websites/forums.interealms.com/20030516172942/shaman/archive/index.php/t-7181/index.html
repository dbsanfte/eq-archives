<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yep druid pets are insane, killing 55+ exp mobs in under a minute sure is nice.<br />
<br />
give them a muzzle of mardu, a couple weapons, savage spirit and a damage shield and they really tear things up.   Keep in mind druids can actually exp faster using the higher level mobs with regular charm than the ones that are dire charmed.<br />
<br />
it's risky though, who wants a massively hasted 55+ mob really mad at you when charm breaks?  For an AA an hour, I would risk it.</div></div><hr />
