I'm bored in class at the moment so I'm surfing the net as usual and i went to lucy.fnord.net...<br />

Scourge of Nife does *not* stack with Bane of Nife.<br />

I see no reason why SoN shouldnt stack with bane, its not like we would be able to land both of them on any noteworthy mobs without being smashed to a pulp and/or running oom first.<br />

Any spell that adds +120 to melee stats is going to make you a popular shaman (and no, not every tank that would be in the position to have this spell cast on them will have maxed stats, not even close)<br />

Being a lvl 60 tank != maxed or near-maxed stats anymore than being a lvl 60 shaman = maxed or near-maxed WIS.  It's a generalization.  Different players take different routes -- one may have his HPs/AC juiced up while their stats remain only decent, and vice versa. <br />
<br />
Stats buffs useless?  No, sorry.  I've seen an un-buffed tank vs. a buffed tank; trust me, there is a difference.<br />

So Vulak drops a poison dot that is 16% better than our level 56 one and 12% better than Pox.  Sorry, I'm underwhelmed.  Why is this not a lure?  Verant is frustratingly stingy and unimaginative when it comes to shaman.<br />

<br />
ancient spells were meant to be an upgrade to existing spells, loot for casters as such(that they didnt have time or whatever for more spells doesnt change this). NOT new spellines. stacking scourge of nife would mean a quite dramatic upgrade to our potential dps.<br />
46.5 dps to be excact.<br />
<br />
giving us a nice 84.7 potential dps from (2) spells. add bolt for 111.7 dps if you feel like, and if you spare casting time, then theres also our epic, and any diseases you might spare time/mana for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Boobash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Ancient avatar is a silly spell for any shaman in a guild that can get it. I already have avatar and primal avatar, along with a primal weapon. So all you are doing is adding 20 attack using ancient. And at 50% reinforcement our avatar lasts 9 minutes, not 6. But even then you can ancient avatar 3 tanks per 9 minutes, and all those tanks are prolly gonna have primal weapons to proc their own avatar the lazy bastiches. So let some beastmaster cast savagery instead.</div></div><hr />

Just to clear things up, its ok to flame VI, but not other posters?  I just wanna make sure i have the rules straight.  And no, it's NOT fair to assume all tanks fighting Ring of Vulak have primal.  Our guild hasn't been in Sleepers for at least 6 months, but we've recruited melee characters since then.  The primal lacking rangers in guild sure do appreciate avatar on raids.  So do the primal lacking rogues.  The monks also.  I'll be damned, all of our primal lacking melees do!  I imagine they'll enjoy ancient avatar even more if i ever happen to get it.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't have enough spell slots to stack too many DOT's, so the Exten Afflict3 bracer putting my Bane up there with the dmg of our Ancient spell saves me the trip to Vulak..   Not that I wouldn't mind:<br />

Sarcasm aside, Gikky -- What's so outrageous about giving the end-all, be-all shaman DoT an improved chance to land?  <br />
<br />
How many times have you cast Bane of Nife this week?<br />
<br />
When was the last time you stacked Bane of Nife with Envenomed Bolt?<br />
<br />
Are you going to pass on every other Vulak drop for a spell that does about a JBB blast more than Bane of Nife?<br />
<br />
Is ASoN useful?  Sure.  Heck, Acumen is &quot;useful&quot;.  But if you can't see this is a warmed over placebo of a spell, then you must be playing an entirely different game.  There is no &quot;wow&quot; factor here.  I love my DoT's and I should covet this spell but I don't.  Considering the big show they made about ancient spells being so rare and hard to obtain, they could have have loosened up.<br />

I've prolly cast Bane of Nife well over 100 times in the last week.  I use it as my major source of doing damage.<br />
<br />
&quot;When was the last time you stacked Bane of Nife with Envenomed Bolt?&quot;<br />
<br />
About 5 minutes before the last time i logged off.  I stack them both on all the time.  With affliction efficiency and duration items, along with spell casting mastery 3, these 2 do a ton of damage for not much mana.  Not that mana is really a problem with our outrageous mana regen.<br />
<br />
&quot;Are you going to pass on every other Vulak drop for a spell that does about a JBB blast more than Bane of Nife?&quot;<br />

<br />
bit flawed logic, it'll up the damage of ancient scourge as well.<br />
<br />
shaman ancients suck no doubt. i mean look at ancient gift of aegolism, the necro lich, destruction of ice, etc., all fantastic spells for your raid/guild member. the dot is *nice* i guess, but it'll be for soloing or duoing mainly, and you probably won't be able to kill anything with SoN that you couldn't without - maybe except Cazel ;) feral avatar is beyond useless as well....yeah again it's nice, but how many shamans actually remember to mem avatar/pa/feral for fights, and want to keep it on people to have it fade 6 mins later. again nice, but RoV-completers will have a lot of primal already.</div></div><hr />

   I _frequently_ cast both BoN and EBolt on mobs.  Replacing the EBolt with SoN would greatly increase my damage.  Or better yet, use all THREE spells for more than 50 percent increase in my DPS.<br />
<br />
   With my focus items, aa skills, and flowing thought I can easily keep my mana high while doing these dots.<br />
<br />
   I just wish I had SoN, maybe some day.<br />

   I'd also love to have the improved Avatar, I _always_ keep primal avatar up and cast it frequently, a second avatar spell would make it easy to keep avatar on twice as many tanks.<br />

<br />
Tho I do have to say that most of the melees in a guild that is doing Vulak ring WILL be primal.  There's no bigger upgrade for a melee than primal, so that's the first thing they shoot for.   It makes a SIGNIFICANT difference in a guild's total DPS.  Which is, in the end, the factor that determines what they are capable of doing.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, i gotta look into an extended affliction item.  I can think of two bracers but I want neither of them.  One is coldain bracer, halfass stats and waste of a slot.  I JBB when I solo anyway, and I have a Eashen bracer in other slot i am not replacing for the friggen world!  So . . is there a non-bracer EA III item?</div></div><hr />

<br />
reasons SoN is a great upgrade:<br />
<br />
poison tends to land decently on boss mobs these days. personally i do poison damage during boss fights inbetween assist heals. SoN gives shamans another dot to split up duties for on raids, thus improving our stackability.<br />
<br />
improving dps by 47 is crazy.. whoever said shaman dps sucks is so completely wrong. we have among the best caster dps in the game. you need to consider mana regen over time, that we have 50 dps of FREE damage no matter what, also with cann4+5 being sick.  epic is 14 dps, bane 30ish, Son what 45? pox somewhere around 25, ebolt 25.  jbb when possible is 30, torrent of poison is a sunstrike quality nuke when it all lands, which it does on alot of boss mobs. add all that up and its very damage comparable to any 'damage class'. <br />
<br />
if your gonna complain about our class, mention something like how annoying it is to be burdened with 'fixing' eq raid dynamics by having to shrink every single person and their collision detection box. otherwise 40-60 people dont fit together in enclosed areas. not only do we have to do this but its group only AND single target. time consuming and annoying. warriors dont have the buffing mantality since their lazy and complacent and expect everything done for them, so cobalt bracer isn't any relief. even in the rare case of a proactive warrior-shrinker, its still GD annoying to switch around groups shrinking people and pets.<br />
<br />
or the eq flaw in general of only 8 spell slots hits us pretty hard when we need 1) slow 2) malo 3) cb 4) torpor 5) cann4 memmed at all times to be effective, leaving 3 slots for foc sta acu sow pe avatar malosini cripple dot(s) root, that have to be CONSTANTLY swapped in and out. mouse work is tedious and annoying, and we have to do it all the damn time to be effective, more than other classes with the possible exception of one (enc).<br />
<br />
hmm rant off</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind that we have 8 slots - if we had more then we'd be nerfed as we'd be too powerful.<br />
<br />
A single shaman can do obscene DPS on a per-caster but on a long fight only one instance of each spell can sit on the mob at a time where as DD casters can just plug away and out damage easily.<br />
That is our achillies heal on the DPS front.<br />
<br />
My only gripe with the shm class is that alchemy is not seen as a true trade skill - not one of the new quests (earring of solstice etc) has an alchemy component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Quit reading the Safehouse and actually go to Sleeper's.  There is still plenty of primal to be had, and the zone is much easier than it used to be.  <br />
<br />
More than 8 slots could be balanced if there were restrictions on which spells could be in the additional slots (i.e. non-healing buffs only or somesuch).  But would probably be a pain.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Thanks for the clarification on stacking.  Apparently I don't understand how to use that damn spdat site :x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Gikk the Unholy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">&quot;Hmm, i gotta look into an extended affliction item. I can think of two bracers but I want neither of them. One is coldain bracer, halfass stats and waste of a slot. I JBB when I solo anyway, and I have a Eashen bracer in other slot i am not replacing for the friggen world! So . . is there a non-bracer EA III item?&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh man, ditch the JBB.  If you're 60 and have torpor, you're better off using the time to dot and canibalize your mana back.  Can 5 makes dotting an even better option.  And if you have affliction focus items, its not even in the same ballpark.  Do yourself a favor and sell/give away your jbb, the only thing its doing for your soloing is slowing it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">Landragoran, if you really want an EAIII item then the Coldain bracer is not a waste of a slot as you so intelligently call it.<br />
<br />
If you use this instead of your Wolfcaller bracer these are the changes you get in item-stats:<br />
<br />
-6ac -1wis -20hp -15mana +5str +5svm +5svc<br />
<br />
If you can really tell this difference when playing I am VERY impressed. The difference you can tell is that your DoTs will last longer. So stop being so damn oober :)</div></div><hr />
