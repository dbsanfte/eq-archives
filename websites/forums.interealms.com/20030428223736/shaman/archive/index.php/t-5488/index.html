<br />
Since shammy's cant be nomes, and nome masks are gone and never where shammy useable, how about a potion?<br />
<br />
Or even a tinkered device, that would be awesome.</div></div><hr />

Title it with what it is, and hope it's interesting enough that the Devs look over it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like the idea of using racial peoples meats to make the masks. Would be fun to kill some gnomes or snacklings for a neato potion. :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Madai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Alchemy needs a major revamp.  Three things they could do to increase the effort with increasing the cost buy much:  One, add sub-combine steps, two, add spells needed to do alchemy.  Such spells could be titled Awaken (herb).  Third, they could add special tools to be used by alchemists.<br />
<br />
Basically, if the potion becomes desirable enough to be bought at 15pp per dose, make production cost 5p and have a substep if you want to make production slower.  Making cost the main limitation of alchemists kinda sucks.<br />
<br />
They should consider lowering the costs and increasing the yields in rarely used potions.  They definatly need to add a fire breath potion, ie, you drink the potion, and then breath fire on your opponent.  <br />
<br />
They should put potions on the drink counter, so that individual potions can have more spectacular effects, but no one can drink too many potions in a given time frame.  Like, say, after you drink the fire beath potion, it will be 15 minutes before you can drink another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sthaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How bout a 'give shaman every other class defining ability' potion?  Honestly, FD?  track?  ress?  summon corpse?  While I'd love to have these abilities, these are mainstays of other classes which we do not, and should not posess.  Why bother with 13 or whatever classes when shaman can do everything?<br />
<br />
What alchemy needs is a kick in the teeth.  Make it interesting, make it fun, make it useful, make it WORTH THE MONEY, do not make it so that shaman have every other class defining ability.<br />
<br />
Some ideas:<br />
<br />
Short(ish) duration skill mod potions (a one shot alternative to or boost to already existing gearlocks).<br />
<br />
AFFORDABLE gate potions, everyone already stocks thurg potions anyway, that kills the market for anything we could make at present.  Admittedly, it steps on the toes of druids and wizzies with port/TL, but there's already prescendent for such things.<br />
<br />
Illusion potions would be fun.  Yes, it borrows other class abilities (chanters, roues, bards), but these are not game breaking abilities like FD or ress.  Illusions would be limited to playable races or other illusion spells, due to these being global files (not an expert on the mechanics, but it was explained when chanters wanted illusion:froglok, more global files = longer zoning times etc).  If they added faction bonuses, that would be great, but might make them too powerful.  Make them lore to prevent stacking or no drop to limit their usage (ie, shm only).<br />
<br />
Stop making potions that have double and triple restraints.  Most potions have short duration, negative effects AND a prohibitive cost.  This is why no one wants them or wants to make them.<br />
<br />
Make availability the limiting factor in alchemy, as it is in tailoring, not price like almost every other tradeskill.  Require dropped components, not all vendor sold.  Alchemy tools and subquests would be useful in limiting production.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">in a time so long ago I asked for this.  I still want it. <br />
<br />
potions made with alchemy herbs and a rogue poison component.  Cost above gate potions and skill above 170 for trivials.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/shameless bump<br />

OMG, please gimme some form of illusion nome. That's all I want. kk thx la~</div></div><hr />
