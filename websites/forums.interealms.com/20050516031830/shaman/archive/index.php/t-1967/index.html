<br />
For what I know about sneak it is like invis. If a mob can see through invis then they can see through sneak?<br />
<br />
A 50 skill sneak doesn't last long?<br />
<br />
Does your sneak skill effect if a mob can see you?<br />
<br />
Or is the 50 skill just how many times I have to push the button before it activates? And once activated a mob can't see me ever?<br />
<br />
Because shamans have Invis so I don't have a full understanding of why everyone is saying Cats are godly because we have a 50 skill sneak.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember this forum is here to teach people how to play the game better. <br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />

Some info on sneak.<br />
<br />
The skill level is only how reliable it is to turn on and off. What sneak does is when you are not in the 180 degree arc of a monsters view you are always indifferent to it. <br />
<br />
Once it is on even with a 50 skill it is always on. (Moving slowly is a good indication.<br />
<br />
So you can bank with Kill on site bankers, Use invis to get behind them then sneak and drop invis. <br />
<br />
You can be indifferant with almost any Quest giver. (Sometimes doesnt work though on faction based quests)<br />
<br />
You can sneak past many See invis critters if you can approach from the rear quarters.<br />
<br />
You can perform something called a sneak pull. Basicly you can sometimes split a multiple mob pull by having sneak up and Pulling with something that doesnt break sneak. If the mobs are facing away from you then your aggro radius is much much smaller. So a single can come much more often.  (I also used to play Feather Silverthorn, a level 60 thief  on E marr that is where I learned to sneakpull.)<br />
<br />
Is it a gamechanger?  No. But it is something that you can use alot once you figure out how to leverage it to your advantage.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I never knew how much sneak mattered until I retired the monk and play a troll/shaman.  You can vend anywhere with sneak.  Click on sneak, Walk right up behind a mob and they are indifferent.  You can quest anything!  Sneak is pretty much just a cool skill all around. The vending/questing thing brings up more advantages than I can possibly think of.. Can also sneak behind some mobs.  Remember sneaking as a monk from the top down to guard camp with full pops just walking behind everything with no aggro.  Use sneak as a faction changer and not much else.  If something is scowling and you walk behind it with sneak, it will be indifferent.  Not the end all to skills, but it's a pretty good one.<br />
<br />
The possibilities are just immense.. Any quest you have to be indifferent to do, you can do (with a few exceptions of course)<br />
<br />
Monks are doing their final hand in for Whistling fists to Cazic Thule himself by using the sneak skill. (That should put in perspective the usefulness of it.)<br />
<br />
Hope that helps<br />

I thought sneak was just a poor man's invis. And I thought a 50 sneak was even worse. So I never really used it. Now I have been enlighten on the powers of sneak. I will learn to use it.<br />
<br />
I didn't know us kitties had it so good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I love sneak on my monk. It's always frustrating to talk to some NPC who tells you to get lost and not be able to do anything about it (except kill them, but that does no good).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sneak ownz all .. strieght up.<br />
<br />
It's the only way my IKS MNK is nonKoS to many of places.<br />
<br />
Off the top of my head, I personally used sneak to run quests to get nonKoS to SteelWarriors, and them High Elf guards. Without Sneak, that wouldn't have been possiable.<br />
<br />
Never underestimate the power of sneak.<br />
<br />
As stated before, the skill level has nothing to do with it's &quot;Duration&quot;, but rather it's success rate. And once successful, it's always on until you turn it off.</div></div><hr />
