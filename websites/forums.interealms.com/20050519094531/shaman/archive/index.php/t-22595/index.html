<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The new dragon in Dagnor's Cauldren who is for the Zerker Epic quest.  I messed with him last night with my 65 zerker, 65 Shm, and a 65 chanter.<br />
<br />
I was quite surprised at how long I could keep my Shaman alive against him with just Q.  I am sure that a Shaman can solo his guy once you learn him.  He is worthless for loot I guess.  Only drops the Zerker item for the quest but still he has some cool effects during the fight that might make it a worthy fight.<br />
<br />
He is lvl 60<br />
Hits for 471 max<br />
Has a 10 sec mezz called 'Slumber'<br />
1200 dd cold spell<br />
Cant be slowed, rooted/snared, or mezzed.<br />
Procs a spell that makes you drunk.  Need min of 150 AT.<br />
<br />
Runs unagro at 70% and 30% and wont reagro until he gets to his next spot.<br />
<br />
Will most likey be an underwater fight after the first run at 70%.<br />
<br />
Low AC and and I think pretty low HP.  My pet got him to 80% before Prak ate him.<br />
<br />
Remember, killing him might piss off a few Zerkers if they are waiting for him but I think he is a two hour respawn (9pm &quot;in game&quot; I beleive) and despawns the next &quot;in game&quot; morning.<br />
<br />
Just curious if any Time equiped shaman have tried him yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Phroke</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Damn I wish some Shaman on Nameless would decide to learn and kill this guy for the fun of it. hehe My Berserker is waiting on this Dragon.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Spawns every EQ night and despawns every eq morning from what I have seen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well I have a few time items, and I have tried this guy. It was for my friends Zerker epic, and well we didn't read up real well before trying this guy. The first time we tried with a 65 ranger (my boxed alt), 65 shaman (me), 65 chanter, 65 cleric and 46 Zerker. I pulled with ranger and didn't know anything about the ae's or anything. <br />
<br />
First ae went of and he mezzed/stunned me. After I finally got him pulled he ripped through my ranger then killed the cleric immediately. Soon after the enchanter died and I was left alone, so  I thought I would give it a shot.<br />
<br />
Just using Bane, pet, meleeing and healing myself every once in a while, I took him down about 60% of his life. I tried to load Blood of Saryrn a few times for extra dps, but he can't be slowed so he kept closing my book while trying to load.<br />
<br />
I would say the hardest part was trying to find him after he ran. Since my ranger was dead, I couldn't track. I would just swim around spam trying to cast a spell until he was in range.<br />
<br />
His ae's are kinda nasty if not taken care of. One of them is based on your alcohol tolerance level (luckily I was around 190). The ae stun / mez can be countered by using a Crimson Potion, cost around 12 pp and can be bought at the potion vendors all over. This does I think 20 regen but also does 2 damage, so wakes you from mez right away. I didn't know about these potions the first time but they helped us own him easy the second time. Also, his melee proc is cold based, and since I'm a barb shammy the extra resists helped a little. I also used Rabid Bear while solo and that helped. I wasn't getting hit anywhere near max on proc, where as my ranger got hit for max everytime.<br />
<br />
So to sum it up, I'm positive a more prepared shaman that had the right spells up with EP+ gear could solo this guy and just sharing my experience with the ugly leezurd worm thing =p</div></div><hr />

That is one cool spell. I knew there would be a reason I got my AT up. Nothing beats getting drunk on a raid when you've got nothing else to do...  :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe in GoD there is alot more ae's that have to do with stuff such as AT. I know for sure that during our first Smith Rondo event people were complaining about being drunk, but I never noticed the effect hehe. I mostly just got my AT while working on brewing and after I ran out of combine materials. I would sit back, drink as much as I could, go afk for 20 min, rinse and repeat. :)</div></div><hr />
