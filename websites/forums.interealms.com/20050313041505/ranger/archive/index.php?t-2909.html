<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sehnea1912</div><div class="date">05-13-2002, 11:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've had several requests to post this here:<br />
<br />
Ranger down? I think not!<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
 We've all heard it, some of us has joined in the peer pressure to say it, and a few of us despise it.<br />
<br />
/shout RANGER DOWN!<br />
<br />
This same phrase was heard at a Plane of Hate raid on the Torvonnilous server where my ranger, Sehnea, attended in hopes of getting the EverElusive Shattered Emerald of Corruption. This phrase was shouted by Sehnea's guildmate whom she is constantly at war with concerning Rangers vs Warriors.<br />
<br />
Sehnea of course responded (a little hastily) with /rude War_Ogre_01 and thus started the war for the day. He merely replied, &quot;It's true and you know it.. You'll go down fast in this raid.&quot; Being a little on the hot headed side, Sehnea had to make this bet. She challenged the warrior that he would indeed die first.<br />
<br />
Seven groups of people saw the challenge and some even made side bets but yes the race was on to see who would die first.. course neither wanted to lose  <br />
<br />
The first fight went ok, the usual problems with people not assisting and some people died but our two challengers indeed lived through the fight. A long pause while the deceased were rezed and rebuffed then the usual lecture on how to assist the MA (main assist) and so on and so on.. The next couple of pulls came out clean.<br />
<br />
Then once again confusion came about as the MA died when someone broke a mez. No one seemed to remember who the SA (second assist) was and all hell broke loose. It definately looked hopeless especially when the call came for the clerics to camp. Just on a hunch about ten seconds before she died, Sehnea did a /who War_Ogre_01 and saw that he was not in the zone.. She went down with a grin on her face.<br />
<br />
Lo and behold, when she spawned at her bind point, Sehnea realized that War_Ogre_01 was also bound there (Lake Rathe Arena). He laughed and said, &quot;you win&quot;. She graciously bowed then he said, &quot;hows your hand to hand?&quot; /grin<br />
<br />
Now Ogres aren't bright, it's no secret. (no offense to those readin this now  ) Sehnea merely loaded up her spells, buffed herself with her Uber Ranger buffs (laughs) and simply snared him and kited him around the arena.. when he did manage to get close enough to hit her he found a nasty surprise of a 19 point damage shield  <br />
<br />
Finally when he had enough the call came that it was time for rezes.. and Sure enough Sehn was rezed in quickly. For the next hour or two things went well. No more deaths and no more screw ups.... till the last fight.<br />
<br />
They were fighting a revenant and a liche in camp when the puller called out that they had incoming of a spite golem and cleric. The Revenant and the Liche were killed quickly and people waited for the mobs. Btw it is notable that spite golems can't be mezed.<br />
<br />
They got a rude surprise. There were TWO spite golems, FOUR clerics of innoruuk and a Disciple FROM THE SECOND FLOOR!!!  <br />
<br />
At first it seemed that it shouldn't have been a problem.. if the enchanters could mez the clerics and the Disciple, then they would be able to split tank the golems. That's what should have been done.<br />
<br />
The first golem surprisingly went down fast, but the second one wasn't. Sehnea realized that he was being healed! But from what? By switching her view and toggling it seemed that the clerics weren't being mezed and were healing the golem!<br />
<br />
Doing a quick /who enchanter in the zone she found two still standing. Shouting out instructions she screamed at them to mez the clerics and split the disciple and golem. But it was all in vain. It was not long till the enchanters fell to the floor. The call came for the clerics to camp. Determined Sehnea kept at the fight in hopes to take as many down with her as possible.<br />
<br />
Somehow she did get help with the golem and he died. Turning around to start on the disciple it showed that he was indeed dead but that left four clerics. However, she was dismayed to see only two rangers besides herself, a paladin, a monk and a mage left standing. No healers, no enchanters and no tanks. With a deep breathe she plunged into the fight.<br />
<br />
Long ago, the term /assist was burned into her head and the Law was you NEVER hit F8 on a raid. But throwing all rules aside she F8'd the nearest cleric and started hacking. The others followed suit. At first it looked like a losing fight as the one of the other rangers hit the floor. But when the cleric she was fighting fell, she charged in again.<br />
<br />
As Murphy's law, or in this case Verant's Law, would have it her buffs started dropping. Of course the first to go were the cleric buffs.  Still she didn't give up as another cleric fell which left two. The second ranger also fell leaving herself the paladin the monk and the mage.<br />
<br />
By now she somehow got the attention of the two remaining clerics and they turned their full force and Innoruuk's hatred on her. They pounded on her while she took the blows and gave as much damage to them as they her. The third cleric fell.<br />
<br />
The Fourth Cleric had been healing itself. Sehnea was tired, bleeding, and stilling getting beat on. But she continued. She tried jolting the cleric onto the paladin who was behind it but it resisted. She tried again, but again was resisted. Looking at her mana she had 20m left. With a deep breath she cast Call of Flames which cost her the rest of her mana. It hit with full force. The cleric decided at this point that it was outnumbered and ceased fighting. Sehnea did not. Finally with a final slash of her Swiftwind, the cleric fell to the floor.<br />
<br />
Looking around her and panting heavily she surveyed the mess. The only remaining comrades were the Paladin, the Monk and the Mage (who had lost his pet and was oom) Then with a shout she sent forth their victory and clerics logged back in to clean up.<br />
<br />
When everyone was back and the desicion was made to cease the raid, Sehnea in her mischievious mood......<br />
<br />
/shout WARRIOR DOWN!<br />
