But it's fully possible that a Ranger can tank AoW the whole fight and live, here is the proof:<br />
<br />
We fought AoW tonight, the fight wasn't very impressive, a few of the clerics were running oom already when AoW was at 30%, so our MT died, second MT got aggro, and tanked it for a while but died him as well. AoW being at about 5-10% HP people were dying pretty damn quick, so I figured I'd grab aggro and at least tank him for 20 seconds with WS, this is how it went:<br />

Tanked him without WS for 36 seconds, may not sound like much, but also remember this was at a late state of the fight, many of our healers were very LoM, I was amazed I lived that long, awesome work from our healers ;).<br />
<br />
Also worth mentioning is that at the point where I died, I didn't get a heal for 3 seconds, I duno about other guilds but we usually use a 3sec rotation on AoW coupled with small heals from secondary healers, and worth mentioning were that when I died I hadn't gotten a single heal in 3 seconds, so even if I was a warrior I would have most likely died.<br />
<br />
Oh, and we did win the fight, AoW died not long after I bit it.<br />
<br />

<br />
[Fri May 10 07:00:00 2002] Angelie tells the guild, 'aedail tanked well =P'<br />
<br />
For those that are interested, here's the stats I had when I was tanking:<br />
<br />
5971hp - 1290ish AC <br />
Got Natural Durability3, Physical Enhancement, Combat Agility2 and Combat Stability1.<br />
<br />
Prior to this I didn't think it was possible for a Ranger to tank AoW, now I'm certain that a Ranger can ;). <br />

Really nice job.  Longest I have lasted after weaponshield on him is about 20 seconds.  Though the only people /assist healing is druids, shamans and clerics not in the CH rotation.<br />
<br />
My weaponshield on AoW last night isn't quite as impressive other than....I LIVED!  The bard in my group, aka Dekein of the glade here, did group DA at the end of my WS and ol' big and ugly turned to a warrior and finished the fight pounding uselessly on some fat.<br />
<br />
This fight, imo, defines how well weaponshield can save the day.  The best thing is with him, if you use jolting blades (which lands occasionally, though not often enough to put you really low on agro list) all you need to do is watch for him to start eating monks.  Once you see a bunch of monks start becoming one with the earth (starting with their feet and then on with the rest of the body) just have your finger poised above the discipline hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Arbok is right, this was a late state of the fight, alot of rotation clerics were Oom so there was at least one out of rotation cleric chaining CH's, and that's why 2 CH's managed to hit so close to each other :).<br />
<br />

I think it could be very ranger-tankable. Wouldn't that put the warriors into shame? 2nd MT is Ranger_01 .... haha =)<br />
<br />
GJ bro =) <br />
I'm not afraid of him now. IMO, getting doubled for 2400 isnt much if you can time it. AoW is all about keeping clerics with mana in Rot. healing properly, and massive melee damage 'cause the tank is getting the shiat beat outta him =P</div></div><hr />

That would be him, not her ;).<br />

<br />
He triples/quads for 1154, and every once in a while he also flurries, so if he gets lucky he can in theory do 9232 points of damage in between CH's, that's where small heals come in, and pure luck that AoW doesn't get a very good flurry round :). It is possible to die against him even if the rotation is perfect and you get tons of small heals, only a warrior using defensive disc can live through a flurry + 1 round of combat if AoW is lucky enough to get good hits off.<br />

Sinark is right, if you check AoW's hits you can notice he's slashing, which means he's wielding a Blade of Carnage :).<br />

I was the first tank on our server to live tanking the AoW (last tank on the very first kill).  Of course, at that point all of our clerics WERE in fact OOM, so I used WS and he dropped all of 1 second before I would have.<br />
<br />
Standing in front of the AoW is DEFINATELY an invigorating experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We usually keep the tanks alive as long as possible, since AoW can disc out up to 9k damage with one round and a well timed Flurry there might be times where the tank will fall no matter what you do, since he just doesn't have the HP for it. So we just let the tank tank till he drops, and then switch to next tank.<br />
<br />
The kill before this one our tank managed to kill all fight, our first and only flawless fight so far, fought a few of them with 1 tank dying, but that's the only flawless one we've managed to do.<br />

In the 3 times I've seen the Adept he had the axe all 3 times, is the Mosquito Leg Earring common drop? I heard someone say that the diseased mosquito only dropped the Leg Earring, nothing else. Which one is easier to get you'd think? And any idea if the diseased mosquito can spawn from any mosquito in sewers? =).<br />
<br />
You won't be seeing Hoss in NToV much in the future, so you guys can pretty much play around all you want there ;). Stitz was telling me of some 70hp all/all boots dropping from Arch Lich though, sounds like a good alternative to Mithril Boots.<br />

I got an amazingly timed heal that allowed me to click the button but after that it was 20sec of heart pounding him or me battling. He was specs from death when our last tank fell so this was it hehe.<br />

He beat on me but couldn't get through the shields nope.<br />

He died, I lived. Credit goes to the Cleric that gave me that extra 2 sec,  but if i had died it would have been clerics an casters next and we all know how that goes hehe.</div></div><hr />
