<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ruoroni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">There are alot of changes people want for the shaman class... Aside from scaling in power along with other classes so that they don't become more powerful than us at our own game (e.g. BLs) I only want 1 thing. Forage.<br />
It doesn't have to be as good as druids and rangers considering we are more focused on perfection of spirit and self rather than interaction with nature...but we still infuse ppl with the essence of beasts (from a lore standpoint) so why not? <br />
Our class specific tradeskill uses alot of foraged items so it would be really useful without being over balancing...just a thought i guess, wondering if anyone else felt the same way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't want to Forage. I want a &quot;Find Herb&quot; ability.<br />
<br />
Someone mentioned it in another thread not too long ago, and I like it. My idea: set a &quot;herb&quot; table for each zone, like the forage table. There should be common things for each zone (herb versions of water, vegetables, roots ... just really common crap herbs), but for folks with higher Find Herb ability, there should be access to things like Storm Cloud, etc. <br />
<br />
I think SOE should either give us better access to things we need for our class-specific ability, or remove foraged components entirely from the alchemy recipe lists, increase the number of vendor purchased herbs, and increase the drop rate of other herbs. We shouldn't need &quot;forage bots&quot; to get this stuff.<br />
<br />
Seeing Storm Cloud for sale at 3kpp in the bazaar is just disgusting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yet another reason to be an Iksar  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yet another reason to be an Iksar  :p<br />
<br />
Last I knew, Iksar had a skill cap of 50 on their forage, and I've never had an Iksar tell me their forage ability did them any good. Whether or not that skill cap has been changed, I don't know. I don't play an Iksar.<br />
<br />
That logic doesn't make much sense to me, anyway. If all shaman can be Alchemists, why does only one race have the ability to forage? From a lore standpoint, can you not picture a Barbarian out in the snow, pushing handfuls of it aside to expose tiny green herbs? <br />
<br />
Alchemists of all races should be able to find their own herbs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ikky forage is nothing like ranger/druid forage. Maybe 1 out of 7 or 8 forages do you scrounge something up, and then it is usually a goddamn berry. Find herb ability would be super for a Shaman, if it matched or came close to curren max ranger/druid forage. The reuse time is so slow that even then it won't be nearly as good as vendor diving. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hint* Kill the druid wench in lavastorm to reset her inventory.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Iksar forage is basically useless since it fails so frequently. The only time it has some use is if, for some reason, you have run out of food or water, then any successfull forage will be food or water. That is usefull only to the non-shaman classes though, since shaman can summon those things.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not true...Iksar have the innate ability to forage 'special' items in any zone...its been that way since kunark was relased becasue so many of the quests in Cabilis required foraged items. Granted, it doesnt work as often as I might like becasue of the 50 cap, but I've foraged all kinds of stuff in pretty much every zone ive been in. Better than nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I don't think you all understand how much alchemy stuff iksars forage in DoN. On a good long day I can forage 2 bags full of alchemy crap. Iksar forage is not crap, it works all the time. I'm constantly getting things foraged and passing them out to other guild shamans that aren't iksars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Keeping in mind that not all the foraged stuff is for alchemy, you are saying that you forage 400 items a day? Assuming a 50:50 hit on an alchemy item, and a 1 in 8 success rate, that makes 6400 foraging attempts. How long is the refresh for foraging? 30 seconds or something like that. In other words you do about 53 hours of foraging a day, typically :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ruoroni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I like the find herb ability...i like it alot. Not just something to sit and think about how nice it would be to have it...This one is worth implementing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ruoroni,<br />
<br />
Please go peruse the alchemy section and read the terror that haveing to deal with foraged components has caused.  I honestly don't see Find Herb as any different.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Reuse is longer than any 30 seconds for sure. Freakin ranger and planar fruits.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You take my exaggerations too literally. I don't mean full stacks for sure, usually only one of each of maybe 8 or 9 different things from DoN. Exaggeration makes my numbers look better. I'm just saying it's enough to keep me afloat without having to whine and cry like you all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Enough to keep you afloat, huh? So you're 300 skill?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">By afloat I mean that I don't do alchemy, I give the stuff I forage to other shamans that do. Actually, I don't play anymore, not sure why I'm posting about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So, as someone that doesn't do Alchemy, it's your opinion that Alchemy is just fine.  Who needs druids to keep the class down, when we have such champions as these?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I did alchemy for quite some time while I played. I think I had around 210/215. I just didn't start doing DoN stuff because I didn't have the plat or time to go to 300.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You got to 210 or 215 before they raised the cap from 200? Or do you mean with an Orb or something? Umbracite Swarm Orb could have gotten your base skill of 200 to an effective skill of 230, but it would still have shown as 200 in your skills window. Right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">There was that bug for a short time, that let people go past the 200 cap for awhile, but I thought they reset those folks back to 200?<br />

&gt; I don't want to Forage. I want a &quot;Find Herb&quot; ability. <br />
&gt;<br />
<br />
I want a spell I can cast on DogDog that makes him smell out roots and herbs and dig um up for me.  When he finds something and is not busy attacking a mob, then giove me a popup trade window to accept the item.<br />
<br />
Just kidding, but would be kwellies.<br />
<br />
I don't want a forge button to push continually or an ability that I can tie to another keyboard function.  I don't like having stuff always popping on my cursor when I'm trying to switch out my root pants for elementals or my procing hammer for my TA.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Just /autoinventory<br />
<br />
Put Forage on left arrow and autoinventory on right. Or make one hotkey in which case you will need /doability # for forage.</div></div><hr />

Anyway I was wondering... are the foraged alchemy items used in ANYTHING else? If not I just don't get this...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It is from an old D and D monster manual or a maybe from an issue of Dragon magazine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Shamylamy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">No I mean I did some of those 255 trivial potions for a while when I found out the skill cap was raised. I just mean I didn't use the DoN foraged components for making potions, I used the luclin stuff. I got to like 215 or something and then quit cause it was costing too much.</div></div><hr />

Those fellows also show their sunny faces on the really classic &quot;Lord Soth's Ride&quot; picture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, once I voiced the connection to my fellow gamers, we were never able to look at her without having to choke back a violent outburst of laughter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I collect stamps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Eew. On purpose?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>KB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Started years and years ago. Baseball cards and comics too. The cards got too diluted for me. The comics jut aint got the same luster. So now its stamps, usually only old ones unless I really like something, and old books. Love my Kahlil Gibrahn collection and have some first edition Poe and have a 125 year old huge Divine Comedy hardback. Have a ton, but mostly just cause I like author/book, not that many real collectables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Ganrin-DRo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">My main is a 68 ranger with 200skill at forage. I have her forage hotkey setup as follows: line 1 /doability #,  line 2 /autoinventory, line 3 /autoinventory, line 4 /autoinventory, line 5 /autoinventory. I then have this hotkey tied to my forward and right turn arrows in option - keyboard - macros. My ranger has the second tier of advanced forage aas for rangers/druids so about 30% of the time I forage 2 items. The extra /autoinventory lines in the hotkey guarantee that all items are inventoried even with a little lag, if I only had 2 lines a lot of the time an item would be left on my cursor after the hotkey fired. <br />
<br />
I really only use my forage hotkey in DoN, usually if I know im going to DoN for the night ill clear out about 40 slots in my packs. Typically ill end the night with 5-10 each of 20-30 alchemy/baking/brewing forages, 20 or so each of 5 or so food forages(common forages vs baking tradeskill rares). The biggest problem I have with DoN forages is that the higher level zones dont seem to have a better forage rate on the more desireable/higher level items, for example I might get 1 mature silkworm in an hour in Broodlands or in The Ascent. With the huge forage tables in DoN it takes forever to build up a stock of any specific item.</div></div><hr />

Witch doctors and herbalists in traditional culture are not the same thing. Herbalists deal with herbal medicine, while witch doctors deal with magical medicine. Sort of like pharmacists and physicians ;)</div></div><hr />

Ok rephrase: A an alchemist should be able to find his own components. Otherwise it would be like buying a  model kit pre-assembled :)</div></div><hr />
