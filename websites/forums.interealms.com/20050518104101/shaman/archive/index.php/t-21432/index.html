<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tvarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have trolled these boards for many months but never posted. A couple of Shaman friends of mine suggested I post how I successfully main heal Hard LDoNs with a 65 group.  This thread is not meant to be pro or con to the threads of “shaman upgrades” so please don’t hijack it for that purpose.<br />
<br />
Perspective: I group with a core group of 4 people that make this work. We can add just about any other 2 classes and be successful 91% of the time to date. I have as of this writing 300+ LDoN victories. I and the folks I group with are not uber equiped. Most of us have a couple pieces of VT gear and some LDoN gear. I will post my magelo. The core group is a 65 Pally, 65 ENC, 65 RNG, and me a 65 Shammy. I only have one level of healing adept and the Pally has maxed his mitigation AAs. We normally do RUJ or MIRs for reasons I will explain later.<br />
<br />
Spell line up is thus: Tnarg’s, Q, Bane, Canni, Velium Strike, Turgur’s, Tigir’s, BoSaryn.<br />
<br />
Normal pull:<br />
I watch the Group ToT Health of the puller to ensure I am not canni IV/V when he acquires a target.<br />
RNG pulls with snare and has pull msg. <br />
I immediately cast Q on the Pally and watch for adds coming down the long halls of RUJ or MIRs<br />
The ENC Tash and Slows the incoming mob while the Pally is chain stunning for agro.<br />
If it’s a single pull and I have time I will cast Bane at this point while counting to myself how long Q will last. Everyone else is in damage mode. Don’t forget your puppy.<br />
If it is a multiple pull the Pally always takes the first mob to reach the pull spot, I immediately slow the Pally’s mob while the ENC locks down the adds and slows them. <br />
Once mobs are locked down and slowed it is Tnarg’s Mending to patch heal the Q on the Pally, Q on anyone that needs heal, Canni IV, extra dot, Vel strike, or Canni V depending on at what health the mob is, your mana, other party members health, etc (that’s the art of being a shaman)<br />
<br />
In a normal Hard LDoN the pally will group heal about one time and have to use his LoH about every 3rd dungeon we do. Occasionally we do loose folks but have a pally for rez and overall it is fun and rewarding to do Hard LDoNs at 65 as the main healer.<br />
<br />
If you have questions I would be happy to try and answer them.</div></div><hr />

Now we are talking about doing Gates runs with me as the MH...we'll see how that goes :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>izmalis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Could you please post the AC/hp of the pally? My 1500 AC/6.8k sk got raped w/ a core group of:<br />

65 shaman<br />
65 enchanter<br />
65 wizard<br />
<br />
My shaman was so woefully underpowered for healing in LDoN hards that I scrapped my shaman to reroll as a cleric so we'd have better healing and a rezzer.  Congrats to you on your success though, that's very impressive considering the limitations of shaman healing.<br />
<br />
Edit: just looked at your magelo and it looks like your shaman buffs out to more hps than my sk.  If your paladin is geared similarly I can now see how you were able to heal so easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No to sound critical, but I notice you are on FV server.  Considering that 95% of your equipment would be No Drop on any other server, and require at least small raids to attain, its not real accurate to state that you are only averagely equipped.  If the same is true for your other 3 comrades and the 2 adds, then I can easily understand why you can handle hards.  You have the IDEAL core group in a chanter for CC &amp; Slows, Ranger (200+AA if anything like you) for DPS, and a Chain Stunning Pally for tanking.  You said that occassionally the Pally has to LoH, and that once per dungeon casts a group heal.  And yet you still occassionally have deaths.  here's the kicker...Could you imagine how trivial those same hards would be if your group replaced you with a Cleric or Druid.  You provide nothing to the group that a cleric wouldnt provide and you have to work 4 times harder to provide it.  And the Druid has the capability to provide legit DPS in addition to the healing.  <br />
<br />
Thats the imbalance problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hey Tvarr,<br />
<br />
     No offense Tvarr, but you make it seem, well, easy. I've been main healer in Plane of Earth before (seriously), and I managed to get the job done, however, it is a struggle like you wouldn't believe. Usually people expect you to slow as well, which is *possible*. Mind you, I've noticed a few things when main healing in any challenging zone:<br />
<br />
1.) If I'm slower/main healer, mobs MUST be malosed on inc, and slowed in the first few rounds. Otherwise tank takes to much damage and Tnarg loop begins.<br />
<br />
2.) I'm casting ALOT, this means I cannot move, I lose alot of mana regen with canni, and fizzles hurt alot when they occur (anyone else noticed increase fizzles over the last few months?)<br />
<br />
3.) Add(s) almost insure a good chance of tank dying. Alot of time is needed for a fresh malos &amp; slow when the mob is beating on the offtank, not to mention heals for them as well.<br />
<br />
4.) Any Non Main Tank only gets Q healing when I'm able to throw one. This time comes when the puller is pulling usually. Tnargs only if they are getting beat on and chance dying.<br />
<br />
5.) Did I mention that I'm casting ALOT? Usually heals because our heals are minute? I frown everytime I cast Kragg's (the efficiency is crucial when main healing since I can't regen mana as normal) and it heals 15-20% of the tank's hp. <br />
<br />
Why must it be extra hard to main heal in anything that's challenging (read semi-entertaining/fun)? Did we not sign on as a &quot;Battle priest&quot;? I want to be able to heal well, not heal best. Am I a reliable slower? 5% seems to say I'm the best, so yeah. Am I a reliable buffer? 2nd best thing we're known for, diminishing returns as progression happens, but yeah, I'm a damn good buffer when they can matter. Am I a reliable healer? The honest answer is..it depends on if we'll be challenged in anyway.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'm tired, like many of you, of waiting on a cleric or druid to pop to do anything with a group. I just want to do my job, and no, a lvl 51 spell is not what I do.<br />

P.S. Sorry for ending up in an age old rant, the train of thought kinda ended up there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Please, people.  He didn't post a message saying that shamans don't need improvements, or that we're overpowered.  He simply gave some very specific strategies that allow him and his group to succeed in a difficult situation.  Please don't jump all over his post as another opportunity to bemoan the state of the shaman class.  I can find that in every other post on this board anymore.  It's gotten to the point where I rarely visit this board - the negativity is just overwhelming.<br />

For my part, thanks for the tips.  These kinds of posts at least convey some useful strategies and information.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have been able to successfully function in normal LDON as main healer and main slower (at the time I had two levels of Healing Gift, but no Healing Adept) with no problems, but never attempted a hard LDON as main healer. Now that I am HA2 and HG3, I've been itching to try it. I do pretty well as slower in hards, but only if I malos-malosinia-slow, or have an enchanter Tash before I slow. I also backup heal, since the cleric I group with (65 with around 80 AA, IIRC) has her hands full with the tank ... Q on the support people and Tnargs on the tank for splash heals here and there. It works out pretty well.<br />
<br />
My problem with main healing a hard is that I cannot seem to find an enchanter who is willing to take slow duty while I'm busy healing. I don't honestly think I could handle main healing a hard in addition to slowing. :/ Thoughts on doing both?<br />

<br />
With all the AA's, flags and gear, saying that you are L65 means nothing.  A newly dinged 65 Shaman in no way compares to a high AA Time flagged Shaman.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, LDoN hard gives the same mobs to both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok Indalecio got carried away a bit ;), but he provided some useful points from his playing experience aswell. No need to be so thin-skinned and block every kind of discussion. There was next to no 'negativity' in that thread.<br />
<br />
That being said, i appreciated Tvarrs post as it had some nice tips to 'play around' some of the shaman weak points and still do challenging content under certain, specific circumstances (atleast that's my interpretation :) ).<br />
<br />
But i would be interested in the pallys HPs/AC aswell. In my experience the tanks durability is probably the core factor for hard LDoN besides good healing and CC coordination.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Tordail,<br />
<br />
     I find trouble in main healing and slowing in addition because of the aggro that doing both generates. I've gained the attention of a few mobs by doing one to many patch heals on a mob that was just slowed. <br />
<br />
A few general tips on Main healing as a Shaman in Earth:<br />
<br />
1.) Q the tank when you hear the inc message from the puller. This gives you enough time for the following.<br />
<br />
2.) Click Malos madly so that it starts casting the millisecond the mob gets in range. Extended Range/Hasted spells obviously hugely beneficial here.<br />
<br />
3.) Usually the mob has just reached the tank by the time Malos lands. Naturally. Click turgur's maddly until it starts to cast.<br />
<br />
4.) This is where your knowledge of the tank comes into play. By now slow has landed, if it is resisted, you will want to use your best judgement as whether to toss a heal then try to reslow, or let the tank soak the damage and repair it when slow has landed. Regardless, slowing the mob is high high proiroity, as healing on an unslowed mob is very difficult at best for us.<br />
<br />
5.) Assuming slow lands on the first try, a decent tank will probably have taken a good 2 or 3 rounds from the mob and be between 65-80% life. Now, here's the trick...<br />
<br />
6.) Do not use Tnargs unless you must! Dust of Kragg's (yeah, I said it), mem that sucker and use it now! Yes, you will be alternating casts of Q and Kragg's. Try to keep Q up and on the tank through the duration of the fight. Kragg's casting time is forever, but has the benefit of being the second most efficient heal we have. You should be able to push the tank's life back up to 80-100% by the time the mob is 1/2 dead. <br />
<br />
7.) If the tank is near full health, you should consider casting Kragg's unless you need to canni (and you probably will want to squeeze some staggering in these moments), or now is the time to cann5 and Q yourself while the tank can take a few good rounds without your attention. Q the rest of the team as needed.<br />
<br />
- Remember, your mission is to keep everyone alive, capping people off to full health is only reserved for the tank, conserving mana is key. If the puller is taking damage getting the mobs to you, consider Qing him/her before they set out for the next mob. <br />
<br />
- The group will always think you are &quot;gtg&quot; since you're a shaman, inform them of your status after every 2 mobs or so, sometimes an extra 5 seconds of canning can mean the difference if you ask your puller to not run off so fast for that next mob.<br />
<br />
- Chain pulling is hard to heal for as a Shaman, you're going to be needing that incoming time for prep and debuffing. Make sure your puller doesn't think he has to impress the group or anything.<br />
<br />
- If you think your group will get regular adds occasionally (can't be helped sometimes), or if the puller is inexperienced with the mobs/zone/etc. Don't go for maximum cycle on cann5, use it as your emergency reserves, go ahead and cycle it if you're above 60% mana to get it to you faster, you should be ok for a few mobs.<br />
<br />
-Instruct your group to make a big effort to ghetto mez adds if no chanter is present. Root, VP are equalivalent to 100% slow, make sure you and your group make use of that.<br />
<br />
That's what I have to offer of the top of my head. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tvarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes I am on FV and ALL my gear is dropable. I got all of it on raids except Legs, Helm, and all rings/earings which were purchased. I do not want to misrepresent anything. I did not say my gear was average I merely stated it was not uber where uber = elemental and Time gear. You will note my weapon and shield and a few other decidedly none uber pieces. Yes my 3 partners are similarly geared as stated above and with about 130AA each.<br />
<br />
When the pally uses LoH, his group heal, or a death arises it has always been thus far the result of a pull of 5 or more. Could a CLR have helped in that situation? Maybe but most times the person that dies goes down extremely fast. I have been in groups with CLR where same deaths accured for the same reasons.<br />
<br />
Again this thread is not supposed to be about balance. What I provide to a group is decent DPS with my dots and puppy, the ability to main heal, the ability to slow, the ability to buff, the ability to cc to a degree with root, and the ability to get the group moving fast even after a huge mana drain pull with the use of canni. The folks I group with would rather have me than alot of CLR's for those reasons and because I actually pay attention (you have all played with folks that didn't). Do I cast alot? You bet I do. Is it a challenge? Yes it is. I don't want to play when it is no longer a challenge. Again, please please no more class balance issues. I was asked to provide information on how (I) do it.<br />
<br />
I would be VERY interested on how the rest of you do Hard LDoNs.<br />
<br />
As for the Pally I know he has 8K HP (I will find out AC and post) when we hit the dungeon. I am normally aroudn 6100HP (6450 ish Raid buffed).<br />
<br />
Can slow and main heal be done? I have done it for short stretches when someone was LD and you shift to pick up the slack. Malos/Tash is key and a Tank that can take a few hits. You will drain your mana fast tho and communication with the puller is very key. Again lets here from some other folks on how they do it. Thats what interests me ;)<br />
<br />
Edit: Inda thanks for the tips there. I hope to be in Earth sometime in the next couple of months. I never thought of using Kragg's as the cast time is so dang long but I may have to give it another shot. The only spell haste item I have is a Wicked Bone Atala that I am almost embarrassed to equip but might have to for Kraggs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The rest of us avoid being a main healer in LDoN hards.  It's a fool proof way to avoid wiping.<br />
<br />
No one here is saying it is impossible, merely that the factors surrounding it must be so strictly controlled that it's extremely unlikely they will ever be fulfilled.<br />
<br />
I don't think there is a Shaman here who wouldn't appreciate being able to MH for an LDoN hard, but point of fact is that right now it isn't reasonable to expect that.<br />
<br />
Now, whether it *should* be reasonable to expect is an entirely different matter and highly related to class balance.  I think most would say that yes, it would be reasonable to expect a Shaman to MH an LDoN hard.</div></div><hr />

So we did a normal and I picked my head up off the keyboard several times.  They really need a medium setting.<br />
Thx for the info, Tvarr.  Ill be referring to this when I get the spine to try and MH one (and the suicidal crowd willing to let me practice :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Indalecio Galronte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Tvarr,<br />
 <br />
     It's ok not to use Kragg's in LDoN's as you are constantly moving. It's just mana efficient. Earth has plain old static camps, so you can park at a camp and not move until you need to. The only reason I've ever moved while Healing in an Earth group is because of a rooted mob trying to crack my skull. Intrestingly enough, the conditions that led to me even attempt healing:<br />
<br />
-Grinding in Earth, typical group make up.<br />
-Cleric LD's, 5 mins later still no show<br />
-LFG shows no Clerics/Druids LFG, /w all 65 Cleric &amp; Druid reports everyone in places where they would be grouped.<br />
-Main Tank asks &quot;if I can heal for acouple to ding his AA and log&quot; =)<br />
-I reluctantly agree, awaiting that pally rez that was sure to come<br />
-Rogue picked up last spot in group about 35 minutes later with me as Main healer. Tank seems to forget about logging after that AA ding. Proceeds to ding about 2.5 more before group splits for the night/morning.<br />
<br />
     It's always nice to be able to rise to the occasion. Do note that I'm leaving out numerous messy group wipe stories when something went even slightly wrong.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Indalecio, thanks. Suffice to say I printed your post for my reference and am also going to cross it to my guild's shaman on our private forum. Great information ... some of it commonsensical, but still, great information. I generally have tried to avoid using Kragg's because of the long cast time, but I have QB3 and an Atlatl (yeah, I know, the Spell Haste IV aug is on the purchase list) plus most of the healing AA under archetype ... so perhaps it's time to blow the dust off, eh?<br />
<br />
Sudedor, I don't know what you mean by &quot;the rest of us.&quot; There is no fool-proof way to avoid wiping, IMO, the best groups do it. Sometimes things just go wrong. If Indalecio can main heal in Earth (having never been there, I would imagine the mobs there hit on par with, or slightly harder than, hard LDON mobs, eh?) I don't see why it's not possible to do so in hard LDON. <br />
<br />
Inda did mention agro issues with doing both slowing and healing, though, and in an environment where mobs hit for 900 (I don't live long, even with 6k+ HP buffed fully) that's definitely a problem. Do you suppose that problem, LDON wise, could be solved by mezzing ... have the mob pulled in, mezzed long enough to be debuffed and slowed, have the tank taunt like mad, break mezz, and commence healing?<br />
<br />
Of course, that'd be a touch hairy on an overpull, but if you have, say, a bard AND an enchanter, it might could work. Thoughts?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I can be the (only) healer and slower in any type of normal LDoN group unless they're just suicidal and/or grossly incompetent.<br />

I've handled heals on hards when the cleric was low or there was an LD but I wouldn't want to do it for an entire run.  If I had that kind of gear, fellows with that kind of gear, and a regular crew with that type of makeup I imagine I could pull it off but I'm still not sure I'd want to.</div></div><hr />

Basicly they have a great core group with people that all know dungeons well (300+ all of em) and work together verry well.  Basicaly it goes to show you that a shaman played well with others that know thier own classes well can do it with out to much difficulty even if they are not ep+ geared.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm not sure I agree on using KM.<br />
<br />
Initially it looks pretty good. 1950hps healed for 400 mana or about 5hps per mana vs 1300hps healed for 450 mana or ~3 hps per mana but that changes as you get better gear/aa's.<br />
<br />
Lets look at things with maxed aa's now and good focuses.<br />
<br />
Kraggs is now healing for 2320 and can't crit and isn't focused by Improved healing focuses. Mana cost is ~300 mana after specialization and SCM. We'll call it 7.7 hps per mana.<br />
<br />
For Tnarg's is healing for an average of 1677 and criting for over 3k. For mana cost you get the 25% from spec and SCM plus an additional ~5% from a normal mana pres item so about 315mana. Ends up being about 5.3 hps per mana. A bit closer than the unfocused situations.<br />
<br />
Taking it up to elemental focus's improves things more. Kraggs doesn't change at all but tnargs does. Tnargs now healing for an average of 1710hps for about 300 mana. That pushes it up to 5.7 hps per mana. Obviously still behind kraggs but closing the gap.<br />
<br />
Keep pushing it for better imp healing focuses and mana pres focuses and the gap keeps closing. With best current focuses you'd heal for an average of 1840hps and mana cost of 292 pushing it upto 6.3.<br />
<br />
Also if your tank has enough hps for it to be safe you can let him drop enough for you to crit for almost double the hps on tnargs. That should average out to about a 20% improvement in amount healed. That puts the elemental shaman at about 2010hps healed averaging out that crit and about 6.7 hps per mana. Fully focused it's 2150hps for 292 or 7.3 hps per mana.<br />
<br />
When you start factoring cast time and spell casting hastes it's enough to make tnargs the prefered option IMO. With your cast time below 3 seconds on tnargs vs 10 seconds on krags the difference in mana cost can easily be covered by more time to cann for mana. For efficiency I'll use Q or breath of trushar which can get into the teens for hps healed per mana.<br />
<br />
If your lucky enough to have Daluda's Mending it's even better since it starts off a little bit more efficient anyway ~3.2 hps per mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I am not sure what this is proving. <br />
<br />
The Shaman in this group isn't slowing, the Enchanter is. <br />
<br />
So Shaman heals are balanced around slows, but Shamans can handle heals, *if* they have another slower taking over their main job(on top of a Paladin tank which basically could solo heal himself on a slowed mob without too much hassle)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Right Giac, and the key really is the Paladin.  <br />
<br />
Well, him and the enchanter.  The group composition is a big deal.  <br />
<br />
The shaman is just acting as a bad healer and the group would be a lot better off (kill faster/less risk) with a druid or cleric instead of the shaman.  <br />
<br />
No offense, and I don't want to be perceived as wallowing in negativity but it is not hard to do this, simply slow and inefficient.  Really slow and really inefficient.</div></div><hr />

So maybe that doesn't really count. But I did it. Once. :p</div></div><hr />

I've healed in Kod'Taz for 10 minute or so stretches while the cleric's been AFK and not had a tank die yet, but it's pretty draining on the mana (I didn't have KEI, I don't own a horse). SCM3, Mana pres, an improved healing item, maxed healing adept/gift really make a difference, but I think the main thing is having Nihil, as it lets you slow without wasting time casting Malos in lots of situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am reguarly the main healer in PoE/PoF groups...as long as you have a decent puller you should never really have to worry about adds. I even duo from time to time with a warrior guildy of mine in PoF, though to be honest its not really all that time effective...we just do it in hopes that a sap will drop.<br />
<br />
As far as Kraggs goes...I havent cast that spell since the day I got Tnargs</div></div><hr />

<br />
     Just to comment on why I use Kragg's; given my current progression with AA's and gear, Kragg's at the very least feels more efficient. Granted, as you progress in the gear and AA it will begin to become not nearly as great as a pimped-out Tnarg's can be, however I'm just not at that point where I can say Tnarg's is simply a clear cut superior spell. Take a look at my magelo so you can compare the strategies I employ with my current progression. hope that clears some stuff up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have been backup healer many times in LDON hards....30 or so of them so far. Of those times, I have had several adventures where the cleric went LD and I ended up being MH till they returned or until the adventure ended....to be honest, all tactics aside it really is not all that gear dependant or AA dependant, at least not for the shaman in question. It is dependant on the skill/gear/AA of his tank and puller/CC.<br />
The very first time I did a hard the cleric went LD...this was in the first month of LDONs release, so everyone was ultra paranoid about them, so we had &quot;the perfect group&quot; with a bard pulling, I had MAYBE 50 AA, certainly no healing AA, and I didnt have a healing Foci. I just Q'd the tank and Tnargs' after slowing....it was just my luck that the tank had 2kish Ac and was at 10k+ Hp with max defensive AA.<br />
These days, I am not all that concerned with perfect groups do LDON hards with 2 rangers as CC, 2 wizards as CC, me as MH, etc...trust is a main factor..IE if I see &quot;Uber Guild 001&quot; over their name, I am less concerned, but I still am wary....if its someone that I have done lots of LDONs with, the regardless of guild, I am willing to try anything.<br />
If you know your group, trust their skills as well as your own, then thats all you really need. The tank being uber geared/AAd dont hurt either :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I have been main healer/slower on a hard ldon. I don't know that I'd like to do it without a TA though, for mana and recast time reasons. A good agro tank and a good bard/enchanter can make this possible.<br />
<br />
A paladin is the ideal tank in this situation because of their agro, buffs and heals. Their heals, LoH and rezzes can save a tricky situation.<br />
<br />
Because of gear improvements, LDoN hards are getting easier, but I still wouldn't do one without a group I trust.</div></div><hr />

       Yes the key is the paladin ,but not because they have heal or buff or aggro well ,just because they can chain stun. Stun &gt;&gt;&gt; tnarg</div></div><hr />

I've handled heals on hards when the cleric was low or there was an LD but I wouldn't want to do it for an entire run.  <br />
/agree w/ both.<br />
<br />
I think I *could* do it (what I lack in gear compared to Tvarr I think is somewhat made up for w/ aa's), but I wouldn't want to on a regular basis.  I much prefer main slow duty and backup healer for the ench when pet breaks charm w/ mobs in camp.<br />
<br />
A high-end skilled pally makes any adventure (easy or hard) much easier.  A good puller does the same.  Ditto a good enchanter.  But honestly, unless the shaman is BAD, the differences between the dps of a good or a great shaman are minimal if the rest of the group is good, because where our skill is shown is when things go bad.  A good core group won't have things go bad very often.  Gear &amp; AA's will mean more than any advanced skills for the shaman.<br />
<br />
I've main healed about half a hard before because the cleric kept going LD.  It was challenging, and the only thing making it bearable was that the puller was being careful to bring singles so I had time between mobs to canni my butt off to get mana.  Even so, several times I had to make the group wait 30 seconds to a minute while I chewed.  We won, but I was sweating the whole time, many times the only thing keeping the Tnarg's chain workable was a lucky crit heal (max'd healing aa's).<br />
<br />
Compare that to a hard where a druid or cleric is present for healing and there are few if any pauses and things go smooth as silk.<br />
<br />
I agree a core group of skilled &amp; experienced players w/ the right composition probalby has more to do with this than anything else.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, thanks for posting Tvarr.  Nice to see someone thinking outside the box and not afraid to try what most of us are reluctant to do.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I used to use Kraggs too occasionally and Tnargs when the situation was more dire. A more consistent 1900 heal for 400 mana was more efficient. However, now that Tnarg heals 1500 is it?, its probably much more worth it to use Tnargs with the crits and everything, and the improved healing focuses and aa.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Tnarg's also allows you to cannibalize about 1.5 times before Kragg's finishes casting. As soon as you get more the basic focuses they are very similar in efficiency, with Tnarg's winning in the emergency and range departments.</div></div><hr />

It will be harder but not by much. Getting slow in early will be more important and the shadowknight should probably chain lifetap if you have trouble keeping him alive. But the difference is not all that big.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Hi ,<br />
Great post and some good Advise there ! In my personal opinion I think that a shaman in fact CAN heal in a HARD LDoN IF they are <br />
a . Functioning with a core group of friends they know and trust .<br />
b . Have and ENCHANTER or at least a BARD ... I would like too hear strats on pulling with off without godly CC .<br />
c . Everyone has at least &quot;respectable&quot; gear .<br />
<br />
If the above 3 arent in place I think youd have a harder time .<br />
Too be an effective healer you must be balanced against a &quot;typical&quot; situation in the content you are examining .. you cant use the perfect sencrio as a balance test ...<br />
So while i think you post has little grouds too shaman balance .. I do think it posted some really intresting tactics and I enjoyed the read .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Tvarr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">1. I have not talked to the Pally yet to get his AC<br />
<br />
2. I am not so sure that its more time efficient or safer (in our group) to have a CLR or DRU along instead of SHM. We normally take about 60 mins to complete a hard LDoN. Same with a CLR, which we pick up when ever available because it IS safer to have 2 healers in group. Shammys gain their mana back ALOT faster than a CLR after a nasty pull where quick heals are being thrown around like coppers. The deaths we do get are from over pulls that having a CLR along most times wouldn't help.<br />
<br />
**Another aspect of having SHM heal (at least the way I do it) as opposed to a CLR or DRU is that for them to be efficient they use their CHeals alot and thus alow the tank to get low in health. If the mob gets a lucky turn when tanks health is low and quads plus a riposte or gets nuked from an add you loose your tank in a hurry waiting for that 10 second heal. The way I heal a hard LDoN the HoT goes on and as soon as the tank gets to 80 percent I am patching with fast heals and try not to let them get below 55 ever.<br />
<br />
3. We also do Hard LDoNs with a 8700HP War with BoC weapons with anger augs and do just as well. The only difference is I tend to not use Poison dot (too much agro) when she tanks but instead use DD once or twice a fight in addition to Bane depending on mana. This seems to even out because the warrior does more dmg than a chain stunning Pally.<br />
<br />
4. We also occasionally do Hard LDoN with a SK that is not as well geared as us. When he tanks he holds agro as well as Pally if he knows when I am double dotting (bane and poison). It is much more a challenge to heal him than the pally or the warrior tho and thus I do alot less DMG.<br />
<br />
5.<br />
<br />
b . Have and ENCHANTER or at least a BARD ... I would like too hear strats on pulling with off without godly CC  .<br />
We have done this but it is NOT pretty. We have done Hard 65s with me healing with no ENC or Bard. <br />
- I always have root up in this case.<br />
- The Ranger pulls with root if adds are predictable.<br />
- Ranger gets everyone that can root to pre-target mobs.<br />
- Only reason to try this is if you have high DPS group so kill VERY fast.<br />
* other nice things to have in this situation is a BST to help with slows and off tanking with pet.<br />
* might be interesting to try this in Tak with a MAG using their CC on the elementals (We have a MAG that groups with us alot I think we will try this soon and I will report back *grins)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ummm...you're not making sense here, it seems to me.<br />
<br />
People are saying it would be more efficient to have a cleric or druid REPLACE you, not supplement you.  You agree and in the same sentence say that a cleric/druid supplementing you doesn't make things any faster.  They are not talking about supplementing you -- but REPLACING you.<br />
<br />
Your use of the word &quot;instead&quot; doesn't seem to make any sense in the quote above.<br />
<br />
Replacing you with either a druid or a cleric would  be more efficient.  Not supplementing you.  If they wanted to supplement you, they should supplement your arse out the door, for all you bring to a group once it already has an enchanter.<br />
<br />
Btw I've healed hard LDON's for short(ish) stretches, like many other shamans have, and been both slower AND only healer.  But, you need near perfect pulling for that particular scenario.  If there were someone else slowing, it would be very helpful.  <br />
<br />
But either way, it's not particularly pleasant, and it is very dangerous if you're both the only slower and the only healer.  One resisted slow and the death cycle begins.<br />
<br />
Having a pally along makes a huge difference.  Those stuns give you a lot longer time to get a slow to stick and get a heal in, and eliminate DPS at the same time.  Plus pally heals really add up pretty quickly, if you need to resort to those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Reading though I hear people report Tnargs healing for something other than 1300, when doing so please mention the AA's and focus items which are effecting it if you could.<br />
<br />
Tvarr,  Keep the atlat in the bag, it won't speed up Kraggs, nothing will.  Nothing effects Kraggs, it is what it is.  And your reason for your useing Tnarrgs is a good one, seen clerics loose plenty of tanks due to those lucky hits.<br />
<br />
Definatly seems the main response on this, besides giving really nice healing strategy is that it is possible for a shaman to heal a hard when your well equipped and its not just some pick up group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Kanati</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Great work, Tvarr. My congratulations to you. Rubitt, is correct, the greatest advantage that Tvarr had going into this dungeon was not his gear. He and his guild are some of the greatest dungeon crawlers I know.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Guys, I've done Hards as Main Healer, it really isn't as hard as you think. I use a slightly different group makeup, but it works well.<br />
<br />
Pally, Pally, Bard, Shaman, DPS, DPS.<br />
<br />
Bard most always pulls 3 max and can mezz. With 2 pallies, you have plenty of time to slow. I do NOT use Malos. Hardly ever use anything but Q. When I do use something else it would be Tnarggs once per mob. Mana isn't an issue, Healing isn't an issue, damage isn't an issue, healing isn't an issue. It really is pretty easy.<br />
<br />
I think that the key to my success is a) Good Bard for pulling/mez b) 2 pallies for stuns/Group Heals and 2 LOH if things go bad.<br />
<br />
I haven't done too many of these, but I still have 0 losses for hards and my Equipment isn't that good. First time I did it, had about 3200 unbuffed HP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">2 Paladins and a bard and they need you why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Yep.  I agree that stun &gt;&gt;&gt; tnargs.  It's the stuns and the CC that make it work. <br />
<br />
Pally's level 64 (Quellious' Word of Serenity) 10 second stun mitigates the use of Kragg's.<br />
<br />
I don't ever use Kragg's, because the 10s casting time is a killer, and I'd rather be landing a dot, cripple or canni'ing.<br />
<br />
Tvarr's success is not based on healing alone, but based on several things: everyone knows their roles well, experience playing together, trust/faith in others, and one more thing he never mentioned:  DO NOT PANIC.<br />

<br />
Nice write up though Tvarr!<br />
<br />
Average is so hard to define. Obviously zones you have access to has a big effect. For an elementally flagged shaman 6400hps raid buffed and ft15 is pretty easy to come by and probably still using some old gear. Augments make a difference too. What and how many augments you have can make a big difference. Getting 40hps augments in all 5 slots they can go in is 200hps difference. Throw in some 20/20 or dropped augments and that can easily be several hundred hps difference.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm at about ~7600 hps raid buffed with a fair bit of elemental currently but still wearing some vt stuff and no time gear. I'd put Tvarr a bit above average since he has several Vex thall peices, an emp drop and even and elemental drop that would normally be no drop other servers. I'd guess he's vt flagged which is still something your average shaman probable isn't but it's possible those are all just tradable on his server and he bought them.</div></div><hr />
