<p>OK...I'm gonna head to TT this weekend because I really really need a haste item - and that damn frenzied ghoul can kiss my ranger butt :P<br />
<br />
I've never hunted in TT, so let me make sure I understand this. I need to kill foragers and/or hunters to get the rare guys to spawn - including the Hangman? I understand he's around 50 or so and that groups are pretty much nonexistant in TT usually. Hrm...being unguilded can certainly suck sometimes. Any of you rangers on The Rathe looking for something to do this weekend? <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Well, the Forager is the cycle you want for the noose...<br />
<br />
If you park yourself at the lake in TT you can easily track him and pulll him to there.  Id recomend a FULL group at 49 to try it.  The Forager alone has *at least* 6khps and hits fairly hard, you could MAYBE kite and kill him solo.....but no way youll be able to take the rares if they spawn.<br />
<br />
As soon as "a Froglok Forager" is killed, either another Forager pops immediately or one of the rares.  Youll prolly have to kill the forager at least about 10 times to see 1 rare, if not more.<br />
<br />
Good luck to yas <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Also about the groups in TT being non existant, pretty much true....cause normally a druid or bard is soloing the Forager cycle <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>As an adendum to what Juneau said, I would strongly recommend not attempting this without a full group.  While some of the mobs may be soloable, this cycle has to be done quickly because the pops are instant.  You CANNOT sit and med after killing a forager because a rare (especially a good one) will not stay up for long.  You simply have to be able to pull this with very little downtime.  <br />
<br />
Set your tracking to /tracksort normal and every new MOB will be at the top.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Nod</b></p>

<p>As was already mentioned, spawned times are instant.<br />
Sometimes they will pop very close to camp (assuming you're at the lake/river merge area, or at the cave near Swamp zone), your group will have close to 0 downtime.<br />
<br />
If you luck out, and have an open zone...and feel capable of pulling both forager and hunters, then you'll most definitely have 0 downtime.<br />
<br />
My suggestions to you.....if you don't have epic, or a shaman or chanter to slow these mobs... grab a fear-capable class.<br />
Snare / fear OWNS pretty much anything in TT, and if you start in the Swamp zone cave, they don't go too far out.<br />
<br />
Hells, at 58, I can duo either cycle with a bard <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
Good luck on drops though....  some stuff to watch for on forager cycle :<br />
Hangman - drops Noose<br />
Crusader Zoglic - drops the Iksar regen bp (I think this is the guy)<br />
<br />
Some other decent drops on here, but those would be the ones of interest to you I would imagine <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""></p>

<p>Wowza...thanks for the info everyone. I'm hoping to get a Hangman's Noose cuz I really need some haste. <br />
<br />
If anybody on Rathe wants to jump on gimme a yell in-game. I already have my shammie buddy lined up and I'll try to track down other friends when I get home from work <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

This weekend's mission: Hangman's Noose, Level 50 & Mermaid Hair to finish my Raincaller...not too much to ask huh? <img src="images/smilies/wink.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Still more info on the cycle in Trak for ya <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
If you get there with group in tow and there's no one working the cycle as of yet, like was mentioned, probably hands down the best place to set up is at the waterfall where the stream from Swamp of No Hope dumps into the lake in the middle of the zone.  Once you've gotten on top of the cycle, anything that spawns on either cycle will almost always pop within say a 15 second run from where you'll have set up shop.<br />
<br />
Almost was the operative word there though.  Even at 200 tracking you'll periodically drop a forager and refresh track and see nothing.  When/if that happens, just run south along the western shore of the lake to the far end.  When you get to the south side and can see the aquaducts, refresh track again and the mob should be on your list from down there; it's just too far south to track from where you've set up camp.  They'll typically be somewhere about midway between the graveyard there before Emperor Ganak and the wall there where you head in to go to Sebilis.  If no one was working the cycle, this is almost positively where something is going to be; they just wander down that way given enough time alive.  They also seem to spawn there maybe once every half hour or hour or so, just to keep you from getting into too much of a groove.  Just drag it up clear across the zone for one pull and from there it's smooth sailing for a good while.  The first one's a riot though, you get to thread your pull through all kinds of stuff that runs at SoW.<br />
<br />
Speaking of SoW, if you get a Hangman to pop, don't even worry about pausing to make sure it's with you still like you'll have to on most things on the cycle.  It *will* be right on you, it's just as fast as you are.  Have fun <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>Doing the cycle is good, cuz there is lots of good loot out there, but if you are just looking for haste item, 16% is probably the lowest you can get.....I'd rather camp the fbss despite losing the 5 ac. fbss is 20%.<br />
<br />
I used to camp it either by EJ zone or just south out of the cave to Swamp of No hope.  I also camped it halfway down the river...No close route of escape, but just about in the middle of the zone....and no wanderers.....right where the stream dumps into the lake<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Yeah Alarcon...been there, done that, got the T-Shirt AND the mug. <br />
<br />
Spent days in the FG group in LGuk. Over that period saw 6 FBSS' drop total. I never won a roll. Hence my decision to go for the Hangman's. After all, 16% haste is better than 0% haste, which is what I currently have.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I'm wondering if anyone has ever done the TT hunter/forager cycle for xp. Considering that it is an instant spawn and everything is lvl 45-50, xp should be decent. I've got a 54 ranger and 54 cleric duo looking for a new xp spot and was wondering if this would work. I even could get a shaman to help with slows/haste without wanting in for the xp. So has anyone done the TT cycle for xp?<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>There is absolutely no shame in the noose.  In fact, many people will say they would take it over the FBSS.  4% difference equate to 4% difference in damage.  If you do 1000 points of damage per minute, then we are talking on the scale of around 40 points of damage difference here.  For this reason, the 5AC on the noose becomes very attractive.  <br />
<br />
Plus, as Odile said, getting the FBSS is not an easy task.  I've yet to pull in TT for more than 5 or 6 hours and not see a noose.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>The cycle is, at least to me, just *so* much more entertaining than a camp in Lower Guk.  At least as far as a Ranger's role is concerned anyway, it's hard to beat.  You'll track, you'll hunt, you'll pull, you'll fight, you'll buff, you'll snare and root adds (*cough* not that we ever make adds on our pulls *cough*), you'll talk smack about how amazing your pulling skills are and never let on that there are two trakanasaurs, a sabertooth and a froglok shaman somewhere back there rooted and hopefully far enough that they're going to forget about you.<br />
<br />
You'll use a greater portion of your skills all at once there than you're likely to use anywhere else, ever. To me and the way I play, this outweighs whatever marginal percentage increase in damage output I'd see out of a FBSS.  The experience for any appreciable period of time spent at it is respectable, maybe not stellar, but something you won't be disappointed in (I can vouch for as far as 52).  It's fun getting the rares, too.  Comparing it to a long camp somewhere at a static spawn, it's nice to be able to walk away several hours later knowing your group got a noose, a regen breastplate, maybe a silken cat fur girdle, an iksar mask; there are all kinds of things to walk away with.  Oh yeah, and one more nice thing about the noose- even if it almost certainly means taking an AC hit, I like having the flexibility of being able to move it to your head.  Final note:  The first time you pull Doom and live to tell about it is a RUSH! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p><b> </b></p>

<p>Hehe yeah realistically he's not all that bad.  My first run in with him though went, well, poorly.  I was 38 =P  Just out exploring the zone and pulling stuff.<br />
<br />
Me: There's a red skellie walking around and it's named Doom<br />
Group: GET IT!!<br />
Me: Um...<br />
Group: You wuss, get it!!!<br />
Me: Inc!<br />
<br />
*crunchy sounds*<br />
LOADING, PLEASE WAIT...<br />
<br />
I lasted for about 4 seconds of getting stunned and smashed to little morsels.  It went through the next few people to try to pull it, too.  Man it was fun though!  Doom's a level 55 Iksar skellie.  If you can land a snare on him to bring him in, groovy.  If not, with SoW and lev on you've got a fair chance at surviving to bring him in.  He's faster than SoW (I think cheetah speed) on level ground, but you'll pull away from him when you coast off hilltops and he has to stick to the terrain.  If all goes well you'll gain ground, lose it, and gain a little more on the next hill and live to get back to the group.<br />
<br />
A group of high 40s and low 50s shouldn't have too much trouble with him, it's just the getting him there part that's so much fun <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />

<p>Doom is one of the rares on the Hunter cycle.  He's a lvl 55 skeleton who runs at SoW speed.<br />
<br />
Just to add my 2cp on the Hunter/Forager cycle.  You'll have a blast pulling there.  Everything Jeryn said is true.  <br />
<br />
Before you go to TT, get a lot of bat wings, with the hills in TT levitate is your friend.  If the cycle isn't camped when you arrive, start off with /tracksort consider.  The Hunter, Forager or rare will be at the top of your list since they are the highest level mobs in TT.  It has also been my experience that the rares seem to come in surges.  Sometimes you'll kill a forager and get 2-3 rares, other times you'll see 15 foragers in a row.  So, be a little patient.  The exp isn't the best in the world but with a good group you can get 1 yellow bubble every 90 minutes.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I have dug up an old post i have made some time ago. <br />
So this is a repost. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
I just like to say that I REALLY hate the Frenzy camp. Hate rolling against casters there to farm it, KSers, ninja looters and of course people who go "wow I won! *loots* Well, now that I have the FBSS...cya!"<br />
<br />
Aslo not everyone can afford (or HAVE for that matter) 6-8kpps to buy  a FBSS, besides, the Forager camp = loot for both casters and meles. <br />
<br />
Bring a 40ish -low 50s group here and you'll have fun. Both the Forager, the Hunter and the rares are all xp to lvl 60s so they are still good xp wise. And Rangers come into thier own here. NO one is going to outpull any good ranger on the job here! <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> (also one of the reasons why I love TT)<br />
<br />
<br />
so here's my old list : <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
<br />
<br />
Trak's Teeth Rare Cycle. <br />
<br />
<br />
The Forager's Cycle: <br />
<br />
These are the possible drops from the Forager's cycle and the mobs I have had so far. Its by no means complete as I have NO idea if we have had everything. (part of the fun I guess) <br />
Do this camp by the Swamp of No Hope / Trak's Teeth zone. <br />
<br />
Bloodeye (Trakanasaurus Hide Armor) <br />
Champion Arlek (Knobbed Warclub) <br />
Champion Thenrin (Ghostly Robes) <br />
Commander Sils (drop spells rarely) <br />
Crusader Zolgic (Iksar Ceremonial BP) <br />
Dragontail (drop spells rarely) <br />
Dreadlord Fanrik (Grim Pauldrons) <br />
Flayhte - froglok (no drop/spells) <br />
Hangman (Hangman's Noose) <----THIS is the one you want! <br />
Harbinger Dronik (Iksar Hide Mask) <br />
Keeper Lasnik (Lasnik’s Staff) <br />
Klok Denris (Korzanz Kit’loukl – SK only helmet) <br />
Partisan Yinlen (drop spells rarely) <br />
Silvermane (Sabertooth Amulet) <br />
Squire Glick (Gleaming Short Sword) <br />
Thruke - froglok (drop spells rarely) <br />
Titail Sinok (Meditative Blanket) <<---- Casters go Gaga!<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hunter's cycle: <br />
<br />
Again by no means complete...mostly because we never really spent that much time on it. <br />
Those that has (no drop = nothing dropped from it) <br />
Don't mess with Doom if you are not prepared for him. <br />
<br />
Doom (no drop...this is a lvl 55 mob btw) <br />
Dreadlord Dekir  (drop spells rarely)<br />
Ebon Lotus (Ropey Tendril) <br />
Ffroaak - (drop spells rarely) <br />
Harbinger Josk (drop spells rarely) <br />
Heirophant Ixtl (drop spells rarely) <br />
Keeper Sepsis (drop spells rarely) <br />
Oracle Friskill (drop spells rarely) <br />

<p>Silvarian, are you sure Sigra is on the Hunter cycle? I could have sworn we've gotten him when we pulled only foragers all night... And nobody was pulling hunters, either.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Sigra popped for us on the forager cycle as well. I thanked her kindly for the belt <img src="images/smilies/biggrin.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>Just an add on Doom.<br />
He too has a rare chance of dropping spells.Only killed him 2 times first time he dropped the druid spell Frost for us.<br />
Err i think thats the name of it ,whatever the highest level druid cold based DD is.Second time around nada.<br />
Should go without saying but if you pull him dont do anything silly like dump an arrow into him.Use snare or cacel magic.<br />
Doubtful if you would just happen to score enough of a crit then to activate him to summon but ya never know.<br />

<p>Hmnnss that's odd.<br />
Sigra had always popped for me when I do hunters <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><br />
Hence I always thought that he was from the Hunters cycle. <br />
<br />
Hmnss...better yet, do both!<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b> Speaking of a fbss</b></p>

<p>Starting a Kerran warrior when Luclin comes so I was interested in knowing if the frenzied ghoul in lower guk was do'able by a lvl 58 ranger w/epics and with a monderate ac of 1079 ( with lvl 50 cleric buffs on) AND  a level 50 cleric which I have on a second account?<br />
<br />
               I can duel solo ( with my cleric) up to lvl 48 giants in Kael before things get risky. And my thinking that most old world mobs are alot easier then mobs of the same level on Kunark/Velious. So, is it do'able? Has anyone within my level range tried it? Let's hear them stories!<br />
<br />
You're input is appeciated!<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

<p>Actaully Doom (like any summoning mob) has a chance to start summoning once ANY damage is done, I found out the hard way.<br />
<br />
(Pulled him with an arrow, did a whole 2 points of damage got summoned 5 times on the pull made it back to camp with 5 hps when the Pally saved my ass with LoH)<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>I am aware of 7 possible forager spawn spots in TT. 6 of them can be tracked from the camp where the river dumps into the lake. Nothing paths through this camp. This is the ultimate forager camp.<br />
<br />
/tracksort normal (So new spawns are at the top of the list)<br />
/trackfilter green (Because nothing important is going to be green to you on either cycle)<br />
<br />
Pull the forager to the campspot by the lake, snare it, and then have someone fear it. This minimizes healing mana used and keeps the group running longer. The mob will path back along the river away from the camp/lake. If he gets too far, run back to camp ahead of him when fear breaks and then re-fear him.<br />
<br />
For all named stuff, just assume it's a caster. Not all are, of course, but several are wizards and can hurt you badly. Make sure you, as puller, have MR buffs and gear on.<br />
<br />
If you kill a forager or named and nothing shows on your tracking list from this spot at the lake then the mob spawned at the last spot he can. This is far to the south towards Sebilis. The fastest way to pick him up is to run south along the lakeshore all the way to where the aquaduct rises from the lake. Track from here, moving south, until you find the forager or his named.<br />
<br />
Using the above campsite, the above techniques, and a full group, we can do 15 to 20 foragers / named mobs per hour. In a 3 hour sessions you will see, on average 6 to 8 named pops if you are killing at this rate. (Figure about 3 minutes for the ranger to pull it in, group kill, and then ranger heads out again.) With two rangers pulling, you can increase that to 30 kills per hour if you can get two forager cycles running concurrently.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p><b><img src="images/icons/icon9.gif" alt="Unhappy" width="15" height="15" border="0"> Destined to be un-hasted</b></p>

<p>I'm really beginning to think I have angered the gods of haste in EQ. <br />
<br />
I spent Fri, Sat & Sun in Trak's Teeth. Didn't see the Hangman once. I pulled hundreds of Foragers - plenty of med blankets, spells, a cat fur girdle, shaman neckpiece - but not 1 damn Hangman. As hard as it is to scrounge up a group there the sucker could at least show up once!<br />
<br />
However, only 1 bub away from 50 <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>

<p>While trying to get Seb keys we spawned and killed the Hangman, course no one needed haste so it got looted and banked, lol.<FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><br>
