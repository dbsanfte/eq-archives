<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lvl 45..almost 46..I havn't started any of my epic yet..im just wondering when, if at all, the quest items start to become Trivial?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Trivial?  never.  At 65, I could easily solo Black Dire, but the Tear will take a raid, The Hole at least one group of 65's and CoM 1.5 Groups of 65's.<br />
<br />
However, when's a good time to start?  Right now.  You can get all the way up to Black Dire solo, and get him with a group at your level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yunkor Guk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Woot! great...that was always a problem with other epics I tried...freakin Trival..ok..thx for the help</div></div><hr />

I think at least CoM would be trivial with less.  It was trivial a few days ago with:<br />
<br />
65 Warrior<br />
63 Mage<br />
62 Bard<br />
60 Cleric (me on my friend's account)<br />
51 Shaman<br />
<br />
Warrior was well equipped... didn't really heal much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think Yunkor is on FV and means when will the epic items not drop because he is too high of a level (trivial loot code).<br />
<br />
I am not sure if they excluded things like Black Dire's pelt from the trivial code.  Knowing verant....I'd get cracking :P</div></div><hr />
