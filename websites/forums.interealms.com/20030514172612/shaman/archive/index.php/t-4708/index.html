<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>wackosr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The slaves are level 45, same spawn time as every other mob in Nurga, max hit is 117 min hit is 36, about 4500hps.  Immune to magic fire and cold based spells.  Not sure on poison or disease.  All of the slaves are like this.  Its really annoying when you agro one that you didnt mean to.</div></div><hr />
