<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For us shammies that aren't able to do PoV (not enough guild support as they're all tier 3 and tactics addicts), what would be a soloable place to polish off 59? I'm 42% into it so far, but only because guild has had two &quot;days off&quot; from raiding so I've had a chance to exp with them. I've been thinking about deep Nurga, possibly Grieg's End or The Deep... any ideas? If I have to spend one more lonely night in PoJ I'm going to go insane.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lilce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">yup, in the same boat basicly and like you if I kill another mob in poj I am going to scream.  I quit around 8 months ago and alas 90% of the people I knew are not playing anymore or don't play much.  So I am riding solo trying to lvl up.  No one is ever in any of the teir 1 planes anymore, pon/pod/poi use to be packed...not anymore. Maybe it is LDoN, I donno but it is frustrating sometimes.  Oh well, hope  it will get better at 60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>EQScott</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Pick up groups in PoV is the way to go, especially if you want to get out and meet new people.<br />
<br />
For variety:<br />
<br />
Shrooms in FG are ok if you can get them broken because you'll have a hard time getting singles at 59.  They spend a lot of their time casting disease based spells so they hardly do damage if your DR is 140ish buffed.  A small percentage of them run, so keep root up.<br />
<br />
Katta used to be good exp, but I thought that &quot;city&quot; exp was nerfed a while back.  It's about as mind numbing as PoJ though.<br />
<br />
You can do Sol B LDC's, the exp is ok but still slow.<br />
<br />
If I were you though, I'd just grind it out in PoV pickup groups.  It's the least painful way to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Volotani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I always forget to note that I'm on Vallon Zek, and I'm one of the few remaining pure-teamers on the server. Pickup groups aren't really an option =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Havs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One method to get through the evil that is 58 and 59?  LDoN.  I've been in Everfrost, NRo, and BB so far.  Took 2 adventures to finish 58, and 2 more to get me a full yellow into 59 this weekend.<br />
<br />
Ok, I realize not everyone will be able to do this, but it is nonetheless a viable alternative to the Planes.  At 58 you can (obviously) group with 65's and be actually effective.<br />
<br />
The comment I heard more than once from some 65 Clerics in groups was &quot;OMG this is sooo much easier on me with you slowing...&quot;  It really isn't that much different than any other LDoN.  Yes, there are more resists but not too bad...DogDog is kinda worthless other than as a DoT with legs (what else is new)...Some may have a harder time finding a group on different servers, etc, etc.<br />
<br />
My point is, for xp and some verra nice loot, give it a shot.  If nothing else, try it on weekday evenings when less people are playing...It might get you a foot in the door, so to speak with some of the 65 crowd.<br />
