<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well Vox gave us headaches, esp with KoF trying to CR their bind rushing 50 man half in the bar pits force there, but we brought her down.   Basically, we were killing her so fast that she kept CHing every time before the enchanters could wipe out her mana.  We, however persevered and I am done playing with that lizard for a while.<br />
<br />
Special Thanks to my homies in KotE who came out and made this all possible:  Tempin,  Mawafu, Acies, Maliin, Cid, and the rest.<br />
<br />
Loots were not spectacular but they were acceptable:<br />
<br />
Guantlets of Firey Might- KOTE<br />
Guantlets of Fiery Might- Jezebelle (WHo is this loot whore anyhow?)<br />
Nag Bag-  KOTE<br />
Red Scale-  Obor<br />
Vox Bag- KOTE<br />
Vox Bag- Xendax<br />
Paladork Book-  Wickett<br />
Staff of Forbidden Rites- Corps for emergency CR tool<br />
White Scale-  Mitzey<br />
<br />
<br />
Last item is of particular note because she is now ready to engage the fake trakanon and I would like some assistance (Corps is not powerful enough to engage such a mob on its own) when and if it is convenient for you to provide it.<br />
<br />
Once again, thanks all.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mitzey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I just wanted to add my thanks to Jice's.  I really appreciate KotE's assistance with Vox and that White Scale - i cant wait to finish up trak and get to try out that fancy sword - if anyone ever needs assistance with anything and needs a bard just give me a tell :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I had a great time doing both Naggy and Vox in one night! Poor Maliin died 5 times but with the 56 rezzes provided by Quyrean it hardly hurt at all. Jice/Jez did a great job of organizing everyone and getting buffs done quickly. Thanks to the high level Corps that hung around to buff/rez/kill big stuff. If my services are needed in the future just let me know. :)</div></div><hr />
