<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eximius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Some argue Stinging Worts are overpowered because of recent Vox Nagafen solo by 52 MA Technoe. (See power of alchemy thread below). Do you believe these potions (300 hp buff, instant click, declines over time, acts as 300 hp instant heal) are overpowering? Are there other instant heals that should be nerfed if stinging worts are nerfed? Do the cost of balm leaves and limited sources of ice giant toes make this tactic limited enough to not be overpowering or require nerfing? How many potions do you have stored?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think whoever 'says' they soloed Vox and Naggy using potions alone is full of it, and that this thread is nothing but a troll post.  Nerf alchemy?  Like it's not completely useless already .. now go bother someone on the mage boards =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't know who's saying that SW potions are overpowered, but this is nonsense.  <br />
<br />
1.  I doubt that the dragons were really killed simply through the use of SW potions.  And if not, then you have to take into account the level 65 AC and HP and Stat and resistance and ATK and haste buffs the monk had on him (notice he hit F10 before he took his screen shot and then pasted the /who on later)<br />
<br />
2.  Think of the time and expense required to make that many SW potions.  Toes drop off of what, one out of five giants?  That plus the 35PP per potion mean that this won't ever change the game.  Manastone was nerfed because it changed the game.  Monk damage mitigation was nerfed because it made them too powerful......   Nerfs happen because the developers see something as a threat to game balance/gameplay.  There's no way that a one-time-event (if it even happened that way) constitutes a game balance issue.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ROTFL, yeah, nerf alchemy, that will fix it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Title says it all. I don't have the link here but look at the bugger's magelo. I believe he probably managed it. He has enough resists unbuffed to shake off most of their ae and more ac/hp gear than many 65th monks are likely to see in a lifetime.  Assume he was buffed before going in I can see it happening. <br />
<br />
The stinging wort potions are balanced out by the tediousness of gathering the toes and the cost of the herb. All in a fire and forget one shot dose. If anything they should look into making the other potions half as usefull in their particular contexts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A buddy of mine actually tried this on Xev only he used a lvl 52 dwarf warrior and had about 11 other people helping as back up.  Failed miserably...<br />
<br />
Granted the warrior was no where near as twinked as the monk but he still had some good stuff like a CoF etc.  Used like 35 potions or so but was not able to beat CH.  <br />
<br />
Anyways I beleive it could possibly be done if you used like 60 or so 10 stack potions (180k hps or so of healing) and used some serious DS (potions, spell possibly effect) but to what end?  Even using an exploit to recharge them would be insanely expensive and probably result in a break even scenario for farming.  And if you failed you would be out a luck for the whole amount.  I just do not see it being worth the time to nerf and thats assumeing it happened which is not a given.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From the log he posted he used something like 27 charges of the stinging wort, far short of the 600 that you suguested.<br />
<br />
He freely admits he was buffed out with standard high lvl buffs (Fo7, Virtue, Seasons etc). He also had 52? point ds up from shaman ds potion and Chardok quest ring. He also from his magelo profile had several clicky items to protect his buffs and the click monk epic for a buffs.<br />
<br />
The monk was pretty well equipe altho almost exclusively tradeable guild.<br />
<br />
Vox and nagafen definitely aren't what they used to be. As long as you had your resists up high enough to resist the ae reasonable and the fear it shouldn't be too hard to solo nagafen as a melee.<br />
<br />
Did your dorf friend have any ds? The ds on the fight ended up doing like 1/3 of the damage done in the log he posted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You're kidding, right?  Some people actually think alchemy is overpowered?<br />
<br />
Holy cats, that's funny.  They can nerf it, removed it, invert it, color it purple and give it to halflings for all I care.  <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No, its twinking thats inherently overpowered.<br />
<br />
30 something pp to heal the damage from one blow in PoP seems expensive if anything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tobasko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The Monk used FIFTY SEVEN (57) charges of Stinging wart and ten(10) charges of Prayer of Life.  He also used a weapon that proc'd a 400pt group heal.  Parsing of the log showed that he healed himself for over 21000 HPs over the course of the fight while Vox did just over 25000 pts of damage to him.  Add in his Iksar Regen and it looks like he was never really in danger at all.  <br />
<br />
This wasn't so much a demonstration of the power of Alchemy, as a demonstration of the power of a skilled and dedicated player.  <br />
<br />
<br />
I can't find where it is written, but I got the impression from the thread that this wasn't the first time that he had done this.  It was just the first time he had told anyone outside his guild.</div></div><hr />

The Log is on page two and is broken up into thee sections (due to message length limitations I suppose). <br />

Have at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to be picky, but it was four lights and he was being told to see five.<br />
=)<br />
<br />
Oh, and this is also quite obvious that both monks and alchemy need to be nerfed.<br />
<br />
....<br />
<br />
Yes, that was sarcasm.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">What is the cast time on SW potions? Zero? So they can't be interrupted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Correct, zero cast time, so you can go through a stack of 10 as fast as you can press the button.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>modrodgod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Yesh, nerf them, give them 0.75 cast or therabouts. Can still be cast between swings of mob, but you can't just blindly spam click.<br />
<br />
I would still buy these potions for the dot effect. 2 hp per tick breaks mez. Very good potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">yeah someone who calls themselves modrodgod is asking for a nerf of shaman potions .. a little bitter mr cleric man? =P</div></div><hr />
