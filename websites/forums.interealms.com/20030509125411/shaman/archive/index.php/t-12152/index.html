<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">While *cough* PLing my SK, I figured that I wouldn't be able to use Q on him until level 46. So finally I get him to level 46 and head over to PoN. Pull a spider, go to hit him with Q and I get &quot;too powerful for your intended target&quot;.<br />
<br />
So does anyone know what the minimum level is for being able to Q someone? Is anyone else a bit shocked by this?<br />
<br />
I belong to a consortium of guilds for raiding. I have and will go on raids in the future with low level folks on occasion. Whether it be to help with fear and hate breaks or whatever. And I can't heal them with Q.<br />
<br />
As a level 46 SK, he can be Tranquiled and Virtued. So I'm guessing that the minimum level for 65 spells is higher than for pre-65 spells, like it is for level 60 and pre-60 spells. But in looking over the level 65 spells in PoP, this really only effects shaman and no other class (Q and Feral Avatar). All other major buffs that are level 65 spells are group spells, so they dont matter.<br />
<br />
Am I the only one that thinks that all spells should land on anyone that is level 46 or greater, because that is the minimum &quot;raiding&quot; level? And I'm not just saying this so I can PL my SK easier...for me, it just means I use Kraggs for a couple more levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had to camp out or wait for the next save form my JBB to work for me when I dinged 45.  Right after I dinged, it still would not let me cast it.  I camped out and when I came in it worked like a charm.  I dont know if that has anything to do with your case.  I seem to recall a min lvl of 47 for PoP spells.  I have a 48 Monk and I can buff him with PoP spells fine.  I havent used Q on him since I dont have it yet, so I cant tell you if it works on a lvl 48. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I guess I'll be able to figure it out soon enough as I level my SK. But the more I think about this, the crazier it seems. For instance, I could in theory actually group with my SK and both of us would get XP, but yet I can't use all my spells on him?? *boggle*<br />
<br />
What is SOE thinking?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're PLing him, I'm sure he'll hit 47, 48, 49 in no time. Then you can tell us what level Quiescence takes hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">As far as I know, the level limit on buffs post 50 is a set number of levels going back from the level of the buff.  IE you can cast Enduring Breath on a lower level toon then Focus of Spirit and you can cast Focus of Souls on a lower level person than Q.  Groups buffs are cast on anyone in the group, allowing a level one toon to get c5, HoV, and Fo7, etc.  I seem to remember c2 (lvl 54 buff) requiring level 42, if that gives you any reference (don't normally pay attention to it and that instance was a long time ago so don't quote me on it :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It's not always that way.  For example..Boon of Garou is a level 44 enchanter spell.  It can only be cast on level 44 and higher characters which is REALLY annoying as my enchanter hasn't been able to use it in any normal experience group yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">PotN sticks fine on 46s.  I'd guess it's some weird thing where you have to zone first to get it to stick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tauran, update sig much? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Did you zone/camp in between your SK hitting 46 and you casting  Quiescence? I know that if a character levels and you do a /who on them immediately afterwards, their level will not be updated until you zone or camp. Perhaps the same bug (If it is a bug) that causes this to happen is what stopped you from casting  Quiescence on your SK.<br />
<br />
Just a theory...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Did you zone/camp in between your SK hitting 46 and you casting  Quiescence?<br />
<br />
Yes, in fact, I tried Sunday night for the first time after dinging 46 and it didn't work. Then, I tried after logging in this morning and no go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes, in fact, I tried Sunday night for the first time after dinging 46 and it didn't work. Then, I tried after logging in this morning and no go.<br />

D'oh! Well, so much for that idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This thread got me thinking so I decided to go out and test it.  I ran around pok, nexus, and bazaar looking for mid 40's people and casting buffs on them.  At Level 47, all buffs land.  At 45, only buffs below 62 land (ie FoSouls was &quot;too powerful&quot; but 61 Agi landed).  At 44, 61 agi didnt land and neither did 60 buffs like focus of spirit, but 58 group agi landed (out of group /tgb).  At 43, 57 and below worked but 58 did not.  At 40, only my 51 buffs (shadoo and levitation) landed but I didnt get a chance to test a 52 buff (he ran off before I could load it up :/)<br />
So generally it depends on level of the buff but there are some exceptions. <br />
<br />
PS: Sciek I fixed my sig =x</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tauran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Pot9 is a level 63 buff, so I would expect it to land on a 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">So Tauran, I should expect to be able to Q people 47 or higher. Thanks.<br />
<br />
I wish I knew how SOE thinks of this stuff. 47 seems so arbitrary. Why not 46 which is the level requirement for the Planes?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">before PoP, your spell can only cast on those con blue to spell's lvl, like lvl60 focus can only cast on blue con(lvl45 and higher)<br />
<br />
for PoP, the con rule is change and not sure how it work now, but I guess lvl65(5 level higher than lvl60) spell can only cast on lvl50 and higher ? the con rule don't work anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I know that if a character levels and you do a /who on them immediately afterwards, their level will not be updated until you zone or camp.<br />
<br />
Actually, if you are in the same zone you will see their level immediately with the /who command. It's just the global /who all command that takes a while to update.<br />
<br />
There is a level range for 50+ spells, depending on the level difference between the target and the level of the spell. When I was leveling up my warrior, he was able to get exp with me at level 40 or 41 (main was 60 at the time), but I couldnt cast level 60 spells on him. I could however cast some other 50+ spells, but nothing over level 58.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'm about 90% sure Q works on 47 and up.  Also, if you ding and want people to be able to see what level you are out of zone just anon or role and then take it off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Also, if you ding and want people to be able to see what level you are out of zone just anon or role and then take it off.<br />
<br />
Cool, never tried that. Thanks for the tip.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I am positive Q works on lvl 47.  <br />
<br />
Stoicism works pre that.  If you really don't mind the effects.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The magic number is 47<br />
<br />
I can tell you from first hand experience that you cannot cast our single target lvl 65 spells on lower level chars until they hit lvl 47. I also noticed that now that I am lvl 65, I cannot cast lvl 60 spells on people unless they are lvl 46 where it used to be lvl 45 (I think..)<br />
<br />
However, even at lvl 1 you CAN cast our very best spells on pets. Noting says uber like a lvl 9 SK with a ferine avatared, focused, hasted skelly pet. I PL'd the crap out of my SK this way. Now that she is high enough I can cast all my spells on her. Get your second char to lvl 47 and you'll be set.<br />
