<br />
If it works for you great. As an iksar I walk around with 75 cha. No problem landing slows. <br />
<br />
You might want to try search also. The topic has come up quite a few times in the past with the general consensus being it doesn't affect any of our spells (except charm).</div></div><hr />

How many tests did you do?<br />
You were testing against the same target every time to ensure the mob had the same level and resist stats, right?<br />
<br />
I thought not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Also, I think my mighty 45 charisma is testament to how much charisma is necessary for the shaman to survive.  I don't have any problems with resists.</div></div><hr />

I can explain it.  It doesn't.</div></div><hr />

Oops, hello kettle ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">How many days you do this? If i play one day and dont get much in the way of resists i log in the next same place same mobs and i'll get some nasty bounces in a row. This is with changing nothing and nothing from nothing proves me nothing soooo..ummm what were we talking about again??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Enchanter slow messages just stick out more, because they are more rare (Enchanters seldom slow with Shaman present). You are getting used to Shaman slow messages, so you just dont realize how many there are per raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
See, easy explanation right there! :)</div></div><hr />

anecdotal BS proves nothing and it never will...thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Its an evil conspiracy by the JC out there to get us to buy cha gear.  Well it wont work.<br />
<br />
I can get my cha up to 150 or so and it makes no difference.<br />
<br />
Also if there is a chanter in your group and he/she tashes that makes a big difference.<br />
<br />
PS- is anyone really wants to parse this myth again be my guest.  But provide back up next time or you will simply get flamed like the poor soul who started this thread :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The next day an Enchanter did the same type of test. He bought a clover from a Shaman alchemy vendor. When he put the clover in his first inventory slot he seemed to get resisted less. This would explain why Shamans land slow way more often than any other class -- most Shamans have had clovers in their inventory at one time or another from making potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Krenk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The reason ENC slow seems to stick more is the religious use of Tash. It actually does not stick more then the SHM. Slow is still based on MR checks. CHA effecting slow spells is just an old sarcastic joke that went around the SHM community in response for the serious CHA buffs we get. In all seriousness, the reason we initially got such good CHA buffs was because we used to be a charm class. Verant being who they were just kept rehashing old ideas without any background checking when it came to spell upgrades after the level cap was set higher.<br />
<br />
Turgur's used to have a built in resistance modifier which allowed it to land more often. I do not think that value exists anymore, but was there when the spell first went live.<br />
<br />
Having played both SHM and ENC extensively, I can say that my ugly ass Troll sees resists about the same as my vain chanter. What mobs you will see more resists on are Warrior class mobs, as they have a higher MR from class bonus. Having magic based spells bounce a little too much is a good sign that you are dealing with a warrior.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got any actual numbers to show the change? If not your feeling isn't worth anything.<br />
<br />
Like several other people who posted I ran around with very low cha for quite a while, hi neg 25 cha on CT brain, and never had any problems slowing compaired to any other shaman around. I've also played an enchanter up to level 59, god that level sucked, and honestly couldn't notice any difference between them. Sometimes you land it first try with no problem. Sometimes you just get the resistant bastard that refuses to be slowed. Happens to both.<br />
<br />
If you want to contribute something go log actual numbers with a controled test. Same mob, nothing but Cha changed. Ideally it would be a mob that was somewhat resistant already since it's harder to detect a difference when you can already land slow 95% of the time anyway. Not sure what would be a good mob to test on since you'll end up having to tank what ever mob it is.</div></div><hr />
