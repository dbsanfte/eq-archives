<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does anyone know if a 60 Shaman (with Torpor and Epic) could reasonable expect to be able to solo the wyverns in the caves in WW?  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">no doubt! Considering at 60 I was Soloing Yelma with ease, wyverns were not a problem.</div></div><hr />

Haven't tried this out yet but it got me wondering, does the killing of the wyverns negatively impact CoV faction?  I'm not that up on all the various dragon related factions?</div></div><hr />

It will destroy your CoV faction very very fast</div></div><hr />
