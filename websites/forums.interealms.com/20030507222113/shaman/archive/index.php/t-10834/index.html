<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">been thinking about my froggy shaman i plan to make.<br />
<br />
as you can tinker with the froggy stats already on the new character screem, i have come up with the idea of piling most of the 30 bonus into sta.<br />
<br />
so i would have 110 sta  and 90 wis.<br />
<br />
although that would disadnavtage me at 1-40 lvls...i dont expect to be take more than 4 weeks to be in my 40s.<br />
<br />
+sta items are hard to get as opposed to + wis items.  <br />
<br />
<br />
also i am considering going 2hb from the start (tarnished driveshaft)  cos i am just MENTAL !<br />
dest droppable shaman weapon under 10k is the reif.  but this doesnt proc till 40 ?  with the high frog dex, i dont want 40 lvls of seeing &quot;u do not have the will,,,,<br />
would drive me nuts.<br />
<br />
When u look at tradeable 1hb vs spears....just shows how poor the spear selection is.<br />
<br />
Personally i like the dizok scpetr of authority.  Thos for toe to toe at 50 its got a very weak ratio.<br />
<br />
bah guess ill just have to keep all 3 skills as high as i can.<br />
(have a spear of the despoiler banked on my main)  best one hander for shaman pre pop.  its 51 + weapon tho.<br />
<br />
/ponder<br />
<br />
and dont moan at me twinking....i have 2 lvl 55 +  shamsn...done it the HARD way more than once.....dont see the point in doing it again at &quot;the vision&quot; pace!!!<br />
<br />
anyone with an once of tradeskill knowledge know if thers any mithaniel marr chain armour around?<br />
<br />
I wonder wherether thers some quests in fp and qyenos, pally/cleric guilds that will now be froggy doable.  i guess most them will be rewards with the wrong class on the item...still could be worth researching...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A REIF is the mutz nutz...it procs at 35 and it's way under 10k on AB m8....usually 5k (altho the one i have was only 1k, don't know how my m8 managed to haggle that one but i ain;t complaining since he lent it to me until i get my epic)</div></div><hr />
