<br />
Has anyone tried this at 55, either by crawling or invis/IU travel? I could use some advice, most importantly:<br />
<br />
Will greenies aggro?<br />
Where is the switch point from Camo to IU (potions of course).<br />
Pulling tactic for the Big X himself.<br />
<br />
My gear is good. Epics and fungi. Oh, and Thurg Gate for the return Trip.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Arynduil, EMarr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kedawen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The hardest part is the first break in when you drop down. There are several spiders, some of which see invis. With Epics and Fungi, you should be OK.<br />
<br />
Either IU or crawling will get you to Xalgoz.<br />
<br />
My technique for pulling him was to stand in the entrance to his general area (maybe one wanderer) then bind sight hop until I could see Xalgoz. Target him or his placeholder, then cast from where I was going to fight. While he is not visible, you can cast through the wall, (at least I could before the recent LoS patch). He won't aggro any of his buddies on his way to you at 55.<br />
<br />
You could use IU to simply walk up to him to target, then walk back to your fighting area, but I'm cheap : )</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sharteel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you cast levitate, you can take an alternate route. You dont have to jump into a bunch of spiders. Personally i fought my way down and back up.<br />
<br />
Was pretty easy. But i was already 60 at that time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>ronthen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You don't need to jump down into the spiders at all. Jump down to the left, I've never gotten agro there. I've heard the necros can see invis, but I've never run into one that can. As soon as you see the first ghost, that's when you want to IVU. Xalgoz can be tough, and everything in his temple will agro if you get close enough. I would bring a healer, even a 40ish druid would make it a sure bet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Arath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok I am feeling very encouraged by the conversation here im still new to the ranger class and this type of stuff makes me feel great. Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Cyantune</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What you may try is PLing a lower companion at the same time. I got a guildmate who was a 35 shaman (im 52) to come with me.<br />
<br />
at 52 I can single pull almost the entire area around the church, and he kept me from having ANY down time, as his haste and heals were all I needed.<br />
<br />
In 3 hours, we both got fangs, He got a Blade of Xalgoz, a Dusty ransacker pack, and 2 levels.<br />
<br />
I made a friend and potential duo partner in the future.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eldron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With lev on, go in and go straight ahead.  Drop down the shaft and make sure to catch the first ledge.  (you'll be facing it, use F9 to spy the ledge before you jump off)  If you miss it, will will float down to the pit of spiders and things will be tougher on you.<br />
<br />
Once on the ledge, head straight forward to the room with the broken up floor.  There will be one mob between you and that room.  Drop down through the floor, do a 180 and look for the tunnel.<br />
<br />
Head down the tunnel, go straight at the T.  Clear mobs around the towers.  Head in to the right.  There will be a tower that is open on the top lvl and leads down to the bottom.  You can re-lev here, walk up the highest point of the wall, step into the tower and cast a lvl 9 dd on a mob below, quickly step back to the ground.  The mob will run up to you from the bottom lvl.  Kill all 4 on the ground floor of this tower.  Then float down to the bottom of it once clear.<br />
<br />
I like to come in this tower as now you have a nice place to pull to.  I have not had anything aggro through the walls of the tower.  So at 51, I could single pull mobs back to that tower.  Whats more, the temple is right in front of that towers doorway. Clear the mobs one by one.  Make sure to keep an eye on the tower spawn timer.  Its nice to fight in there, as you wont get any healer adds.  Which is probably a must to keep up with the spawn if you are solo with no healer for yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Icye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow could 53 shaman 51 warrior 56 druid take this entire zone with  NO TROUBLE at all ever even if it is crawling through heh also cna druid and warrior do alon e without shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kenshu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I powerleveld my wifes enchanter here from 30-42 in just a couple of days. Some things were still blue-lt blue at 52 for me near Xalgoz. We ccamped mostly the library and xalgoz but nothing offered much of a challenge. Only downtime was from me healing myself but with Clarity even that was short. I kept my druid bound near the entrance to sell all the weapons, books, and dusty ransackers packs and made pretty good PP. It was a lot fun too. Id recommend this as one of the best places to powerlevel too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arynduil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">May as well update.<br />
<br />
Went in with a 60 Pally friend who needed the groundspawn in the Library for the VP key. Needless to say it was trivial with this duo.<br />
<br />
I'm about 95% confident I could have done it solo, but this was a sure thing and a heckofalot less boring. Xalgoz popped on the 5th cycle. I hear that's pretty good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>PhyrexDarkmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is possible solo at 55, just need to be careful.  I started out going down with a druid in tow but once we got down there he fell thru the whole in Xalgoz's room and died so I was forced to do a CR from down there.  I guess I don't know about heading down but I did drag the corpse back to the zone so I'm sure a good ghetto mezzer should have no problem since there aren't many casters down there.  I did manage to pull his corpse out of Xalgoz's room and get my fang for my HS key.  Just be patient and it ain't a problem.  Most of my down time was regening mana so grab a C3 and it should be cake, you can nuke and everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Everything in the church can be single pulled.  Bring a ItU caster or a few ten dose shaman potions.. <br />
<br />
Using ItU go to the church entrance, target Xalgoz (or Ph, he will be in the middle furthest back).  Move to the back of the church (outside behind where Xalgoz is), there is a little niche there.  Use cancel magic to pull Xalgoz through the wall.  He will take a long path, but even my lvl 45 ranger didn't get adds from this.  He is a Necro, so Magic resist gear is very useful.</div></div><hr />
