<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I spent last night in droga duoing with my warrior. All the entrance mobs are even/yellow/red cons to him. My shaman is getting decent AA exp, and the exp seems to be &quot;ok&quot; for the warrior. Got about a yellow of exp in 1 1/2 hours. Switched to AA exp for him, and it was flat out terrible. Worse than regular exp by far. Anyone have an idea what kind of split creating here grouping a 65 and 51? And why is the AA exp worse? I had it in my head that AA exp was supposed to be the same amount as lvl 51. Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Level 52 sticks in my mind.  So your xp would be significantly worse if that is true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Exp in groups has been changed many times, but one of the more memorable changes was when they removed the level base for exp splits in groups.  Every member of the group gets an equal share... as long as you are within the level range to get exp together.  The modifiers for race/class/etc are applied after that.<br />
<br />
AA exp should be approximately the same as an unmodified level 51-52.  At his level it should be almos the same for regular or alt exp.<br />
<br />
I have heard that there are some bugs in the AA exp splits, but I have no details.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I could very well be wrong, but I don't recall them ever removing the level ratio division of group xp.  I do remember them changing from a total xp ratio division to a level ratio division, which greatly increased the shares that lower leveol group members would get (because of the steep xp curve, total xp rations are much higher than total level ratios--with level rations, a lvl 60 and a lvl 55 grouped together results in the lvl 60 getting 60/115th of the xp and the 55 gets 55/115th whereas with total xp ration the lvl 60 could get [pulling numbers out of my ass, real numbers are at showeq  site I am sure] something like 2/3rds of the xp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">maybe you killed differing numbers of mobs and the exp seemed worse but was mostly the same?  You dont say how long you killed with aa on so thats the only conclusion i can draw that makes sense to me anyhow.<br />
<br />
and maybe this has something to do with the removal of hell levels...maybe aa exp is actually more exp than level 51-52 is now; aaexp was shown as this number before removal of hell levels correct? dont remember seeing anything about what it was after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect.  The level split was never removed.  What was removed was the class based modifiers being applied to the entire group.  The only thing now that splits the xp unevenly is your levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">nope.  The change I am referring to happened quite a while back.. they said it was to promote grouping... :)<br />
<br />
(BAH, casters realm is down, and I dont know where else I can search old patch messages for the text....It was back when daoc was new, if I recall)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Could it be his race, Krak?<br />
<br />
A 20% penalty AND your shaman's share might look like a drastic difference.  I know you also mentioned AA which would not be affected.<br />
<br />
I'm levelling an ogre SK (currently 52) with 10% going into AA and his xp just crawls when we're grouped.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Slurm, I am talking about the one a couple years ago, it was the same time/close to the same time that they removed hybrid xp penalties and changed race based penalties so that they would not be shared by groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think its more related to 2 other facts.<br />
<br />
First, Droga (and Nurga) only has a +12% zone experience multiplier.  While that is a good multiplier, several other dungeons have better, such as the hole with a +20% ZEM.<br />
<br />
Second, Droga mobs, like most any mob from LoY zones or other &quot;retuned&quot; zones, have a truckload of hitpoints.  At 62, with can4/torpor and mage-equipped alpha dog, I can only keep 3 droga spawns cleared during the 20 minute spawn time.  In Sebilis, I can usually rotate 5-6 mobs of only slightly lower level in the same time.<br />
<br />
Combine these facts with a player that has recently been exp'ing in the planes (which mostly have +35% or +42% ZEM mods and reletively low-HP mobs), and it all starts to make sense.<br />
<br />
Finally, remember that there was also a patch that dramatically improved exp for killing mobs that are close to your level (I think the formula is within 5 levels of your level at 60, or within 7 at 65).  Below that, even blue mobs will give comparetively little exp.  Remember that patch that made many mobs that used to be light blue into blue mobs? Well, it didn't really change the exp they gave very much; they are basically still light blue for exp purposes.<br />
<br />
Since mob exp is determined mostly by the level of the mob, you should power-level in the old world: the mobs are far easier for the amount of experience you will gain.  In fact, the Hole is probably one of the best places for higher-level PL'ing, unless you have access to a CoD chanter.</div></div><hr />
