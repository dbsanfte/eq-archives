<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moraganth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simply question that's been asked many times.  I've done the search, and found some answers.. however...<br />
<br />
The most common answer has been 4 hours.  This answer pops up as far back as January of this year.<br />
<br />
Is Kirn a 4 hour spawn.. and, if so, when was he changed from 1 hour.<br />
<br />
The last time i was in a raid there that we did two of him, he was 1 hour... and yeh, it's been a while.  I'm looking for  a more recent confirmation he's been changed... confirmation as in someone actually sat through 2 spawnings of him... preferably the person posting said confirmation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Last time I was there (a few months ago) we waited at least 2 hours for a respawn, then wiped on a bad pull :(<br />
<br />
The time before that he took about 2.5 hours to respawn I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shaman101</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Good way to check Kirn is make an assling rogue who follows BB.  Everything in the zone will con KOS to you but its just a fake.  Get an invis, yes regular invis, and run and park him in Kirns room.   If not invis, the only thing that will attack you are the ratman  warriors and reavents.  Log and check and if hes up go for it. <br />
Another note.  You can get to the tower and ITU and run straight into Kirns room.  Theres one reavent, in the back of the room that I believe is kos.  All the others arent.  Saves a lot of time if your doing it with a single group like I did. <br />
Hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my third hole try (his pet had been up but not him previously), we arrived at the hole and found through a mage's eye that Kirn not up.  Another group said he had been killed an hour prior. We decided, on a whim, to try him anyway, as we might get lucky.<br />
<br />
It took an hour for the raid to get organized. (It was a bad night). It took an hour and a half to get down to the tower. It took us another thirty minutes to fight our way up the tower. Just as we neared his room, we saw &quot;High scale kirn begins to cast a spell.&quot;<br />
<br />
It was four hours almost exactly since the first group killed him.<br />
<br />
Needless to say, he died quicky, we were happy, and I got my ring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lanadena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I will confirm what Harvyst has said.  At the end of September my friends and I took down Kirn.  Four hours later (we had half the numbers and spent the time doing pulls around the tower) Kirn reappeared and gave another engraved ring.</div></div><hr />
