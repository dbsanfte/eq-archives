<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does someone have a good link to cleric meleeing DPS figures?  Lord I'm so sick of hearing &quot;my mana regen is just as good meleeing as sitting with KEI, so I should melee&quot;.  Then they miss heals and people die.  Every time... unless I start pinch healing.  So they can melee.  *scream*<br />
<br />
Last time I started laying on so many dots and rains that the cleric got to alternate CH'ing me and the MT, had no time to melee.  Most of em won't stop until they've killed somebody and wasted everybody's time with the rezzing and rebuffing process.<br />
<br />
I'd rather solve it with something more logical, though, if somebody has a breakdown on it.  I honestly wouldn't care in the least if they could melee and accurately time their heals, but it seems to be impossible.<br />
<br />
Please, how do YOU deal with these clerics, especially when they're *sigh* guildmates.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">other thing to do before disbanding ya cleric :) is to say in group when MT is low HP: 'Should i heal you &lt;name of tank&gt; or I let the cleric heal? don't wanna take his job&quot;<br />
<br />
sometimes it works... sometimes just find another cleric.<br />
<br />
but I always heal when HP goes down on a group member , I heal.<br />
whatever the cleric says: one time i had a cleric yelling at me cuz i have healed a tank at 20%...  &quot;THIS DOES NOT MAKE MY CH MANA EFFICIENT !!!&quot;   lol who cares if the CH is efficient or not? a tank who knows that healerS are behind him is better than a tank worrying if he'll die or not cuz CH was.. oops.. too late to be efficient.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">disbanding the cleric usually leads to a group disbanding you.  Even if the cleric sucks, you had better have a replacement cleric ready and waiting for his/her invite when you do something like that.  <br />
<br />
I usually leave the group if the cleric sucks and tacit explorations reveal the group is content enuf with a sucky cleric.  Usually that means they suck too.  So I just leave and do something else.  Good lord, i can get sooo much better exp if I put the group together myself anyway, what's the point of being frustrated?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Has anybody tried to convince guild clerics that it's stupid and pointless for them to melee?  Or is this just futile?  I don't want to say that I uninaterally will NOT group with this particular guild cleric, but I'm not really willling to deal with the frustration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>touk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">we have a melee cleric also. vut she knows her job and does it and really depending on what your camping will  decide what the cleric will do. I would say send the cleric a tell doing it in Gsay will only delay that heal you may need lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't have any problem with a cleric having some fun.<br />
<br />
Playing a cleric just plain sucks.  If EQ can give them a little fun then I don't have any problem with it.  I just try to adjust a bit.<br />
<br />
If they are a garbage cleric then they are a garbage cleric reguardless if they sit on their horse or mele a bit.<br />
<br />
Anyone who does not like can just start up a cleric and have some nice boring jobs to do till their fingers fall off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I guess that's the thing.  When the MT falls over dead without getting a single heal because slow was resisted and he didn't have enough hps to last until the second slow got off while the cleric spaced out... I guess you're right and that's a crappy cleric issue and not so much a meleeing issue.  I guess it just accentuates the crappiness of the cleric when they start meleeing.<br />
<br />
I've seen clerics do more than stand and CH.  They have the hammer pet now.  They have a better nuke than shamans... what exactly do they want for entertainment?  Are buffs really so exciting that our job is that much different from theirs?  I thought all clerics started that class because they want to cyber nonstop between CH's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">My old main is a cleric and it droves me nuts to see them jumping in on raids to melee.  It left me having to be the sole healer at times and the druids trying to back me up on the chanters and casters.  I had no one to watch my back and often thier group would go unhealed.<br />
<br />
Sure they just want to have fun and melee, but that is not thier job.  You can't have your attention in two places.  I have yet been able to get a cleric to stop lol.  They are a hard headed bunch. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">you're just grouping with bad clerics. most the clerics i play with melee, and no one dies. generally it's my fault when my best friend who plays a cleric kills the MT due to us talking about hair or makeup or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jedediah Bloodmoor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I like to see a melee cleric most of the time, I dont believe that clerics somehow forget that they are the groups primary healer and have never had a problem with groupies dying.  As long as they never say &quot;OOM&quot; or &quot;LOM&quot; i'll happily melee buff them (speed and all) and never complain that they should sit down and be a cleric.  Their DPS isnt bad (counting the proc of course) and if they have the mana, I say go for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have cleric friends who like to melee...  I usualy groan and make fun of them when they do it in the group.  But they dont let people die.<br />
<br />
If you have a cleric that wants to melee, let them... but let THEM heal still.  If the tank dies, just tank the mob yourself.  In an experience group you arent fighting anything you cant tank.  Let the cleric kill the tank, let the tank complain.   When they ask why you didnt heal, say you were waiting on the cleric to CH, and by the time you got your heal off it was too late.<br />
<br />
It may seem cruel, but the group will not let the cleric slack off after that happens.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying clerics shouldnt melee for fun, I'm saying if they cant do the job that the group invited them for AND melee... then they shouldnt try it.  That would be the same as a shaman who didnt slow, because they prefered to spend all their mana on nukes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimmlukk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">... generally it's my fault when my best friend who plays a cleric kills the MT due to us talking about hair or makeup or something.<br />
<br />
ROFL!<br />
<br />
OMG...I will NEVER be able to keep a straight face when the tank in a group goes down.  Never!<br />
<br />
I just had this REALLY bad visual of a big, ugly Ogre and a bearded, smelly dwarf sitting around, chatting about their HAIR while the warrior dies...lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Actually, I've been in a few groups where the cleric has gotten up and started meleeing and the reason why (for me) is Q.<br />
<br />
In the pretty good BoT group, I'm maloing, slowing, Qing liberally, and nuking. This works very well most of the time. And for the most part, I end up doing alot of the mundane healing, because Q is so efficient (2k for only 200mana). As a result, the cleric has extra mana regen which they could use towards nuking, but it's actually more efficient to melee. The end result, is that the cleric is only there for the emergency heals and occasionally CH when Q when the tank gets low because, Q is not keeping up or I'm busy with adds ect.<br />
<br />
The reason all this makes sense, is because cleric melee is more efficent than our nukes or their nukes and Q is very efficient for ordinary healing. It actually makes sense, at least to me it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Nuggruk RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Have to say it really depends on:<br />
<br />
1. The Skill of the cleric in question<br />
2. The mobs they are fighting<br />
3. The makeup of the group<br />
<br />
and most importantly....<br />
<br />
The ability of the cleric to judge the above 3 things.<br />
<br />
In &quot;most&quot; xp situations a good Cleric can melee, with decent haste item and a dex buff the cleric puts out some very respectable damage and using Yaulp V they do regen as much mana as sitting with KEI, with Yaulp VI they actually regen more mana than sitting with KEI.<br />
<br />
If you have a cleric that lets the tank or anyone else die in the group because they were meleeing then I have to say its normally a sucky cleric issue.<br />
<br />
Many many clerics are the suck however when just sitting / healing they can disguise that they are pretty crap players, when they start to melee they lose the ability to hide it.<br />
<br />
A properly played cleric who is willing to melee when the situation warrants it is a great asset to the group.<br />
<br />
On a personnel level I have a much bigger problem with sucky shamans who insist on letting the mob get to 80% before even attempting to slow or those who start to scream for a heal cause the mob decided to smack them around a little bit.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It's not the buffs -- playing a cleric is essentially a passive duty.  You sit and wait for people to get hurt, then you make them better.  Stuff like Mark and the Hammer are a little more interesting, but really usually, it's sit and heal, and occasionally toss a root or stun as needed.<br />
<br />
This is opposed to the shaman, who has such an *active* job, even when playing the healing role.  My 2 biggest characters are shaman and cleric, and it doesn't bug me because they play SO differently.<br />
<br />
I play a cleric to relax.  People who play it all the time may go a little stir crazy, I don't blame em for wanting to mix it up now and then, and if nobody's dying, and everyone seems ok with the pace, more power to them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I group with a friend who duo boxes a 58 ranger and 59 cleric, though his girlfriend sometimes plays his cleric.  Last night in Seb the cleric, this time being played by the girlfriend, got up and started fighting for the first time.  This worked out fine because they’re such good players.  But I have to say I was amazed.  The cleric had an incredible weapon.  I can’t remember the name of it, but I was told it was summoned and I remember it was no rent and no drop.  It was fast did good damage, added 10ac and a number of stat bonuses.  But most impressive was the proc.  The text said something about the wrath of the gods and it did, I believe, from 100 to 150 damage.  And I swear the darn thing proced at least 15 times per combat.  I had cast HoS and haste on both of us and I tried fighting side by side a few times.  My Spine Chill Spear proced once or twice per fight while the cleric’s weapon spamed the chat box with procs.  It was simply amazing. <br />
<br />
So for our little group the cleric fighting worked out just fine.  The heals came just as they had when the cleric was sitting on his butt.  And we were able to kill the mobs off faster.  When we fought particularly nasty spell casting mobs we were a little more conservative and the cleric would put away his weapon and start nuking.  But for the melee types it worked out very well indeed.</div></div><hr />
