<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Firstly, let me say that I probably know a lot less than you about tech issues...........so Im asking for insight.<br />
<br />
Ive only logged into eq a few times in the past 5 months or so but as of late, im getting heavy lag and &quot;choppy&quot; arse frame rates that are annoying (but playable)<br />
<br />
Im not really suffering any packet loss and my connection indicator doesnt appear to be doing anything unusual.<br />
<br />
My system specs are:<br />
<br />
Sony Vaio 2.8 ghz<br />
512 ram<br />
Nvidia GeForce fx 5200<br />
Windows xp<br />
<br />
DSL<br />
<br />
Just bought this system about a year ago so I doubt my hardware is causing issues...and this game ran smooth up until recently..........and I dont have any lag issues running the game on my backup comp (sony vaio 1.7 ghz, Radeon 9800)<br />
<br />
Can lag be caused by not enough free disk space on 1 of my drives?  I only have 8 percent left on drive c.<br />
<br />
Also, at random times while on the internet Ill get this windowed black screen (same screen when you do a tracer test/ ping test) that flashes for about 1 second: &quot;program to big to fit in memory&quot;.<br />
<br />
I have tried to cleanup drive c but there is an issue with that process as well.........as soon as i hit the button that says &quot;Calculating disk space&quot; only 3 little bars are visible after 2 hours of leaving it on.  Only supposed to take a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts ?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd check your system using Adaware or SpyBot also.<br />
<br />
I do believe EQ requires a certain amount of swap space on a HD also.<br />
<br />
Do you only have one HD?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Internet sites often put things on your system that fire up one or more at a time and start sending a flood of info about your online habits all at once.  They can severely slow you down or even crash your system sometimes, especially with only 512 RAM, or they can just all add up to a slow, trickling death as they eat away system resources over time.<br />
<br />
I'd try Ad Aware and ummm Spybot.  Both are freebies you can download from the net or find on many utility disks that come with conputer magazines.  I've used both and there was a huge number of things that got cleared from my computer.<br />
<br />
These are must-haves!  I'd also get an anti-virus program and check things out.<br />
<br />
By the way, Fry's is having a sale on Western Digital HD's (very good drives) for 30 bucks for 80 gigs.  Doesn't get much cheaper than that bro.<br />
<br />
Oh, and you might consider getting some more memory.  512 is really not that much for today's world.  I've had crashes and long, laggy pauses while netsurfing etc. with 512 before.  If you can possible scrape up enough money to bring your RAM up to 1k, your net use(often including EQ) will become much smoother, believe it.<br />
<br />
As it is now, I bet what's happening is your smallish amount of RAM is making you write to your hard drive's swap file and read out of it a lot instead of storing info and instructions in your system's RAM -- which is what, like 10,000 times faster than any hard disk?  Something like that anyway, I dunno.  <br />
<br />
Now if your swap file is fragmented too...oh boy.<br />
<br />
So...for freebie solutions, try Ad Aware and Spybot, and I guess MacAfee virus protection, since that's free.  Then see if you can defrag.  And then think about getting some more RAM -- RAM is often by far the best upgrade you can get for a computer.<br />
<br />
Oh, and search your start-up folder and clean out all the crap that spy programs and most everyone tries to shove in there.  That can be a big problem too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you only have one HD?<br />
<br />
<br />
No I have 2 hard drives.  All my eq files though are in teh one that is loaded with all kinds of Sony dvd/media/movie making bells and whistles that I dont want to get rid of, even though i rarely use them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>SoulStorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Video lag and connection lag are two different things.<br />
<br />
About the defrag<br />
<br />
Defragmenting needs space to move the data around 8% sounds very very low. Uninstall some stuff you do not need or get a new hard drive and use THAt to install your OS there.<br />
<br />
<br />
About Temp files<br />
<br />
Clean out all your temporary internet files as well as any other misc temp files you do not need.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UNINSTALL everything u do not use<br />
Backup stuff on a zip/cdrw/dvd etc and unclutter your HD<br />
<br />
8% is very very low but again no connection lag could come out of it. However a LOT of video lag can occur. Don't confuse the two.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Larium</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks for the replies folks as eq sites are way more educational than a comp class.<br />
<br />
I did indeed downlaod Adware and cleared 22 &quot;objects&quot; from my stem that but it didnt have any affect on my lag in-game.<br />
<br />
I havent run any anti-virus programs lately so I will jump on that.<br />
<br />
I cant stand McAffee though as I had bad experinces with theire customer service.  Lol you think EQ CS is bad?  Try contacting McAfee about an issue.  If you get over the fact that they try to charge you some crazy $ amount I cant even remember just for the phone call, they wouldnt even help me try to uninstall their software and never sent me instructions that the technician told me on the phone that he would.  McAffe is horrid.  <br />
<br />
Any respectable ant-virus programs out there that once-installed are easy to disable and user friendly?  Norton?<br />
<br />
In regards to cleaning up my disk space, like I stated earlier, something is wrong because when i try to run the &quot;calculating disk space&quot; part, no progress is  made (only 3 yellow bubbles after 2 hours).  Perhaps that is because of a virus.<br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for the advice,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chulain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Did you empty the Temporary Internet Files?  Do it directly, not with the cleanup wizard.<br />
<br />
<br />
 In Internet Explorer select Tools|Internet Options... from the menu bar.<br />
 On the General tab, in the Temporary Internet files section, click on the Delete Files... button.<br />
 In the Delete Files dialog window select the Delete All Offline Content option and click the OK button.<br />
 When the hourglass goes away, click the Cancel button on the Internet Options dialog box.<br />
<br />
That should free up some space and allow you to run the cleanup wizard and defrag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Spybot and Ad Aware each catch things the other doesn't.<br />
<br />
I really high recommend both, though with your disk space, adding on more programs could really be counter-productive...maybe.<br />
<br />
If you can go to START, RUN, then type MSCONFIG and go to START UP programs, see what you have there.  Look carefully because you don't want to delete anything you need!  But very few people don't have a huge clutter of programs stuffed into their start-ups after a while of computing.  It's the norm, not the exception, for even reputable programs to try to stick themselves into your system so they start up(visibly or invisibly) every time you turn your computer on, pointlessly using up system resources.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">First up, you need to do some clean up work on your drive, EQ, Windows, and in fact most programs use a certain amount of drive space, dictated by the program itself, to swap files back and forth. Having too little hard drive space gives you a similar message to what you have above, sometimes &quot;You have run out of virtual memory&quot; messages too.<br />
Second, do you have your hard drive partioned? if you do that actually decreases your hard drives ability to do this file swapping, causing lags and other problems. Only partition your hard drive if your wanting to do something funky like run Linux on a windows machine (if your gonna do that just use an emulator, works just fine).<br />
Also check your current Radeon drivers and to see if you have the most up to date Dx9 version (9.1b I believe) a different version than what your video driver is looking for can give you headaches.<br />
<br />
Edit: did some thinking real fast on your cleaning up problem, you really need to defragment your hard drive once a month at least, and some people recommend more often than that, also its good to wipe and re-install your OS every ~6 months to prevent corruption of files (it does happen). Most people skip that last part entirely, but gaming PCs, video editing PCs, etc tend to have more number crunching and processing going on than your average internet cruiser. If that doesnt work, you may just have a hard drive thats going bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How do you unpartition a drive?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">How do you unpartition a drive?<br />
<br />
Depends on your OS.  Win2k/XP can be done from windows.<br />
<br />
Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools &gt; Computer Management &gt; Disk Management<br />
<br />
That will display a list of partitions, and you should be able to delete and format a partition there.  With Windows 98 you need to run fdisk from a dos prompt, or from Run under the Start menu.<br />
<br />
You will probably lose all information on the drive when you do this though, so make sure you backup everything you need. (Or just worry about it later like I usually do.. :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">i wouldnt advise rearranging the partitions to attempt to cure lag. i think ur problems arent coming from having a divided hard drive.<br />

more likey its caused by the graphics card conflicting with the dx9 enginethingy.<br />
<br />
eq is optimised to run with intel cpu and geforce graphics chips.  I use amd chip and geforce card. i have virtually no problems with the dx9 graphics upgrade.<br />
<br />
adware is a good program.  id recomend u use a diferent computer to surf the porn sites with, u never know what crap is being downloaded to ur hdd; allakhazams is a bad site for adds downloads (<br />
windows as an os is very reliant on the hdd performance- keeping it defraged is good idea, and hacking things out of sustem resources is a good idea- inpractise 96% of windows users arent techy enough to know whats ACTUAlly runing on their pc. I have pops on my comp i just cant get rid of(<br />

I recommend AVG from Grisoft.<br />

It's absolutely free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Listen to your hard drive while eq is lagging.  Is the drive running nonstop?  If so, then you've probably run out of system memory, and windows is spooling to the hard drive.  Make sure all unneeded programs are closed, and clear up as much hard drive space as you can.<br />
Eq runs pretty well with 1 gig of ram per running instance, 512 will spool quite a bit.</div></div><hr />

In general this is right, however, the Radeon 9800 is not only Dx compliant, it was designed for Dx9, but like I said earlier, his drivers may be outta wack with the latest Dx9 build, that causes all sorta of funky stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How bout moving EQ to second hdd? This will free up a large chunk of the disk enabling defrag to run correctly. Another nice free AV prog is Avast (http://www.avast.com/i_idt_1016.html) . You do have to register for a key unlocking the program but they do regular updates and is free for home usage.<br />
<br />
Black Viper (http://www.blackviper.com/) has some pretty good guides on cleaning up XP. There are quite a few services that run automatically that eat up resources and you really don't want them on at all i.e. Remote Registry or Remote Login etc. Lots of little tweaks to XP do a search on google and should find more than you ever wanted to know regarding cleaning and tweaking the OS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Do a search for Trend Micro on the web.  Get a free virus scan and remove any viruses if found.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Standard defrag requires 15% free space.<br />
<br />
Consider moving system swap file to a drive with more free space.<br />
<br />
Update drivers for all devices (yes, even sound) and then reinstall DX9.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If your swap file (which it sounds like you are using) is fragmented, it will kill system performance.  Also, I believe HPFS (that is, non-FAT systems) require a certain amount of free space for optimal performance, and you will see performance degredation with the hard drive under 10% free.  20% is considered the minimum for optimal performance (at least it was on the AS/400s I used to admin, which have the same type of file system, YMMV and all that).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The last OS to use HPFS was OS/2.<br />
<br />
Win98/ME use FAT32.<br />
<br />
NT/2k/XP use NTFS.<br />
<br />
OS/2 up to e-Business use HPFS, and e-Business uses JFS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Maybe I misread his original post, but the Radeon 9800 is in the spare PC? and the main machine is using the nv5200?? <br />
<br />
I'd swap those cards around, the 9800 is a much faster card. (unless it's 128-bit el-cheapo model).<br />
<br />
Move your system swap file to the drive with the most free space so you can get things going again. By default it is probably around 512meg and on C: drive.<br />
System Properties, advanced, performance, virtual memory, change.<br />
Remove any unneeded things from startup and system tray.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Another thing you can check is that you have the journal turned off. It's been known to cause lag too. Though I doubt that is what is causing your problem.<br />

For a quick Anti-virus check go here Trend Micro (http://housecall.trendmicro.com) <br />
<br />
I have had better luck cleaning out spyware with Spysweep, available free at Webroot (http://www.webroot.com) <br />
<br />
Check your swap file settings, You do not have to have your swap file on the C: drive. You can move it to D: where there is more room, or split it between the 2 drives. <br />
<br />
Clean up your C: drive! Take those music, picture, video files and move them to the other drive for storage, or better yet put them on CD/ zip disk. Uninstall anything you don't use regularly, if you really want to keep it installed then reinstall it to the D: drive. <br />
<br />
With 512mb of ram on the system, you are forcing the system to use the swap file more for EQ. Each time you access the drive for the swap file you slow things down. I would suggest bumping the ram up to 1 GB that will prevent a lot of swapping. <br />

The current game engine seems to like memory first, then processor or video card depending on zone or models. It almost seems like the new models are more processor intensive and the zone rendering works my video card over more.  Or maybe I'm just high.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Moibles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I know I am getting in on this late and your problems are somewhat solved but not entirely.<br />
<br />
I would highly recommend getting the entire Norton Systemworks package from Symantec.<br />
<br />
It has a more than decent antivirus package(NAV/SAV - Norton Antivirus or Symantec Antivirus), a disk error resolver(NDD - Norton's Disk Doctor) and a disk defragmenter(SD - Speedisk) that is vastly superior to Window's built-in defragger.<br />
<br />
It isn't really cheap but it is entirely worth it.  The one problem is that it installs a lot of material on boot up that will waste a lot of valuable resources.  Be sure and uninstall most of this stuff and leave only the antivirus.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, NSW also has a registry integrity scanner called Windoctor.  Pretty spiffy.  It helps to clean up garbage left behind in your registry and in some of the other system areas.<br />
<br />
If you can't or more likely don't want to spend the money on NSW then Windows has a disk problem correcting program you should try.  CHKDSK.<br />
<br />
Click on Start, Run and then type in:  chkdsk c: /f<br />
<br />
The /f is important, otherwise Check Disk(chkdsk) will only check for errors but not fix them.<br />
<br />
To use CHKDSK the volume must be locked.  Which is normally impossible when Windows is running.  You will get a message to that effect and be asked if you want to schedule CHKDSK to run at a later time.  Answer yes and reboot.  On the reboot CHKDSK will run try to find and possibly even fix logical errors that creep up on a disk during usage.<br />
<br />
I don't want to offend anyone but I noticed the standard comment above about having to reformat and reinstall your OS every so often and that is true of many systems but only because they aren't taken care of properly.  A computer system is like a house in many ways.  It must have regular maintenance to remain in tip-top shape.  The problem is that it degrades much faster than a house does and most users have no idea how to properly maintain it.  It would be nice if more users were better educated about their systems but that doesn't excuse the fact that the systems should me more maintenance free.  I spend more time maintaining my computer system than I do my car.</div></div><hr />
