<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anyone tell me how t find these secret Lugald caves in Dulak Harbour? I'm puzzled and starting to wonder if I am looking in the right zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Justanote</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Follow the left wall til you slip thru the fake section. It's on the right side of what looks like a wooden wall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Once you zone into Dulak follow the wall on your left all the way around until you hit a wooden wall. There is a hidden entrance in the wood planks, walk right through and you'll come to the mouth of the caves.<br />
STAY INVISED, there are scouts on the way there as well as scouts right at the mouth of the caves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you zone in, follow the tunnel, hug the left wall (kill things as needed).  You will soon come to a wooden wall, the secret entrence is along this wall (it is invis).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Get a map. Wonderful things, pretty colors and very handy.  www.eqmaps.com has a lot of LoY maps as well as most other zones.  In addtion if you download the mapping tools (cant remember the URL) some of the LoY zones are there, just not 100% complete.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zilansis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">down load maps for the mapping tool here http://maps.eq-toolbox.com/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Scardrak1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">There are 2 zone-ins to Dulak that I know of.  These folks are talking about the zone in straight from Gunthak I believe.   There's also a zone in from Togiran mines I think?  Been a while.  Regardless, just clarifying a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, kinda goofy to find the first time, but once ya got it will be cake. Of course, this coming from a guy who after 100's of trips would STILL trigger traps in DN to the great displeasure of 30 other poor b4stards :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks all, yes had those maps and although its obvioius to those who have already been there I was unsure if those caves were the ones I needed to be in.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, much appreciated.<br />
