<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Browu Frostforge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, I made up a batch of potions.  I got 20 out of 21 Gate potions, and priced the 5-charge at 1200 each overnight.  This morning- no bites.  So I changed it to 1000 (barely any margin).  Still not bites.  <br />
<br />
No bites either on reasonably priced DS, Shrink, +10 all resists, or Stinging Wort potions.<br />
<br />
I had hoped that maybe business would be a little better.  Maybe it will as people figure everything out.  I did see one guy selling 10-charge sow potions for 60p.  Not gonna play that game.<br />

I also put single charge Swamp gates on sale for I think 275 each. I'll see if either have sold when I get home from work tonight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I fought the good fight on sow potions.  Put up six 10 shots for 100pp each last night.  No bites.  And of course, there was someone undercutting to 80pp this morning.  Sometimes economics sucks :).  I am guerssing the mean price will end up around 75pp and that is not really worth the effort imho.  There will always be some tool that  will settle for a tiny profit :p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I woke up to an extra 1.5k selling my VC Armour, not great but a start.<br />
<br />
I would talk to the other shaman if you can and try to get some price fixing in place as shaman we should really police ourselves and make selling our crap ass margin potions more fair.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Put up 3 SOW at 100pp overnight; sold one.  I think prices may firm up as people get mules loaded up with goods and just log on during AFK time--they can be patient to get a reasonable price.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Heh you guys have the wrong idea, you worry too much about what other people are doing. Make your potions and sell them for what you think is fair. If someone undercuts you, who cares? His potions will sell out faster then they will be forced to buy yours or wait until the other guy restocks. Eventually the other guy will get sick of constantly restocking and raise his prices or he will quit the vendor altogether. Make your potions, put a price on them, and go enjoy the game while the other guy grinds away making potions. You tell me who is having more fun. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Bazaar is surely going to create a lot of headaches until things balance out. I do feel it will keep people a little more honest and reduce price gauging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rokkeb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmmm<br />
what if you made a whole bunch of 10 dose sow potions,<br />
and sold them for regular 100p... but then snuck in a few 5 doses for 50p, hoping people would &quot;snatch them up at such a good price&quot; thinking they were 10 dose just like the rest? :p</div></div><hr />

Heck, if your going to be a thief (and I am not saying YOU are), why make them 5 does, why not use a single shot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">If you are going to be a thief, at least think big. Ruining your traders rep for 100p or whatever is hardly worth it. Not like it's tough to make a new trader but now you are starting over again with zero rep rather than a good accumulated one.</div></div><hr />

People will click on them, and have NO CLUE what they do. The only way you can support sales of potions like that is if you are at the keyboard with your little auction hotkey which explains the exact effect that the potions provide.</div></div><hr />

There is some saavy on our server.  I have spoken to some people who know what they are.  In fact, I sold 100 of them to an uber guild on our server.  I would even expect more people to know about DS potions.<br />
<br />
But, to help a little with this, I explained all of the potions in my AFK message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Buy all the 60pp 10shot sow potions from the fool and sell them for 75pp. 75pp is still a damn good price and you're making a &quot;free&quot; 15pp off every one.<br />
<br />
At 60pp it practically at cost so it's as if you made a 10 shot with no failures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Sold a 5 charge potion of swamp for 1500 plat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">5 charge gates might be the way to go.  Spendy but not OMG spendy.  Plus the added value of stackable gate potions.  <br />
Swamp seems popular location.  Even if it does put u smack in the middle of the shadow man camp.  <br />
<br />
I put two 10 shot SoW potions on my char, two hours later they were gone.  The DS and resist potions didn't sell.  The spells did sell however.  Spells seemed to be good sellers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Looks like it is time to go farm Emp chottal to have spells to leave on mule overnight \ while at school.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Checked bazaar this morning before coming to work, one guy had about 10 stacks of sow potions for 92pp each, one guy had one left at 90pp.   Looks like the price might stabilize in that range as everyone realized undercutting too much won't work.  I plan on buying out all potions being sold under 75pp and putting them on my toon, I can have up to 3 characters in the bazaar selling stuff so it won't hurt me :)<br />
<br />
Taladaen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I sold 1 1 charge gate to Swamp potion. I've lowered my 10 charge price from 2600 to 2200, I'll see if that makes them sell. No one else in zone is even selling 5 or 10 charge gates to anywhere, so there's not much competition on gate potions.<br />
<br />
I think 1 and 5 charge will probably be the best sellers. Not as many people can afford 2k or more for potions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Lunasombra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Agreed.. if someone wants to make 21pp on a potion let em.. I can do without the pained wrists from making these..<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Calimony, I have contacts in the uber guilds on the server who I do buisness with and we keep each other happy.  I don't ask for plat, I just ask th em for an item, they tell me how many and I do 1 ten shot per 1000pp.  Works well because neither of us feel rooked.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">I agree. I set 4 of em at 90pp each (which is what I always charged in the past). I am not budgeing from there. Someone else sells them for 80 or 70, more power to them but they will run out quickly and there I will be. As said before, it is a nice little money maker but I am not gonna spend me eq time whipping up dozens of SoW potions to sell cheap and I think the undercutters will catch on eventually too. It will probably stabilize around 85-95 pp</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">edit:  posted in wrong thread.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Cause not many people want to spend the time and money it takes to bring up thier alchemy skill.<br />
<br />
I salute all those who have done it but unless they make alchemy a reasonable TS I am not gonna raise my skill anymore.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">i suck at the internet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I stuck 10 10-dose SoW potions on my trade alt. After a few trading sessions (about 24 hours in total) they were all sold at 100pp this is with another shaman selling his at 90pp. So just be patient.<br />
<br />
If some one does start under cutting me by dropping the price to 80pp (let alone 60pp) I'll buy them and sell them for 100pp easy money without the RSI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Tossyndar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">sold 7 sows at 100pp, 5 shrinks 150pp all 10 dose..... Hell I was asleep and made a little plat but not expecting to make enough to buy a Pony in the next 6mth from it.. Im also putting in a few 5 dose Greater Stat Potions to see how they sell and afk message is :www.eqshaman.com for potion listing.. <br />
<br />
Expect to see 20 potion mules a day in Bazaar as every Shammy and his dog will be trying to make some plat.... While they do that and spend the time making the potions Im off to farm Hill Giants in RM</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">havent really noticed to much activity on A' ro  yet .. although ive seen a few potions being sold .. most of my customers usually just send me a tell and ask if i have time can i mafe so and so and how many. <br />
<br />
Although i did see Dart selling some the other day. =-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I was on last night selling my SoW at 90 and shrink at 180. I did a search for them both and the SoW was about middle ground. There wsa a fool selling shrink potions for 110pp. I am positive it said 10charge. I hope he thought it was a 5 charge potion and mistyped (for his sake, with failure he may be breaking even at that price).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">been selling 10 stacks for 2k apiece(trivial so i make abit) first day i sold about 4, nothing after :) <br />
<br />
and i'm as far as i know the only gate potion vendor there.. (searched for potions alot, no other gates)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">im not selling SOW potions for 60-80 a pop<br />
<br />
sorry , there has been a long time reason on why its 100pp . to make up for the fails . if they wont buy them in the bazaar ill sell them some place else . i never really sold many in the bazaar anyway  :shrug:</div></div><hr />
