<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a full set of thrones, knights, squires and about 10 crowns none of which are white. Where does the white crown drop??? It's driving me nuts, I just want my boots dammit!<br />
<br />
I'm clearing AIW3/4, stomples, white stallion and puppets, should I be looking somewhere else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its just really rare man, keep on farming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yub just keep farming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mcast12</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">OK thanks, I was worried it only dropped off a specific mob. Everyone kept telling me dolls and thrones were the toughest things to get, wasn't prepared for the white crown being rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Sadly before I ever hit PoM I was scouring the Bazaar, bought my white crown.    First card to EVER drop for me was the one and only white crown I have seen in all my time up there.   It was from Grink 3, and since I hadn't learned to place my cards on a mule yet to prvent cards rotting, and someone else was actually in the zone, I GAVE IT AWAY...  I still kick myself for that one.<br />
<br />
  But if you want assurance that it CAN drop where you are hunting, I got it in AiW3, can also get crowns off the TC in forest (got a red off him before) and Donk (easiest mob in the entire GAME, 62 ranger friend solo'd him and with just self regen finished fight full health and full mana)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Best part about being bound in PoM, is that when you happen to die, you get a chance at rotting cards.  I have gotten a few crowns and a throne this way.</div></div><hr />
