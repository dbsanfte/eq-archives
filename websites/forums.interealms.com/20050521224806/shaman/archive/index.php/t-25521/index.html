<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am not a computer person but I was thinking this is the best board there is for eq1 so figured I would try to get some advice here. For the past few days I have been going linkdead before I can even get into the game. It happens on multiple characters and I dont think it is my connection because other games in house such as eq2/wow have been having no problems at all. I reset the cable modem and the router and tried a complete file check. My next step is to contact tech support but it seems this board has a lot of technically knowledgeable people so was hoping one of you had some ideas. I was hoping there may be a setting I could change or something. I had been playing fine all week the suddenly cant even log in because of the ld's. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I would appreciate any ideas.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigsnack For'Mobs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't really tell you for sure but can give you a couple things to try.<br />
<br />
1.  If you are camped in PoK try to make a run to another zone before you go LD.  A lot of people have problems with PoK, especially logging on in that zone.<br />
<br />
2.  Turn your journal off.  Use Alt-J to access.  Journal records NPC emotes and seems to cause frame freezes a lot or worse.<br />
<br />
3.  Turn your log off.  /log off.  Also delete or rename and move your log file if it is very large.<br />
<br />
4.  Use sky off or set to simple.  Turn down your graphics settings in Options.<br />
<br />
5.  If you are getting booted before you log in from character select screen (quickly booted not like normal LD boot) you will probably need to contact SoE tech.  That happened to me last Monday.  I visisted the chat room and it looked like it was happening to random people on all servers.  It cleared up for me so I haven't worried about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>7ekno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Sounds like a eqclient.ini fault ....<br />
<br />
Firstly, try going into the 'options' screen .... from that screen, change your screen resolution down one ..... sometimes, if you have played with screen resolutions in game, the eqclient.ini file can get screwed up ....<br />
<br />
Secondly, if the first one didn't work, find eqclient.ini file in the everquest directory, and delete it .... then re-try to play EQ ....<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of the above will work, good luck )<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You guys rock..thank you..problem fixed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yes ... but which of the above, or what did you do to fix it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>EQOracle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Im really not sure exactly what fixed it. I was logged in riftseekers so I messed around in the advanced options and changed some settings and stuff, also did another complete file check making sure all boxes were checked. Haven't had a problem since.</div></div><hr />
