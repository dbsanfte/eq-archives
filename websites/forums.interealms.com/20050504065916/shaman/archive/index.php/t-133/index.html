Goofed up - this was meant as a reply to a &quot;what race should I play&quot; thread<br />
/EDIT End<br />

Actually, there's some confusion going on because the boards were recently wiped.  So you can't find the 10000000 threads on this subject :)  Anyways, you can ask this question and everyone can make darn good reasons to play a particular race.  Basically, the answer is this - pick the race that looks the coolest/will give you the most enjoyment playing.  <br />
<br />
Barbs and Vah Shir are basically equal - sort of average, nothing really bad or really good.  Vah Shir can't wear fungi tunics, but they get an equivilent item on the moon - you'r platless so it doesn't matter.  No exp penalty so they level quick.<br />
<br />
Trolls and Iksar - they get regen at the price of an exp penalty.  People will make a case for Iksar not being able to JBB but since you're platless, it doesn't really matter.  Trolls can get some snare necklace thingy - you decide if the exp penalty is worth it.<br />
<br />
Ogres - this may be the one race that stands out from the others a bit.  They can't be stunned from the front.  They have the most strength and the largest hitpoint pool - also nice.  However, I believe they have a small exp penalty (not sure though).  Ogres seem to be the best race at lvl 60 but that's a LONG way away - especially when you gotta do it platless...<br />
<br />
What did I pick?  Vah Shir.  Probably the least popular race.  There's also some other things people will add to this, but in the end it really doesn't matter.  I dig the moon, kitties look cool in plate, I really don't want to bother with an exp penalty (which ultimately regen probably won't matter) and the nexus provides easy transport back to home...  Play whatever you think would be cool and realize that race really doesn't matter much with the shaman class.<br />
