<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have the itch to try farming for spells - some questions:<br />
<br />
- What is the respawn time on Cliff Golems?<br />
<br />
- What is the respawn time on Guardian Wurms?<br />
<br />
- Are there any soloable/duoable PoP mobs that drop runes?<br />
<br />
- I have never tried the Juggernaut camp. I know I can't single pull there. How many mobs per pull are we talking about? Two? Five? Is there a safe spot to pull to?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I live in Skyfire - know it like the back of my hand!  GW very frustrating - not enough of them - I 2 box and PL other characters while trying to get them to spawn.  The other nite I could not get a single GW to spawn in about 3 hours of killing ph at vp zone.  I have been hunting there pretty heavy for about 3 months now (I know,  I am easy to entertain) and have seen one Malo and one Torpor drop.  I have seen tons of empty GW bodies and tons of GW bodies with really crappy spells - but on occasion once or twice a week I can get a juicey spell drop which enables me to buy some new ornate armor or other goodies for my little army of troopers.  I bought my malo and torpor, and would not recommend that you try and farm GW to get them -but as a source of income GW are ok for me.  We all farmers - no?  Their spawn time is kinda random.  THere are 3 or 4 Elder wyverns that are the ph for them at vp entrance and their are 3 or 4 that roam the zone - I see one or 2 over by ragefire spot alot and one over by where talendor hangs out and one in between vp entrance and rf spot.  Also, kill ancient wyvern whenever possible - he is easier than gw and can drop goodies - he usualy paths between ot zone and dragon gy by bw zone.  Nothing in zone sees invis - this is nice at times - but they seem to have limited agro range and all seem to be slow movers.  Another nice thing is easy to get to and you can go afk relatively safely.  I wish I could find a few more spots like this as it is really to my liking.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just clear all the elder wyverns in front of VP. Any of the 5 statics and 1 wanderer can spawn a g wurm. Respawn is about 10 mintues give or a take a few. I normally get 1 a hour and I have *finally* gotten torpor to drop though it's about a year after I needed it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Several named in the tactics pit are soloable, and can rarely (very rarely) drop runes.  They drop spectrals a bit more often than that.  Most of the mobs there don't summon, I don't remember if the named do or not (I don't think so on most).  They also drop some items and ornate molds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The only soloable-by-shaman mobs that drop runes that I know of, are tactics pit named like Jaruden said.   Tactics is my primary exp zone and I have killed dozens of pit nameds and I have seen a total of one rune.<br />
<br />
If you are duoing with an enchanter, or possibly charm enabled mage, you might be able to get the wing bosses in BoT.  They can drop ornate pants and other loot in addition to runes.<br />
<br />
Been a while since I have been to Juggs, but if you are careful the biggest pull you should get is 3.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have a couple of motivations. First off, I have never tried to kill a cliff golem or guardian wurm, so there is the challenge. Second of all, I am starting to multibox a little army (shaman and mage, and adding enchanter and necro when my new computer comes in) and all of them need spells. Lastly, my shaman is rapidly approaching 65 and I don't have any spells over 63. Of course, I can farm for cash then buy the spells, but I'm sick to death of killing light blues in sebilis. <br />
<br />
I was hoping that if Cliff Golems and/or Guardian Wurms spawned fairly frequently that I could whack a few of them a night, and maybe once every few days get a drop that's either usable or worth enough cash to buy a spell....</div></div><hr />
