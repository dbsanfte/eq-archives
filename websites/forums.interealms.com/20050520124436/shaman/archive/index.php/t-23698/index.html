<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've heard rumours that lvl 68 to 69 is the mother of all lvls, a friend in my guild spoke to someone in Beta, they suggested that getting to lvl 69 from 68 is the equal to the xp required to get from lvl 1 to lvl 60! Now that would suck!! anyone know if this is the case (beta players)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Its possible that the raw amount of exp is similar to 1-60, but if you are fighting lvl 68 mobs that give huge amounts of exp, you shouldn't notice a difference I'd imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">sow is slower when you are going from 68 to 69 too!  Oh, and a fungi tunic would become no drop when equipped at this level, but of course, assuming 68-69 was this much experience, 69-70 would have to be more.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">from my understanding 66 to 68 reasonable slow , but not that bad,  <br />
68 to 70 will be longer, though i cant say how much longer but it does seem to be more grind</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zamiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Level 66 is a hell level, so think level 65 experience times 2.<br />
Level 67 is much faster than 66.<br />
Level 68 is a hell level, taking a bit longer than 66.<br />
Level 69 is not a hell level.<br />
Level 70 experience is very, very easy (even easier than at level 65 for some reason). You will be able to max your level 70 experience very quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Personally my experience last night was that lvl 66 requires ~ 3 times as much exp as 65. My bard wasn't full 65 while my shaman dinged off one golem kill in PoV before starting real exp camp for the night. In the time it took my bard to get the ~40% more exp to finish off 65 my shaman got ~15% xp in 66. That puts lvl 66's exp at 2-3 times the exp of 65 and probably closer to 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Going from 65 to 66 probably eliminates the &quot;close to level&quot; bonus you get for fighting mobs 5 or less levels lower than you. If you were fighting level 60 mobs, I imagine thats what happened. Plus each level has allways taken more xp than the preceeding one (except level 60). I dont know what the increase is offhand, but its probably of the order of 10-20% more. Those two things combined might account for what you saw.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A group of Altera Vita guildmates and myself just completed a 21.5 hour exp grind to ding us all level 70. So i thought i'd post and share some data with everyone that's interested in what they can expect.<br />
<br />
First, the entire grind was done in PoFire in teh second castle. All mobs were level 68. The exact time of the grind took 21:38:40 (rounded to the nearest :05). We killed 1255 mobs. That averages to 0.3195% reg exp/mob and 0.30877%exp/minute.<br />
<br />
here's teh breakdown in # of mobs it took to ding each level.<br />
<br />
67 - 261<br />
68 - 291<br />
69 - 332<br />
70 - 371<br />
<br />
Additionally, AA exp on these mobs at lvl 70 was right at 4%/mob as compared to 5%/mob at 65.<br />
<br />
I hope this information proves useful and informative to those heading out this week to grind it out.<br />

Unless oow zones give more than about 5%? at level 70? which i dont know, if they do them maybe they still have an arguement, but i think that at 70 you`ll probably get about 5% .</div></div><hr />

Mobs give you a set amount of XP according to YOUR level. Whether that XP goes into your regular bar or you AA bar is up to you. I am pretty sure something red to a 65 gives more XP than the same mob that is blue to a 70. <br />
<br />
OoW has barely been scratched, but I am willing to bet there are a BUNCH of places where the AAXP at lvl 70 will be better than Fire or KT. I think the AA scaling is just fine as it is. Nothing looks overly expensive. Even the Gates AAs look reasonable just by XPing in KT or Vxed. Gaining AA isnt going to be hard, but nothing is going to be &quot;handed out&quot; either.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that was changed a while back to encourage groups to attempt more challenging content, or something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just a fyi on what i've seen in KT.<br />
<br />
With full groups:<br />
all level 65, 1% reg xp a kill or so<br />
<br />
all level 66, 1% every few kills, I was averaging 10% reg xp an hour for about 10 hours (2 sessions) But i know people that did level 66 in 8 hours.<br />
<br />
at level 67, the xp rate is about the same as 66 from what i've heard.<br />
<br />
at level 68, xp rate gets a lot more unfriendly</div></div><hr />

I don't think that much of the difference was from the difficult fight bonus they had put in. It was done in kod'taz so was a mix of blues to yellows at 66. Some of the yellows where red at 65 which would put them at 68. I'm pretty sure that the blues in KT are in the 62-64 range too. I'm sure this had a slight effect on the rate at which I gained exp vs my bard but not nearly tripple.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Any word on racial penalties?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Xilinx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Racial penalties are still in for reg xp, heard lots about them from an iksar monk relative to a wood elf war.  Needless to say the scaley monk was falling further and further behind.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Of course, nothing I can find on the steel warrior or his website indicates his race.  What was his exp penalty on that?<br />
<br />
Do we need to divide all those numbers by 80% to get to iksar/troll kills?<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">EXP from 66-70 isn't that bad, youll get it done and once its done its done. The problem is AAs at 70 are like double to triple the time they took at 65. I hope once we find the later OOW zones it will be better. The AA costs are pretty unreasonable if you have to multipl them by 3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Does this mean for folks who are going to take a LONG time to get to 70, there may be an argument to grind some essential OOW AA's at 65 first?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">From my experience, the exp was almost exactly the same from 66-70. Each level I was checking and getting right around .3% a kill. At 69, every once in a while I would get 0% but the good majority of the time it was .3% a kill. At 70 it is always .3% a kill and aa xp is right around 4% a kill (all of this was at c2 in PoFire).<br />
<br />
Roxxanne, honestly I would try to get 67 or 68 so you can unlock Ancestrial Aid. Its a great aa and I'm loving it. Also the runes for those levels seem to be very easy to come by and it would suck if the group didn't let you roll because you weren't of level to use them. Just my opinion though =)</div></div><hr />
