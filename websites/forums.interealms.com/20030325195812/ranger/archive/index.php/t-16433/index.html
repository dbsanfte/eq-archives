<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>whaerf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I finally got to VSR first and we killed him easily.. YaY!<br />
<br />
The hole will be a snap I know, can plan that raid anytime.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if anyone would be willing to give me an idea of the time requirements for the ranger stone in Air though?  Guilds on my server reserve PoA on a calendar to avoid nastiness, and PoA is the only one guilds can reserve for days at a time, because it takes that long.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure I could talk my guild and alliance members to going up for days at a time, most of them (including me) are more casual than that.<br />
<br />
Can you get to the Griffon Isle and clear it in an 8 hour raid, or should I be looking hard for an MQ?<br />
<br />
And, hehe, if anyone is going up there on Morelle Thule without all the stones spoken for, I'd love to be a guest. I'll behave!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If your guild is largely unexperienced with PoS, you could find it takes longer than 8 hours to get to pegasus isle, but it's probably doable with some organisation.  The first time I went there we made it to that island on the first day, but didn't finish clearing, simply because most of us were inexperienced with the place.   I really enjoy PoS, I'd recommend you go there if you can, but do make sure you do your research well.  For example, make sure you already have a plan of action mapped out should someone fall out of the plane (ie are you going to try to get them back, or forget about them).   There is no CotH in PoS, so moving people around when they get left behind/fall off etc is a big time-wasting pain if you haven't worked out beforehand what you're going to do when it happens.    <br />
<br />
It is probably the easiest epic MQ to get, though, because each full clearing of the island yields 6 spheres.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Just to hijack abit, how much to MQuests cost? I am just gonna buy it for my Swifty (dont really spend more than 3-4 hours on at a time so raiding PoA really isnt  an option for me :( VSR and Hole are doable (I think) but PoA just isnt<br />
<br />
oh and Amise, can you PM me if ya have one perchance? I would be VERY interested in buying the mqest from you in the near future (I am also on Torv). Just need a Reaver, VSR and the Hole :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Amise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">About 5k for a SSoC MQ on Torv.  I don't have one myself (haven't been guilded for a few months so I haven't really been raiding) but Thermopylae were up there today, so they might have some.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Cool, ty. Just need a few more items :p (like a Hole raid)</div></div><hr />
