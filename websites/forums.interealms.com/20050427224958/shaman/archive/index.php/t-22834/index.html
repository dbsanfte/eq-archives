<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am starting to seriously consider trying to get the page for researching Remove Greater Curse from this zone. I've heard they drop most commonly from the &quot;zorro&quot; looking guys in the zone. I have yet to go into the zone, although I know where to go to access it. However, I have several questions.<br />
<br />
1. What level shaman would be able to solo there? What is to be expected from the mobs that I'd be soloing there (do they run, melee vs caster types, etc)? Any tips?<br />
<br />
2. How far into the zone are they? Is there a safe area nearby to set up? Can I get to it safely using invisibility? Is there a link to a map of the zone?<br />
<br />
3. Given the name of the zone, is there anything &quot;mischievous&quot; I can expect from the zone?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately I haven't been into PoM in a while, so my advice won't be the greatest, but at the least I can hope to trigger other people replying with better knowledge ;)<br />
<br />
   When you zone into PoM you will be standing on a blue dias with a forest in front of you.  Invis yourself since the denzens of the forest are all quite KOS to everyone last I heard.  Head through the forest to the moat.<br />
<br />
  At the moat you will see a bridge leading up onto the first wall of the castle, that bridge doesn't actually exist and you will fall through to the water.   Head to the left or right as you prefer and look for the first bend in the wall.  Right at that bend is the actual ramp up onto the wall.  Walk straight toward the wall just before where it bends and you should catch on the ramp.  If you fail, back up and try again, lev helps so that you can adjust a bit before falling to the water each attempt.<br />
<br />
<br />
   The halflings you want to fight are right there on the first wall as I recall with the revamp.  Supposed to be pretty easy kills, so just head to one end of the wall and take em down.  I'd imagine that with mage gear and mini-torpor you can handle them from 58 on up relatively easily if skilled at the solo.<br />
<br />
  As for mischief, it has all been systematically removed from the zone.  The place is completely boring now :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This zone is a hoot.<br />
<br />
As you run from Zone-in through the woods to the castle, I'd con everything 1st as named do see invis and there are 4 possible named out in the courtyard.<br />
<br />
The zorro's hit for 250+, are slowable and are on a narrow wall outside the castle above the moat.  Meaning that mage pet toys are bad unless you are good at controlling push.  Rot/dot is the way to go.<br />
<br />
Old timers are mad that this is an exp zone and easily acessible now (the Old PoM was neither), but it remains on of the best designed zones in the game and exen as an exp zone it's weird enough and hard enough to put most roups off.<br />
<br />
One example is zone out, you'll be using gae of course but not gaters w/o a port have to find one tree in the whole forest that ports them out and that drops them into the middle of the water in CS.  The run  back from there for them isn't usually fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Or, as the considerate Shaman you are, you could make them a FoB port potion.  ;)<br />
<br />
All kidding aside, PoM can be fun, but don't underestimate the mobs.  Things can get out of hand in a hurry here.  If they do, 10 second cast on Gate might be more than you have to live.</div></div><hr />

The Dastardly Rascals are rogues.  They do backstab and will run on low health.  Be sure to have root mem'd!  All are single pulls except for the two directly past the bridge (entrance to building).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">PoM is great fun. I usually go with a group of three. The big named Bixxy is near the zone in. She drops An Amusing Bauble everytime from what I've seen. Nice range item. She can't be slowed, summons, and kills me quicker than I can run away. LOL.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bzzzibuzzana can be slowed but mitigates to 25%ish<br />
Does summon<br />
Hits in the 250-300 range<br />
Can drop a Rogue/Bard dagger but common is Amusing Bauble (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24549) <br />
<br />
All 4 courtyard named are pure melee, mitigate slow, summon and have 2 drops.<br />
<br />
Funky Skunk has a decent back item for Shaman Mystical Skunk Hide Cloak (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24629) <br />
<br />
Irritating Mushroom drops a halfway descent neck item Spore Necklace of Rot (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24552) <br />
<br />
Maddened Mushroom Man drops a Moldy ring of Mirth (http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/item.html?item=24571) which isn't great but not bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember trying to solo Bzzzibuzzana once long time ago.  Glad there was a cleric in the zone. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">at 46 i tried to slow bzzibuzzana. That was that time that time that I died.... Oh, and the rest of my group died, what with no healer and all. <br />
<br />
I should edit my previous post to say that &quot;she can't be slowed by a 46 Shaman with no HP's&quot;... LOL</div></div><hr />
