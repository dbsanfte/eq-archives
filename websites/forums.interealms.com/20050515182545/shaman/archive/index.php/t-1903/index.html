<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there a reason why Magelo posts my AC as 507, when it is 538? My current shaman is 19, defense maxed, and unbuffed EQ says 538. I am just wondering if being Iksar makes a difference, or if Magelo is just a little (A *little*???) off. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time, I know how much people love answering questions like these ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Humbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There is an option that asks for your unbuffed ac without your gear on for your current level, I think on the first screen when you log in. Try that and see if it changes any when you look at your profile with your gear on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ya, I have my unbuffed, nekkid AC on the first page correct (I bagged all my gear to find it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you've got all the correct equipment in then it could be Magelo.<br />
<br />
AC can be a little off, the HP calculations are normally very good. It can't be easy working out how to make it all add up correctly especially when theres several things that effect your AC.<br />
<br />
What I normally do with my alts profiles is to adjust the naked ac until it looks a little more as it should. Once you get to higher levels it gets a bit more accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Make sure all your buffs are off. I know kinda of obvious but you never know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kervin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Magelo &quot;tries&quot; to duplicate the math used for calculating AC and ATK since they depend on more things than just level. Check out their forums in the site. You will find that they are aware that sometimes the values are a bit off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its usually only 1 or 2 points off, not 31.  Triple check your gear. 99% of the people I've had to trouble shoot with your problem had the wrong gear listed or worn in one slot or another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I use EQW, so I had my character inventory opened, and checked several times. As for the nekkid/unbuffed AC, that is correct for certain as well =) <br />
<br />
1) All buffs (even SoW) were clicked off<br />
2) I had absolutely no gear on when I entered my nekkid AC<br />
3) I checked my gear at least 4 times, with magelo open as well as my char inventory (I love EQW)<br />
<br />
I mean, this isn't a huge deal, I just found it odd that it was that far off... realizing there would be SOME error, I didn't expect 30 points of AC in difference ;-) Thanks for the thoughts though.</div></div><hr />
