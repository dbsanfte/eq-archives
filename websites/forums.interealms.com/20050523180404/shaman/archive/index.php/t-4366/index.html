<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This isnt actualy for a shaman . I have a 25 Warrior im thinking of aking my main alt . He has been leveling with my GF . well i dropped some nice gear on him and now i like him so much im going to pull him away from her * i level alot faster then her* . i gave her a new troll SK ( sexy beast0r ) to couple with her druid .<br />
<br />
ok so anyway . where is good for a warrior to go , he is currently in stonebrunt which is slow cause no one else is there to group with :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Marus Seru has been good to me at 25 for both my characters, usually easy to get a group and even if you can't I soloed my warrior there quite a bit to work on my bind wounds skill until a group came along.</div></div><hr />
