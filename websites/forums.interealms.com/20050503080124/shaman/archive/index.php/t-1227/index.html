<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Got some spiritcallers arms to quest in kael...been smooshing tons and tons of stinkin dwarves for heads...rare drop it seems. I get about 1 head for every 10 I kill. <br />
<br />
Anyway, curious about what faction I need. Currently Kindly to Zek, KOS to Riff and tormax. Pretty sure I need ally for zek, and just need to not be KOS to the other 2 so I dont get ganked trying to hand it in. <br />
<br />
BTW THANKS ASSES WHO KILL CAPT BVEL. :P<br />
<br />
Where is the best spot to get dwarf heads? Been killing all the wolfmasters that pop outside thurg with my trusty druid in tow. I heard there are some mines in that zone somewhere where heads have a better chance at dropping. Never been there. Anyone know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Woland</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You need to be at least dubious to king Tormax (to reach the quest NPCs) and you need ally faction with the quest NPC (Komzek faction).<br />
<br />
Try to show up whenever Dain is being killed on your server. Getting faction from the kill gives a huge +Tormax hit. <br />
<br />
And for the Kromzek faction, the least painful way is to hunt in west ToV. You get Kromzek faction for each dragon kill there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If your level 60, and want to make decent experience while collecting heads, then yes head to the dwarf mines is the place to be.<br />
The expediton guards are all blue to 60, and can drop heads at same rate as the guards around the river. You just can't slay them as quickly.<br />
<br />
The mines are located in Great Divide at around location (-6000, -3500). It's south of the Giant Fort near the wizard spires by EW zone.<br />
There's a cave you can go down in, and miners and guards to kill.<br />
If you pull from the correct spot you can get the guards singly at level 60. There is 6 guards you can kill plus a named one I usually avoid. Respawn here is very quick, and they are static spawns.<br />
<br />
For factions, you need:<br />
+ZEK Ally<br />
+Tormax Dubious (tormax faction in our quest giver room)<br />
+Rif doesn't matter, you don't run into these guys near the quest rooms, and can invis into the bank area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gaining faction can be done without a lot of heads, depending on where you do your raiding.<br />
<br />
Woland is correct, Dain is a huge +Tormax hit.  Several others in Icewell have associated Tormax hits as well, including Senechal.<br />
<br />
Two hours in Icewell, with time split between the little ones up front and the Royal Guards higher up, will fix most faction problems.  I reversed from negative giant to ally with a few Icewell raids, and GD hunting.  Total heads turned in was about 10.<br />
<br />
Other spots:<br />
ToV... west and front.  +Zek hits.<br />
Skyshrine... +Zek and Riff (I think)<br />
Velks... collect paws for turn in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup done plenty of WW dragon smooshing (+zek +riff)<br />
<br />
plenty of wurms/wyverns in SS (got tons of 45-60 spells and some really weird loot) (+Zek only) (those stupid cubes are hard as hell to slow without malo, and they can split sometimes into annoying 40+ hitting greenies which is maddening)<br />
<br />
Ahh thanks for the advice Vic. on the other dwarves. Honestly, if they drop heads at the same rate as the greenies, then forget it. I can kill all 6 or so spawns of the wolfmasters at once, causing them to respawn quickly. Not really looking for more AA exp, just want my lewtz as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
BTW I have been attacked randomly in the bank while not invis on 2 separate occasions. Dont remember the dudes name but he isnt on Zek faction obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yah, there is a wandering rif guy who loves to start making train's out of the bank. <br />
<br />
BTW, if your REALLY just after the armor turn in's and have zek at ally already, you can get a warrior to offtank the tormax faction guy in the quest room while you quickly do the turn in's. <br />
Just be careful when sneaking through tormax's throne room area or get a COH.</div></div><hr />
