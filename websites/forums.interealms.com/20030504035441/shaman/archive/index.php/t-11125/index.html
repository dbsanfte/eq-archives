<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kiegh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering if I could duo the Emp chottal room in Seb w/ my ranger friend.  He's got decent gear and he's level 55, I've got epic and horse and ft4 at the moment.  Please let me know, I'm in search of Torpor/Malo/Pox and I've heard that this is a decent spot that's not so hard to get those spells but they are rare.<br />

Someone answer me please? I don't know whether this is a good idea and would like to hear your opinions.  Thanks<br />

Emp and Blood are easy to slow and thus easy to fight. I have tanked them both with a 56th Rogue in mediocre gear. With epic and KEI and maybe some cleric buffs you should be able to solo the sucker. I've never tried so I don't know what's involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did at 60 2boxing a 51 rog. The only probllem I had was when he ran. With snar after you get in the room (have a rog buddy tag along to let you in) that wont be a probllem for you. But if he gates kiss it goodbye your done for.</div></div><hr />
