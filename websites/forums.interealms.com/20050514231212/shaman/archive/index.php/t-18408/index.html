<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eci_shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A friend of mine asked me this the other day.  I never thought about it before and was curious as to what other shaman would answer.  The question took me off guard and made me think...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If and when you quit EQ (for real), where is the last spot you will camp out at?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For me, I would use that 4 charge DA ring and camp right in front of Cazic Thull in fear... mocking him for one last time.  (If I die, oh well, was fun creating a train...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ohh the ol &quot;go out with a bang or a whimper&quot; question.  Good one.<br />
<br />
Shaman - At first I would say something to do with Epic. But no. Probably Halas or BlackBurrow after a massive buffing and plat, item giveaway to the young barbarians who aren't twinks or being PL'ed.<br />
<br />
Enchanter - Something to do with Sebilis. Probably solo my way down to Disco or Chef.<br />
<br />
Monk - Friggin Chardok where I spent (and forced others to spend 25 hours + waiting for betrayer). <br />
<br />
And if not CHardok then HS or Sebilis 'Shroom King. Can't solo so will be feign flop all the way down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">leave my fully equipped corpse in in front of the nexus stone, then camp out at my bind spot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The first time I quit for real, my very first character, a human enchanter, camped out at felwithe, fishing (because that was what he loved to do), and getting drunk.  He was depressed because his poor eyesight caused him to get killed in the unrest tunnel to zoneout.<br />
<br />
Er, actually, that wasn't when I quit fully-- I think that was when I killed Aanladil with a guard, deleted him, and created a new Aanladil so that I could have a level 1 dwarf cleric with JBoots (back when that was possible, hehe).<br />
<br />
Anyway, now that I think about it, the last 2-3 times I quit for real, I didn't go anywhere special.<br />
<br />
O/T.. what memories, hehe.  I used to transfer stuff to my brother by running under the docks in south qeynos and dropping bags of stuff off and quickly logging him in, always paranoid that someone else was hiding nearby to pick it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Moot point.<br />
<br />
none of us addict gonna quit before server go down.<br />
<br />
That is, if WoW isnt good enough.<br />
<br />
But if i had to... i guess that would be in blackburrow, guk, or PoAir. Old school was so the best era :)<br />
<br />
Little mention for trak lair and Veeshan Peak.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I havn't reactivated my account since being gone for a bit over a year.  I'm thinking of returning but playing something new.<br />
<br />
My monk however, is logged out under Nagafen.  That isn't that rare for me though.  I used to log out there all the time for kicks.  There and the efreeti room.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i camped out in pok bank.. im l33t!<br />
but then again someone has my account now.. so i guess i dont count</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Id have to say I'd camp out in Dalnir, by the lumpy goo spawn. That i where my monk had the best time ever solo'ing. He has never soloed as well or with as much fun as back in 2000/2001 when he was in his mid thirties. Solo'ing that spawn made him rich beyond measure (he had fricken 11k at one time, which he bought a FBSS with).<br />
<br />
Ah, and for my shaman, obviously will be in the halas bank, where i met a kindly level 54 shaman (uber level) back in 2000 who gave me a spell that I wouldnt mem untill 3 years later (level 49 pet). ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Western Wastes, right next to Yeldema.<br />
*patpats the poor gimp dragon*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Eisgeist</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I would get naked in Everfrost in front of Halas where it all started and aggro maybe 20 gnolls, polar bears, skellies, etc...<br />
<br />
Let them beat on may for an hour or however long it takes until I die and let my aged, worn corpse freeze over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">On one of the stone hands of Innoruuk in Innothule swamp, where the Troll shaman vendor used to be.  Only now it's some butthole frog, so I'd have to kill it first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Im camping out in CoM, by the stables. Never in all my seasons have a found a place that was more of a home to me.<br />
<br />
Incidentaly, no matter what WoW or EQ2 is like, its time to move on rom EQ. Change is that which is what life is about. Staying fresh and moving on to learn of new places and adventures and memories is the only way you stay alive. Otherwise your a shell of memories.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Is this like one of those &quot;If you were stranded on a deserted island . . .&quot; questions? <br />
<br />
I guess I would have to say wherever I happen to be camped the day before I decide to quit EQ forever. I hardly think that I will say to myself &quot;Well, going the quit EQ forever now, wonder where I should camp out&quot;. I just don't see the &quot;end&quot; happening like that. If anything, I will pass my accounts to my guild, for them to use if needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Eventually there will be a final day.  Sony will unplug the servers.  I think the original poster meant at this time if you are still playing, where will you &quot;die&quot;.<br />
<br />
Turc will probably die where he was born, the frozen lands of the north, in his hometown, Halas.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm going to do whatever it takes to get into the shaman guild in Grobb, kill every frog that I can and then die on a heap of my enemies, preferably by my beloved Spear of Fate.  (Yes, I watched the Last Samurai this week  :D )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>woon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">lol awesome. you took the words right out of my mouth Grimdreg. Btw damn good movie</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Get myself killed in battle somewhere (doesn't matter really), go naked to PoJ and log out in the middle of the circle of the Tribunal.  Let your corpse rot and go to meet your gods when you die. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thanks for the spoiler, Grim :(  I hadn't seen it yet, and it was on my list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'm not sentimental about it, whereever I end up is whereever I end up.<br />
<br />
If I really wanted to take my time and quit &quot;right&quot;, I might actually level up a young character into the mid-30's and group with some strangers, find some struggling young shaman without a rich main (if possible) and give my droppable gear to him.<br />
<br />
More likely I'll just get distracted by something in real life, and a few months later decide to stop paying the EQ bill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>2hawks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I camped out in the Bazaar on Stormhammer in January of this year. It was a quiet, and peaceful way to go listening to the hustle and bustle of the busy community around me. I felt it was fitting that Ironhand's spirit disperse there. I can honestly say that I will not be back to EQ. It had it's shining moments, but I knew it was time for me to leave.<br />
<br />
You might ask why am I posting on this board? Well it is kind of like driving past the house you grew up in after it has been sold. You know you will never go in, but you lived there for so long and developed such fond and loving memories, that it is good to look at it and sigh with reminiscence at the nostalgia of good times spent.<br />
<br />
There are greater games for me on the horizon that do not deal with fantasy RPGs. I will make my home there in the future.<br />
<br />
*Bows and disappears back into the crowd*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Grimdreg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for the spoiler, Grim :(  I hadn't seen it yet, and it was on my list.<br />
<br />
Don't worry Vixy, no spoiler there.  I'm just talking about being inspired by that whole samurai warrior ethic portrayed in the film.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Wing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I did thought about this.<br />
For sure I will be in my bear form and camp out at Halas ramp (the ramp you run into the tunnel before you zone into Halas)<br />
Because I am a barbarian shaman.<br />
<br />
It feels good to look out to the snow from the top of the ramp and feeling something is out there waiting for you.<br />
<br />
And when my shaman was young, I lived in EF for 2 weeks and within that 2 weeks I camp out at that ramp everytime I logout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I'd camp out right where the Sleeper used to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Riaz Whitepaws</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">When the day comes for me to quit EQ I will be kneeling in front on My King in Shir Vhal best way to end it in front of the Lord your served for many years</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm not sure who posted it, but it was his &quot;good-bye&quot; post (he was leaving EQ).  He likened himself to a Great Polar bear, went into a cave and collapsed the entrance tunnel, and went to sleep.  It was so good an ending, it actually brought a tear to my eye to read it!!  Anyhow, I think my final days would have to be in either Split Paw, or the Mammy Ramp in Everfrost,  Those were the 2 places that I learned how to really be a Shaman.  Everything else kinda seems like window dressing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">When the time comes, I'll go sit with Bandl in Everfrost for a little while and then retire to my snowbank in Halas.  I've probably camped there more often than not over the years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Rotun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">IMO, most people that quit EQ do not care where they are camped.  They are done with the game, so it has no meaning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference in the types of players mentioned here.  One type is tired of EQ or just doesn't like it anymore.  The other type is the ones who have played for a long time and they only will quit when there are no servers to log onto.  <br />
EQ has let me stay close to friends that have moved across the country and it has let me meet many new people that I would never have had a chance to meet before.  EQ is not my whole life (I have a wife, children, friends and a job), but it is more than a game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">There is a difference in the types of players mentioned here.

<br />
Or a third type that more or less describes me... basically tired of EQ, but have too much time and effort invested in the character to be completely uncaring about his eventual in-game fate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vittra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I will return back to vah shir and camp infront of my king.<br />
=) Yes. I am a vah shir kitty shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">&quot;I'm going to do whatever it takes to get into the shaman guild in Grobb, kill every frog that I can and then die on a heap of my enemies, preferably by my beloved Spear of Fate.&quot;<br />
<br />
Amen brother.<br />
<br />
I am taking an army of trolls (however many I can gather) and making one final stand in grobb fighting as far and as deep into my homeland as I can.  Wherever I fall is where I stay for good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">In the middle of the Plane of time, strewn about with Player and NPC corpses, &quot;Enarcheos_pet_98&quot; behind me, spamming &quot;Feet move faster&quot; message, encumbered by 500,000,000 platinum, holding warrior epics in each hand, and surrounded by 20 or so GMs looking at me angrily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">More likely I'll just get distracted by something in real life, and a few months later decide to stop paying the EQ bill.<br />
That goes for me as well.<br />
<br />
When I stopped playing my first Shaman I simply stopped playing. I didn't know it was going to be the last time I logged her on but it was. She was camped out in the Bazaar.<br />
<br />
I did start playing again but the same will probably happen again with my new Shaman. When I move this spring I'll probably play less and less...and end up camped out for good in PoK or something. I wish I could think of something more dramatic but when I leave EQ I'll most likely just log off one day and that'll be it.</div></div><hr />
