<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is not the first time, neither the last time, when Amazon announces some release date, which is way off the rocker. I wouldn't trust them as far as I can throw the anvil, and I can't throw that thing far. So, basically, until SOE announces the release date, my reaction to the dates from any other source is like &quot;Yeah right...&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Same site that said doom3 for june .<br />
<br />
I dont see no doom3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">have they even started beta yet ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I actually got that Arse of a game EQ RTS Lords of Everquest.  Worst game ever...I'd rather Watch Dungeons and Dragons the Movie instead of playing Lords of EQ.  Anyway....they say they guarantee you a spot on Beta if you got that hell hole of a game so I got it and signed up.  I even got the reply that &quot;You are already going to be a Beta Tester&quot; when I tried signing up for the open Beta a few months ago.  I havent heard anything yet about when it will start.<br />
<br />
OH and yeah those release dates are way way off.  They typically just keep pushing them back a month at a time.  &quot;Ooops that game says it was supposed to be out yesterday... kick it forward a month will you?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as I know, no Beta testing has begun yet.  And with the &quot;new and improved focus on the &quot;customer&quot; (Brenlo quote &quot;Whats a customer?&quot;) I would think that they would be sure and test the new game.  <br />
<br />
Of course, EQ2 is being done by a seperate team and this seperate team may be doing things the &quot;old&quot; (the way things were done last month) approach to game design.  If so, expect to see Beta start about August 15th and run to Sept14, when the game will ship.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Phase one beta (http://www.fortunecity.com/underworld/mario/671/beta.htm) began July 15, 1998 and EQ I was released March 16, 1999 --- 8 months beta testing.<br />

Sure we might see EQ II in September ... of next year.</div></div><hr />

If done well, yay.<br />

If done bad, it ruins you from ever reading the books again.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">the only good thing in that filum was seeing tom baker and richard o`brian(bald king of thieves).<br />
<br />
The thief charater(the black one with the stupid hat) was THE most corny and undefined character i have seenin on screen since alan shearer did tv adds for mcdees.! (were run on Uk tv)<br />
<br />
However came up with the plot/director , should be horse whipped at dawn......not a goblin/kobold in sight; it wasnt D&amp;D as i rember it!<br />
<br />
Was Very disappointied- even i could written a more intriguing plot!  Am i am a pretty crap GM (switched to Runequest for most of my attempts at running an rpg)<br />
<br />
sadly, i still own the d&amp;d dvd tho..../hide</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Osmodia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Worst movie evuh!<br />
<br />
-It had that 80's comedy/porn-music and sound goin on. <br />
-The dwarf was taller than me.<br />
-The CGI was good, but wrapped around a movie so bad, it was like going to see The Perfect Storm just to watch the waves.<br />
-My mongaloid inbred nephew came up with better DnD plots in his pen and paper game.<br />
-Jeremy Irons is the man. No one is arguing that. This is why you MUST read the script before you sign up for jobs in hollywood.<br />
-Marlan!! The hell were you thinking? Got stabbed? No cleric in the movie?<br />
-The entire cast was aligned : Chaotic Retarded!<br />

Really? By my count we're getting close to 5 1/2 years of beta testing for EQ2.</div></div><hr />

you obviously dont know how &quot;efficient&quot; soe has become with their beta testing ;o)  id give it 2 months at most...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Buffrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If that is the release date I dread the game coming out with little beta testing.  Two months of beta testing is not enough time to work out the bugs.<br />
<br />
D&amp;D the movie sucked.  I was very disappointed.  We need Peter Jackson (LOTR) to make a D&amp;D movie.  Now that would rock.  I would like to see an EQ movie too.  I think it was in the works, but they said the actors bished too much about their roles in the movie not being balanced.</div></div><hr />

I would actually buy William Shatner's greatest hits ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well it's official.  Most of the 20 people that saw D&amp;D The Movie, post on this board!<br />
<br />
I was at a LAN party last weekend and in between drunkenly going out to restaurants to harrass pretty waitresses, drunkenly playing UT2004, drunkenly playing Far Cry, drunkenly doing LDoN runs....we decided to watch a movie (drunkenly) and this dude actually has D&amp;D The Movie!  So what were we do to, but pop in Old School &amp; Euro Trip :)  <br />
<br />
Derail time: Man alive I've been giggling over Euro Trip all friggin week :)  I have that damn &quot;Scotty doesnt know&quot; song stuck in my head... cant get past the one dude's face when he's looking at the brother and sister after making out... the 15 minute &quot;No the spot isnt gone yet... try some spit&quot;.<br />
<br />
HAHAH now I'm at work giggling like a little school girl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">the D&amp;D movie is the Episode 2 to Harry Potter's Empire Strikes Back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jharassik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I can sympathize with you Gorgos, it's one of those rare movies in that genre that actually turned out to be good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Piwacket</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I've seen Euro Trip and the DD movie and laughed my A@@ off on both :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Hey now... I happened to like dungeons and dragons the movie.......<br />
In that case may I direct you to this fine list of movies that are even better then DnD:the movie (http://www.imdb.com/chart/bottom) ?<br />
<br />
When I went to see DnD I wanted to claw my eyes out at the sight of the horror that is bad acting and a couple of RPG stereotypes on top of a delicate spiderweb of a story desperately trying to web the black hole that is called &quot;plot hole&quot;. Suffice to say that desperate attempt failed, the three-and-a-half spiderweb strands of storyline could not support the truckload of messed up acting and so the plot holes sucked it all up, hopefully to die of indigestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">The D&amp;D movie was the worst made and acted film of all time, or at least near it.  Richard O'Brian was the only entertaining actor for me to watch (even more so than Irons, for me).  Aside from him being the writer of the The Rocky Horror Show, he played a part of an evil shamanistic type character in a popular Robin Hood series, in the 1980's.<br />
<br />
If an EQ movie is ever made, I can assure you it'll be 100x better than D&amp;D.</div></div><hr />
