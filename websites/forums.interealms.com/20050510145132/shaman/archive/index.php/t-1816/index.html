<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Magelo has the effect displayed as instant click, is that true?<br />
<br />
60 dd instant-click would be kind of insane if you ask me :p<br />
<br />
Although I thought I remembered reading that it was a proc, not a click anyway, but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">its a 10 second cast. the dot works out to about 5 damage per second. which is hard to notice, but then again you could just think of it as half an epic or plauge, which are both about 10-15ish dps.<br />
<br />
still, free damage is where its at for caster upgrades imo. and its a kickass range slot. and a fun 2hb toy when your bored. and, its nice to have a shaman only high end item to aspire to, finally.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Moogalak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thanks Blore :)<br />
<br />
Stupid Magelo...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The click is actually 35 dmg for 20 ticks, plus the 60 DD. Basically its a mana free 800 dmg every 2 mins. Plus the bone fits into range, which makes it a very nice soloing item. From my experience with it, the dot has standard DR resists. Nice little toy ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where did you pick up this toy?<br />
<br />
Im a sucker for procs/clickies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">High Priest of Ssraeshza drops this. Used to be a proc and was changed to a clickable in the latest patch. It was made rangeable too, as stated.</div></div><hr />
