<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maegwin Darkenwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So, some of us are in the Elemental Planes now....(my guild is almost there, just have to beat Rallos, soon...)<br />
<br />
But, to those who are already there...have you found any number of summoned mobs that make our vs summoned nukes and our imbue proc of any use?<br />
<br />
(Edit) Because if there aren't, they really DID **** us over with those two spells...I just can't see a justification for them if there isn't something for us to use them on in the elemental planes and up...they become utterly worthless ( save the execution trial in PoJ ).   And I think we should stand up and be heard on this issue...because having two worthless spells ( one is a 65 spell no less ) simply for the fact that there is no mob to USE it on is just ridiculous...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Maegwin Darkenwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">C'mon, I know there's at least a few of us in the elemental planes...anybody run into any significant amount summoned mobs or an area that has a good deal of summoned mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sylvos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">yes there are plenty of summon-type mobs.<br />
problem is - dont try to use nature's rebuke cause if you are that close you are gonna get trounced - badly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sean SpiritArrow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Elemental planes do have a lot of Elementals, but they're also mixed in with a lot of other stuff. Really, Nature's rebuke isn't woth memming unless you're purposely pulling only elementals, which you can't really do.<br />
<br />
Cry of Thunder is just as good anyways, and you'll probably have it if you're in the Elemental Planes now. CoT also has like no aggro too.<br />
<br />
The nuke is great and can be worth memming though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Maegwin Darkenwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks guys.<br />
<br />
Sylvos, I assume you mean AE rampage mobs...the range on their rampage is larger than our casting range?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aedail Mistwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sylvos, I assume you mean AE rampage mobs...the range on their rampage is larger than our casting range? <br />
<br />
Sylvos was probably talking about Nature's Rebuke, you have to be in melee range for it to proc. It doesn't work with bows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">for Nature's rebuke to really be worth meming it should be a 300 damage proc just like the paladin's vs undead proc buff Ward of Nife.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pretty much what Sean said.<br />
<br />
Cry of Thunder does 150 damage, lasts an hour, works on everything and is low agro. The extra 20 damage on summoned mobs for Nature's Rebuke isn't enough to make me buff swap, especially since I started using COT to time my hour long buffs on other people.</div></div><hr />
