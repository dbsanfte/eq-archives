<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...info please? Heard they were good XP for a while and they are animals so can I fear-kite them in SolB?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i wouldnt recommend fear kiting them, as there is alot of them.  But you can exp in solb til 60</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, thanks. I have yet to really venture into SolB, it ought be easier now that I have my Tolan's Helm, also I should really bring my friends druid with me to be my little healer biznatch.<br />
<br />
Any stratagies though for hunting them? SolB XP bonus + mobs a few levels below me + old world usually means nice XP so I am egar to try this out. Also I can get some guildies to come with me here if it helps (2-3 more 40-50 ppl).<br />
<br />
on a side note, could a 45 ranger (me), a 46 ranger (avg. untwink gear for the lvl, 43 Druid 200+ wis, a 43 chanter (not definate) and/or a 51 SK (again, not real definate, can prolly get 1 lvl 51+ person to come with us). Would the XP be worth it or would the 5 spawns not supply enough XP for the 3-5 way split?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you're bringing that many people, you're gonna wanna pull all the bats and bugs...LDC's, stone spider room, etc.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of spawns, and a group can ding 50 on bats n bugs quite easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heh, let me be more specific, solo or having the druid bot heal me is the preferable choice here, guild group is only gonna happen if I need to bring one and we will get good XP (a yellow/hour min)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rounlin Starwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">get a cleric or shammy and u could prolly do freeti too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Damn I wish I had a bot shammy, everywhere I go XP is better when I group with one :p....<br />
<br />
Thanks, so solo would be a no-go unti my 50's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Not bats, but there's no reason you couldn't smack around some Kobolds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the questions just keep coming :), I have tried the Kobolds several times, at the LS zone in and in the window room and both times I have pulled a train, any special place to hunt or should I just break the train and go on?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dranex Tical</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If there aren't many people there (and I don't imagine it being overly crowded), I used to just run around the zone in area, covering between bats, window room, champ room, and the LS zone.<br />
<br />
Just sorta ran around and made a little circuit killing kobolds. Not the stuff in the camps, just the strays everywhere else. Avoid the....oh dear, I forgot his name. From the LS zone in, you go right, and follow the path around to a little room, there's a Kobold enchanter. He sucks. He's named tho, so he's not always up.<br />
<br />
I'm not totally positive how it would work out, but I think you could also bow pull singles from the King / Champ areas, standing in the little connector room that leads to each. Just fire down the hall. Pull them back down to the ramp room or something though, cause stuff pops in that little area.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So basically use Tolan's Helm cameo to run around till I find the solo Kobolds and generally scout the area to find out where the safer spots are?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lenas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Everything minus some beetles sees invis.  Tolan's helm will do you no good here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yecna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">How does the xp killing bats/bugs compare to velks/ permafrost/ FG as a lvl 58 with pretty good equipment (Swiftwind, Wicked Mail, no fungi )?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Azareal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Name of mob is Kobold Noble if I remember correctly. And yes, he is a pain in the behind with an extremely powerful charm spell. First time there he had me beating on a 50 necro (lol). second time there he killed my wizzie friend. Third time there I killed everything there, but was 55 at the time lolol, revenge is sweet hehehe.<br />
<br />
Try not to do the bats until you get closer to 50. Zone in to the back room (from SolA side) if you want to do the bats, much safer and the zone is a step away if you need to zone. Becareful fighting on the little bridge thing at the back room though because falling in means you just about lose everything, cr is next to impossible if that happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less XP per kill, but faster kills. They also hit like an angry 2 year old, so the number you can kill between downtimes should be quite a bit.<br />
<br />
You can go to 60 running that little circuit if you have the patience. I know a lot of people, monks and rangers, that did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just a final question on this thread, the bats/bugs in SolB is more 50/55-60 then 40's-mid 50's?</div></div><hr />
