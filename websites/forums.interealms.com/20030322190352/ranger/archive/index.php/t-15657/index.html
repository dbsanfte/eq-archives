/cheers</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drienne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think it's a cool idea, but not really a good one.  On one hand, it would be a very novel use of the D&amp;D Ranger feature, allowing for the character to have one racial enemy that they do enhanced damage on.  Unfortunately, having a single racial enemy would be relatively useless, considering the variety of mob types in the game.  So, to make it useful, you'd have to allow bane imbues for a number of different mob types.  This would add a very large number of spells to the Ranger spellbook (not that we have so many to begin with).  It would also force a Ranger to sit there and try to figure out what mob type they're fighting, and what imbue they need to use for them.<br />
<br />
Forget about all that previous stuff, however.  The real trick would be to decide how much bane to use.  Will it scale with level?  While banes would be pretty cool for a low/mid-level player, it would be way overpowered for a high-end Ranger.  Take a bane imbue of +2, for example.  That doesn't seem so incredibly high-powered, right?  Well, now imagine a Ranger wielding, for example, an AHB (16/19) and a Soul Render (17/24 +4 disease).  Add the bane, and you've got an 18/19 and 23/24 (at max damage).  That's some silly damage.  Just that small increase of +2 would add about 12 damage per hit to that weapon at level 60.  That's a pretty serious increase.  Now, you might say that since it's bane damage, it's not that great.  After all, it will only work on a few mobs.  Well, if it only works on a few mobs, what's the point of having it in the first place?<br />
<br />
Just my opinion, it's a really cool idea that I could definitely imagine being added.  However, it would either be made so situational as to be barely functional, or overpowering enough for the nerf bat to come swinging.</div></div><hr />
