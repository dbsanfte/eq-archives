<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My warrior friend is trying to convince me that ranger pure melee dmg is higher than war pure melee dmg.<br />
<br />
I don't think we're near the dmg output of a war.  Anyone know of any good logs to show where we fall on that spectrum?<br />
<br />
With buffs, without buffs, with procs, etc. <br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Same level, same weapons, no buffs, should be about the same. At 55+ Rangers should do slightly more due to inherent Atk bonuses, but that advantage goes away at 60 when Warriors get Triple Attack. Beyond that, it's totally dependent upon gear and buffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TaliosTerangrea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep all do to the gear and weps mostly.  Mostly the War main roll will be to draw agro not necessarily do alot of damage.   But with your atk bonus and same weps you would probably out damage a war.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dangoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because of Rangers attack buffs.. and generally better weapons, like our epic swiftwind, we slaughter warriors in damage output.<br />
<br />
I would bet I am 20-30 DPS higher than alot of  warriors in my guild.  Top warriors in my guild maybe 5-15 dps higher than them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Archyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Your warrior friend is right...in the low to middle level of the game, the warriors role is to help kill the mob....after 50+ his basic job is to keep aggro and be a meat shield, this is achieved by their taunt (which caps at much higher than ours) and high aggro low delay weapons, preferably those with debuff/damage procs such as Wavecrasher, Willsapper, Lammy, Fleshgrinder, Bloodpoint etc...<br />
Our job/role in the 50+ game? kill stuff dead and make sure that they don't notice us :-D<br />
How we do this is variable, can be archery with the right AA or by our amazing damage output in melee due to high ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>jcdew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I can tell you from my experiences recently that I think we come close. I say this as I was in Velks and grouped with a lvl 59 warrior and a lvl 54 Paladin.Im 54 btw. I was doing slightly less damage than the Warrior(had some SCHW too) Unfortuneatly the Paladin was the one pulling all the aggro,he had SCHW and useing an Argent Protector. I was amazed at the damage he was doing. I have some SCHW, Lammy and a Sarnak parrying blade,but that Paladin was owning me and the Warrior in melee damage . The Paladin wasnt uber as he had the same ac I did (1005ac),and since I used my buffs on him and he on me we were actually close in ac and attack. But I noticed even though our hitpoints were close I still dropped in hitpoints ALOT faster than he did when attacked individually by same mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jcdew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm sorry about babbleing too much in my previous post =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Elyeena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am not sure if it higher DPS or more hits that sends the argo to me all the time, but with 2 Toxiferious axes I need to use jolting blades for my weapon proc to keep argo on the tank. Unless I am the MT in a pickup group. I usually can keep the rogue in buisness because if it ever turns on the rogue it does not stay there for long.  just from my expierence I kinda like the axes a little better, and I use a spiked seahorse belt for the haste. it's 6% off from SW, but I do not notice it much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Lanowln</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">personally i think theres a little more to it, as a ranger (when not tanking) you should (imo heh) be behind the mob.  you hit more because you dont get parried riposted blocked etc...thus significantly increasing DPS...and since you dont get riposted your not getting hit unnessecarily anymore</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">In a group with a Paladin, Warrior, and Ranger only, the Paladin may well do more damage due to his self-only haste spell. Now that is far more unbalancing than the slay undead AA that VI temporarily nerfed. No one else gets an extra 25% haste like that, and combined with the sick ratios Knight weapons have it is quite easy for a high end Knight to outdamage most other melee (assuming no epics, no ench or shaman for haste).</div></div><hr />

<br />
you sure he wasn't stuning the mobs and getting agro?<br />
<br />
hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Neclon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aggro is NOT the equivilent of damage.<br />
<br />
I have taken agro on a mob from a grp from across a room by just sitting down.  They chase it, do about 200-500 dmg, I sit and its comin for me again.</div></div><hr />
