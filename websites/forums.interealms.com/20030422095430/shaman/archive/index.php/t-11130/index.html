<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Torpor question for a 60 Shaman.  I'm looking to drop down the casting time on Torpor from 6 seconds to something a little more reasonable.  I'm looking for either a spell haste item (15%) or a beneficial spell haste (20%) item to work this with.  <br />
<br />
The biggest limiting factor at this point would be that I'm not in a largish raiding guild.  I generally do pickup groups of 6, or duos.  Of lesser limitations would be platinums.  I generally play with my RL sk friend, and our latest project is to pool some pp together to purchase something.  Looking around maybe 50-80kpp.  Time is  the lowest restraint.  I play quite often, so camping things generally isn't an issue.<br />
<br />
Not being in a large guild, I tend to tag along on large guild raids (for example Fear raid killing Golems to get my iksar child tear), and pick up the no drop stuff they don't want.  I have my doubts of seeing any Spell Haste items rotting in ToV though.  The stats are just too good on those.  <br />
<br />
Would it be possible to find a pickup group if I were to faction up with CoV and try to take out some dragons there?  From what I understand Dragons are a multi-group encounter so probably not.  I dunno.  I read on lucy that there's a Ceramic Totem of Xenogy with Spell Haste IV which seems to be player made, though I found no further information on it..  I doubt it would be priced around 50k at that.  Tormentors Chain, probably too hard, dunno where that's at.  Then there's the Frostreavers Cape, soso stats and all.  That would play on the pp fund.  I haven't found anything comperable to the Shield of Bane Warding where one can pick a primo shield if you spent the time gather the individual quest components together, which happens to be my strongest suit.  <br />
<br />
I think I have enough down, maybe yall could recommend some stuff to me.  I'm guessing that several other shamans are in the same boat.  Maybe not in a uber guild, but do play quite a bit and aren't opposed to farming/questing for stuff.  From what I hear, haste focus items generally are a good thing.  Maybe one would have an opposing opinion to that as well.  Thanks -<br />

edit : had a major brain fart while writing the initial post and essentially posted worthless crap. removed the nonsense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was thinking the Haste of Mithaniel effect.  One of the easier one of those seems to be the Wicked Bone Atlatl, but that assumption is based on the relatively weak stats for items with that effect.  This one effects Torpor, and even falls into the long quest with a duo partner type quests.<br />
Well at least so far as to getting the key to get into Crypt of Decay.  Once you get to CoD, I dunno how hard/easy it is to come by these Wicked Bone Atlatl's.  Maybe it takes just a full group exp'ing off of regular mobs.  Then again it could drop off a named mob.  Named mobs arne't my forte. <br />
Maybe someone who had the Wicked Bone could fill us in.  <br />
<br />
I have had the benefit of an extra cool summoned Nakis Studded ring.  It may have been one below that, similar name, worked on spells upto 60 similar to spell haste III.  If I were a mage, I would set up shop with those things on my trader whenver possible.  Those, and pet weapons.  Good call though.  I'll definately be hitting up a magician tonight to get a feel for the effect again.  Maybe make my own opinions wether it's worthwhile or not...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shizbiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Use aa points to buy quick buff 3 and your torpor will be 3.0secs, you would only have to farm exp :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you can get flagged to get inside the factory in PoInnovation you can probably kill the Manaetic Prototypes with a few groups (3-4ish?).  They drop a nice hat with improved healing 4 and shoulders with haste of mithaniel.  The stats on the atlatl seem pretty weak for me to want to have in my range, so I went with the shoulders from the prototypes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cog Encrusted Epolets from PoI.  Finding the named larvas has proved quite difficult in PoD anyways.  Maybe it's time to start working on the PoI Key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I forget the name but the ring in SSRA's the one that you get all the parts there and combind. Is a good item to reduce buff cast time. But like was already mentioned get QB3. QB3 is your friend, get it, use it, love it :) It sucks that it takes 18 AA points to get QB3 but in the end they are points well spent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stats of wicked bone atlatl are as good as talisman of benevolance from Skyshrine quest, except the atlatl has the added 20% beneficial spell haste effect.</div></div><hr />
