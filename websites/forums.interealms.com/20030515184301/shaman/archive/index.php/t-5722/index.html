<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Varanuss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi.  I'm a bored as hell 60 monk who doesn't want to camp stormfeather.  This mask seems like a good alternative.  <br />
<br />
I was wondering if in your experience it always drops off VS?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Abani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, Amulet of the Kunzar is also a drop.  I don't think anyone has tried to systematically figure out which one is more likely, though I could be wrong. <br />

But camping storm feather will problly be esire then finding a Iks shm that is doing this part. And there will problly be loot issues with others that are there. You maybe able to find a Shm that has already done this part and is willing to collect the items agine. With the funky faction that seems to be plauging shammies at every turn I am not sure if you could do the turn ins yourself.</div></div><hr />

Actually I could and did.<br />
<br />
You don't need to do any of the cudgels.<br />
<br />
You only need to do the fights for the 8th cudgel.<br />
<br />
This is what I posted on monkly-business.com:<br />
<br />
) Kill Xalgoz, get necklace...EASY<br />
2) Hand in to shammy NPC Oracle Vauris outside Kaesora and get Pouch of Bone Dust.<br />
3) Kill Kaggy Krup....this guy is odd...he's a 55 froglok at n900 n1200 in SoNH with a very small amount of hps. However, he curses you which slows and snares you by what I'm guessing to be 30% for the entire fight. The curse cannot be cured by anything short of Remove Lesser Curse I'm guessing, but the cleric I was with didn't have that spell. He hits really hard for a level 55 mob....241 is max hit but due to his level doesn't ALWAYS hit for that, and he hits kind of slow. I duo'd him with a level 60 epic cleric(my wife) and she had 60% mana left after the fight with no KEI or mana regen other than FT1. Other than it being a LONG fight due to being slowed the whole time, it was surprisingly easy. Drops Glowing Kunzar Amulet.<br />
4) Kill Thuuga Dengibl in FM at n2100 n2400. His proc is very fun and he is very easily duoable by a 60 monk/60 cleric. Probably easily duoable by a lower level/different combo. Hits for 195 max, is level 50, and has quite a bit of hps. I can't say how long the fight lasted because we had to get the cleric hit by the proc for fun before we ended it, so we let it drag a bit. Drops Changeling Essence.<br />
5) Kill VSR or VS in KC and loot Blackened Iksar Bones. Easiest way IMO is camp in VSR arena looking room FD'd til he pops and announce to the zone when he pops. Very quickly a druid/ranger and raiding party will make their way to KC and kill him. Ask them to loot bones because they ALWAYS rot.<br />
6) Give these items to Oracle Vauris:<br />
-Pouch of Bone Dust<br />
-Glowing Kunzar Amulet<br />
-Changeling Essence<br />
-Blackened Iksar Bones<br />
<br />
Receive Iksar Relics.<br />
7) The final fight. Apparently you hand in the Iksar Relics and a scripted sequence begins where VS and 4 mobs spawn as well as Rile. VS and Rile battle for awhile, both untargettable, then VS becomes targettable. VS drops the mask or a crappy amulet...pray for the mask I guess. <br />
<br />
I am at step 6.  Ready for final fight.</div></div><hr />
