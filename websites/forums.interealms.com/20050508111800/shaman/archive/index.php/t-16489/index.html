<br />
Second Experience: Monday Sept 15th<br />
Log on, 2:35p.m.<br />
/shout &quot;Forming LDoN group 35-42, all classes welcome, minus shaman.&quot;<br />
group finnally is completely formed 1 hour after i start looking for people.  Group consists of the following<br />
<br />
35 Ranger<br />
42 Shadow Knight<br />
35 Paladin<br />
35 Shaman (me)<br />
36 Druid<br />
36 Wizard<br />
<br />
Get adventure, EC this time.  Travelled to Oasis, went into dungeon after buffing/medding.<br />
Opened a can of OWNAGE on the entire time, completed adventure in less than 28 minutes (kill the boss of the zone and return)<br />
did a second adventure (again kill boss and return, same zone entrence) <br />
group composition stayed the same.<br />
went a bit more choppy, i died once, 20% res from paladin, no other deaths<br />
logged to check my email, came back, group disbanded.<br />
Made new group<br />
<br />
34 cleric <br />
40 monk <br />
36 monk<br />
36 Bard<br />
36 shaman (me, dinged on second adventure)<br />
40 Shadow Knight <br />
<br />
was going to get my paladin back from other group, but she went to kill Lodizal w/boyfriend.<br />
<br />
got adventure, OWNED the zone, hardcore, completion time, less than 40 minutes (slightly harder zones)<br />
<br />
exited zone<br />
Cleric went afk while i went to get a newadventure in EC.<br />
grabbed new adventure, gated back to zone entrence.<br />
buffed everyone, bard playing maansong<br />
cleric still afk by time our timer hit 15 minutes to enter, i just hit fm at that point and said we will take it without him.<br />
monk monk shaman bard entered zone, soon as the bard zones in<br />
&quot;&lt;cleric name here&gt; has gone Linkdead&quot;<br />
meleers said &quot;Oh great, lsot our cleric, no way were gonna finish this now.&quot;<br />
i said &quot;bard, twist manasong, were continueing.&quot;<br />
35 minutes later, its 10:16 and my mom is b!@ching at me to get off the computer and go to bed, i tell her wait. 10:19 i tell her, give me 5 F#$!@#inc minutes and i'll be off.<br />
Sure as sh!@, we compelted 50% of the dungeun at that exact moment, the boss popped. i was amazed, no deaths so far in a group of 4, no cleric.<br />
Bard backtracked and had the mob on track, we followed him.  Killed the entrence mobs, monk pulled the named, SK went down to 12% hp, i rooted the named while monks beat the living daylights out of him, sk stood back and lifetapped. 16% hp- SK<br />
Root releases, i was like RUN SK RUN! he took 2 hits, went to 4%...<br />
<br />
You have gained Experience!<br />
You have completed this adventure!<br />
&quot;WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&quot;<br />
tanks were like &quot;we did this with no f#%!$#% cleric?! ****!&quot;<br />
10:24 exactly, mom was getting snippy, i gated and /quit<br />
10:47, was right before i fell asleep.<br />
<br />
Close shave? Indeed, but as you can see, but it is possible to take LDoN without a cleric, atleast at lvl 36. The entire time i never went above 20% mana.<br />
EC 3-0<br />
SRo 0-2<br />
<br />
Heres my explaination of LDoN experiences. What you need is atleast 3 tanks, no less, no more, or any meleer for that matter.  Enchanter isnt a must, its a nice addition, cleric, you most likely will NEED one, but as you can see, it is doable without one. I love having bards in my group, they will grant you the most utility of any class besides enchanter. infact, i sometiems if i cant find an enchanter that can come right away, i will take a bard and say &quot;sorry, you snooze you lose&quot;. Give the bards some lovin, they need it! hire a bard!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Things have been generally good.  I'm up to 16 wins vs 2 losses.<br />
<br />
one loss was a raid, 'nuff said.<br />
<br />
Other loss was yesterday... took a group with no cc, got a 6 pull, wiped.  Unfortunately, the cleric decided to rez people and they took it before I could see what was going on.  Argh!  About 10 mins after recovery, the ranger got 5 resists on a snare but didn't tell us, and the mob ran and got like 5 friends.  Wipe again.<br />
<br />
Plus, the drop rate (this was a collection) was obscenely low.  I mean, when we weren't dead, we were killing at a normal pace where my groups will finish with about 20 mins left or so, and we'd collected 10 of 22.  It was just altogether bad.<br />
<br />
Most of the rest though has been pretty darn smooth.  Finished an assassinate with 50 minutes left yesterday.  We actually got TO the boss with 63 minutes left, but the two monks decided they wanted to clear the room singly and be safe to take the boss alone.  We seriously could have just laid waste on him without that though.<br />
<br />
Tightest win was in Miragul, we got the dungeon that's 80% all one long hall... which is great for kills and collects, but this was an assassinate, which basically means you have to exterminate the dungeon to get to the bad guy.  With 4 minutes on the clock, we just mezzed the two we had waiting, and charged the boss, winning with 2 on the clock.</div></div><hr />
