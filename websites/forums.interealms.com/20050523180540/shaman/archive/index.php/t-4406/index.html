Long time lurker.<br />
<br />
Just curious, could me and a 60 druid (With quite alot of AA) take down the dire wolf? <br />
<br />
Also are DW's little doggys Dire Charmable? Or anything in MM that could actually help the fight?<br />
<br />
Is he usually up? Or will I have to spawn him?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Fenira</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Druid could probably solo him, so yeah ;)<br />
No idea about dire charm.   Wolf is way back in his own little area.  Sometimes there's some female back in the area as well.<br />
You may have to spawn him, have to kill the.. umm... advisor?  Dont' remember, check the quest board, probably alot of info about how to make the Wolf spawn back in there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">:-) I actually tried to kill black dire along with a 60 druid (no AAXP), back when I was lower level.  We failed, recruited a few lower level friends (a mid-30s cleric, and a couple of fourty-something melee types), and succeeded easily.  I'd expect that a 51 shaman and a druid with AAXP could prolly take him alone.<br />
<br />
Can't help with the charm questions, but as for him being up, I only had to come check a couple times before finding him up, and even if he isn't you can always go kill the advisor to make him spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dire is pretty much poison/disease resistant. His mr isnt too impressive though.<br />
<br />
Just clear out the immediate area around him. Druid harmony him (to ensure you dont agro his pets).<br />
<br />
Druid pulls with snare and gets HT for 500ish. You stick malosi on him asap. Druid roots him down and applies WD/epic/drones and whatnot.<br />
<br />
Get a slow on him once you get malosi to stick.<br />
<br />
If he resists you, just keep the druid alive while you watch dire rot away.<br />
<br />
He doesnt summon so shouldnt be a prob.</div></div><hr />
