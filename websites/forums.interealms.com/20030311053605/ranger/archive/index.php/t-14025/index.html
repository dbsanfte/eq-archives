<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking that at mid lvls Rangers should get some sort of disc similar to Trueshot but not that powerful.  Something like...<br />
<br />
Aimed Shot (tm)<br />
Increased chance to hit with a bow.  (not sure how much)<br />
Every hit is an automatic crit.<br />
Last for like 1-2 mins<br />
Re-use timer something like 5-10 mins or possibly shared with the trueshot (so you can only use 1 or the other not 1 then the other)<br />
Get disc at 32-37 somewhere in there.<br />
<br />
Also couple other thoughts.  It would have been nice if those 2 new PoP spells we received we similar to Call of the sky just for the bow.  Enchants all arrows shot from your bow with fire dmg and makes the arrow hit magic only stuff.  Don't get me wrong I like the extra DD but felt as if it were a &quot;what should we give rangers..?&quot;  &quot;ah just give a couple low power DD's that will make em happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
I know it will never happen, but what ya think?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gendias</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hehe, have you ever played Anarchy Online?  In one of the major patches a few months ago when I was still playing Agents got a series of spells that pretty much had an effect similar to that.  Durations were around 4 seconds for the lowest one 6 seconds on the highest every shot being a crit and another series gave them an upped crit % right around 25% or so for about 20 seconds, reuse time 6 mins for the 25% and 10 mins for the 100%.  I think both ideas are pretty good, but I highly doubt that it will ever happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TheTorpid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeah I know that it will never happen just thought I would throw it out and see what others thought about it.<br />
<br />
And I have never played Anarchy Online... didn't have a clue about that one.</div></div><hr />
