<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Scabber</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey all ...<br />
<br />
I posted a previous thread on the effort I should be making in tracking down a JBB.  Everyone who was kind enought to reply told me I should not worry about it and go with a mount instead.  Done deal.  <br />
<br />
My questions are these...<br />
<br />
1. Would any horse do?  Even the cheapy?<br />
2. What is proper technique for using it?<br />
3. Can you melee from horseback as I like to think of myself as a battle Shaman<br />
<br />
Drop me a line and let me know!<br />

<br />
1. Would any horse do? Even the cheapy?<br />
<br />
The only difference betweenthe classes of horses (and drogs) are the speed in which they move.  People like Drogs better because they move sideways better and the head is not in the way.<br />
<br />
2. What is proper technique for using it?<br />
<br />
Generally, horses/drogs are best used when you are in a group/raid where you'll be casting from a relatively stationary position.   If you're going to be moving around a lot (either tanking or because you're adventure has you on the move) horses/drogs are as useful.  One place they are highly useful is when you're switching your spells around (since you don't gain aggro from sitting while on a horse).<br />
<br />
3. Can you melee from horseback as I like to think of myself as a battle Shaman?<br />
<br />
The answer is &quot;your mileage will vary.&quot;  The larger the weapon is the physically easier it is to stay on your target.  Most of the time, however, the mob will be backed up or moved slightly and easily get out of your range.  Since subtle movement on any mount is problematic I wouldn't recommend meleeing mobs on a mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bukbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There are a bunch of horse threads out there.  I recommend doing a search in the equipment section, but here are some quick answers.<br />
<br />
1. Would any horse do? Even the cheapy?  The cheapest horse would be the best one.  You have sow and scale of wolf you don't need to spend 100K on a horse to go faster.<br />
<br />
2. What is proper technique for using it?  You are using the horse as a medding tool.  While on a horse you are considered to be sitting down if you are not attacking.  You can be casting spells and see your mana go up.  It is a mana regen tool only.  You will be on and off the horse often.  It is more of a group or root rot tool.  If you are tanking only use the horse in downtime while canning.  You don't need to dance anymore, just sit on the horse and canny.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Can you melee from horseback as I like to think of myself as a battle Shaman.  You can but it's difficult to see and loot from it.  You don't get the benefit of medding while attacking.  It would be more difficult to melee from the horse than not on it and you would be wasting food.<br />
<br />
Technique and use is definitely covered in other threads extensively, but you have some quick answers.  In super short the horse is a meditation tool.<br />

1. Depends on what you want out of it. As a way to get more meditation time any horse is great. Since you sit and cast from it, you never break your meditation cycle the way you do when you sit/stand all the time. Ie canni dancing becomes much easier.<br />
<br />
2. When youre grouping/either stationary or moving at a slow pace, you should be on in always. If you have a fast horse you can also outrun mobs/trains and get anywhere fast without getting off.<br />
<br />
3. Meleeing from a horseback is generaly used. It can be done though. Youre not a great meleer to start with as a shaman so the difference would be marginal.<br />
<br />
Oh and the no sit aggro is great stuff too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">1. Would any horse do?  Even the cheapy?<br />
<br />
for what we use if for, a cheap one will do. The 100k horse will only allow you to travel faster. For soloing a faster horse has its obvious advantages.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. What is proper technique for using it?<br />
<br />
The main advantages of using a horse is that you don't have to worry about canni-dancing. You can cannibalize all you want without having to worry about timing the penalty for cannibalizing during a tick.  This is not as big a issue when you have heal over time spells like torpor or quin. Another benfit is if you have KEI or VOQ ... while mounted your are alway sitting so you get maximum mana regen.  Lastly, unlike sitting you do not get the sitting agro so you can switch spells to your hearts content.<br />
     The disavantages is that a horse takes time to go to maximum speed  and to slow down (so you  can over shoot or be left behind) It  disappears if you decide to go for a swim. It could be my imagination but I seem to be stunned a lot more on a horse. And it only can be used in outdoor zones  (or many POP zones)<br />
<br />
With that in mind, the best technique is  no direct melee (meaning you are not the person who holds agro), root and rot soloing, group oriented experiencing. Also at times in quirky raiding areas like VT, a horse actually can cause agro.<br />
<br />
<br />
3. Can you melee from horseback as I like to think of myself as a battle Shaman .<br />
<br />
In a group where another person is holding agro, you can melee (although the damage a true melee will make you look silly at high levels, unless you have time weapons) The advantage being if you don't move around much is that  you are medding while fighting and with kei or VoQ  thats not too bad. <br />
 <br />
  If you solo melee,  if you need to run make sure you have sow up and you  click off the horse. When you turn and run  it takes the horse time to get going and more chance to get stunned.<br />
<br />
If you use the standard view, the horse's head sometimes gets in the way ( the lizard is better here) If you normally use the camera view then this is not so much an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heck, after 61 DOGDOG's melee damage makes look silly...<br />
<br />
After DoTs, I am Dogdog's meat shield - and I can do that just as well from a drogmar.  The mobs find me.  ;)</div></div><hr />
