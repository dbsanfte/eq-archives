<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm pretty much in ghetto gear right now and after a visit to the planes definately need 1 of these upgrades but will only have enough $ for one of them in a little bit.  I'm having trouble deciding between them.  What would you recommend.  I'm lvl 51 with ac in the 600's &amp; hp alittle over 1500 self buffed .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">ikky BP.  if your ac is that low id probably even suggest basic gear upgrades rather than the ikky bp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
(This is my stupid way of saying, &quot;I'd choose horse over BP&quot;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hmmmm, tough choice Ikky BP or Horse.  <br />
<br />
Gotta say though, if your AC is under 800 at +50, you should really work on that 1st.  You can get the Horsey a little later.<br />
<br />
Is your defense skill maxed at 200?  If not, go melee seafury clops in OOT, they good for defense skill raises. Get defense to 200 ASAP!<br />
<br />
Other than that, go look for cheap AC pieces in the bazaar or hunt them yourself.  JB arms, head, boots come to mind.  Leaf Scale Gloves 14 AC +wis +hitpoints sell for 150-200 pp on my server.  Clay Guardian Shield, 25 AC +50 hitpoints(?) are dirt cheap.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should ask, are you a WIS shammy instead of an AC/Hitpoint shammy?<br />
<br />
Well, you get the point, even if you are a wis shammy, you are going to get aggro slowing things you need some more AC before other purchases IMHO.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i'd have to agree, go for armor over the horse. Isn't the horse limited to outside areas?<br />
<br />
are you on a PvP server? are you in a guild? are ya gonna be raiding? grouping? soloing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I do try to melee when possibly especially when soloing but it takes forever for me to skill up in defense, currently around 130.<br />
I've just been kinda crusing thru not worrying too much about equipment or money, just having fun.  Then I started going to the planes and noticed that my stuff is definately lacking. Here's what i have so far:<br />

<br />
The ones I left empty aren't worth listing.  I can see I have problems.  Thanks for any criticism, you can be as harsh as you want, I can take it.  Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Tumamor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">THIS IS A NO BRAINER.  GET A HORSE.  I have the cheapest horse, and it is awesome.  The constant medding is well worth 10k.  and being able to change spells without getting the crap beat out of you is PRICELESS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Look at my stuff (clicky da linky), except the JBB, nothing there is really expensive. Shop the bazaar for good deals, be willing to wait a bit to get a decent price. And work on your defense asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey again!  <br />
<br />
I can't read those profile links, but you say your defense is at 130 at level 51??  That is probably your biggest weak area.  That is EXTREMELY bad defense skill for you level.  <br />
<br />
I'm not good with numbers, but I think it is a fair guess to say that those missing 70 defense skill points are costing you well over 100 raw AC (and I think that is a low esitimate).<br />
<br />
I repeat my original suggestion, go to Ocean of Tears and melee the Seafury Clops.  I spent quite a bit of time lv. 48-52 on those clops, and found I got more defense skill raises against those fellows than any other mobs in that level range.  Many other shaman have commented on this board that they also used the clops to raise defense skill.<br />
<br />
The seafury clops, once slowed, are pretty much wimps.  Their max hit is around 70-75.  Your doggie will chew them up as you melee.  I recommend simply pulling with slow, sic'ing doggie on them, laying on a DoT (one of your lv. 49 ones), and then melee'ing them to death.<br />
<br />
Save the seafoam that drops from them.  It is used in cultural tailoring (human) and a guildie might appreciate it.  Also, the clops drop some pretty nice gems/jewelry that sell for 50-100 pp each.<br />
<br />
If you are determined to chose a Horsey or Ikky BP now, well your play style should dictate which you choose.  If you spend most of your time in outdoor zones, without a doubt you should get the horse.  But if you spend the majority of your time inside, the Ikky BP will help you more.<br />
<br />
Good Journeys to you!  And good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I must say that Shabby is giving you great advice.<br />
<br />
I would skip the horse and iksar breastplate and upgrade my<br />
ac and hp dramaticly.  I woud start buy replacing the <br />
rings with the standared 6 ac 65 hp velium fire weading<br />
rings.  The clay guardian sheild, as someone said, is a great<br />
deal for ac / hp and should be cheeper then the shield you<br />
have now,  and the varius Jaundice Bone armor pieces can<br />
fill in a lot of slots with quite nice ac considering the price.<br />
<br />
Once some gear changes are compleated I would do exactly what<br />
Shabby said and head to OOT and slow tank the seafuries.  They are big hp and very low offense when slowed so the fights are long but predictable and provide lots of chanses for skilling up all the mele skills.  It may take as much as 2 weeks of slow tanking the big one eyes to max your defense but I would rank that as a very high priority.<br />
<br />
The horse / iksar bp question is much more a matter of how and where you play then anthing else.<br />
<br />
If you solo a lot and do not have a JBB then the iksar chestplate is a much better way to go.<br />
<br />
If you primarily group,  and a lot of that grouping takes place in outdoor zones,  then the horse is just great.<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here, if I have not convinced you already, this is an excerp from another post on this board:<br />
<br />
Found this once: http://pub147.ezboard.com/ftheconce...opicID=30.topic. <br />
<br />
It is a breakdown of armor class. <br />
<br />
If you do a little moving around in the formulas you will find out that: <br />
AC += 2.4925 x Defense <br />
AC += 1.5742 x Equipment <br />
AC += 1.1806 x T(agi) <br />
AC += 0.2952 x Buffs(spdat) <br />
<br />
So as you can see, if you are 100 from maxing your defence, you are lacking ~249 AC... <br />
<br />
Anyway, read the article <br />

 :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye get better gear.  JBB armor is the way to go.  Its cheap and has lots of AC.<br />
<br />
Defense of 130 is bad. Real bad.  Go to KC, slow a MoB and let them beat the crap out of you. <br />
<br />
At lvl56 and a defense of 200 I have 546ac naked.  Defense skill is free ac.  Get that skill up asap.<br />
<br />
ps - A Sarnark Battle Shield is down to around 500-700p on my server.  That is the best 'cheap' shield you can get imho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I value all your opinions and have put off the horse or ikky bp for now in place of upgrading my current stuff, you guys have great ideas. <br />
<br />
So far i have increased my ac to almost 700, just from gear, and my self buff hp to over 1700 now.  And it does make a big difference guys, thanks you.  Next is to increase my defense, I'll be heading to OOT .  Thanks for suggestions.  Guess if I can max my defense AC should around 900, currently it's at 148.  I'll check the article out too.  I'll update my profile tonight to see what you guys think of the upgrades.<br />
<br />
Thanks again shaman gods.....<br />
<br />
<br />
PS.  SBS will be the next upgrade but goes for around 2.5k on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Phinger Bang</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heyas,<br />
<br />
Just to support what is being said about having high AC.  I dual-boxed my shaman from his very beginning.  I melee'd my butt off until I got nearly to level 50, and by doing that, I maxed out all of my melee skills.  I have pretty much all purchased gear, with just a few exceptions.  I run around with 950 unbuffed AC at level 57 (10% to 58).  I tell you what, you will take a serious beating on a slow resist from a PoP mob, with your AC of 600ish, you would go down faster then a 2 dollar hooker : )<br />
<br />
AC/HP is better then wis, flat out.  Wis will come with the gear over time.  Yes, having high wis creates a large mana pool, but having high hp (and regen) creates an endless mana pool. AKA: Canni <br />
<br />
You WILL get whomped on at times, it is what shaman do.  In a pickup group you pray that your tank can, and knows, how to gain aggro, but much of the time you need to get slow on as quickly as possible.<br />
<br />
Phinger, Povar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well the first thing you should do is get equipment for all your slots.  <br />
<br />
I envy you.  I used to love coming here and asking a question and getting alot of good replies and then going out and doing it.  People have given you good advice so far.  <br />
<br />
Back to the question though.  Remember pop = outdoor zones (at least the ones ive been to).  A horse is so much more usefull than an ikky bp would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Dan_N</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well I got the SBS and got defense upto 171 in about 2 hours of dueling friends pet while he was camping a mob.  That's a raise of 23 in 2 hours. Nice.  Got AC unbuffed to 740 now.  Thanks for all the suggestions.<br />
I'll keep at it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Clay Guardian shield carries the 25AC and 50HP of the SBS, but lacks the stats/resists.  May be a worthy interim shield, depending on the price on your server.<br />
<br />
Also, can you still raise skills by dueling someones pet?  I thought they stopped that.  Bah, looks as though I've been giving the wrong advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Great progress Dan_N  .....  Grats</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Nice Dan!!!  Way to go!  Bet you'll break that 800 mark soon :)</div></div><hr />
