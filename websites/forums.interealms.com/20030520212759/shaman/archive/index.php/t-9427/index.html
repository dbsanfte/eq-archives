<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am lucky to see one a nite.  Anything else I could be doing to speed their spawn besides killing VP elder wyverns??  These guys are good adrenaline rush btw (for me anyways)!!<br />
<br />
Or know any other mobs of similar difficulty and possible high rewards?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Emperor Chottal in Sebilis is a great camp for the 60 Kunark spells your looking for.  The same goes for deeper in Sebilis if you can get down to Jumpy and Protector.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>moops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've been killing these sob's lately 2 boxing my 56 warrior &amp; 58 shammy. Its a real PITA to get them to spawn, all you can do is kill the elders ( that have an assload of HP ) &amp; hope a gaurdian wurm spawns. I've killed 10 GW's so far &amp; have nothing to show for it yet. They seem to drop the absolute worst possible spells for me..talisman of the serpant X 4, mala x 2 , a few other vendor bought spells &amp; my last GW killing netted me 3pp &amp; no spells at all! It is fun as hell to kill these though, the fights are always super close usually the wurm turns to run as I'm frantically trying to canni to get 1 last heal off.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Waredan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Guardian wurms will spawn when you kill the Elder Wyvernns. Ive killed about 50 or so now after about 2 weeks of campin em. I got malo my first day there (yay, go me) which only fueled my hunger for torpor.... which hasnt dropped yet. Just be patient and keep on killin the wyverns... <br />
<br />
Or you could go ballistic like I have and any time a kunark dragon spawns, get your closest 2 groups of 60+ friends to come to kill the sob. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I am pulling them to the dragon bones to fight them there,  where I get no adds - is there anyplace closer that is safe to fight??  I spend half the nite running back and forth, dodging those lame chromodorks.  Got Mala Friday nite - does that mean I win EQ?  I cannot seem to get more than one or two at best in about a 4 hour shift.  REALLY REALLY like it when one is up when I first get there - its just like Xmas when I was 6 back in the swamp.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sundrops</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Static spawns at VP entrance, pull them to the top of VP to the northern edge of the roof.<br />
<br />
Most roamers wander near the Ragefire area and can be pulled to the ledge just east of Ragefire platform.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks - I will try that out - all the running was killing my horsee.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Guntak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I heard about these and went to give them a shot last night. Had 2 Guardians pop in a 5 hour camp... then 3 in a row. The 4th one dropped torpor. 60 bst spell, 60 necro pet buff spell and 60 wiz rain spell dropped as well. Prosperous day for me and friends.<br />
<br />
I was getting decent exp at 60 and my cleric at 52 was also. This is a great camp to spend some time with friends and a chance for some great spells :). <br />
<br />
As for spawns... seems way random.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I finally have a group of guildies together to hunt Guardian Wurms, to try and get Malo and Topor for me, and other spells for guildies.  I scouted VP entrance and one GW was at entrance, along with 5 elder wyvern and many mature chromos were wandering nearby.   Where would be the best spot to set up camp and pull the GW's to?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Read above for pull spots.  I see many group fight right on the flat spot outside VP entrance - I am by myself and prefer no chance of adds so I pull to dragon bones. <br />
<br />
After a week here I can state emphatically that the exp here SUCKS - I get 9 to 10 times the exp killing cavemen in ME.<br />
<br />
Last nite after 4 hours I got one to spawn - this is starting to irritate me - trolls are not patient and the exp is sucky - if exp was better I would not be so moany - those elders have a buttload of hp.<br />
<br />
And....several times now I lose the camp to folks who just mosey in and take over.  This is kinda annoying - I keep hoping Karma really does work and go do something else after they ignore my requests to honor my camp.<br />
