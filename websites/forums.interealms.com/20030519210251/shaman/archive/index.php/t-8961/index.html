<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chasmyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since PoP release my shaman has been sleeping with the shrooms in FG.  Now that his pet monk is lvl 65, it is time to wake up and get leveled up.  I just wanted to ask the experts what they thought would be the best place for us to go.<br />
<br />
Been thinking HS, since i'm sick to death of shrooms.  Anyone have any better ideas?  I will probably group them as opposed to FD'ing each kill, thats a pain in the butt when two boxing and I'm just to lazy to bother with it.  <br />
<br />
Also, if anyone has any recommendations as to equip upgrades I'd sure appreciate it, though my funds are limited I do have a little saved up.  <br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for any advice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FG sucks but would still yield good exp.  POJ basement towards Mavuin perhaps. Decent exp from that at 53 I'd imagine.<br />
