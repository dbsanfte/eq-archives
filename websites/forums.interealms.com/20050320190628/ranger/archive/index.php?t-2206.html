<br />
Official Code of Male Conduct<br />
<br />
1. Thou shall not rent the movie Chocolat.<br />
<br />
2. Under no circumstances may 2 men share an umbrella.<br />
<br />
3. Any man who brings a camera to a bachelor party may be legally beaten and killed by his fellow partygoers.<br />
<br />
4. Unless he murdered someone in your immediate family, you must bail a friend out of jail within 12 hours.<br />
<br />
5. You may exaggerate any anecdote told in a bar by 50 percent without recrimination; beyond that, anyone within earshot is allowed to call bull****. (Exception: When trying to pick up a girl, the allowable exaggeration rate rises to 400 percent)<br />
<br />
6. If you've known a guy for more than 24 hours, his sister is off-limits forever.<br />
<br />
7. The maximum amount of time you have to wait for another guy who's running late is 5 minutes. For a girl, you are required to wait 10 minutes for every point of hotness she scores on the classic 1-10 scale.<br />
<br />
8. Bitching about the brand of free beer in a buddies refrigerator is forbidden. You may gripe if the temperature is unsuitable<br />
<br />
9. No man is ever required to buy a birthday present for another man. In fact, even remembering a friends birthday is strictly optional.<br />
<br />
10. Agreeing to distract the ugly friend of a hot babe your buddy is trying to hook up with is your legal duty. Should you get carried away with your good deed and end up having sex with the beast, your pal is forbidden to<br />
speak of it, even at your bachelor party.<br />
<br />
11. Before dating a buddy's ex, you are required to ask his permission and he, in return is required to grant it.<br />
<br />
12. Women who claim they &quot;love to watch sports&quot; must be treated as spies until they demonstrate knowledge of the game and, more importantly, the ability to pick a buffalo wing clean.<br />
<br />
13. If a man's zipper is down, that's his problem-you didn't see nothin'.<br />
<br />
14. The universal compensation for buddies who help you move is beer.<br />
<br />
15. (Gas Warfare Act) you may flatulate in front of a woman only after you've brought her to climax. But if you trap her head under the covers(Dutch Oven) for the purpose of flatulent entertainment, she's officially your girlfriend.<br />
<br />
16. It is permissible to consume a fruity chick drink only when you're sunning on a tropical beach... and it's delivered by a topless supermodel and it's free.<br />
<br />
17. Unless you're in prison, never fight naked.<br />
<br />
18. A man in the company of a hot, suggestively dressed woman must remain sober enough to fight.<br />
<br />
19. If a buddy is outnumbered, out manned, or too drunk to fight, you must jump into the fight. Exception: If within the last 24 hours his actions have caused you to think, &quot;What this guy needs is a good ass-whoopin&quot;, then you<br />
may sit back and enjoy.<br />
<br />
20. Phrases that may NOT be uttered to another man while weight lifting: &quot;Yeah, baby, push it!&quot; &quot;C'mon, give me one more! Harder!&quot; &quot;Another set and he can hit the showers.&quot; &quot; Nice ass, are you a Sagittarius?&quot;<br />
<br />
21. Never hesitate to reach for the last beer or the last slice of pizza,but not both. That's just plain mean.<br />
<br />
22. Never talk to a man in the bathroom unless you're on equal footing: either both urinating or both waiting in line. In all other situations, a nod is all the conversation you need.<br />
<br />
23. If a buddy is already singing along to a song in the car, you may not join him...too gay.<br />
<br />
24. Before allowing a drunken friend to cheat on his girl, you must attempt one intervention. If he is able to get on his feet, look you in the eye, anddeliver a &quot;F@ck OFF!&quot; You are absolved of your of responsibility.<br />
<br />
25. The morning after you and a babe who was formerly &quot;just a friend&quot; have carnal, drunken monkey sex, the fact that you're feeling weird and guilty is no reason not to nail her again before the discussion about what a big<br />
mistake it was.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if QUeen ever admitted it, but the general public consensus has always been that they're gay.  Kinda like the Village People.  You can just tell from seeing 'em.</div></div><hr />

Of all the various bands that I wish I could have seen live, Queen is the one that I regret missing the most.  They were probably the best rock band of all time.  Such a range of styles and music and great talent.<br />

You're correct. But I don't think the rest of the band was gay, just Freddy. But Numbuk is right, it doesn't make their music worse because of it.<br />
<br />
I found it kind of funny though how Wayne's World kinda re-vitalized that song. Now, no matter where you go, if they play that song, you'll always see somebody headbanging when the guitar solo starts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, gay. No wait, it actually depends on the song, if it's a &quot;neutral&quot; kind of song, then maybe, but if he's singing with you guys to Destiny's child or something, then he's gay.<br />
<br />
EDIT: OR if he tries to touch you in anyway while singing along, then yup very sly.</div></div><hr />

There was a huge Queen resurgeance after that movie.  :D  Teenagers who had never heard of the band beforehand had a whole new world opened up to them.<br />
<br />
I was one of them, but I honestly didn't get into their music as much as others.  I just couldn't get into songs like &quot;I want to ride my bicycle&quot; and &quot;Killer Queen.&quot;  But, we all have different tastes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gay or not, Freddy is one of my favorite all time singers/entertainers.  That guy had a voice for the ages.<br />
<br />
Man, did this thread get hyjacked or what?<br />
<br />
On a somewhat related topic, I agree with Numbuk.  Bunch of guys singing in a car is not gay(well maybe if you are singing &quot;Feelings&quot; or &quot;Somewhere Over The Rainbow&quot;).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I *love* Les Miserables and Phantom of the Opera.  Why is there a stigma attached to it that if you're a guy and you like that, you're gay?  It's exactly like saying &quot;If you play EverQuest, you are a complete and total loser and social reject who has no chance of ever entering a healthy relationship with the opposite sex.&quot;<br />
<br />
I love Les Mis.  I love singing the parts of Javert (the manly, baritone Philip Quast Javert, not the wussy, nasaly 'New York cd' Javert).  I love singing Marius and 98% of ValJean (some of his stuff is just too high for me).  I love singing Crawford's Phantom and that one dude's  Raul.  Am I gay?  Well, if you call getting turned on &quot;by women and women only&quot; gay, then I guess I am.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with liking things other than trucks, farts, and football.  I think anyone who refuses to do so has something to hide or is in denial of.<br />
<br />
Slap good!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Men who know they are men can access a whole range of feelings, fun and entertainment that the insecure ones deny themselves.<br />
<br />
My little brother sings and dances - sometimes he dresses in tights (on stage). In improv skits, my husband has been stuck in female roles, gay roles, and anything else you might imagine. I like to see the kind of cinfidence in a man that it takes to do things like that.<br />

I take it my singing didn't impress you Taamar. LOL.</div></div><hr />

Numbuk, I totally agree about Brad Pitt.  I used to hate that guy, dismissing him as just another pretty boy.  Over the years, though, he has played some really great characters (12 Monkeys, True Romance, Snatch.)</div></div><hr />

I miss my young, carefree days of singing Les Mis in my car with a quartet of opera trained voices. We may have been gay, but we were GOOD. <br />
<br />
Les Mis rocks.<br />
<br />
You should see the looks I get when I have my windows down, stereo up, with...<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm Jean val Jeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaan...! You see Salvare it's true.. this man is no more guilt.... than you.........<br />
Who am I...................... 2...4....6....0.... *very high voice* ONE!!!!!&quot;<br />
<br />
I think I have the entire thing memorized....<br />
<br />
It's even funnier when someone's playing a rap with very loud bases, and my car's stereo overrides his stereo...<br />
<br />
then there's phantom.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you on Javert, Numbuk... should be a resonant baritone with some OOMPH, to complement a Valjean with a ringing clear tenor. Meanwhile, I can't sing Cosette to save my life, but Eponine is perfect for me, and I can manage Fantine in a pinch.</div></div><hr />

Do a search on American Jedi.  I swear you will piss your pants it's so funny.</div></div><hr />

One of my good friends and I both have good strong powerful voices, with about as much sense of pitch as a bucket of sand.  We like the same music, and sing in the car to many tapes.  Never once has either of us reached over to kiss the other.  We sing together because we both like to sing and we're the only ones willing to tolerate us.<br />
<br />
Queen had several videos that indicated the whole bunch of them were flaming, and a lot of their fan base was gay.  Who gives a flying fish one way or the other?  <br />
<br />
Some of the tightest harmonies I have ever heard recorded, especially in hard rock.</div></div><hr />

Seen it.  Funny as hell.  If you liked that one, check out &quot;You've Got Mail (This time on the Death Star.)&quot;  That's probably not the exact title, but close enough.<br />
<br />
&quot;Excuse me Sir, is that your spaceship parked outside?&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;THAT IS AN IMPERIAL TIE FIGHTER!&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah, um, whatever.......It's being towed.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;****!&quot;<br />
<br />
I nearly fell out of my chair laughing at that scene.  It's not even a Tie Fighter. :)<br />
<br />
edit: I just went back and watched it again.  The reviews are pretty damned funny, too.  The nerds are out in full force with quotes like &quot;This one sucks!  It's an Imperial Shuttle, not a Tie Fighter!  Vader with a blaster rifle?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
/edit the above didn't sound too good so the following are clarifications<br />
<br />
By playing with each other I meant with their instruments.<br />
<br />
By their instruments I meant their guitars, drums, and keyboards.<br />

Man you guys are way too uptight.  Sing, be free, live your life before its gone.</div></div><hr />

I happen to be of the opinion that those who are insecure in their masculinity shy away from singing in the car, watching &quot;chick&quot; movies, or using good manners in front of their friend.<br />
Chick movies are usually boring from a general male standpoint. We want action or comedy. We sit down to watch a movie because we want to be entertained. We rarely feel the need for a good cry. I can tolerate an occasional romantic comedy. But chick-flick dramas (a la Wings of the Dove) make me squirm like a 5 year old getting his arm pits tickled.<br />
<br />
And being insecure about good manners? Hardly. Why are women so repressed they can't appreciate the basic comedic value of a well timed belch or penis/fart joke?<br />
<br />
Though I'm sorry to say both my brother and my husband enjoy watching The Man Show. Ick! <br />
Hey, we let you have Oprah :) Besides, The Man Show is only 30 minutes whereas she gets a full hour and her own book club.</div></div><hr />

I really don't want to know how the music &quot;moves&quot; someone.<br />

P.S. Anyone got a link to this &quot;american jedi&quot;? I wanna check it out.</div></div><hr />
