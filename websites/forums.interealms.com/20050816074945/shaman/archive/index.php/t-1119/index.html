<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have a 56 monk and after playing my friend's shaman pretty extensively I would like to buy/trade for one...my question is do you guys condone this on your market boards?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ralahast-BB</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/me covers head expecting flames.....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why expect flames? i'm asking a question instead of just posting...if you guys don't like it i won't do it. i am just having a hard time finding one &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bah, post it in the Buy/Sell/Trade forum. Some peeps may give you crap, some could care less. Since you have played your friends Shammy, I would think you know HOW to play a Shammy, so your less likely to get flammed than someone who bought a 60 Shammy from Berserker on E-Gay and has no idea what they are doing. You might also want to try your specific server boards.<br />
<br />
I personally think there is nothing like developing a character yourself, but could care less if you ask to buy/trade for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why the hell ask here..<br />
<br />
Try playerauctions.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">you probably won't get a whole lot of favorable responses from this board.  as mentioned, try playerauctions.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">as i said before, i am having a hard time finding one...my server board admin decided to go extremely gay and ban pretty much all acct auctions, even though was for in game cash</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Even if it's for in game cash it's still against the EULA.  Maybe not the letter of the Agreement (or some people's liberal interpretation) but it's certainly against the intent.  That's prolly why your board admin nuked the thread.  Our server board was much the same way, until it recently crumbled into Anarchy. <br />

<br />
Go look in the mirror, bro.<br />
<br />
I wonder why you &quot;are having a hard time finding one&quot;? Maybe because it's a pathetic request.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Winsome Dove</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most of you didn't mind on the have you e-bayed poll but now your all against it?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Why not just start a new shammy? If you have a 56 monk, you can probably twink one out pretty nicely. And with the latest changes, its even easier to get to 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I could care less about people E-baying, it's just that this is not the place for it.<br />
<br />
Thus, I said go to playerauctions.com</div></div><hr />
