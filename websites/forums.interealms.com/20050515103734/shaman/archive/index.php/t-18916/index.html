<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi All,<br />
<br />
Well, my level of frustration has gotten to the point where I'm willing to solicit your help even if it is in poor taste.  I am a level 55 Shaman on The Nameless server and am looking for a good bunch of folks who want to group frequently for exp.  <br />
<br />
Due to my work and family commitments I only play 8-10 hrs a week.  Usually between 10-12pm, 2-3 weeknights and on Friday and Saturday nights.  I am currently playing solo most of the time, and doing well in PoJ, but I really like to group.  Unfortunately, lately, getting a pick up group just takes too long.  When I was in my 40's I could zone into DL on any given night, shout out lfg, and get a group offer in less than a minute.  I'm just not having that level of success any more.  The zones worth going to are either fully camped or the groups were formed before they even zoned in.<br />
<br />
Therefore, I'm looking for a quild with members in the 50-65 level range who play consistently and are focused on exp in LDoN and PoP.  I would also like to work on my epic more, and help others with theirs.  Finally, eventhough I know I will never see the plan of time, I'd like to farm some of the easier keys required to get into the restricted 2-3 tier planes.  <br />
<br />
I've tried being in a new guild that was open to all, but we had too many newbs and kids and it was not enjoyable for me.  I've also tried a level 60+ raiding guild (got in due to a friend in the guild) but I was too low a level to be of any use and did not have the time to raid every night.  And even if I did, their focus was not the same as mine at this time.<br />
<br />
What I need is a group of folks to play with, who like to exp and are not hell bent on killing the Sleeper or Quarm.  If any of you has any suggestions, or knows of a guild on The Nameless that fits my profile, please let me know. I believe I am a good player and my magelo is below.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />
Thunderwolf<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Thank you, did not know this existed.  Now, does anyone have any first hand knowledge on these guilds that they would like to volunteer?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Most likely you want to post a thread on the general NT forum to see who is recruiting or accepting people right now, should be able to find a couple good matches.  I was out of the game for a bit until recently, and a few guilds have stepped up to becoming more raid oriented, so I'm not familiar with all of them, but there are several guilds similar to what you are looking for.  Your best bet is to find some names of guilds, look at the ranges of people, and try to group with a few of them to see how they are.</div></div><hr />
