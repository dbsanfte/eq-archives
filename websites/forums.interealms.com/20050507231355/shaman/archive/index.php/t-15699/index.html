<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am going to hit 51 tonight, which means I have to start dealing with AAs, something I have never dealt with until now.<br />
<br />
Is there a recommended progression of which AAs to take and when to take them generally?<br />
<br />
Should I do them at 51 or still concentrate on leveling until I am about 63 or so?<br />
<br />
I hear people take Run3 a lot, but when?  How about Innate Regen?<br />
<br />
As you can see I am obviously a bit confused here.  They all look good, but, I also dont want to be 51 forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">stop and get run 3 if you are in dungeons alot. <br />
<br />
if not level to 60 before worrying about AA's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Repiv Dashammie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I got run 3 first...i thought it was pointless at first becuse i have my sow boots but indoors it helps...now that i have it i cant tell a diffrence runnning even sow seems slow these days..got to stop playing my bard..i would wait till at least ur 55/56 becuse at 51 u would be getting aa at lvl 52 exp..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get run 1 at 51, it's enough to keep you alive in dungeons/outdoors when sow drops, then burn to 65<br />
<br />
anyway, we get an indoor run spell with LDoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">this is from a Shaman-FAQ document I'm working on:<br />
<br />
How should I spend my AA points?<br />
<br />
Of course, everyone has their own opinion.  It's pretty widely accepted though that there's nothing that even touches the Cannibalization (aka Cannibalize V) ability for utility.   This means your first 23 points are pretty well scripted:<br />
3 points in Run Speed<br />
3 points in Innate Regeneration, though some people like Innate Metabolism here.  (Baron title)<br />
12 points in Mental Clarity (Venerable title)<br />
5 points in Cannibalization<br />
<br />
Immediately after that there are a number of useful abilities, so many that there's no clear path.  Among the most commonly suggested are:<br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement 3/Mastery<br />
Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
Radiant Cure (RC1 is only 2 points, it's a good take for early, maybe pick up 2 and 3 later)<br />
Virulent Paralysis (level 1, though level 3 has its uses too)<br />
Spirit Call (level 1; especially on PVP servers)<br />
Mass Group Buff (if you raid a lot)<br />
Natural Durability 3<br />
Combat Agility 3/Lightning Reflexes 5</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yes, I would confirm that the vast majority of shaman say Canni5 is the best bang for the buck.<br />
<br />
But I can also say from experience that spending 10 points in one go on MC2 and MC3 is heart-breaking!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jonat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Said it before I will say it again if you dont go your first 23 for Canni 5 you have just wasted time. These threads should be called what AA should I do after Canni 5. IMHO Canni 5 is just a great AA that should be your top priority. If you plan on getting LDON expansion you might want to wait to grind AAs since we are getting an indoor capable run speed buff called spirit of the shrew/pack shrew. Those spells should get you through to 60 when its much better to grind out AAs. If you raid alot MGB is one to think about. I got it after Canni 5 and when you are the only shaman on a raid to buff it is really helpful. SCR 3/SCRM is one that I personally could not live without. Buffs last 50 percent longer which cuts down on mana usage and also gives you that all important 6 tick 1800 hp torpor/que which is unbelievably helpful imo. Some people argue that longer buffs dont do much good when people die and lost buffs, but to me you really shouldnt be dying that much for this to be a factor and if you are maybe you should rethink what you are doing. The tough thing about this line is its 20 pts to max which is long. ND is a great aa set as well, extra hps is always good. hope this helped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hi. Level 65 here with the following:<br />
<br />
Run 1/2/3<br />
Metab 1/2/3<br />
RC 1<br />
MC 1/2/3<br />
...and 6 unspent.<br />
<br />
I was going to get Can5, but now I'm the Shaman Class Officer for a raiding guild, and as the person in charge of buffing, I really need to be able to MGB Focus. <br />
<br />
Although I might get an RSI from Can4 all the time, I am doing MGB first as a responsibility to my guild. Anyway, at about an AA every 90 minutes if chain-pulling in BoT, what's another couple of days?</div></div><hr />

Yikes... Shaman Class Officer who doesn't have CanniV at lvl 65... <br />
<br />
Big Kahunas you got there...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Canni5 is so much better than any other AA we get, it's just ridiculous.  Especially when raiding, since there's always a spare cleric or druid, standing around bored, waiting to heal you, so that's just free mana.  The amount of damage I can sustain on large mobs from laying on every dot imaginable, and canni5'ing when oom is simply... inspiring.<br />
<br />
I use it soloing, partnering, exp'ing, raiding... it's hands-down the most useful thing to get.  After that, SCM is probably #2 for me - very underappreicated, but you just get used to using less mana for everything you cast.  Really makes gameplay more enjoyable for me.<br />
<br />
*edit*  It's cajones, I think.  /grin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, well, at 6 banked AAs, I did train Can-5, and... WOW ! <br />
<br />
Used it repeatedly raiding NToV tonight. and got another three banked already towards MGB. <br />
<br />
I got run3 at 55, metab3 at 60 (damn horse), and then went straight to 65. Then acquired, in order: RC1, MC1/2/3, Can5. MGB next, then probably VP. <br />
<br />
I'll be reading up on others' observations, but here is a general question:<br />
<br />
General observations: what do you recommend as a smart initial investment of AAs:<br />
<br />
1. Damage Absorbtion, including <br />
Innate Stamina <br />
Combat Stability <br />
Natural Durability <br />
Advanced Innate Stamina <br />
Innate Defense <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
2. Damage Avoidance, including <br />
Innate Agility <br />
Combat Agility <br />
Advanced Innate Agility <br />
Lightning Reflexes <br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
3. Casting Improvement, including <br />
Spell Casting Mastery <br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement <br />
Spell Casting Reinforcement Mastery <br />
Quickbuff<br />
<br />
I was really leaning towards Damage Avoidance, when someone said &quot;let the tanks do their job; go for Casting Improvement&quot; - and it just made a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your input.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">never never never spend AA on sta/wisdom/any other stat if you're in a guild that raids, as your guild progresses you've have more sta and wisdom than you know what to do with<br />
<br />
there really is no best path after canni5 - SCR/SCRM, SCM, ND, QB, SC, RC, VP, MGB, CA/LR.....  <br />
<br />
just pick one randomly and get it, then move on</div></div><hr />
