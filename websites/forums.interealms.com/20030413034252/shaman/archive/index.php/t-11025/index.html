<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i was wondering how many people actually buy sow potions and such, <br />
<br />
im tired of being poor =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xhosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yes people buy sow potions. No, it is not a good play making skill unless 20 or 30 pp per stack of 10 is a lot of plat to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Dragonsfyre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alchemy will never make you rich, and if you do not have high skill yet, it will make you poorer to raise it up.  That being said, I do make a decent amount of plat selling potions in the bazaar, primarily I think because my server is not very cutthroat on potion prices beyond the SoW potions.<br />
<br />
Every week or so I restock my sales mule and scrape off the profits.  It never amounts to more than a few Kpp in profit, but that is plenty to keep me and my alts in food and water, and allows me to buy the occasional trinket or KEI when I need it.<br />
<br />
These days most of my sales are in Shrink and Grow potions, and sometimes both to the same people.  I wonder sometimes if they go around shrinking and growing themselves...heheh.  Gate potions still sell decently, but not at the profit point that some might like.  2000pp for a 10 charge to the destination of choice is what I sell them for.<br />
<br />
Occasionally I'll have someone clean me out of DS potions also.  And the Lev and ITU potions sell ok.  Beyond that not much else moves.<br />
<br />
It's kind of a pain to refill the mule, but I love coming home from work and seeing how she did that day. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Overall..even with 180 skill now I have never made enough money to recoup my losses in gaining the skill.<br />
<br />
I have actually been in groups where melee's were talking about &quot;Damn..how am I going to get another portal potion now!?&quot;..and they didn't even think to ask me.  I had to explain to them that I'm an alchemist to finally persuade them to let me make them a few potions at cost...which are trivial.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I love being able to make high-end potions.  I use my own ITU potions, sell a few damageshields and stuff, but it's mostly pretty marginal benefits.<br />
<br />
(I just realized I can make levitation potions now that dont need batwings..I'll have to keep a few of those around now.)<br />
<br />
Anyway..you can make marginal profits on SoW's and shrinks, but don't expect to make back anything close to what a smith or jewlerycrafter can make.<br />
<br />
Sorry to bust that bubble</div></div><hr />
