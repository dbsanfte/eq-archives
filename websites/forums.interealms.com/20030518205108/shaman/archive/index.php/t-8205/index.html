<br />
I have never done much duelling, but am looking for some advice on how to duel a SK.  I am lvl 62, he a bit lower.<br />
<br />
I figure get my resists high as possible and stay away from him.. keep rooted and blind and dot till he dead.  Let doggie chew on his but while I cast.<br />
<br />
I know he will life tap, but eventually he should run out of mana, and with my regen I should still have mana left when he is out.<br />
<br />
Any advice?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pebles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Dueling I SK, most important thing is donot let you hitpoints get low. If the SK has any skill then what you want to do is throw a 1 or 2 lesser DoT's on him, then nail him with a big dot. If using your Pet, let your Pet chew on him, if he stops to fight the pet then jump on him, when he goes after you again, back off.<br />
Keep Health above 60% keep dots on him, keep him attacking you and not your pet.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HIGH HIGH HIGH MR.  Stay far away from him.  Be used to 3rd person view because you need to duel in it.  They can Shadowstep which is a mini-teleport.  Have a see invis item WORN, not the buff, they have instant invis abilities through pre nerfed circlet of shadow.  Do not get in melee range if able.  If you get low on hps run away and heal.  Keep him dotted.  Also if this is a 51+ sk, his pet is better than yours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Use blind, root his pet, also keep your first buff slot open so you can dispell his snare. A see invis item is mandatory if he has a Circlet of Shadow. If he does decide to use invis he will lose his pet so it evens out some. <br />
<br />
Here is the bad news.  At 52 he has mental corruption which is a lifetap/mana tap proc. If he's 54 plus he will have 2 spear spells that can do a total of 650 damage in about 2 seconds. Those are based on poison as far as I know. If he's 55 plus he's going to have Bobbing Corpse which will jack up his poison resist and /discipline unholy aura which does around 1200. So thats about 1850 damage off the bat. <br />
<br />
The good news (for you) is that fear doesn't work anymore in PvP. Also his pet is only tougher than yours if he has the level 58 one. If you have your 61 pet you have the advantage there. Depending on your spells and gear you should be able to beat him as long as you can withstand that initial onslaught of damage.</div></div><hr />
