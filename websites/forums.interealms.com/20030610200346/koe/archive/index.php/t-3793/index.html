Nothing on the posts as to what it drops off of, but this is an AWESOME resist item and it's a RANGE slot item.  Would be good for all the lizzies to have, especially monks and sk's since they usually get wacked first heh.  Anyone know what this drops off of in Droga?  According to allawhatever it drops in Droga, but there haven't been updates as to what you kill for it. Oh well, thought I'd bring it up in case some haven't seen this item yet, would be a good thing to pharm a bit for the weak, er uhh, scaled ones.<br />
<br />
*edit* just noticed the weight, may not be too good for monks till raid time, but still uber. :D</div></div><hr />

The goblin fanatics drop this in the fort area deep in Droga, in the building where the oven is. This is something many of the lizards have talked about going to get, but it is a rare drop and there are enough gobbies there to give a soloer trouble. Razma and I went in and did the camp for a short time, before my pet decided to go make a lot of friends. Good ol' Raz FD'd, I was left to gate and pray, but I made it. I wouldn't mind getting this before they upgrade Droga/Nurga and potentially remove it from the game, but it would take a small group of folks (not necessarily a full group. 3 high levels could do it safely if one is crowd control.) These will all be greens to most of our high level folks.  I've been meaning to try to get the lizards in a group and go farm these, then I wouldn't have to use a friendly pet.  It is a nice item. I need to look into this again.<br />

Let's take an evening to go sit in Droga and demolish the gobbies.  be an excellent time to have a get-to-know you session with recruits as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ummm, look at stats carefully....Monks?   ummm 7wt item??? ummm i dont' think so even for raid time.  Monks get hit no matter what they do and by high lvls monks stretch their wt limit by a lot...a 7wt range slot piece would probly drop AC by 50-75 at least.  unacceptable loss imho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'll go along with who ever down to Droga to hunt these gobbies.  Personally I've never been down there so I wanna see the zone.  So, if anyone wants to pick a date just pop it up here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Droga = best mid-lvl zone ever, i love it but few mid lvl characters go there do to the risk involved.  At the level this zone is exp at it is very difficult to unskilled players/poor groups.  Definately need a strong group that works together well.  I can say in the right group there is no better zone for exp, it has a Huge exp modifier attached.  Many level 60 characters could walk into this zone and wiped out in seconds if their invis breaks in the wrong spot, get a bad pull, runner mob that causes a train, etc.  I highly enjoy the challenge this zone provides and contains many great loots.  I'm sure VI will change/remove it cause few go there other than high levels to farm and the occasional PL, unfortunately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've spent quite a lot of time in Droga after various drops such as earring of essence (+10 svm), bracer of vajeen (+10 fire, +10 cold, dru/rang only), and book of rings (forget all stats but it has nice resists). Soothsayer Dreznek (sp?) drops the earring and bracer. He pops in a room with 4 mobs. The initial break can be pretty challenging depending on how many legates are up that will heal. It is also possible to get adds from outside and above if you aren't positioned correctly. I've been wiped out from these adds several times. :) Most of the time it has just been me and a necro doing this room. I have also been able to solo break the room recently but again if there are too many healers mana gets burned down quick. The goblin fanatic drops the stone and the book of rings. He is a random spawn both in the Sooth room and the surrounding room. I think the stone is a common drop. He also drops an iksar necro only book. If you sit in the Sooth room and do the 4 spawns you definitely have a chance of popping a fanatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Falamil Vaemas and myself ran around here together once.  We did AE :)  Works awesome, I had my pet up, Vaemas(necro) had his up, and I'd just ae stun things to death while fal and vaemas did AE and the pets went to town.  We owned most everything there and only ran into trouble when we couldnt find our pets and fal went LD &gt;:P  Fun zone to roam around in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zhentil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">me and Lianna went to droga a couple times after a idol for her and a shroud for me...we had almost no trouble except for once when camo dropped at an inoppertune time while we were looking for some rare that popped on my tracking...i think if you go with less than an overkill group then the key word would be patience hehe...if you try to rush anywhere you will get far too many HTing and healing mobs to deal with without a skilled enchanter/bard<br />
<br />
anyways hey everyone...speaking of lianna anyone seen her around?<br />
