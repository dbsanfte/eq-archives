Log in his characters and the /played command will tell you how much time has been played in days/hours/minutes on each character. That info is kept server side and will tell you how much time he has been playing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Years ago, when I was 14-15, I started to get heavily addicted to MUD's, almost exactly like you described for your step son.  I would sneak on in the middle of the night and play until 5am, get two hours of sleep, then go to school.  I would fall asleep in my classes and then just come home and play all night, completely neglecting my schoolwork.  Your step son is going to hate you for it, but you have to get him to stop.  I sure as hell wish my parents had completely cut me off from games when I was younger, because my life would be in much better shape now.<br />
<br />
My advice is to put new passwords on the account and the machine.  If that doesn't work, remove the keyboard at night and keep it in your bedroom so that it is impossible for him to play.  Also, I did a search in google.com for &quot;windows activity monitor&quot; and got a whole bunch of results for programs that monitor what is done on the machine.  Most of them appear to cost money, but it is an option.</div></div><hr />

lmao. Here I am reading this informative serious post and this smacks me in the face. Thanks for that laugh.<br />
<br />
There's got to be a package/tool you can install on win2k/xp (not in a domain) that will let you restrict users to logon hours. That would work well.<br />
<br />
But you've got to bolt down and pay close attention no doubt. When eq first came out I was a newlywed and after 6 months of playing it My wife was ready to kill me. This time around I have to force myself to play less and on smaller time frames.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Some of the addiction horror stories are pretty bad, especially with teens.  I would definately take this very seriously.  You need to be prepared to wipe EQ out and not play yourself if that's the only way to fix this problem.<br />
<br />
If your stepson has already disobeyed restrictions on when he's allowed to play EQ, he should have his EQ privileges removed for a while - maybe a month.  Change the password on the accounts and don't give him the new password.<br />
<br />
After the privileges are restored, tell him that if you ever catch him deleting an EQ log or playing EQ at an inappropriate time, he'll be banned for a longer period, and that you will be checking up on him.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, just type the password for him every time he is allowed to play.<br />
<br />
If he's really addicted he may try to buy an EQ game card and start a new account.  If that happens, it's time to wipe EQ from all machines in the house.  You may choose to terminate Internet access as well.  If you need Internet access for work and use a cable/dsl router, you can disable external internet access via the router and re-enable it using the password-protected router config page when you need it.  Just remember to disable it again when you are done.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On the OS side you can restrict the hours of access on machines running NT/2k/XP then restrict access to changing the PC time but this is a little more involved than my description.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">hmmm 15 years old here and i know what your talking about first hand.<br />
<br />
 Normally I only play 4hours tops after school but lately since my TV broke and started making clicking noises I've been spending a lot of time on EQ (and Counter-strike, HL mod).<br />
<br />
 I may not be quite addicted but my friend definitely is, also 15 years old. On weekends and holidays he spends the WHOLE day on EQ (breaks for when he goes out etc but if hes on his house he's on his computer). <br />
<br />
Personally all i an say is he'll have a burnout, I've quit EQ a total of 4 times in 2 years. Give it a month or 5 **grins** and he'll stop...maybe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Take this seriously.  It can turn into a big problem.<br />
<br />
Install software to limit his access to the computer if possible.  If you use a router to share an internet connection, you can configure it to block his IP at certain times.  If he is like most teens, he can find a way around anything you can think up, but try it anyway.<br />
<br />
Mostly, get involved.  There is a reason he is becoming addicted.  The fantasy world has become more interesting than the real world.  Your attention is probably the only thing that will get him back on track.  Try not to be confrontational about it, as that will push him further away, but find a way to get him involved in real world activities instead of online life.</div></div><hr />

You as a parent say NO! Child does it anyway and now you talk about how disable what hes doing. THINK AGAIN!!! <br />
<br />
As a parent you need to teach your kids to obey the rules! If I disobeyed I got punished. I havent heard many speak of punishment only how to prevent the child from loging in. I say punish the hell out of him if he disobeys. <br />
<br />
Son if you log in again in the middle of the night I will have ground you from useing the computer completely, and if you continue to disobey me i will delete your charactor and find something even more unplesent. <br />
<br />
Blah blah blah.. something like that. Parents are tending to go soft and let there kids run over them... result spoiled disobdant brats that think they can always have there way. Your not doing them any favors by not punishing them. <br />
<br />
Spare the rod spoil the child!!!!!<br />

I say leave the computer as it is. Fix the kid not the computer. The kid is the problem!</div></div><hr />

he could just learn another login. your not fixing the problem. If he disobeys thats what needs to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">well if your whole family plays EQ perhaps try the pen and paper version of everquest (or D&amp;D) that way you can all play together. Maybe get his friends interested in playing with yall.<br />
<br />
or restrict login times for his user<br />
if using xp try this link http://www.zdnetindia.com/downloads/info/10120524.html<br />
<br />
Also The Lock 2002 from http://www.crashcoursesoftware.com can limit internet access during specific times for win 95 and up<br />
<br />
hope this helps</div></div><hr />

<br />
I disagree.  You are saying that adding security to the computer(s) involved is &quot;not fixing the problem&quot;.  Use of those security measures are indeed a part of the solution.<br />
<br />
Yes, if he disobeys he needs to suffer the consequences.  The punishment should start with removal of EQ/Internet/Computer privileges, exactly how long and what restrictions are a judgement call.<br />
<br />
However, the parent can't camp out by the computer 24/7, and the child's already demonstrated a willingness to defy the established rules.  So the parent has to enforce the rules in a way that the child can't get around.  That's the question the original poster really came here with, and that's where the security measures that we've been discussing come in.  AFTER the punishment has been established and AFTER you've established that the child can't or won't obey the rules on his own.<br />
<br />
Once the punishment period is over, then the parent can start rebuilding the trust relationship by allowing lightly supervised EQ privileges... with the clear message that any abuse of the new privileges will result in harsher punishment.  At that point I'd look into detection mechanisms, rather than enforcement.  i.e. I'd want to be able to look at some logs and determine what apps had been run on the computer when.<br />
<br />
Eventually, someday, the trust relationship might be robust enough again that the parent's detection mechanism can just be his report card, i.e. if he's bringing home good grades, he can do what he likes with his spare time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a little FYI... the kid obviously has console access to the machine.  Anything you do can be undone/gotten around by a resourceful kid.  To tell you how he could would just be giving the kids those tools without them working for it ;)<br />
I used to have a similar problem.  Hell, I still do.  Get the kid interested in other things dealing with computers.  Spend time with him building him a very low end PC that he can have in his room without net access.  Let him learn as much as he can.  He will be better prepared for working heavily with PCs later on in life, and he'll be able to fix several of his own problems.  He might even turn out like I did after my Dad did a similar thing with me.  Not a bad gig doing part-time PC tech work while going to college full time on a full scholarship :)<br />
Or you could feed his disobedience and wake up with a phone call one night from the police department.<br />
As a kid, I've got to seriously agree with what's been said.  Punish the hell out of him, but you have to be consistent.  Go to bed 30 minutes earlier and wake up to check and make sure he's not online during the night.  Smack him with the power cable.  Get some Cat5 cable and make a noose.  Put some fear into him.<br />
And what someone above said, if you can, play some pen &amp; paper games with him.  D&amp;D is excellent.<br />
<br />
In the end, get involved.  Spend time with the kid and show him there's more to life than a game.  Blocking access to the PC is treating the symptom, not the cause.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Korbis Catchaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Discipline him in front of his friends. Let them participate.

<br />
If your kids knows about computers and is interested in them, I think there is not much you can do software-wise from stopping him from getting on it, and it'll be iffy whether you find out if he does or not.  I think controlling the eq password is a GREAT idea, until he installs a keylogger and finds it out and doesn't tell you.  The /played is even better 'cause there is no way he can affect that.  My father used to take the power cord and the keyboard, but computer power cords are a dime a dozen (I would use the fax machine's cord) and keyboards are cheap, esp five finger discount from school, but I wouldn't even use a keyboard sometimes, I would just use windows character map and cut/paste chat to my friends for the hell of it after my dad took the keyboard away.<br />
<br />
I wish you luck to finding a workable answer between you and your son and controlling his computer time in a proper, effective manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think she/he hit it on the head.  There is also a huge trust issue between parent and child.  <br />
<br />
You should not have to monitor the child.  Out of respect for the parent's rules the child should not play during inappropriate times.<br />
<br />
You need to address the higher issue first.</div></div><hr />
