<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has anyone else heard the rumor that you'll need a maxed Adventurer's Stone to access certain things in GoD?  Is there information anywhere about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>doedel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I doubt it.<br />
So far every expansion worked independant of the others.<br />
So this rumour would mean you have to own LdoN to access GoD content, thus breaking the pattern established.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that you had to have LoY to have a charm slot, which is where the Adventurer's stone goes.  I have LoY so cant confirm this one way or the other.  That would be content requiring a previous expansion.<br />

Actually a friend of mines dad (yeah how cool is that) plays and doesnt have LoY but he has his planar charm, so I am assuming that it was generally added; remember the planar charm was added when all those zones were opened to the general public (with level restrictions) as a reward for doing the flags (as was the AAs granted per flag).</div></div><hr />

Also, you do not have to bind the stone (which is an augment) to a charm for it to work. My Chanter wandered around a week or so with no charm and did LDoN's just fine.<br />
<br />
You would need a charm slot in order to get the added stats, but looks like everyone got the charm slot...so it is all rather moot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">key word: &quot;rumor&quot;<br />
<br />
also very very likely not gonna happen.  that is an ABSURD amount of adventuring required to max it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe it currently requires 366 adventures to max the stone (some areas require more than others--NOT 366 in 1 camp).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Since it appears we are getting 2 more &quot;themed&quot; camps (10 more instanced zones)... I would guess our charms will go to 140hp/mana. They should make an quest for people with maxed out adventurers stones. Like... an uber range item... The millstone of grinding</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bit off topic, but where can I find info on adventurer's stone mechanincs?  What it does for you and what it takes to increase that, etc??<br />
