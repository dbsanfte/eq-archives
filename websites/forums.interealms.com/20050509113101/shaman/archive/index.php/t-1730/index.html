<br />
Gloriana does this guy pay you for all the advertising you do for him?  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Damn, that sweet!  Can he do Troll Shaman one for me? :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I really like that picture. This time I know exactly why. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Saraquael will do sig pics for free, he just has a really long queue right now.  Donations are welcome (of course) and he does have a Paypal thingie set up on his website.<br />
<br />
I think his art is fabulous and I receive a lot of compliments and emails and Crucible-mail about my signature.   I would love to see Saraquael draw an ogre or troll (mainly, he's been doing the more &quot;human&quot; characters!) <br />
<br />
I am going to have to ask Saraquael for an emergency redraw of my sig, Raelven got a bigger rack than I did!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think I detect a theme in his work...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like how he overemphasized the boobs while still getting a good ass shot thru the robe. <br />
He should do graphics for verant, seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">so far Gloriana's is the only female pic where the chest isnt about to break free =-) even though she does have monster juggs ^^<br />
<br />
that picture is seriously sweet, i would deffinately donate for something THAT cool =-)<br />
<br />
the shadowing is perfect, and the 'figure' is amazingly well done.<br />
<br />
my favorite part of all his drawings is the way he does the hair. as an avid 'doodler' whenever im bored, i find the hair is the hardest thing to get just right.  Saraquel does it perfectly, and quite beautifully.</div></div><hr />

No, yours is definitely bigger. Hers just looks bigger cause she's an elf. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah but Glor isnt showing any cleavage, so she needs to compensate =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You fools! It's all about the tease! In other news, those are some great pieces of work. Thanks for posting Glor!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I liked the wizard, it was really grafiti style looking. I like that.<br />
The rest of the pics are more.. anime style, which I'm not really  into. The guy has some real talent, but I do agree with Landragorans synical remark.<br />
Of course, I am not really in a position to criticise his pics till I put some of my own online, still working on that. Maybe I'll do some EQ-related stuff so you people can criticise me :D.</div></div><hr />

Whats the addy for his website?</div></div><hr />

Look at the bottom of Gloriana's post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Very nice drawing.  I like to draw myself.  My question is how does he do that coloring.  Thats more impressive I think.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should donate for a new sig as you can see somebody listed below this removed my homemade one :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't laugh, Saraquael said he would make me a tshirt with my sig pic on the back for the next Fan Faire I attend.  Last time, I couldn't find anyone!  Next Fan Faire, I'll be easier to spot for those familiar with my pic.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Oh, and my sig may be losing the rack war, but I still think mine is the prettiest...and I have the best hair!<br />
<br />
I also prefer Saraquael's &quot;non amime&quot; sig pics...like mine and Uumuar's and Miiphon's and Laoke's.  But, I still think he's incredibly talented, and a really really nice guy to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Couple of question Gloriana,<br />
<br />
I seriously want him to draw a Troll Shaman for me what must I do?  Go to the site? what are the steps?<br />
<br />
Next how do I post it? I dont really know to much about the Html codes and webpages and all the other computer crap hehe.<br />
<br />
Of course I will donate as well for something like that, that is very sweet! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Laoke:<br />
<br />
&quot;I've gotten blue taffy stuck on my hand, and some gum on my right foot.  If you will wait just 2 seconds, I'll get it cleaned off and continue pulling....&quot;<br />
<br />
Seriously, those sigs are pimp : )<br />
<br />
Very fine work, I too like the non-anime approach....<br />
<br />
<br />
.....<br />
<br />
and big racks.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey Scurg,<br />
<br />
Saraquael does requests (but he has a pretty long sig request list at the moment).  <br />
<br />
What you do is:<br />
<br />
1) email him a recent screenshot of your character (as a jpg, not a bmp).  (there is a link to his email on his site)<br />
2) Include any special requests (I told him I wanted full Wolfcaller's and red braids and let him work his &quot;vision&quot;)<br />
3) Donate using paypal on his site (not required, but appreciated I'm sure)<br />
4) Wait!<br />
<br />
You can visit his site at:<br />
www.saraquael.com<br />
<br />
As far as using an image for a signature...<br />
<br />
1) You need a place to host it.  <br />
2) Once you find a place to host the image, you will use the signature feature of the Crucible (in your profile) to create a default signature that will appear at the end of your posts (once per page).<br />
3) You need a basic (very basic) html skill to create one (mine was made with the help of friends /wave Megumi!).  If you ever need help on a signature, I'm sure folks here would help you out with the code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Thanks Gloriana :)<br />
<br />
Couple of more questions.<br />
<br />
How do I post Screen shots?  I have no clue and always wonderered.<br />
<br />
When you say host do you mean get a website? If thats what you mean do you have any preference for me?<br />
<br />
Thanks again Gloriana<br />
<br />
I know some HTML, I have a tutorial website as well booked mark, I started once with a webpage like 2 years ago and just stopped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The picture has to be stored someplace.  For example, my sig picture is stored on my friend Jai's website.  Everytime someone reads a thread where my signature appears, Jai's website takes the bandwith hit as it is displayed to the viewer (help me here folks!)<br />
<br />
That is why a lot of places (like earthlink and angelfire) don't let you store your pictures on their site and then link them to other places, they don't want the increased traffic since increased bandwith use = increased cost.<br />
<br />
So, first you need a sig pic, then you need a place to store it, where you will be able to link to it, so others can also see it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">www.homestead.com<br />
<br />
sign up for a free '3 page' site...<br />
<br />
pretty easy stuff, jus log in and click on work on my site etc..<br />
<br />
click on upload, find file and upload it.  Then jus view it(if you uploaded it as x.jpg, and your site is you.homestead.com, it SHOULD be you.homestead.com/files/x.jpg)<br />
<br />
A minor knowledge of HTML is easy to achieve...<br />
<br />
it get the pic on your sig you have to use HTML code or UBB code<br />
<br />
note: the periods are so you the tags arent used as real code.<br />
<br />
ubb= [.IMG][./IMG]- not positive on how you apply, but either but the webaddy in between the tags, or do [.IMG src=&quot;addy&quot;]<br />
<br />
html: &lt;.img src=&quot;webaddy&quot;&gt;&lt;./img&gt;<br />
<br />
thats either right or 95% right =\<br />
<br />
have fun w/ a new sig =-)</div></div><hr />
