In largest cavern on map??<br />
<br />
Handing her something - I go in invis and have to uninvis to give her the item - does she not agro??  How about the other surrounding worms - am I gonna eat a death here?<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Spawn? Not sure .. I just know she's been up from time to time when I've passed through GD.<br />
<br />
The far more NE cavern. I guess that's the biggest, sorry. Don't have a map infront of me.<br />
<br />
She's nonAgro to all, but all the wurms do agro you. She doesn't assist however. ;)<br />
You can safely run in while invis, turn-in and then re-invis for the run out.<br />
<br />
PS: Also, make sure the two named giants are up in the fort. They *walk* out when you trigger the quest, they do not repop at this time. Thus - if they are not up, quest will run and Broodmother will end up runing around with no giants to fight, if they are not up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Somehow I think  he is trying to do the Coldain Military Bracer quest and not the leggings quest because of its focus effect :)<br />
<br />
About the bracer quest, whats best? Following the broodmother after turn in, or running to camp?<br />
<br />
Read on allakhazam it was supposed to be outside that coldain mining camp. However, before turning in the item, there is no sightings of Korf. Is he deep withing the caves, and will run up when I(Well a bard friend is) do the turn in? And does BM run to the caves as In right outside it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bracer quest? The leggings quest is the only quest I ever knew she did.<br />
<br />
/ponders .. This is new to me<br />
<br />
*Edit - Just looked it up. Looks to me it's exactly like the Leggings quest, but the only difference is that you're fighting two dorfs instead of two giants.<br />
I might have to look into doing this for my Necro, and or my Shaman.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatly, w/out runing this quest myself, I can't really say how it runs or any &quot;best&quot; tactics over another when doing this.<br />
I'll have to investigate more, myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I did the bracer quest I just ran ahead to outside the mining hole and waited for broodmother, she came eventually and it worked fine.<br />
Korf spawns pretty deep within the caves and at a considerably higher level IIRC, he then spawns anew outside the cave with a friend, lower level/hps/resists.<br />
<br />
The only problem I ran into was broodmother becoming the other dwarfs pet, but I had read about that before starting the quest so I was prepared and just pulled Korf as far away as possible from the wurm.<br />
<br />
Not sure if Broodmother becoming pet to the first thing that aggros you is still an issue, its been a long time since I did the quest and they might have fixed it. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking of the wristguard quest, could someone explain this.. It seems I'd need to be non-kos to Kael and Thurgadin to do it ? How can a person on Coldain/CoV faction do the quest.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>guice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The funny part, I don't know. I plan on runing this quest with my monk and pretty much &quot;mq&quot; the end result.<br />
<br />
My monk's Ally with Coldain and Scowling to the Kromrif, but Ally to the Kromzek. :p<br />
<br />
From the walk through on Allakhazam, you basically need nonKoS with Coldain, Kromrif and Kromzek ( all the mobs in gleed area see invis ).<br />
Not sure exactly how to do this w/out using a nonFactioned Warrior following Rallos Zek.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dante</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Make a level 1 ogre warrior worshipping Ralloz Zek, camp him out in CC while killing orcs and grab acid when it drops.<br />
Then get the harness using him.<br />
<br />
Or have a friend do it, easy MQable quest since the item is on a NPC corpse open to anyone.<br />
<br />
Edit: Err just saw the &quot;without using a nonfactioned warrior&quot;.<br />
<br />
Good question, maybe Erdarf or whatever his name is doesn't have a faction and you can get the gem that way... ?<br />
Never tried actually hehe.<br />
Since quest is originally for people on Zek/Rif faction the Kael part isn't meant to be a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Spinashe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thats great thanks Dante, I've got two pc's so I'll do it like that.<br />
<br />
muhaha.. coldain wristguard WILL be mine :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Serj</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Last I knew and this was from a GM, the Kromriff Military Legs quest is broken.  I'm not sure if it's been fixed in the last month or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">As of the first part of June when I got my Legs, this quest was fixed.  I had my melee and cleric positioned at the giant fort where the giants would spawn while the druid and I invised and headed into the wurm cave.  We did this right after the zone repopped after a crash.  Turned in the harness to the Broodmother, reinvis, and followed her out.  Normally I would have gated back to rest of my group like the druid did, but since I had heard horror stories from other people on my server, I chose to follow her invis.  I had a hotkey set up to shout every couple of minutes there was a quest going on and to please leave the Broodmother,Grakl Dwarfkiller and Fergul Frostsky alone.  We took down Fergul within seconds of the Broodmother killing Grakl.  She stopped and looked at us for a couple minutes, then simple walked back towards the caves.  Got me a new set of legs with ease with a group consisting of a 54 warrior, 52 paladin, 52 druid, 52 cleric, 55 rogue, and myself. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The broodmother's regular spawn point is to the rear of the guardian wurm cave in GD.  Basically, upon entering the caves from the Thurg side take the first left and then go left again.  If you are above ground she can be conned thru the ground by the empty tent with fire to the left of wurm mountain if coming from Thurg.<br />
<br />
The broodmother cons indifferent and is far enough out of the way to do the hand in and then gate to the mines/giant camp.<br />
<br />
If you are doing the Coldain Military Wristguard quest you MUST wait until the Korf starts to run to kill him or he will NOT drop the bracer.  I killed him early once and had to the frikkin quest over again. :/</div></div><hr />
