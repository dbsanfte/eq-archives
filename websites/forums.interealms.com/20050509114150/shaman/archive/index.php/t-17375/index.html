<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seveca</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heya all.  I have been off EQ for a long while due to work and other things.  I have a 55 Barb Shammy with a little less than average gear  (from what I am reading, it seems that my AC/HP is pretty low now) and the last time I really played was right when PoP came out (What the heck is a flag?).  I will be getting back into the game soon, but I have been reading the posts and there have been a LOT of changes made.  I had my char down pretty good when I left, but with all the new spells and gear changes, I think I need a tutor.<br />
<br />
Was hoping that some of ya could give me a breakdown of the new spells and thier usage, the new skills with gear (putting gems into slots?), new zones, Adventure points and the like.  I have been reading the posts, but you know how we are with our acronyms, and I can't seem to understand much of what peeps are talking about anymore.  :(<br />
<br />
If anyone can help, please post it.  If you have a &quot;Beginner's Guide to using your 50+ Shaman with the PoP and LDoY expansion&quot;, please let me know.  I guess basically what I am saying is HELP!<br />

If you have been away for awhile you might not have noticed that there is a new &quot;area&quot; on the Crucible now ... instead of asking for help in General I bet you can find a lot of good stuff in The Medicine Cabinet.</div></div><hr />
