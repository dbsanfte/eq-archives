<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm working on the cord and have my faction with Chardok to max ally. Now I would also like to help a cleric or two with their epic.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that killing a normal chardok mob gives 1 hit, so killing one goblin will fix that single hit. How about the royals? Are they a big hit or just 1 hit as well?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>grootz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Dont know!  Didn't live long enuff to find out.  This weekend a ally necromancer and myself(an ally shaman) pulled the King by the necro pulling up the corridor and feigning death.  I waited until all the mobs except the king left and cast cancel magic on the king.  I brought him back to the raid where he promptly killed me. No faction hit. Successful kill for epic piece.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i recall hearing they give the same 1 goblin faction hit.  Worst case is you have to kill goblins for another hour or two.  If you dont have the pieces for turn in yet, I wouldnt worry about it at all. If you're at the angry goblin part, you dont need any chardok faction for that hand in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I forget actually-- I believe it was something weird, like all mobs in chardok give -3 faction points.  One goblin is +1 faction point.  Two salts is +2-3 faction points.  One skin is +1-2 faction points.  In no way are these correct numbers.  But it's something like that.<br />
<br />
Takes awhile for you to lose ally, although if you're fighting everything on the way to king that could be a lot of faction loss (last time I helped my guild there I just walked ahead scouting, and allowing my self to be bind sighted so they could lull if need be.  I only helped if people were really in trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Royalty of a faction line usually gives a significantly larger faction hit than any of their underlings.  Or you can just go on level.  The higher level the critter, the more faction work necessary to reverse the hit.<br />
<br />
Two or three Dain kills got me from max Thurg ally to KoS, but it wouldnt' surprise me if Velious faction was skewed a bit compared to Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Faction hits are non-noticeable.  We farmed king/queen with 1 group of nonkos folk for a long time.  Probably 10-20 king/queen kills, and associated pulls around there (plus various named slaying when bored), faction dropped from ally to about indiff.<br />
<br />
You won't jump suddenly from amiable to kos, you'll see it slowly drop down.  When you see indiff/apprehensive, start killing in droga some more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Youichi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't know about the Chardock Royals faction hits, but I do know that Chancelor Di'Zok in the LOIO has a huge faction hit to Chardock faction.<br />
<br />
I went from Kindly to Chardock to Indifferent in one kill.<br />
<br />
SO I suggest you get someone else to get your Jade Chodakai prod, for the Charasis key.</div></div><hr />

Odd, I killed him while getting my chardok faction. Can't say I noticed much of a hit. At the time I logged all my goblin kills and they seemed to add up to what I should have expected even though I killed him in the middle of it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ungerargh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I went from low ally to (presumably) high indifferent in one start-to-finish (zone-in to Queen) chardok royals raid on which I was primary slower.  It's really not all that bad, assuming you have some guildies that like to pad their bazaar mules and AAxp in Droga.</div></div><hr />
