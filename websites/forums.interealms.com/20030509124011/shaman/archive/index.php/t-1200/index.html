<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ooker_Berkowitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have about 2kpp, but I know that nobody is going to read this post that has the JB bracer that is willing to sell it for a long time.  So i'm sure that i can save up the rest of the money to buy it.  In case you're wondernig what the stats on the bracer is.  It's 14AC and it has a clickable effect of Winter's Roar (a 250dmg DD) that you can use at level 45.  I'll probablly be that high before anyone posts.  Right now i'm level 36, and killing HG's.<br />

Anyways, if you have one and you are on crack and willing to sell it, please E-mail me at Ooker_Berkowitz@yahoo.com, or send me a tell, my name is Ooker.  Also, i might be on a Monk called Daissy. (The name is from a marilyn manson band member, so if you don't like it...i hope you die.).</div></div><hr />
