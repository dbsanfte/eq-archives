He asks if your group is ready for testing. Sounds sorta like the trials in PoJ.</div></div><hr />

He isn't new, he's always been there.   I did his test long long ago, I don't recall what it was, nothing memorable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">What I know about PoI factory that I don't know how many other people know about or care:<br />
-When you go into the factory on the left side there's an NPC you talk to asking if you have the power source or something like that.  He's the guy you talk to to get flagged for the plane of time.  You say &quot;yes&quot; and if you have a quintessense of elements he ports you to another part of zone where you walk over and can talk to a gnome (I think it's the guy in the library, Maelin Starphyr? or something).  You click the machine there, and get flagged for Time.  Anyone that's Time flagged knows this.<br />
-There's another NPC you can talk to there for a ring event.  He ports you into a room in the zone that has lots and lots of spiders that start spawning.  Apparently you kill as many as you can, and named start to spawn but that's just hearsay.  I've only tried it once, and our group had to evac out in like 2 mins cuz of about 10 mobs in camp.<br />
The guy you were talking to was probably one of these 2 NPCs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This was one of the best ways to get spectrals back when most folks couldn't zone into BoT and HoH for spectral drops.<br />
<br />
There's also a rather decent cloak that drops during it, I wear one still.<br />
<br />
Basically, you have a whole bunch of little spiders that spawn and every once in a while a named spider spawns.  That drops a piece of loot usually, which can be a ethereal parchment but can also be a spectral or a decent item.<br />
<br />
Four nameds spawn, and then the trial's over and everything despawns.<br />
<br />
There's a corner you can stand in to only fight an occasional little spider and have all the named spiders aggro on you as they pop.<br />
<br />
I've never tried to fight all the little spiders, it seems like it could be some fun :)</div></div><hr />
