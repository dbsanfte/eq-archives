<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My guild is just now approaching the ability to do Kunark Class dragons. However, I'd like some tips from you shaman in the uber guilds on how to compete with the current uberguilds for these spawns.  I'm on Tarew Marr in Oathsworn.  The guilds on our server that compete for these spawns are Enlightened Dark, Black Company, The Awakened, Blood &amp; Loyalty, and I think one or two more that I can't remember at the moment.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

If you see that they have spawned, start heading there right away and get 25ish people there that are intent on killing it (more is always better).<br />
If you can get 18 or so into the zone and make your intentions known, most people will respect that.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure BC, ED, and TA won't bother you for the most part on these targets as these are now only killed for fun because nothing else is up. (stupid staggered spawnings)<br />
I'd be more concerned with B&amp;L, SA,syndicate, and any others I may be forgetting.<br />
<br />
One exception to the rule would be servilious. Some people may still be actively hunting him for green scales for warrior epics. Which means he who has the force present there first to engage will go. Coincidentaly he is probably the easiest to kill of the bunch.</div></div><hr />
