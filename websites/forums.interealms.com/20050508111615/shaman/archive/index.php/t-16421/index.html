<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Don33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone know what the max haste is for shaman?Im only lvl 46 now but I have done alot of testing with alacrity while wearing my cloak of flames then alacrity with my SCHW and theres is no difference in speed between the two.Is this a result of some type of haste cap?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Items wont haste above your level... So a 40% haste item on a level 30 toon is going to be limited to 30% haste. As he levels, the haste will increase.<br />
<br />
Spell haste doesnt have the same limitations. <br />
<br />
However, there is an overall haste cap for each level. I dont remember the number for all the levels, but I know at level 60 its 100% haste maximum (ignoring bards here). Seems like the limit was somewhere near 50% at level 50, but I could easily be wrong on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">go ask on steel warriors. they have some good people there that can point ya in the right directions on just what haste is, how it's calculated, and other things regarding haste.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You seen what a hasted monk can do to stuff at lvl 35ish?  It's sick!  There's a reason for the haste cap at lower levels.  It's so melee from these classes isn't completely obscuring the need for support classes.</div></div><hr />
