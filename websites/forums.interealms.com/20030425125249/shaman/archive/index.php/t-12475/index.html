<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to let the community know about this cool little ring I picked up last night.  The quest begins in Neriak Commons, but the majority of the quest pieces are found in LoY.<br />
<br />
To begin the quest head to Neriak Commons, invis and run in, the quest NPC is right by the PoD and is indifferent to evil races.  There is an identical quest that begins in Freeport but I won't go into that here.<br />
<br />
Hail Fleshweaver T'Soma, he will ask you to get 3 luggald flesh for him.  Go to Dulak and down into the hidden passage.  Take your first right, and in a room with two campfires there are a lot of luggalds.  Kill them and loot 3 flesh from these guys. They were all green to me at 61 and really easy to kill with dog and horse. Head back, combine them in the satchel you got and hand them in.<br />
<br />
He will ask you to get 3 more flesh for him.  These are different from the first part of the quest, and you get them in Nadox.  Head into nadox and cross the lava bridge.  In the middle hallway there are alot of luggald type creatures and also some troll Treasure sorters.  Get a few friends to help or you can do this part solo at 61 (possibly as early as level 54 or so).  Get the three flesh and return them to him.  At each step you must combine the three flesh in the satchel that he gives you.<br />
<br />
Now he asks that you find an npc on the shore in Toxxulia forest.  I forget the name of the npc but she is in the northern part of the zone on the water, by the north wall.  Simply Hail her and this will spawn a level 60 giant 'Fleshless Servant', a skeleton.  He is easy to slow with Malosini (I had a chanter to tash so might be tougher than I think), and will go down fairly quickly with a small group.  Bring a good tank and a healer, druid as healer is probably fine, he will HT so be prepared at the start of the fight.  We had a necro sacrifice his pet to HT each time so if you don't have a necro with you use dogdog as HT fodder.<br />
<br />
As a side note you can Hail the last npc as many times as you want, spawning the Fleshless Servant each time.  We did this about 4 or 5 times for all the people there and it was great experience.  Definitely not a solo mob though so be prepared.<br />
<br />
Loot the fleshless heart and return it to Fleshweaver T'Soma in Neriak and you will receive:<br />

Fleshweaver's Mark<br />
5AC<br />
Sta: 8  Wis: 4  Int: 4  HP: 45  Mana: 55  Sv Disease: 5<br />
Effect: Aura of Health<br />
<br />
The effect is 1/tick regen, not too shabby.  This adds more hp than my Velium Fire Wedding ring so I was happy :)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

Does anyone know if the Aura of Health effect stacks with itself?  I have the good version of this ring, Signet of Grisk.  If I did the evil version for the other ring and had both, would I get 2hp/tick regen?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />
