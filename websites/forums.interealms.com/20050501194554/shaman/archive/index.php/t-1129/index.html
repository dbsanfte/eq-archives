<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sengal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I did a search and couldn't find any other topics that addressed these questions that I have:<br />
<br />
I'm currently level 31. At what level do I really need to start worrying about my resist gear? Is this a don't worry until Vox issue? Up until now, the thought hasn't even crossed my mind.  I have been slowly buying resist gear when I find it cheap and storing it in the bank for future planning.<br />
<br />
What is a good number to shoot for in each resist? 100? 150? I assume the higher the better, but is there some bare minimum that I should shoot for?<br />
<br />
What is some good specific gear that I should look for? Most of the stuff I've seen so far would force me to sacrifice AC and HPs for the resist (example - cloak of the ice bear swapped for a hooded black cloak). <br />
<br />
I suspect this is just a huge balancing act that I will need to discover on my own, but any advice from the Elder Shaman is appreciated.</div></div><hr />

You are on the path...Hold the corse.<br />
<br />
&quot;What is a good number to shoot for in each resist? 100?&quot;<br />
<br />
100 is good. With additional resist spells and bard song you will be at 250 easy.<br />
<br />

<br />
That is just the way it goes. Think of it like this though. If you have to sacrafice AC and HP but are talking 300 less dmg per spell hit what have you lost? Thats right nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mordaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hehe, now is a good time to start working on a resist kit. All the resists are pretty situational so there isn't much need to wear em every day (unless your on a pvp server) so just drag them out when you need em.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When you're the appropriate level (mid-40's) make SURE to go to Eastern Wastes and kill ulthorks.  Save all the tusks, go to Cobalt Scar (once dubious with dragons) and turn them in to the Othmir Chief.  If you get lucky, you'll have a blue diamond to hand over to a master jeweller.  If you don't get lucky, you'll still have an unbelievable amount of money for the level - like 150 plat average per turn-in.  You turn in four tusks at a time, and a tusk drops on the average of one every 10 ulthorks or so.<br />
<br />
Cobalt scar no longer requires a key, just grab a port or TL, run down to the beach, and you're good.  If you have good dragon faction basically nothing there is KOS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Weis if you don't mind me clarifying that for you just a tad :p<br />
<br />
The wyverns are KOS to non-dragon faction folks (they line the ridge). However you can go past them inviso with no problem. The Othimir on the beach are neutral to all unless you have killed them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To be perfectly honest, I didn't bother with resist gear until I was in my 50's.  Frankly, under 50, there just aren't all that many mobs that require resist gear.  Sure, there are a few casters, but for the most part, it's not even worth losing the hp/ac.  When you start raiding, ESPECIALLY when you get AE mobs, then you need resist gear.<br />
<br />
Check with your guild and see if you have an enchanter with maxxed jewelry.  Then collect 8 blue diamonds and 5 diamonds.  You only need 6 and 3 respectively, but you can resell them as needed if the enchanter doesn't fail (I think 4 of the combines require greater than 255 skill for trivial).<br />
<br />
That will get you a tiarra, 2 velium diamond rings, 2 BD bracers, 2 BD earrings, a veil and a necklace.  Pare it down as necessary, of course.  Personally, I didn't bother getting a tiarra, necklace, or veil myself, as I don't want to give up the ac/hp and wisdom I have on those pieces for the relatively low resists they offer.  Even without the veil, necklace, and tiarra, I can get most of my resists up to the 290's with raid buffs.<br />
<br />
If you get into a high level raiding guild, you'll find that you replace a lot of the above stuff with items of equal or greater resists.  Right now, I'm looking to get a Crown of the Kromzek Kings sometime in the next few times we drop Tormax.  Compare that to a tiarra!  ;)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">For HoT, I would suggest 125 vrs fire and cold (unbuffed) at level 55, and plus 10 to each for every level under 55. If you are under 51 dont even consider going to HoT (actually for a shaman I would say wait till 57 but some people would scream about that).<br />
<br />
Gather some friends and go to Temple of Droga. Camp the Fanatic that spawns in the area around Soothsayer Dregzak. The Fanatic rarely will drop a Stone of Morid. Look it up its amazing. Buy a Crown of the Froglock kings (maybe 1k) and a Sarnak Battle shield (around 3 or 4k now). These three items alone will give you plus 60 to fire and cold, and plus ten to all other resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>argoth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You are on the right track to begin collecting resist gear now. You won't really need it until you start attending raids in your high 40's.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It really depends on what your play style evolves into.  I absolutely hate switching up a ton of items just to hit resist goals so I gravitate towards equip that is balanced and requires little adjustment no matter what I am doing.  I also never have a day free of Gflux, AE nuking, and general casting unfriendliness so it makes sense IMO for my resists to hover around 100.  Generally tho on a blue server you dont need resists all that much.  <br />
<br />
Just keep in mind that you don't want to be hauling around 3 bags of extra gear with you that you use 10% of the time.  If you are gonna haul gear make sure it is for fashion purposes.  I gotta sick pink shirt I whip out on occasion that makes elfs cry :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Stone of Morid being Iksar only helps the original barbarian poster not at all...<br />
<br />
Froglok crown is THE essential resist item (until you get into *really* high end stuff like the aforementioned kromzek crown). I wouldn't bother to pay for one, just head down to Lguk when you get to around 45, and camp the king.<br />
<br />
Giving up AC for resists is expected, and really, unimportant. Raid mobs will eat a shaman fast no matter what your AC is, and if the mob is attacking the shaman, the raid is wiped anyway. Be more careful about giving up hitpoints though. The cloak of the icebear is a VERY worthwhile trade against the hooded black cloak against vox or another cold user.<br />
<br />
For ToV, definately shoot for unbuffed resistances to fire/cold at 125+.<br />
<br />
Order of resists to care about, in the order they should be cared about (IMO) would be: Magic, Fire, Cold, Disease, Poison.<br />
<br />
Magic: If you are feared, you are worthless....worse than worthless, since people might waste mana trying to heal you.<br />
<br />
Fire: Lots (and lots) of things use it, and there aren't any easy-to-get mega fire items like the icebear cloak. Resist stacking isn't too friendly, which makes your items a larger factor.<br />
<br />
Cold: Lots (and lots, and lots) of things use it, but is is fairly trivial to raise through items, and current stacking rules allow for resist cold AND circle of seasons at the same time (which can put basically anyone above 200). Plus this is your strong suit resistance as a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Disease: Hardest resist to raise, but also the one most rarely used by mobs. If raiding VP, raise this to #1 or 2, cause Hoshkar is an ass ;)<br />
<br />
Poison: Trivially easy to raise, since DMF and shaman poison buffs stack. Epic + mistmoore shield + talisman of epuration + DMF = basic immunity to poison breathers, of which there aren't too many to begin with (Trakanon and Severilous are the only ones most players are likely to face).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">imbued granite spalder is a nice shoulder piece, keeps the ac and gives resists across the board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stone of Morid isn't iksar only anymore.  Have it on my barb shammy and warrior.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Old (well kinda) thread digging...I missed when the stone of morid became useable by non-luggage. Interesting...I'm gonna have to go grab one of those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep, Stone of Morid is essential resist gear for every shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">What does the Stone of Morid drop off of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Best i can tell stone of morid was changed when luclin came out. It now has all beast master races on it with all the original classes + best master on it. Which does mean all shaman can use it now since all shaman races can be beastmasters too.</div></div><hr />
