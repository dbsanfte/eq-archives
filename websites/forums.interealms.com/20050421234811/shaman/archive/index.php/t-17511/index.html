<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kagn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Started a Shaman to play since I'm about burned out with my Main. I'm wondering if anyone could suggest an alternate route to level beside Paldual? I know the exp is great, but i would rather try to see some zones not seen or used that much anymore. I leveled my main the Kunark route back when it was the route to go. Just want to see some zones  I probably only ran through. I'm used to soloing but would also like to group some to get the exp of grouping a Shaman.<br />

Your advice is appreciated,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mascoma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">well depending on what level your shaman is. prolly round 20 right? there are a myriad of places that you could go. LoIO near the sarnak fort, unrest, Aviaks in SK.  WHat i have always done is gone to illias and looked up what level the mobs are, then gone to those zones and hunted there.  I have been levelling my g/f's shaman with my pally both of the same level. and we have gone to Paludal till abotu 22, then we went to upper echo caverns, through the secret door by the soulbinder in SH. Then around 30 you can go to GD and do the drakkel wolves or coldain wolves/wolfmasters depending on what faction you want to be on(in my case our entire guild is on Thurg faction.  Also netherbian Lair is right off the nexus and is good till about 35, then right offa that zone is Marus Seru, bood till around 28.  Allakhazam's if your friend. you can look up what level the zone is recommended for/what level the mobs in that zone are . any more questions Post here and ill get back to them as quickly as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hyperd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Befallen has the same ZEM as Paludan, however due to pathing you wont find that many people to group with. I like the zone however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bitzee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I did a couple of LDoN groups yesterday at level 20.  I know it's hard to find LDoN groups at that level, but the recent change to a minimum group size of 3 (down from 4) makes that a bit easier.  My group (20 pally, 20 rogue, 20 shammy) beat 2 collect missions in MMC handily.  I think we had at least 30 minutes left each time.  The loot was good too - 28 to 56pp per adventure and a couple of augs dropped (+2 strength, +1 dex).  We got 1 AP per adventure.<br />
<br />
I got about a half a level of xp per adventure.  Paludal would be WAY faster xp wise, but not nearly as much fun.<br />
