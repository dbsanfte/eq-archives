<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I already have one in run1... should I go run2 or regen1?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Raikor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most will say stick with run2, but it really depends on how much time you are going to work on aaxp atm. If you're going for 60 asap, get run2 and run3...if you're racking up the aaxp now for fun or convenience and will continue to do so before regular xping again, it really won't matter.<br />
<br />
Almost at 1st aaxp point myself and going for regen first. Regen 3 will be a small change, but better than nothing considering my current gear. AAXPing for fun now...just feel like getting a few points before trying to level again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">run 1, reg 1, reg 2, reg 3, run 2, run 3...... Baron :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I personally went for 3 points in regen at level 54. I think it depends if you send a lot of time in indoor zones, if you do, run speed might help you more.<br />
<br />
The benefits gained are quite small from either, so I think it's really personal preference.<br />
<br />
And of course, you realise you are inviting the &quot;anyone who does AA before level 60 is stupid&quot; comments? :)  (A sentiment I don't agree with, but I have seen it expressed even more rudely than that, thankfully not on this forum).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I don't really care though, I wanna be a Baron and I'm going to get my AA points while the stuff that gives good experience is an easy kill.<br />
<br />
I plan to get run3 and regen3, and then start leveling again... granted regen3 isn't a lot, but it makes a difference... every bit counts. Run3 obviously is of HUGE advantage indoors.<br />
<br />
Just not sure if I should finish run before I start on regen or do regen then finish run :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I did Reg3 first as I solo more often then grouping, even though the regen isnt much it still helps, personally, most wont agree with me here but I dont find Run3 all that useful, I guess because I never run. /shrug<br />
<br />
I was actually going to keep getting points to I had 5 in reserve for Canni5 but I had to stop AAexp since I now got Torpor and Malo, so now its a race to 60. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Arisai/Miser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Runspeed is by far the best bargain you get for your AA points. Most people that say it isn't don't have it. :) You will get it eventually anyhow, so just get it first and see just how awesome it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Mez was getting an AAXP every 5 hours or so so it was not bad.  Now like Scurg mez going to lvl to 60 where I expect to get an AAXP every 5 hours or so.  The differace will be where I get it and what kind of loots drops for the same amount of time and effort.  <br />
<br />
I like run3 and regen3 both.  It was also nice to slow down the lvling a little bit....  some people in da guild where starting to get a little green like a trollie at how fast mez was lvling so I wanted to give it a rest.<br />
<br />
Mez just wait to 60 to continue AAXP and then mez grind in places like Seb or chardok instead of HHK.<br />
<br />
If people think Gerka stupid *grins* dat just fine wid Gerka.  Mez having fun and that why mez play.  :)<br />
<br />
*burp*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Especially about &quot;mez having fun and that why mez play&quot;.<br />
<br />
I figure I'll stop when I get Baron... I could do mental clarity and I might even do it, but I'm going to get baron for sure, then continue.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just get my fiance (52 cleric) to bother getting the same runspeed as me, I wouldn't have to stop every 30 seconds when she's following me in a dungeon. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">i think i'm the only one going for all 5 wis exp making 10 wis total...is that a bad idea? or is the ability to run fast just more popular?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I hunt in seb alot, and notice whenever we trained the exit, whoever has the lowest level of run speed would be in deep trouble and usually did not make it.<br />
<br />
Many people seem to be working up run speed 2 for general indoor purposes, then returning to leveling.  Seems to be enough to outrun the frogs/golems/aliens/sarnaks etc to the zone.</div></div><hr />
