<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't really been a fan of the latest writer for mobhunter, but she raised an interesting point in her most recent post (http://mobhunter.com/000031.html).<br />
<br />
Basically she argues that five phrases in EQ are should be taken out of use because they have many different meanings for people:<br />
<br />
Uber: The German word for Over describes high end characters, guilds, equipment, or abilities. We hear about uberguilds and ubermobs. We use the word as insult or praise when a friend acquires a new shiny item. Uber is anything more powerful than you. Some 65 paladins with 300 AA points don't consider themselves uber. Level 25 rangers tear through Crushbone like a tornado and everyone in the zone considers them uber. There is no specific use of the word that helps describe a particular state of the game, guilds, or players. In almost every Mobhunter article I wrote for my first three months, my editor, the uber wizard Azile Ciricbane, had to edit out my use of uberguild and told me to replace it with something more specific.<br />
<br />
Casual: Casual is the most misunderstood and misused phrase in the Everquest community. There are casual guilds who raid the Elemental Planes. Some casual players have hundreds of AA points and play 40 hours a week. Everyone has a different definition of a casual gamer. Sometimes it means low level. Other times it means non-raiders. Instead of asking for changes for the casual gamer, we need to describe exactly what it is we desire. Do we need more short-duration events? Do we need less locked content? Do we need higher power equipment available to single LDON / Ornate equipped level 65 groups? Avoid the word casual, speak in detail.<br />
<br />
Mudflation: This ancient term gets used any time someone sees the game progress and doesn't like it. Mudflation means little but has a built-in wrapper of negativity that lets us label progression like a package of spoiled meat. Few describe exactly what they mean when they use the term and fewer can describe how to fix it. The game gets larger. The high-end zones get higher. Level limits increase. Equipment grows in power. That isn't mudflation, that's progress.<br />
<br />
Timesink: This is one of my favorites. Timesinks describe any action in Everquest that someone doesn't enjoy. Everquest is a timesink. Reading a book is a timesink. I know one perfect way to avoid timesinks. If you aren't enjoying what you do, do something else. Before you begin telling me that you HAVE to camp shards to get intoVex Thal or you HAVE to get your Ring of Scale faction up, remember that this entire game is voluntary and the world is big enough to find a million other and often more enjoyable things to do. If you find a particular event or hunt that bores you to tears, instead of labeling it a timesink, just tell SOE what you don't like about it. Speak in details, not overused and meaningless generalities.<br />
<br />
Class Balance: Classes, by definition, cannot be balanced. Every class is good at some things and bad in others. There is no way to balance the wide variety of skills from one class to another. How does one compare the blasts of a wizard to the slows of a shaman to the healing of a cleric? With limited combat interaction it becomes difficult to make every one of the sixteen classes unique yet not required for a group. SOE can tweak class abilities and help support those unique roles. SOE can also tune encounters so they work well with particular class archetypes as they did with knights and the Ikkinz trials. There is never a clear solution for class balance and there is no conclusion. Classes cannot be balanced without ruining the unique skills that each class has to offer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here on the Crucible we use these phrases, but sometimes people have very different ideas of what they mean.  IMHO, &quot;casual&quot; means any player who only plays less than 15 hours a week.  This (on my server at least) prevents such players from joining the most serious raid guilds, and thus implies a not being in an &quot;uber&quot; guild.  &quot;Class Balance&quot; is just a matter of desirability.  If you can never find a member of class A (*cough* clerics *cough) and class B always has five level 65's lfg, then those classes aren't blalanced.  &quot;Mudflation,&quot; to me is when I see a level 15 shaman with a full set of jaundiced bone armor he bought of a guy in the bazaar for two plat, three copper, and a rat ear.  It's not a bad thing, just the reality of a game that grows.<br />
<br />
&quot;Timesink&quot; to me is when players are prevented from experiencing content by unrelated hurdles.  For example, some old end-game zone key quests required you to kill hundreds of green mobs, or kill the same green mob every X minutes, to get a peice of the key.  Now soloing greens has very very little to do with high-end raiding, but Sony connected them to slow people from getting to these zones.  Finally, I agree with Loral that &quot;uber&quot; has a different meaning depending on your power level, I think most people understand that when you refer to an uber guild, you mean a guild that raids end-game zones (similiarly an uber raider is someone in such a guild, and uber loot is loot that comes from these zones).<br />
<br />
These definitions seem obvious to me, but I wonder if other people might have very different definitions.  So while we all wait for the servers to come up, how do you define these terms?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">nice article</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Varrish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not too far off..<br />
<br />
Uber, a class with above normal grouping desirability.<br />
<br />
Timesink, spending time for the sake of spending time - unrelated to the content at hand.<br />
<br />
Class Balance, something 'in the eye of the beholder.'<br />
<br />
Mudflation, realist.<br />
<br />
Casual Player, one who has a real life.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wanted to keep them short, as I tend to ramble alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">To me uber means people who regularly hunt in zones that I sometimes forget even exist because they are so far out of my reach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">IMHO:<br />
<br />
Classes can be balanced.<br />
<br />
A game can always be balanced. Any of you played the boardgames Puerto Rico, Settlers of Catan(Die Siedler von Catan), Euphrates and Tigris(Euphrat und Tigris)?<br />
<br />
These are very nicelu balanced games where each player always has a number of options (I'm comparing this with classes) at the exclusion of others in any given turn.<br />
<br />
Balancing all these options to prevent an &quot;optimal win in all games strategy&quot; is what the designers of these games worked hard to do. It is not an easy project to undertake.<br />
<br />
AA's on the whole have made class balance more difficult since they allow some classes to take on abilities which earlier were only available to others.<br />
<br />
UBER: <br />
<br />
Has for me in EQ always become a negative word. I grouped with a beastlord and a monk (tanking) in sol ro yesterday. The beastlord was constantly talking about how uber he is and behaving recklessly (ignoring my root parked mobs and tanking them) and when the Necro (innocently asked) how Monks keep agro, is it just dps and procs? The Beastlord quickly replied &quot;Monks suck&quot;. <br />
<br />
 That for me is uber.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Uber: Two or more steps up in 'This Game is My Life&quot;liness from me.<br />
<br />
Casual: Two or more setps down in &quot;This Game is My Life&quot;liness from me<br />
<br />
Mudflation: /agree<br />
<br />
Timesink: /AGREE<br />
<br />
Class Balance: Here's my take, anyway: We have four archetypes: Priest, Caster, Melee, Hybrid; we also have four main roles: Damage Taking, Damage Giving, Damage Taking Support (buffs/heals, offtanks), Damage Giving Support (buffs). Okay, I added a category for Mana Regen, since it is so game altering.<br />
<br />
Setting up a matrix I see this (please forgive any ignorance about what the classes can do; this is my perception when posted):<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe src=&quot;http://samanna.net/balance.html&quot; width=900 height=450&gt;<br />
&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
So, anyway, with Class Balance, you want to fill your six group slots with as much category coverage and as little category overlap (except where you want backup heals, for example) as possible. Except for Damage Giving. Can never have too much Damage Giving, can we?<br />
<br />
With two of each archetype, equally capable of filling the main role, probably not a problem. With three or four of each archetype, with various levels of performance in the main role, plus a complicated system of overlapping secondary abilities... wow, you'd have to pay me to try and solve this one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">fact:<br />
<br />
unless classes become identical, there will *ALWAYS* be people complaining that the classes are unbalanced because class x has ability z that class y does not.<br />
<br />
so i hope they never balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">People can complain, but that does not mean it's unbalanced/balanced.<br />
<br />
Playtesting by independent minded players can reveal class balance issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice idea Sam, keep up the good work.<br />
<br />
What do the bolded classes in your matrix represent?<br />
<br />
In the damage giving section I would probably try to rank the dps of the classes (approximately), and have one section for DPS for &quot;short&quot; fights and another for &quot;long&quot; fights, rather than worrying about the source of the dps be it pet, DD, archery, dot etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">actually I have always been thinking that &quot;Class Balance&quot; is a myth. There will always be advantages and disadvantages to certain classes, often just depending on perception.<br />
Board games overcome this problem with making everyone the same. It does not matter if you play Risk with blue or black stones, it very well matters what cards you draw.<br />
<br />
As for the other points, well Über is depending on perception but mostly  describes players that are members of the top 3 guilds of a server (or the guilds themself). At least that is my definition.<br />
<br />
Timesinks have never bothered me, so the name is meaningless for me a s an EQ player. Everything is a timesink if it is worthless to you and nothing is a timesink if you believe the time is well spent.<br />
<br />
Casual means just that, casual. 40 hours a week is not casual. 20 hours  just barely may. Especially if some of that time is spent socializing. I am a casual raider, which means I  raid a maximum of three time a week with 1.5 times on average.  But that is a different concept. Casual player &lt;&gt; casual raider.<br />
<br />
Enough rambling :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact:  &quot;people *ALWAYS* complaining&quot; has nothing to do with the actual issue of class balance.<br />
<br />
There are thousands of games out there that balance the classes (or players or teams or sides or whatever).<br />
<br />
----------<br />
I thought the article was average.  The gist seems to be:  SOE can't fix the game because WE aren't explicit enough when talking to other players.<br />
<br />
Bull****.<br />
<br />
SOE knows what we mean when we cry about class balance.  They understand what a person means when they post &quot;Holy crap the old VP quest key is a timesink&quot;.  <br />
<br />
The only valid point he brings up is the definitions of Uber and Casual<br />
<br />
Uber:  non-Casual.<br />
Casual: non-Uber.<br />
<br />
He's got a point about that one, the rest is just fluff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Board games overcome this problem with making everyone the same. It does not matter if you play Risk with blue or black stones, it very well matters what cards you draw.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just to clarify, I am not talking about games like Risk here.<br />
<br />
The games I am talking about were developed to minimize the influence the effect of chance while still keeping the game fun. Many of the players who religiously play them as we play EQ (I have played these games and own them but am no expert) play them for that reason. These are the &quot;serious&quot; end of boardgames whereas games like Risk are at the &quot;casual&quot; end, if you will.<br />
<br />
The example might be a lame one, since the games are much simpler than EQ, but I feel the analogy is valid:<br />
<br />
In these games you often choose an ability that will last you for an enitre turn, at the exclusion of all the others. There are multiple ways to win the game, some focussing on one of these abilities and others on others. It's just like class balance in that respect. There are no random cards to be drawn, dice to be rolled. The &quot;undeterminables&quot; that can affect it is turn order (the games implement features to handicap the player who goes first enough to balance this) and what strategy the other players choose. The games use simple rules to create such complex structures that it is very hard for a player to just &quot;play through all the moves in his head&quot;, as we see in a game like Go.<br />
<br />
My main point above all this is games can be balanced (to an extent), even when the &quot;classes&quot; themselves have very different abilities. Yes it's very hard to do, but it's not impossible.<br />
<br />

Here is an interesting way to think of it.<br />
Rate a players skill on a scale from 1-10 (10 is highest). <br />
Now rate a players gear on that that same scale<br />
Add the 2 numbers together &amp; any if you are 16+ you are uber. <br />
<br />
Now rating your skill &amp; gear out of 10 is a whole other topic on it`s own<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I bolded the ones against which others of that archetype would be compared, as in (for example), &quot;a Druid can fill the pull/cc/ot role, but not as well as a Shaman&quot;, or &quot;a Beastlord can fill the mana regen role, but not as well as a Bard&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Definition of Uber.<br />
<br />
Someone who while having the same gear and AA as you do Does things that make others go DAMN. Or Someone who is playing the same game but on a level above what normal folks are doing. (See Michal Jordan in his prime)<br />
<br />
The Definition of casual PLayer in EQ.<br />
<br />
A person who cares about playing the game but is constantly frustrated due to game mechanics.<br />
<br />
Non raider. Someone who does not raid or raids so little, that he  considers it a confusing mess. Someone who schedules seem to be impossible to determine.<br />
<br />
Raider. Someone who beats up things with 20+ of thier closest allies. Someone who adheres to a schedule while playing a game. <br />
<br />
Mudflation. When The gear level between players becomes so pronounced that they are playing a different game.  See Everquest. Raider Vrs Non raider gear.  Discription. when a Mudflated equipped warrior can easily handle 1-2 of the monsters that would wipe a group of non raiders. They are Mudflated. <br />
<br />
Another discription for mudflation. Monty Haul campagns. See teenaged DM's in DnD. When gear or the new fangled power/gizmo outweighs years of charecter development. So as to make the charecter a support system for gear. <br />
<br />
And most impiortantly fun.<br />
<br />
See Everquest Ruins of kunark Era. The world was open and dangerous. Sure you had a long way to run through beasties galore. But it was managable. Fun level was also due to the freshness of the game. It was still an adventure rather than a grind.<br />
<br />
<br />
My definitions. My bias. Don't like it. Well. Tough. Lok em up in Websters then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">The word Uber is an example of the community as a whole agreeing on a word because of its accuracy.  It was originally used to describe top-end guilds.  The point is that words with no negative connotation - Super, Mega or whatever - weren't considered appropriate.  Uber, on the other hand, carried the subtle distinction of being applicable to those guilds that would happily stomp over anyone unfortunate enough to get in their way.<br />
<br />
Its probably not so relevent in EQ now as non-raiders these days are so gimped in gear these days that they are unlikely to find themselves in an uber-guild's path.</div></div><hr />

If you rate their skill &gt; equipment, then they deserve to be called 'Uber.'<br />
<br />
We have time-enabled Enchanters on Xev who won't charm in a LDON hards.  (&quot;Because they can't&quot;)<br />
<br />
Similarly, took a group of under-equipped folks through Sewers 4 last night.  It was their first God Trial and second time they had been in GoD.  (We lost on time - ouch. Had a wipe and subsequent wipe on CR).<br />
<br />
Yeah our DPS wasn't so hot, but you know what?<br />
<br />
They LISTENED and did their best.  (Their Warrior (who had to work) had less hit points than my Enchanter (Both fully buffed)))<br />
<br />
If I am a 10 on gear and a 1 on skill, then I suck.<br />

Ahh but a good shaman doesnt need to do it solo. <br />

He has friends willing to help.<br />

It is a group game. Even with our master of the trivial I would hate to walk into Chadok royals and defeat them one on 15. It just seems wrong somehow. If someone can do that then well... They shouldnt be there taking away from someone elses challange. <br />

Just because you Can do something... Doesn't mean you should. Even if it is only to save a little of the mystique of the game. <br />

It is also entirely possible for someone to get great enjoyment BY having all the stuff but these are the ones that go out and start slaughtering kobolds at level 65 for steamfont water, thereby ruining the game for other players between level 2-7 that could enjoy killing them.<br />
<br />
Casual: A player that plays to play (have fun). They log in, ready themselves, play, log out and continue life. They most certainly will group if possible, but won't give up sleep, call in sick to work or skip school to be able to raid. Casual games may in time have great stuff, but are almost never &quot;uber&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mudflation: The sudden &quot;over-valuation&quot; of items when it is discovered that they have a new use, exploit (remember shivs and tribute?). It can also cover the sudden overpricing of items in an attempt to earn enough platinum to buy the newly-discovered &quot;uber&quot; item that has started appearing in the bazaar.<br />
<br />
Timesink: Anything that causes a player to spend long amounts of time doing something they feel they need to do but would rather be doing something else. Quests, camping for plat, etc all can fall under this.. even working on faction as well, even if the end result seems worth it.<br />
<br />
Class Balance: The desire to have an ability or feature of another class without having to actually BE that class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The word Uber is an example of the community as a whole agreeing on a word because of its accuracy. <br />
<br />
Not trying to mock Crusty or anything, but I just found this amusing because it was how I thought too before I read the article.  And yet in this thread alone we have the following definitions of Uber (Ueber):<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber, a class with above normal grouping desirability.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;uber means people who regularly hunt in zones that I sometimes forget even exist because they are so far out of my reach.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;when the Necro (innocently asked) how Monks keep agro, is it just dps and procs? The Beastlord quickly replied 'Monks suck'. That for me is uber.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber: Two or more steps up in 'This Game is My Life'liness from me.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Über is depending on perception but mostly describes players that are members of the top 3 guilds of a server (or the guilds themself). &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber: non-Casual.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber to me is someone who plays their class extremely well. Equipment means nothing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber= anything or anyone thats better than me or with better equipment.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Rate a players skill on a scale from 1-10 (10 is highest). <br />
Now rate a players gear on that that same scale<br />
Add the 2 numbers together &amp; any if you are 16+ you are uber. &quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Someone who while having the same gear and AA as you do Does things that make others go DAMN. Or Someone who is playing the same game but on a level above what normal folks are doing.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber, on the other hand, carried the subtle distinction of being applicable to those guilds that would happily stomp over anyone unfortunate enough to get in their way.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;when speaking of shaman i consider uber to be above 5k unbuffed hp&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;If you rate their skill &gt; equipment, then they deserve to be called 'Uber.'&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Uber is when people point &amp; say there he/she is...wow...i remember one time that...&amp; then...ect&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When a player passes the point from &quot;game enjoyment for the sake of enjoyment itself&quot; to &quot;obsessive desire to have the mostest, bestest things&quot;. &quot;<br />
<br />
Now some of these are flat out contradictory (&quot;Equipment means nothing&quot; and &quot;above 5k unbuffed hp&quot; for instance), and even when they don't contradict each other there are still wildly different definitions.  For Jolav21 uber is all about fame on your server (&quot;when people point&quot;) whereas for Snoww uber means a really skilled player(&quot;does things that make others go DAMN&quot;), and for Stragak it basically means loot whore (&quot;obsessive desire to have the mostest, bestest things&quot;).<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just because I was a Literature major in college, but I find all this really fascinating.  I think we all just take for granted that we are speaking the same language, but in an environment where flame wars erupt on a regular basis (though thankfully not as much on this forum as on some other EQ boards) I think it's important to make sure that everyone understands each other.  If this little experiment in definition has revealed anything to me it's that Uber, and several other phrases, have many different meanings to different people.  Therefore, while it may take me a few more seconds to type &quot;high-end raid guild&quot; or &quot;extremely well-equiped player&quot; instead of &quot;uber,&quot; it's probably worth it to help avoid confusion and make sure everyone knows what I mean.<br />
<br />
Oh and Snoww, thank you so much for the quote (&quot;You can't cure Stupid.&quot;).  It very much applies to some people I know :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Class Balance to me means that your class is balanced against ALL content and not other classes.<br />
If we were all balanced against other classes then all classes would be the same.<br />

<br />
Actually I found it amusing too.  I wonder if this isn't an example of a word's meaning being broadened - and diluted - with time.  So its original use for 'uberguilds' has led to its association with top-level gear etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Uber to me has always referred to equipment, skilled has been the term for someone good.<br />
Mudflation when the gear in old world zones is obsoleted by what can be got from the bazaar, well thats one definition.<br />
Casual, yeah I agree there is nonraider and true casual. Some nonraiders that play a lot hide under the definition of casual as some sort of superiority.<br />
Timesink- When something eats away time. Ie the VT camping, it could have dropped from the first 20 mobs, but instead SoE opted for a timesink.<br />
Class Balance- to me is when classes are balanced in their chances of obtaining a group. When one class has more difficulty than other classes, or more specifically against the classes of the same type of them, then that class is unbalanced.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Kjell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Uber For me this has always been a tounge-in-cheek term, originally used to describe the most dedicated/skilled players, but these days I feel it (as I use it anyway) is more of a comment about ones view of themselves.  <br />
<br />
My stereotypical &quot;Uber&quot; would someone with nothing better to do than sit gaming for 40+ hours a week as they have nothing else to do in RL.  They gain all their personal achievement by putting others down, trampling on weaker gearered players and generally shout thier mouths off about how awesome they are.  <br />
<br />
(this does not mean that playing 40+ hrs a week makes you uber, as I state above, it is more a reflection of ones oppinion of them selves, like the Bst in one of the posts above)  I see Uber as more of an insult than compliment these days.<br />
<br />
Casual is surely the term for someone that plays &quot;relatively&quot; infrequently rather than a reference to their status in the game.  You can be casually employed in a very specialised job, that reflects not on your skills or equipment, but more on the amount of time you spend working.  Alot of people seem to hide behind the term as an excuse for their position in the game, trying to use it to reflect their playstyle rather than the amount of time they play for, they would be better realising that if they enjoy the game then their position is irrelevant.<br />
<br />
One thing that does puzzle me when these terms are used in the infference that Raiders have no fun and are always just out for their next upgrade, and that non raiders are lazy.  I am in a casual EP level guild that raids 2-3 times a week, we raid because we enjoy it, and we dont raid all the time as we enjoy the other aspects of the game aswell.  I see both sides of the coin and dont understand why each side feels that they have to compete with each other and put each other down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true dat.  it's like a series of ephiphanies by someone who's either not thought much about MMPOG or isn't very bright.  like someone riding down PCH one day looking over to her right and saying, &quot;whoa look what I discovered over there... I discovered the pacific ocean&quot;<br />
<br />
with the exception of UBER which is decidely a player-derived EQ term every single term up there &quot;mudflation, timesink, casual player&quot; and above all &quot;class balance&quot; are crucial and pivotal things developers have to carefully consider and agonize about when they develop a game.<br />
<br />
there is a kernel of actual sense in the sort of negative, nihilistic response the author has to the above points... the above do not have to necessarily be NEGATIVE from the pov of the player... and honestly in EQ they are NEGATIVE.  when you think of timesink in eq that = stuff you hate and dont want to do that is forced upon you time and time again.  class balance = stuff your class cannot do or cannot do well.  this is because, well put painfully honestly because EQ is a pretty ****ty game.  <br />
<br />
so it makes sense that the writer would inherently react negatively to those concepts (even if she isn't smart enough to QUITE put her finger on why her emotions feel that way) and say NM, stick your head in the sand and forget about it<br />
<br />
in developmental terms a time sink is anything that delays a reward in game as a means of regulating pace of the game.  it could be something as simple as needing to be lvl 45 to enter a plane, needing to be lvl 20 to mem a certain spell, or needing to check 10 possible locations for a vein to use your mining skill<br />
<br />
class balance is REAL and tards who dont understand it are morons.  class balance can be clearly understood by looking at the other side of the equation... mob balance.  think about being lvl 45 and hunting in lower Guk.  the frenzied knight encounter and the arch magus... one is a casting mob, the other pure melee.  one comes with 2 adds one with just one.  they are very different types of mobs but the encounter is analgous... you still need a full group at that level... need MR more for one, slow more for another.  but they are roughly EQUIVALENT.  that's the idea of class balance... the concept for that for players is muddled now... in large part due to the other factors above... MUDFLATION etc but the concepts are valid<br />
<br />
all of those above concept are key ones in ensuring the health and fun of any mmpog.  it's completely understandable that players who confuse, neglect, dismiss or simply be not smart enough to fully recognize them but you developers HAVE to be able to or the game turns ****ty like eq<br />
<br />
the hardest part of making any game is the balance.  that's what turn it into an art.  a lot of lower class people believe it to be ideas... throw a thousand things out there and you have a good game... that's why i used to laugh and laugh at those who would get jacked at horizons or anything else that promised everything.  the best games in the world were focused on very very small ideas done really well.  pac man.  doom.  xcom.  all these games weren't about a big idea other than making sure the game was balanced and tuned to fine tone.  they were very focused on gameplay.  dimissing the about pivotal concepts is dismissing the every things that are most crucial to a game's design</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mudflation - the tendency of developers/GMs to introduce more powerful items into a game, leading to a devaluation of older gear and its connected content.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above this is not a new term but stems from the times of the text based muds. Even in P&amp;P you encounter this kind of development. And actually, there is little you can do as a designer/GM to stop it. People are unhappy with things like item wipes. So to keep people playing (and having fun playing), you make new, better items and dangle them in front of the players. Because, face it, someone who plays a fantasy roleplaying game just LOVES big flashy toys. If you ever GMed a P&amp;P RPG and you have seen the glee of a player getting a new toy ...<br />
<br />
/sigh straying from topic again :P<br />
<br />
Until now I do not know of any RPG that has managed to circumvent Mudflation. And I do not think you can.<br />
<br />
Just a quick word why most people think Mudflation is evil. It enhances the gap between players just based on gear and produces envy from the haveless people (which may be at any level). To solve this problem more powerful items are introduced into the game and , well, guess what, more mudflation occurs.<br />
<br />
The solution? There isn t really one. Developers/GMs need to be aware of the problem and try to find a balance between enjoyable upgrades and the speed of Mudflation. In EQ this balance is sometimes kinda ok, (LDoN + Aug - EP gear), sometimes its not (LDoN + Aug  - GoD). No idea how OoW will turn out.</div></div><hr />
