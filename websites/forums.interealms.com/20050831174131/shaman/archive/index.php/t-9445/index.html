<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I gave up on using custom UIs a while back, since they kept changing things and making me re-load them.  However, I decided last night to try out some new ones.  I downloaded them all the same as I did before.  However, now I noticed a &quot;download UI&quot; button on my options panel, so I used that instead of typing /loadskin xxxx as I would have previously.  However, none of the skins loaded.  I went back and used /loadskin xxxx, but that didn't work either.  <br />
<br />
Has something been changed in the way you load these?  Or am I forgetting something important that needs to be done first?  If anyone could give me some ideas about what I need to do, I'd appreciate it.  Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />
