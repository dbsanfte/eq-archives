That would make us the best stat buffing, hasting, slowing, rooting, cc'ing, loved by all class healer...thus F**king over druids, and to a lesser extend Clerics.<br />

I agree, we shamen do need a better heal, tnargs doesnt cut it, but we simply cannot have it all. We cannot heal as well as a druid, stop asking for it, because you wont get it from the dev's.<br />

<br />
Well shamand we used to heal as well as druids. . .<br />
<br />
I for one don't think we need to heal as well as druids, but I do think we should be close.  Even if we did heal as well as a druid, I think druids would still be a valuable member of a party.<br />
<br />
My guild is short on clerics, so maybe I group with druids more often than most folks.  Druids are a very good class, with many options.  They nuke hard enough to make mages complain that Druids may be the second best nuker in the game or at least way to close to mages for them to be happy).  Evac is rather handy.  If there are charmable animals in the zone druids nuke + charmed critter is very nice DPS.  They track (very handy for many situations).  Their buffs are as nice as ours (I can't wait till the druid I commonly exp with get Pot 9).  They can also debuff mobs about as well as we can (not counting slow of course).<br />
<br />
This crazy notion that druids are an inferior class that only brings second class heals to the table mystifies me.  I've a friend in rl who is a mage, if you want to hear someone complain, ask a mage what he thinks of druid's nukes.  The only reason that I can think of why some people do not think druids are good to group with is that they do not group with them.  A good druid can safely quad and or charm kite for near as much exp as they can in a group, and most druids that I know do not really like to heal, but want to dot and nuke, even though they are usually asked to join groups because of their healing.  The reason why so many druids solo is not that they do not have anything to offer groups, but because they do not have to group.</div></div><hr />

Stat buffers - Only in stats of Str, Con, Dex, Char.  We also buff Poison and disease rather well.  We do not buff the best for Int, Wis, Att, Magic, Cold, Fire resists.  Quite a few weapons out there proc our higher buff of Avatar.  Most warriors have max str con and dex anyway.<br />
<br />
Hasting - We have 3rd level in Haste.  With enchanters being 1st, then bards, then us.<br />
<br />
Slowing - You are correct here, by 5%.  Not counting mitigation, which reduces the numbers down.<br />
<br />
Rooting - To many classes have root for me to list.<br />
<br />
cc'ing - Already talked about root above.  I dont count Dog Dog as a cc, since the things I fight pop him fairly quickly.<br />

<br />
ok so :<br />
<br />
- best stat buffing : useless . Don't you know nothing about the game ? Only stamina is usefull ,and nearly everyone is maxed.<br />
-hasting and slowing : yeah ok<br />
-Rooting :but what your point ??!  you probably know LOT of classe have root ? <br />
-cc'ing : wow we cc ! with root i suppose ? no comment . It was a good option when we were able to tank them after a slow ,channela  root ,and heal us after. When they don't hit like a truck.<br />
<br />
    Healer balance have to be redone . totally .I'm 100% to give the CH to druid.And a big blast fast heal to shaman.<br />
<br />
What have cleric :<br />
-CH<br />
-Big fast heal<br />
-REALLY FAST heal<br />
-groupe heal<br />
<br />
<br />
what have druid :<br />
-semi expensive CH<br />
-semi big fast heal<br />
<br />
what have shaman :<br />
-lesser fast heal<br />
<br />
    Yeah i don't count Q  or heal over time ,they're totally outdated now.</div></div><hr />

I said I agree we need a new heal, but we dont need to be better healers than druids.<br />
<br />
I said we can do CC, not that we're the only ones able to do CC. I said we can slow, I said we can heal, I said we can do this and that.. and we CAN.<br />
<br />
It's the sum of the whole.:<br />
It's not that we can CC better than anyone<br />
It's not that we are the best buffers when it comes to certain stats<br />
<br />
We are a buffing/debuffing/light healing class. We happen to be the  proverbial 'best' at the debuffing..just like clerics are 'best' at only the healing and druids are, well, not best at any of those criteria.<br />
<br />
Please do some research before you come here.<br />
Believe me, I've researched it, and I almost started to believe that we shamen are up a creek. We're by no means balanced, and we do need some tuning, especialy in the heal department. It just seems now adays that the Shaman community wants to be.<br />
1: Tied with Second in Healing with Druids<br />
2: Have druid dps (whines about DoTs and DD's abound)<br />

<br />
Agreed.  However this issue has been discussed thoroughly and continuing to bring it up really serves no purpose.  Some folks will just never be happy.<br />
<br />
/em lays into the dead horse with a vengeance<br />
<br />
Some people here want everything.  With AA and focus our heals don't suck entirely and by no means should shaman be able to replace clerics or druids as main healer for ALL content types.  I don't for one moment think that the shaman's main role is primary healer.  However shaman are more than adequate backup healers and for a great deal of content we actually can be the primary/only healer.<br />
<br />
The game features groups of 6.  That means that no one group can have every class.  If the content you want to face requires tons of healing then include a class that has stronger heals in your groups.  Seems pretty simple to me.<br />
<br />
But, but, but....there is no 'but'....you can't have everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And what exactly DO we have? In a limited 6 person group, why take along a shaman? Slows? I'd rather have an enchanter (decent slows, better haste, clarity buffs, pet charming for mad DPS) or a BST (SD, DPS, decent slows, some form of haste) or especially a bard (great haste, slow, snares, mana regen, resists, pulling abilities, DPS etc).<br />
<br />
Shaman are PRIESTS. We are supposed to be decent healers. If a group needs a tank, a group has choices. If a group needs DPS, there are tons of choices. If a group needs a slower, there are choices. If a group needs a healer, right now, there aren't a lot of choices.</div></div><hr />

I guess I don't understand what you're ranting about.  I've not seen anyone asking for a CH that outshines druids.  I've seen a lot of people wanting a fast heal that is near what druids have.  Where is this groundswell of people asking for the druids place in the CH chain?<br />

1)Seriously Shamad as I’ve posted earlier, I’ve not seen shamans demanding to take the place of druids in the CH chain.  For the most part it seems to me the shaman community wants a fast heal strong enough to keep a tank alive long enough for a second shot at casting turgurs if the first on bounces.  That’s really pretty much it.<br />
2)As for shamans matching druid dps, where have you seen that?  I’ve not seen it.  Yes, I want a faster nuke.  A faster poison nuke for around 1k is needed in my opinion.  That would not put us anywhere near what druids can do. I know that you said that you do not have a druid, but have you ever grouped with one?  There is a reason why mages complain that druids nuke too hard to be balanced.  All I can say is you should try grouping with a charming druid.  Try the frogs in PoS, you’ll understand just how short changed shamans are in DPS compared to druids.  We are not so close to druids that any improvement in our DPS will put us over the top.  When I group with a druid I heal. If the druid heals it is a serious cut in our DPS, even though my heals suck compared to his.<br />
3)When did shamans ask for Virtue?  Can you show me where in the proposal shamans ask for virtue?  I missed it.  I’d like some improvements in my buffs though.  Shoot all I want is a haste that lasts longer.  That would be a godsend.<br />
<br />
If you think we’re not balanced and need improvements, why are you ranting against the requests for the improvements?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Riahna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I did read your post, it had the best quallifier before a list of items.  I was pointing out that this was inacurate.<br />
<br />
I dont want to have the buffs of a cleric, I dont want the nuke of a druid.  I want a heal that I can keep people from dying.  I currently have to chain my heals in order to try and save someone.  The  druid I group with casts a heal every once in a while.<br />
<br />
The point is that  there are 3 priest classes, and at one time (51 superior heal) druids and shaman were equal.  At the time the new mini ch spells were put in.  Shamen had a spell in test, that was a little weaker then the druid top cheal.  Up till the live date, most shaman were eagerly expecting this spell. (if I remember correctly it was 3900ish hp spell)  Shortly before this, druids had made a big stink about their non-usefullness in groups.  They pointed out that clerics with ch are the only option in the high game.  The mini ch were put in, but we lost our larger of the two.  <br />
<br />
Most shaman dont want the ch, but with the absence of anything better, I will take it.  I personally would like a quick heal of a little less then druids.<br />
<br />
Many people say that we lost it because of our canni ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">. . . Some people here want everything.  With AA and focus our heals don't suck entirely and by no means should shaman be able to replace clerics or druids as main healer for ALL content types. . .<br />
<br />
Well I guess suppose Robin never complained that he did not entirely suck compared to Batman.  So since our heals only kind of suck, but not entirely, anything more would be too much to ask.<br />
<br />
I think that there is a split in the shaman community.  I said it jokingly at first, but I'm beginning to believe it.  Some people think that shamans are witchdoctors, a primitive priest class.  Other people really do think that Shamans are a utility hybrid class, and not worthy of heals close to a priest class.  Maybe we should quit asking for better heals, and ask for more utility instead?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Denero Creed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hasting - We have 3rd level in Haste.  With enchanters being 1st, then bards, then us.<br />

<br />
<br />
What other class can do all three (5 including stat buffs and healing, shrinking, sowing, binding, levitating, EBing...this list goes on)?  I made a shaman because they were quoted in the book as a &quot;jack of all trades&quot; and I am happy I did.  I have no problems getting a group and I hardly ever die.  Because I can take the place of 3 other classes.  Not a 100% but enough to make a difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sensei Xarrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">update to kraggs I think is what is needed I would agree that druids should probly keep a bit of an advantage on shamans in healing due to our other abilities.  However our highest heal now is 1950 (before focus aa)  the druid one of the same lvl is 2900 then we get tnargs which is 1300 to druid Equal lvl area spell 1750.<br />
<br />
But later Druids get an upgrade to these lines and I think shaman should too but at the same time still keeping a moderate difference.  IE Karana's Renewal before focus/aa is 4680 heal shamans should get one in the 3500 range lvl 64/65 spell then they get Sylvan Infusion  which is their upgrade to a fast heal that is 2100 heal   lvl 65  Shamans should get one in the 1750 range.  To keep everything in line with spell progressions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Bards? <br />
<br />
1. Left out shrink, since every class can shrink themselves with a gnome device and a battery<br />
2. Stat buffs are also useless and I hate it when people say we're balanced because of stat buffs)<br />
3. And bind? hello, soul binders on every corner, bind is useless as a balancing issue<br />
4. Sow? 4 other classes can sow (or affect run speed), not to mention sow potions, horses and jboots and run speed 5 making that a paltry item to balance us with<br />
<br />
I'd hold onto that thought until you're 65 and going through some of the same issues we're going through now. It's only been lately (hard LDON, GoD) that I've personally felt like more of a non-contributor in groups.<br />
<br />
Can I rock BOT or a LDON easy as the only healer? Hell yes, and do a great job (and keep up with haste and FA and maybe a nuke here or there).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Thlexian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I want to be useful.  At one time, my slows were sought because they were the best.  They made a difference to the efficiency of the group because they significantly reduced the damage that a mob inflicted on my melees during the course of the fight.  The fights lasted long enough for the slow to make a difference.  Now I have a hard time casting Malos and slow before the mob is at 50% health, and even then, my slow is often resisted.  It grinds me to see the beastlord announce his slow after I've been resisted on mine.  <br />
<br />
We're priests, and having a faster and higher capacity heal is definitely important, but damn, I want to have something that I can offer my group that is the best, that is sought and valued for my chosen class.  Maybe it's the new slow.  I've not played much in GoD yet, and don't know when I'll be able to acquire this spell since I'm not close to uber and have average gear.  But even playing in LDON (normal Guk) has been a discouraging experience.  I've been hunting there with a predominantly melee group where mobs are pulled 3 at a time and tanked in parallel.  By the time I get all of the mobs Malos'd and slowed (resisted in there too), the BL has probably had to slow at least one and one is nearly dead before I can even get to it.  Oh, and the cleric tanks and nukes between heals too.  Sheesh.<br />
<br />
I guess this post isn't adding much value to the thread, but I feel that I'm not adding much value to my groups and EQ is a social game for me.  I don't want to play alone.  I want to make a contribution to the success of a group.  I find I'm not doing much of that these days.<br />

<br />
What class other than Druids can buff HP/AC, DS, manna/hp regen, SOE, Wolf folks, invis, see invis, lev, bind, EBing, track, charm critters, almost nuke as hard as mages, have heals strong enough to stand in a CH chain, root, snare, AE nukes, self reinforcing dots, evac, port,. . . this list goes on)?<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that druids are over powered, but I am saying that shaman are not any more the &quot;Jack of all Trades&quot; than many other classes.  One ranger offers all the utility that a shaman does.  Their buffs are about as good, they have all the nice little utility spells we do.  I've never heard that rangers do not deserve dual wield because of all their utility.<br />
<br />
When you said &quot;I can take the place of 3 other classes&quot; I have to ask what 3 other classes are those?  We can certainly not CC in place of an enchanter.  We can certainly not take a cleric or druids place in a CH chain.  We cannot do DPS as well as almost any other class.  Shoot sometimes I'm finding I can't slow as effectively as a BL.  Our dogs are certainly not the equal of a BL's warder or a mages elemental.  Where is this mythical jack-of-all-trades utility?  Back in 1999, before most rangers had sow, maybe I'd buy the jack of all trade thing.  I certainly do not believe it today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or other SOE employees, like Brenlo saying, &quot;What's a shaman?&quot;<br />
<br />
Some people in this forum call this issue and any other issues shamans have, &quot;beating a dead horse&quot;, but I'd rather call it beating our drums until SOE hears it and stops being sarcastic with us.  <br />
<br />
I've said it once before... if they've had the slightest clue about us and tweaked us like the other classes throughout all the expansions (i.e. be more innovative), all these issues wouldn't have piled up so big to create such a huge uproar amongst this community.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">In all honesty, IIRC we used to have exactly the same heals as druids at exactly the same levels.  It seems the major disparity came when they gave druids and shamans a gimped CH.  The druids CH was useful and ours was not.   Somehow everyone accepted this and there got to be this huge gulf between the priest classes  - well, there already was one between clerics and everyone else.  <br />
<br />
I don't think the sky would fall if we got the same heals.  Druids and shamen are both priest classes - druids heal and nuke, we heal and debuff and dot.  <br />
<br />
Except I have every healing AA maxxed and an IH 4 item and I could not possibly come close to keeping a tank alive in GOD for any extended period of time. <br />
<br />
I can heal a LDON easy (I've seen a ranger main heal an LDON easy) and if that was all I ever wanted to do for the rest of my EQ career, our heals would be fine as they are.  Problem is - that's not all I want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I never bought the argument that we didn't deserve just as good a heal as the Druids. Period. <br />
<br />
The idea of slow making us better healers is SO flawed it's ridiculous. For one, slow already has a cost in both mana and time and resist rate. For another, slow benefits any healer associated with us (through group or raid) just as much as it benefits us. And considering that slow mitigation is pretty much a constant fixture of PoP Tier 3+ and GoD, the argument is even more ridiculous.<br />
<br />
So what level of heal do I think shaman needs? Start at the level druids and work from there. We don't need heals IDENTICAL to the druid's, but something comparable overall in HP/mana and HP over time.</div></div><hr />

Somehow everyone accepted this and there got to be this huge gulf between the priest classes  - well, there already was one between clerics and everyone else.  <br />
<br />
I don't think the sky would fall if we got the same heals.  Druids and shamen are both priest classes - druids heal and nuke, we heal and debuff and dot.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Very well said.<br />
<br />
And as far as those who try to say there is no problem with shaman.... I tried to explain to my best friend how much the game changes at different levels and stages.  I am NOT playing the same game as a 61 shaman or even a 63 shaman.  I'm a 65 shaman in a Time  and GoD raiding guild, and as far as those things go, I am pretty damned useless.  To reiterate an earlier post, I just want to be needed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">One of the things that I think a lot of people forget about Shaman is we were always the &quot;Over Time&quot; class...we got Regen spells before druids, and we got Torpor long before clerics got a Heal Over Time.  Our Dot's are designed to wear down mobs over time, which is why (at one time) they were so powerful.<br />
<br />
Now, I don't have a problem with Druids being better healers than us for fast heals, or Incomplete Heals.  But I think the ratios are out of whack.  2K Incomplete Heal vs 5K Incomplete Heal?  Hello? A 2.5 to 1 ratio?<br />
<br />
And now clerics have better Heals over Time than us.  That's always bothered me, but since nobody else brought it up on these boards, I just went about my business quietly, grumbling under my breath about how underpowered chloroblast was when we first got it, and why are clerics getting C. Elixer, and so on and so forth.<br />
<br />
Do you know what we really, really, need?  A Complete Heal over Time.  That would make me enormously happy.  A Group Complete Heal over Time.  Would this be overpowering in any way?  Think about it...clerics are charged 500 mana for a 10 second casting CH.  I would LOVE a 10 sec cast, 500 mana, Quiesence.  300/tick for 3 minutes = 9000 HPs.  Over time.  It won't heal a tank who's being spanked for 1200+ a round, but it will do the one thing we've obviously been designed to do from Day One of EQ:  help mitigate the damage the Tank receives, through Slow, Cripple, Regen, etc.<br />
<br />
Now, would this REALLY be overpowering?  Think about it.  The same thing for a Group Complete Heal over Time...charge whatever clerics get charged for it...1500mana?  2000?  I don't have a problem with that.   <br />
<br />
And for all you detractors out there, would you still want to do GoD trials or EPlanes with just a shaman healing, even if he had these spells?  I wouldn't.  300/tick will NEVER replace 5K or 10K &quot;right now&quot;.  <br />
<br />
And wouldn't it be nice to see us have just ONE ability that affected everyone in the group, that no other class currently has in game?  I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm sick of spamming my crappy little 1300hp heal on tanks that have 10K+ hps.  <br />

Increase our HoT to make it closer to the clerics. Its our main heal, our &quot;CHeal&quot; if you will, we heal by letting out HoT mitigate the mobs damage and shooting a quick heal once in a while.<br />
<br />
Also give us a better quick heal.<br />
<br />
All i personaly ask is that you take the same healing ability and style that we have done for a long time now in PoP and simply upgrade it appropriatly.  I dont want and im sure no one else hhere wants a CHeal of any kind. As always it was said and its still true, we desire to be the kings of HoT's and druid of the Cheals with clerics toping us all. But our quick heals should be much much closer. Its just a slap int he face they got a quick heal upgrade and we didnt. Sorry if its drama, but i really feel neglected as a shaman right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Even if we had a 2100 pt. fast heal, same as druids, we would not be sought after as main healers because we do not have a 5kish (in)Complete Heal.  I see no reason druids should necessarily be better healers.  They buff as well as we do or better (stat buffs are worthless by the time you'd get that fast heal), have snare, can solo to high heaven, and can act as main heal.  Slow doesn't overwrite our inability to heal IMO, since no matter what, a group is going to have a main healer and a main slower, and seldom do the two coincide.  I think asking for a 2100 pt fast that allows us to keep the cleric or chanter (or patch heal whoever) is not too much to ask.  Now, if the devs choose to upgrade the class in other areas, then perhaps the heal would be unbalancing.  As we stand right NOW however, a 2100 pt. fast heal is NOT overbalancing, especially given the increase in how hard/fast mobs hit, and the decrease in usefulness of many of our buffs.</div></div><hr />

I agree and am beyond feeling neglected, I am insulted by GoD.  The one aspect of the expansion I was looking forward to was Chatic Pain, which isn't even an upgrade so to speak, but more of a convenience, was placed so far out of my reach that I will not buy the expansion.<br />

The least it could have been was one of the disgustingly overpriced GoD AA's or something.  I am so disheartened by GoD that I don't even bother worrying about the other problems Shaman have in GoD and LDoN hard.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">What do I want?  I want OPTIONS.  Not just for shaman, but in general.  There are 4 main types of healing: big heals, fast heals, heals over time and group heals.  I have no problem with clerics being the best at all 4.  I do have a problem that the other healing classes aren't close in one category.<br />
Druid ch should be reasonably close to cleric ch.  Paladin emergency heals should be reasonably close to cleric.  Shaman heals over time should be reasonably close to cleric.  None of these can replace a cleric in all situations, but in a specific situation, there should be an option.<br />
Look at the rest of the abilities in the game.  There is at least one option that is a very close second best.  There is no such thing in healing.  Look at slower, options abound, with strengths and weaknesses for each class.  Tanks? yup, a lot to choose from, take your choice.  Snare? yep.  Mez? yep. etc.  Each of these abilities you can find someone almost as good as the best, but with differing extra abilities.  There is no close second to cleric.<br />
I feel a shaman should be a close substitute for cleric in our healing specialty (over time).  Druids should be a close substitute in big heals, paladins should be a close second for emergency heals.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">The 'complete heals' are not affected by healing focus or AAs, for one thing.<br />
<br />
Our quick heal is 1300 - 3.75 second cast (is affected by focus and AA).<br />
<br />
Our complete heal is 1950 - 10 second cast (not affected by focus or AA). <br />
Druids quick heal is 1925 - 3.5 second cast (is affected by focus and AA).<br />
<br />
Druids complete heal is 4680 - 10 second cast (not affected by focus or AA).<br />
<br />
Paladins best quick heal is 935 - 1 second cast.<br />
<br />
Paladins have two group heals of 900 and 990 - 3 second cast on both.<br />
<br />
Remember: Cleric, druid, and shaman are priests. Clerics have always been the best. Druids and shaman were equal to each other originally.<br />
<br />
Remember: Paladin, ranger, and beastlords are their hybrids respectively. Hybrids fight better than their parent class, but have never come close to being as good of healers as any of the real priests. That's the tradeoff for being a better fighter - they have a fraction of the parent's magical ability.<br />
<br />
In the case of rangers and beastlords, that's still true. <br />
<br />
There's no reason anymore for us to have lesser healing than druids. Slow mitigation is here to stay, as is the power of the mobs we've been facing since Planes of Power. There's every reason for us to receive improved healing, since we are quickly becoming outclassed by a hybrid healer.<br />
<br />
It just baffles me almost beyond words that there are shamans (not shamen) who dont know we are healers - yes, we are priests. We have always been priests. We are not hybrids. Beastlords are our hybrid.</div></div><hr />

What i think we need are as follows...<br />
1) Group FA, MGB'able. That would put us extreemly high on the want list for Raiding guilds, as well as make it usefull for multiple shaman on raids. Kinda like form bard/cleric groups, in our case it would be form Shaman/DPS group... really makes sence for our class if you think about it, we are the &quot;supposed&quot; to be the melee augmentor.<br />
2) Upgraded Torpor, Not Q, But torpor. To heal around 5-7k max duration.<br />
-OR-<br />
3) New Ch style spell, leave Tnargs alone, give us some real heal power.<br />
-OR-<br />
4) Q upgrade to a single target Paragon type spell/aa. Hell, even if it was not self castable.<br />
<br />
Just some ideas thrown out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Really, they need to just change plague of daluda to a 1750 heal for 525 mana. that would be worse than Nature's Infusion, yet a world better than tnarg's, and an appropriate (and fairly scaled) upgrade. Druids would still have a 350hp heal margain, for only 25 more mana, which is fair enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">I think shamans are as addicted to whining as any other class, and pretty much every class likes to whine, but really, when I see some of our virtues listed, I have to shake my head in bewilderment.<br />
<br />
Levitate?  Enduring breath?  Shrink???<br />
<br />
Multiple classes can cast the first two, but more to the point...<br />
<br />
Go buy a potion, they're cheap.  If you're anywhere near 65 at all and can't afford a 10pp potion, you're just not trying.  Sorry.  The game is full of places where you can make 500pp an hour just off the equivalent of fine steel from green mobs.  There are so many ways to make trivial amounts of money it's amazing.  And, at high levels, you don't have to only stick to those things; you can get together with friends and camp up stuff that gets you all big money.  I used to do that all the time with lots of different people.  Cazic Thule, Plane of Earth, Tactics, BOT, Sebilis, Droga, many places can get you a quick cash influx.<br />
<br />
You sure as heck don't need to group a shaman for that stuff!  Please don't define our class by citing virtues that can be duplicated with a simple quest or bought over the counter all over the place for 10pp a shot.<br />
<br />
Or less!  Good/neutral races can quest a free EB neck in The Grey/Katta.   Gnome made shrinking devices use a mana battery six that you can buy above the smithing building in POK for 106pp for 20 charges.  That's about 5pp a cast!  You can even use the machine to target and shrink OTHERS in your party, or pass it around to let them borrow it.  Recharge it by combining the machine and the battery inside any toolbox--also sold in POK and other places.  Or you carry around a collapsible one, like my SK does.  <br />
<br />
Also, endless mention of our stat buffs seems pointless.  The only buff I get asked for regularly by top end people is focus.  They don't need stamina buffs because they already have it maxed out.  They don't really need the strength component of focus either, because that's so easy to max out.  My SK had his strength maxed out at like level 16 or something.  The effect of AGI is pretty minimal; certainly it's almost never worth cluttering up a buff slot with.  So basically, people want stamina until they get reasonably nicely suited up in the game, after which they just click it off if you put it on them.  Strength, same thing.  The buff they want is focus, and that's for the hitpoints almost entirely, though the DEX doesn't hurt.  In short, the effect of stat buffs is just too minimal unless you're low level to make much difference.  The only people who are inviting shamans to groups because they are excited about stat buffs are the ones who haven't really considered how little those buffs matter.  Not many people are that dumb, and it's not like I'm hoping to meet more.<br />
<br />
Slowing?  Frankly I'm pretty happy with either a chanter or a beastlord in many places when it comes to slowing.  With mitigation, 5% over the chanters seems like nothing; with a beastlord, their slow lands so quickly I feel like I'm constantly losing the quickdraw contest.  Once a mob gets slowed by a beastlord, my slow is nice, but not critical.  It's merely incremental.  I guess I'm saying that I'm quite often pretty content playing my monk or SK without a shaman in the group.  Shamans add a lot, but I figure when they replace a beastlord, you get less DPS, and when they replace a chanter, you get no KEI, inferior haste, vastly inferior crowd control, and if the chanter gets a pet --  wow they beat us on the DPS too.  Shaman slow is nice all right -- but you give up a LOT to get it.  I know many people who have no interest in making that sacrifice, and in their groups they want chanters or beastlords.  I can't blame them a bit.  I do great in groups and people like me fine there, but especially with mitigation, the days of shamans sitting back on their heels glorying about the power of their slows, and hoping the extra 5% over a chanter really matters, is now ancient history.  Many times I've had people say, is this thing even slowed?  Do some of the mobs here only partially slow?  And I have to tell them, yes, it IS slowed, and something like, most or even ALL of the mobs here only partially slow.  Sorry, but this is as good as it's going to get!  Obviously, these people are not at all being impressed with shaman slows at that point.  If they see that often enough, I don't know how it's not going to sink in ... and maybe reconsider what the point is of having a shaman along when you can't even tell whether his slow has landed or not.  A little disheartening, and it educates people against including shamans.<br />
<br />
I think we need a better heal, but I do think it matters also when considering how much or little of an improved heal we get that we have many responsibilities besides healing.  Being able to do many things only counts if you actually CAN do them in gameplay.  When a mob comes in and I have to slow and/or malos and THEN slow, I've eaten up a ton of time.  A druid or cleric can be healing right at the start of a fight, or even be casting a heal before the mob gets to us so it lands early in the fight, before the mob is slowed.  No chance I'll be doing that; I'm no competition on that point.  I need to slow or malos/slow, then wait for my spells to un-grey themselves.  Only then does healing even become an option for me.<br />
<br />
So if we get a better heal, it won't make as much of an impact on us as some other classes might fear -- not at all.  On the other hand, it won't solve our problems as much, either, for the very same reason.  We have other things to do.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, those things might not make us all that valuable.  But regardless, they must be done.  <br />
<br />
The same thing holds true for DPS.  Mobs die so quick, and I'm so busy doing other things before I can even think about DPS, that my DPS contribution, gimp as it already is, turns out to be far less than it looks like it might really be on paper.  What good is having 20 dots if I often don't have time to cast more than one, or even one, unless I simply want to waste my mana pointlessly?<br />
<br />
I do feel we need a better heal, or to be able to do better DPS, or both.  We could get fairly substantial upgrades in either or both without being seriously considered as primary or even secondary healer or DPS in a group.  We would still be behind even with quite notable improvements.  Being dead last in DPS and dead last in heals, and having our primary class feature being a slow that other classes can substantially match on a huge portion of mobs these days for general group and sometimes even raid efficacy, especially since slow mitigation seems to have become endemic to game encounters, is not so great.  Having unassailably real deficits innate in the class at this point in the game, and not having them being made up for by our primary virtue to any noteable extent, means we need to be able to offer a little more. <br />
<br />
On quick-dying mobs like we have these days, I'd say some better DPS, and not in the form of DOTs.  We don't need any more DOTs to stack on mobs that die before the first one has run out.  We don't need to fill our already vital spell slots with things that do not stack, like DOTs.  Malos, slow, heal, HOT, cannibalize -- that's five slots out of eight taken up already.  Most people would fill up at least one more with a root, whether they have Virulent Paralysis or not.  That leaves us two slots with which to do something worthwhile -- if we want to leave out gate, too.  If not, one slot.  Heaven forbid you need malosinia as well as malos -- then you're left with either one or zero slots.<br />
<br />
We don't need to fill those one or two or zero slots with something that doesn't stack, or might not run its full duration, becoming a waste of mana.  Our DD's right now...are very slow casting and very insignificant, even with the AA invested in direct damage spells.<br />
<br />
I'd like to fill that last slot or two with something better than our present small, very slow incomplete heal.  A better heal, or a chance to make a DPS contribution that doesn't make me so very solidly last place in the DPS sweepstakes.  Doesn't have to be huge...I'll be mostly slowing, debuffing, and healing anyway.  I won't use it constantly.  But when I do, it would be nice if it made any kind of a difference.<br />
<br />
Being able to cast &quot;focus&quot; and the 5% difference in slows on mostly mitigating mobs is just not enough to make up a class.  Considering how demanding this class is to play, there should be a little more sense of reward.  <br />
<br />
I hate wondering when or if people are going to &quot;find out&quot; that they could do many of the things they invite me to do just as well with a beastlord or enchanter or even bard -- and maybe even do quite a bit better with them instead of me.  You shouldn't have to hope that people don't &quot;discover&quot; that your class has become more or less redundant.  I want to be welcomed, not &quot;found out.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Sorry, Murtak, you lost me. I'm not getting back on the Torpor bus. I'm not going backwards when everyone else is getting huge improvements.<br />
I have to agree with Glor. Torpor had negitive side effects cause it was a over powering heal at the time without it. We arent restricting ourselves cause we are too powerful, we are trying to play catch up.<br />
<br />
Please note that &quot;my&quot; version of torpor heals 900 per tick - could even make it 1500 per tick for yet more mana. I do not mind the side effects if I get something I can drop on an overaggroing caster that will keep him alive for a bit, or something I can drop on a tank after the fight to fill him up.<br />
<br />
If you are not willing to hav negative side effects for more powerful spells that is a valid opinion but please do not think that jumping from a 300 per tick heal to a 900 per tick heal is &quot;going backwards&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is going backwards in my opinion. I dont care how much it heals i dont want negitive effects on my melee causing their DPS to be cut in half and not able to move. Its good to think outside the box and props to you for trying, but i still feel its a backwards movement at this level of the &quot;end game&quot; to have a snare and slow incorperated to our biggest and best heal.<br />
<br />
Dont forget Murtak, with these negitive effects, comes group only limitations. Not to mention that i personaly dont believe SoE will ever give us a 900 tick heal or a 1500 a tick heal. Im pretty confident that out HoT's will never surpase the clerics. Infact im pretty much coming to terms with the fact that shaman are very possibly a necro/cleric hybrid and as a hybrid we will never have anything unique of our own.<br />
<br />
<br />
But that last sentence is probably more momentary frustration...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I think askign for better HoTs will hurt us more then help. because sony has no clue and will might make a better one but it will suck since it wont fit the minimum requirement to be realy usefull for HEALING (ie if its below 1000 all 6 sec you cannot use it in combat in the higher game)and before you say busll**** let me say one thing if you have to spam tnargs to even have a slight chance to compensate trash mobs(hi i am not even talking about bosses or minibosses they slow imune anyways) dps after slow in later game thats with the right aas more like 2k all 6sec(do the math), then no sub 1k hot going to even have a chance to stand up against the damage your group takes. and dont come with down time heals. good groups have a combat time 90% of total time (ie your puller  working on next pull BEFORE first mob is dead).HoTs suck for the same reason DoTs suck the change in EQ from longer fights to fast fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">But HoT is how we heal. we asked for it, we got it. Its how we are. What we need is whats been said, a HoT to keep up with a good part of the mobs damage with a quick heal that is efficent enough to toss on to help keep up. These needs to be done with in our mana regen range of the average shaman.<br />
<br />
No one said the numbers are easy, but im confident this can be acomplished .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Change Breath of Trushar to group quiescence.<br />
<br />
Remove the disease dot they gave us in GoD.<br />
<br />
Give us a 1750 base heal with 3 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
Then I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

True, I did not think of that. And I doubt they would make the effort to have it castable on anyone in your raid. Hmm. Nope, that pretty much kills Torpor II.<br />
 :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">For what would you use a 900er torpor?<br />
<br />
On melees? Only for downtime healing.<br />
<br />
On a puller as &quot;pre-heal&quot;? Hell no.<br />
<br />
On caster that overagro? When he overagros he is dead meat. 900er torpor or 2000er torpor doesn't matter. The mobs will rape the robe in one or two rounds.<br />
<br />
To heal AE damage? Yes but only on casters. Havn't seen a AE I could cover with Q / TM. May be GoD will have some surprises for me.<br />
<br />
Intressting idea but only sounds usefull for 5% or less of my fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>jkoij</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">personally i hate the roll of healing. Im very happy to not be good at it. My heals do just fine duo'ing or keeping one group alive xping, thats good enough for me, No cheal chain here&gt;&lt;!</div></div><hr />

Actually &quot;my&quot; version would not snare, just melee slow and spell slow. So Yes, I would use it on the puller, I would use it during downtime and I would use it to cover AEs. Might even use it on the tank, depending on how secure his aggro is.<br />
Now, just how useful such a heal would be is hard to tell as the downsides are hard to evaluate. Does not matter though. As Litgruv pointed out, that spell would be group only and it needs to be raid only at least to make it useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">Frankly, <br />
Though I hate to say it, most of  you have it wrong...just like SoE...they messed up way back when they adressed the original weakness of druid and shaman healing...<br />
<br />
Originally, when Kunark came out, Shaman and Druids healed the same...only real difference was Shaman got Torpor at 60.<br />
<br />
SoE finally admitted that as priest classes, we were gimped, and decided to give both classes a percentage heal spell.  This was the original mistake and is what has led to our current conundrum.  The gave Shaman Kraggs...the most useless, overpriced mana-burning  heal spell ever created, and gave Druid's Tunares...Not sure when Natures touch showed up, but dont remember it from the original spell set.<br />
<br />
Anyways...the difference at that time was fairly huge, and they justified it because of slow and mana-regen.<br />
<br />
This solidly put druids in the CH chain...and left Shaman out of it.<br />
<br />
The mistake they made is quite obvious.  They didnt want either class to compete with Cleric healing, but recognized a weakness.  If they had half a brain, they would of split the priest classes at this point in time and given druids the in-complete but decent mana heal ratio spells, but NO better instant heal spells, or at least marginally better...<br />
<br />
The shaman should of gotten the more mana-inefficient instant heal spells.  This would of let the combination of druid and shaman effectively replace cleric healing...or, either act as effective backup healers...but neither would be as strong or as versatile as a cleric.<br />
<br />
Why would I say druids for the slower casting, CH type spells...and Shaman for the faster casting instant heals...simple...long casting spells are a problem for shaman...they interfere with our mana-regen because its active mana regen, not passive...and shaman could make up for the inefficiency with their HoT spells, which are highly efficient.<br />
<br />
I too am annoyed though that clerics now dominate shaman in the HoT spells (makes em better at healing of all types and this just isnt right)..that never should of happened, ah well SoE has no vision and if they tried to fix it now, druids and clerics would just complain incessantly..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Tudani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">Nature's Touch was put into game I believe during velious.  It wasn't really a big deal at the time, so they were giving druids a bigger heal, we had slows that rocked still and we had torpor.  And it wasn't a huge upgrade, just slightly better than casting chloroblast 2 times, and just slightly faster.  During luclin, with the priest balancing, they put in the percent CH spells.  I guess by that time we'd all gotten used to druids being slightly better healers, and considering that back then people still ran into the 75% cap sometimes instead of always healing for the full amount, and druids were having trouble getting groups back then.<br />
<br />
Now, a couple of years later, druids are solidly in the realm of good healers, replacing clerics (though not as well) in many many encounters.<br />
<br />
It seems to me these days, that when a druid can act as main healer, I can be a perfectly viable backup healer.  When a cleric is needed as main healer, I struggle, a lot.  I haven't done any of the ikkiz trials yet, but I've done the first named in both the first and second ikkiz trials...both fights I ended with 15m or less, both fights I thanked the Tribunal for crits that I got, because I didn't think we'd have won without those.  I think the cleric (who has much much worse gear than I do) ended both of those fights with significantly more mana than I did.<br />
<br />
As for healing, I'd like either a heal over time that does a significant enough portion of healing to make up for our lack of instant heals  (and there's no reason to say it would make our mana regen better, Q already heals more than canni 5 does dmg, a higher mana higher healing heal over time would probably make us less efficient when using Q, cuz I for one don't have room to mem two heal over times)  Or a better instant heal so I don't have to watch myself chain healing a tank and see either no movement of the health bar or their health dropping.</div></div><hr />

<br />
      That nearly impossible now ,they hit way to much for a healing over time. If you look when torpor was created ,mob were hiting 10 time less(and double max,no proc too)...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">What if they gave us a new type of CH? We're shaman...let's be different. How about a blast CH?<br />
<br />
Here are some possible thoughts and you can fiddle with the numbers to balance...<br />
<br />
Name: ??? (I'm not creative)<br />
Mana: 500<br />
Casting Time: 3.5 seconds<br />
Description: Heals up to the target to 65% (note it works different then current 75% CHs...see examples) of it's max HPs up to a total of 5000 HPs.<br />
<br />
Example1:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He is at 50% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 6500 for a 1500HP heal. &lt;--- notice cap at 65%<br />
<br />
Example2:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He's at 25% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 6500 for a 4000HP heal. &lt;--- notice cap at 65%<br />
<br />
Example3:<br />
Warrior has 10k HP. He's at 5% when heal lands. Total HP after heal would be 5500 for a 5000HP heal. &lt;--- doesn't hit the cap in this case<br />
<br />
Effectively this type of heal is the oh **** heal that heals for more the more dire the circumstance is. This is exactly the type of heal that I want. The tank is never at full HP with this heal so Q or the new super-Q spell is always at work. This is the perfect type of backup healing spell.<br />
<br />
Change the numbers around for balance. Make it 60% or 70% or make it a 3 second cast time or 4 seconds or make max heal 6k or make it 400 mana...whatever. But it's this type of spell that improves the more dire the circumstance that will set Shaman apart, but is not overpowering in other circumstances!!<br />
<br />
Come on designers....be creative!!! Make a new type of healing and give it to shaman.</div></div><hr />
