<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi guys - <br />
<br />
Question here - what should I be focusing on stat wise.  Hps?, AC, or total mana?<br />
<br />
My way of thinking leads me to conclude that AC is most important, followed by hps - as long as mana pool is sufficient. Reasoning is - I use AC EVERY time i get hit - but hps only when I get that low on hps.  (ie living with 1hp same as living with 250). What thoughts do you guys have?<br />
<br />
I am unguilded and mostly solo and duo with a monk of the same level - so that places limitations on gear i can aquire.  Thanks for your thoughts.  Here is my magelo btw:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">HP. You also use those every time you're hit, as well as every time you Canni. AC (to me) just came with the HP as I upgraded gear. I think priests are still soft-capped at what? 1100? Which is not hard to obtain.<br />
<br />
When you get Cann5, you're gonna need every last HP you can find, so start working on it now so you're not screwed when you get it ;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HP and Sta &gt; AC &gt; Wis<br />
<br />
In the mid 50s you are likely doing pop.  I have yet to notice a difference from 800 to 900 ac.  I am told if you cross the 1000 ac threshold there is a big difference.  HP effects not only how long you live while being beaten upon but also your mana regen.  So if you need X amount of hp to survive a mob all additional hp can be used to create mana or decrease downtime.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gawkmar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I think you will find that most of the Shaman community covet HP/AC over WIS. I am also of that opinion. To me HP are the most important because the more I have the more I can convert into mana. Ac is a close second simply because it allows me to absorb more damage and still survive. For a class that can instantly turn HP into mana, WIS is not really all that important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You ac is still a bit low so I would work on getting that up a bit before giving a great amount of attention to HP.  In the long run you will have to get your HP up also so I would take that into account when looking for upgrades.  Can V is still a long way off and my first goal would be to work on the ac number.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Well one reason the Magelo shows you having a &quot;low&quot; AC is your 72 AGI. (Partially due to the neg 10 hit from the Fungus).<br />
<br />
Buff your AGI  and you shoot above 75 which will give a disproportionally huge hit.<br />
<br />
1325 health is a &quot;smidge&quot; low for 52. Your stuff is mirrored to mine in many slots. I use the SBS instead of the Chitin Shield, and I have my Epic. (I really need to post a Magelo).<br />
<br />
Level more than anything else is going to get your butt handed to you in PoP. <br />
<br />
But yeah, with a 179 WIS, start looking for AC and HP. <br />
<br />
And remember - we're Shaman, HP=Mana. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't focus on any of the typical Shaman stats.  I prefer a much more balanced approach, and I find that by doing so I have more options on gear and that my stats in general are better.  But that's just my opinion.  I could use more HP though. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vaaxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was doing my shammy/warrior in kael arena one day, pulled a veteren, slowed it and proceeded to cann 5, and then torpor, after which, I sat the shaman down.<br />
<br />
Right after my shaman sat, I took a rampage from the vet....203, 203, 85.  My shaman lived for one reason, and one reason only...the fact that i had more than 500hp left over after I cann 5'd.  AC doesn't help in that situation, and wisdom doesn't help in that situation.<br />
<br />
AC is damned useful, but HP is useful in many many more ways...AE's, nukes, cannabalize, hits you can't avoid, etc.  HP is the way to go.  Follow it up with AC, and I think you're going to have a hard time running out of mana, which makes wisdom kinda pointless.</div></div><hr />
