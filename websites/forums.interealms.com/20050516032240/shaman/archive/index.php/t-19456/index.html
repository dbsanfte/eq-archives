<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">GWJ: What is the tribute system, and what kind of rewards can one gain from its use? Is it level limited?<br />
<br />
AC: Characters can now gain favor in their home towns by turning in items to their tribute masters. Favor can be used to grant buff like abilities to the character, which drain favor from a pool upon use. A new interface will allow characters to see their accrued favor as well as any favor buffs they can activate. Any character of any level can gain favor and use these abilities. Of course the better the item given to the Tribute Master, the better the boon of favor he returns.<br />
<br />
<br />
From an interview with Brenlo here (http://www.gamerswithjobs.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=822&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0) .<br />
<br />
So...if I'm interpreting correctly:<br />
<br />
Dump all the old junk I can't sell to the tribute master.  I accumluate favor points (ala LDON) that I then use to 'buy' a buff at any time.<br />
<br />
Not sure what how they determine what buffs are available to you - will it be based on level?  class?  amount of items you /donate?  probably all of the above.<br />
<br />
Wonder if you can /donate in other cities to get access to different buffs? Or perhaps it's diety based.  I *hope* that the buffs in Oggok are different than the ones in Halas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  You can also donate pp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not impressed by the vague details he gives.<br />
<br />
My prediction is it will be either way overpowered or completely useless and no where in between (call me a realist!).  I also predict some races will be more equal than others in terms of their tribute system :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I fought in CB back when I was a wee little tike, and didn't realize I was ruining faction in some distant land that would eventually become my homeland, because the *vision* of sony doesn't include my ugly troll butt.</div></div><hr />

You might be able to petition and fix that considering the circumstances....GMs do have the power to reset your faction, but it basically sets you at Noob with all factions......sometimes thats a good thing, sometimes not (IE velious factions).<br />
As to is this worth that much trouble? Who's to say till it comes out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the tip Helfdane, but i'd be damned if i'm going to redo all my faction with the damn iksars so I can complete the cudgle quest =).  And I am max ally to the dragons, and I'm not really sure I want to be doing Vindi raids all over again just so I can blow pp/gear to get some buffs.  These buffs are going to have to be STELLAR for me to even think about it.  Heck... even if they were, I think I'd just invis my way past the ole warriors guild, and gate out after speaking with the shaman guy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Trolls are still welcome in Oggok, as far as I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">re:faction reset.<br />
<br />
Its only for the neriak factions, and I believe it starts in or around Neriak.  Trivial little quest that I know nothing about (since I still have my hometown :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Trolls are still welcome in Oggok, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Well, I don't think they'll let me use the tribute system in Oggok.<br />
<br />
Characters can now gain favor in their home towns by turning in items to their tribute masters.  <br />
<br />
But then again, it is still somewhat vague.  I gain favor with my hometown, but does that mean I have no tribute masters anywhere esle?  For the moment I am assuming it does, but you never know.  They're being pretty nebulous on the whole topic so far.<br />
<br />
EDIT: but then maybe I'm just making a huge stink out of nothing...  With GoD comming out, they could overrun neriak with willowisps and move me to freeport  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Dont worry the tribute system will be working as intended, becuase they have shut down all access to any zones other than the GoD zones... <br />
Sure the home towns are up for lvl 1 newbes to betabuff but no one can get there other wise...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't think you should have any faction issues with the Smurf warrior guild.  They may have two tribute people in Neriak, one in Foreign Quarter for the trolls and another in Commons/3rd Gate for the smurfs.<br />
<br />
I'm KOS to the warriors and never have any problems navigating Commons or 3rd Gate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wish I hadn't destroyed all that ornate, ssra, and VT armor.<br />
<br />
<br />
you can only donate certian items ... no drop items are excluded ive played with it a bit .....<br />
<br />
the system allows you to &quot;buy&quot; focus time or stats etc etc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Cool now other classes can get buffs in their hometowns and we will be even less useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">After our GoD AAs, I don't even want to know what useless crap this system will delve out :P<br />

<br />
I seem to recall seeing a troll in Nektulos just outside Neriak that, when I hailed him, gave me the impression that he would reset faction for trolls. Sorry but I don't have any particulars beyond that.</div></div><hr />
