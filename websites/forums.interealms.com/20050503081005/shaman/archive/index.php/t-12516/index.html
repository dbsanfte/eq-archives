An &quot;alpha pet&quot;, unless I didn't understand it myself, is a buffed/hasted pet to which you give mage summoned weapons, or stun-processing weapons to have him dual wield and process.<br />
<br />
Apparently, with focus, regen and pet-buff spell, the with 2 mages summoned weapons, an mage-summoned hp belt, a mage summoned haste item (muzzle), your pet can greatly improve his DPS.<br />
<br />
Note that it's not first hand info, since I'm too bad a player to control my pet and my character at the same time.<br />

Nothing to see here, move along.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">giving your pet any two 1h weapons will cause him to duel wield and greatly increase his DPS, stunning or mage summoned ones are just extra fluff, rusty or fine steel work just fine for me</div></div><hr />
