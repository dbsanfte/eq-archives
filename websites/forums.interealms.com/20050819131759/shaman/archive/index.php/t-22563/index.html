<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Silverfawx Bertie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, can anyone tell me if they run 3 accounts off the same computer, and if, so how much RAM do you have? <br />
<br />
Anyone tried a trio with 512Mb RAM?<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have a AMD 64 3400+, with a gig of Ram, and a ATI Radeon 9800 Pro.  2 Windows work ok 3 becomes slightly unstable.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I routinely 4box on a P4 2500 Mhz with 1GB of RAM.  Each active EQ instance takes around 400 MB of RAM if you have the Luclin Models turned on, 300ish if you turn them off.  You can probably get away with 3 instances as long as you turn off all the Luclin models (except the min each char may need to ride his/her horse) and social animations.<br />
<br />
You'll have to look down on the 2nd and 3rd toons in places with wide open spaces (PoTran) or places with lots of people (PoK, Bazaar) but other than that you should be OK.  I experience occasional pauses on one of the chars.  Zoning takes about 50% longer for each char.<br />
<br />
The good news is that if, like me, you're multi-boxing LDoN's you shouldn't have any real problems.  Tight indoor zones with no one else other than who you bring with you makes it a breeze.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />

I usually run them in tiled mode but can switch to full screen on the fly. You'll have to buy the pro versions but it's money well spent.<br />

I've run 4 instances with minimal problems.  I could probably stretch it to 5 before anything bad would happen, but Ive never had to do that before.  Usually its just two, occasionally 3.</div></div><hr />

I 3-box easily on 1 computer, I have a p4 3Gig processor with 1GB RAM and a geforce FX 5600 vid card. I don't have eqplaynice, so I still get a little lag, but other than that, I can operate them all just fine with all models on and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jormal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Cray made supercomputers back in the day. All the national computing labs had them and they were made here in Wisconsin. When I was in high school we worked on a 3d animation project that we would create the wireframes on our workstations and kermit(ftp) them to Lawrence Livermore's Cray for rendering. So basically it was almost as powerful as computers 5 years ago.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>AtommWarbird</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Grimreaper made a very good point about turning the sound off.  From what I've been able to tell, having sound GREATLY increases the resources needed by EQ.  Since I can't live without sound at all I only turn it off my 2nd, 3rd, and fourth instances.  (I do VERY occasinally 5box but to be honest it's a bit more taxing on my nerves than I can usaully stand.)  If I have the sound on even a 2nd instance I get a lot of lag, sputtering and freezing.<br />
<br />
To REALLY turn the sound off (i.e. EQ doesn't even think about when it should be playing them) put a file called nosound.txt in the root of our EQ instance.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use to 2box on one pc's with a 1.5gig 512 ram. I turned off the sound on one of the pc's(or you get more lag and an echo effect). I used eqwindows I'm not sure if it's still workin yet or not but it helped alot. Like everyone else said I turned off most models I liked to keep my model on though(barb and human). If you got a extra hard drive use that for the swap file for your computer, it helped the perfomance noticably.I think I could have added one more easily</div></div><hr />
