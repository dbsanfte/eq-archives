<br />
Epics are Kunark weapons, they just aren't all that good anymore. Warders Ornate Broadsword drops in PoP in a tier3 zone, the Broadsword is *supposed* to beat the Epics by a grand margin, and they do, no doubt about it.</div></div><hr />

Seems that lots of people who have moved on to archery aaxp style still wield SW for the haste/attack (myself included).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on your definition of easy... I'm in a guild, just killing Vindi, IV, Zland/Kland and whatnot... If there's a better soloing weapon out there for me, I don't know what it is. <br />
<br />
It may take me some time to kill a VL spider... but that slow is huge to me. 14/24 doesn't suck.  Perhaps compared to 16/19 of the AHB, or the 2 weapons off Cursed...<br />
<br />
Just a quick search on EQMaps shows 21 weapons (1hs) with damage 14+ and delay 24-. <br />
8 are 14 dam, 10 are 15 dam, 2 16, and 1 17. <br />
1 drops in VP<br />
7 drop in Ssra off Emperor, Arch Lich, Cursed and Creator<br />
2 are FF/GM Event rewards<br />
1 Drops off Grieg<br />
1 off IV in Akheva<br />
1 in Plane of Storms<br />
1 in Kael (Blade of Carnage)<br />
1 in PoG Off Tunare<br />
1 in Acrylia<br />
1 in Plane of Torment(off Saryrn)<br />
1 off Vallon in Drunder<br />
<br />
Easier to get better weapons eh? Perhaps I am missing something here...</div></div><hr />

Drops off both Doomshade, who should be doable by a guild that does vindi, and more simply the Spirit of Radir which is doable by a good single group.<br />
<br />
Heck of alot easier to get than going up to Hate over and over waiting for that stinking Emerald to drop.  Plus alot easier to convince folks to go after since Doomshade drops other great items (41% haste earring, bow of doom, sweet rogue piercer) while in Hate you're generally looking for a mage staff, a ranger stone and armor drops to turn in for gems.<br />
<br />
You don't get the slow, but swarmcaller fills in adequately anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for better than Earthcaller, you need to also look at much faster weapons with lower damage. Tox Axe slightly outdamages Earthcaller at 10/17, which means Fleshgrinder (12/19 plus proc) and a host of others in the same general range do as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ArafysAragon</div><div class="date">12-04-2002, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Perhaps its not just the dam/delay, but the slow proc and the stats in one whole package. <br />
<br />
For many rangers with swiftwind, swapping out swarmcaller is difficult(at least I found it so) as I had no other haste item. I sold my SCHW when I got SW as I no longer really needed them. That made Swarmcaller a 29/41 weapon with a bad 2HS score and no haste. Yes, it still filled the purpose, but when I got EC, my game changed. <br />
<br />
The MESS is rather nice, and yes, it drops of easier mobs. Tox axe? I couldn't say, but 10/17 and so-so stats... I dunno. Granted it drops off a mosquito in CT that's easier than a multitude of hate raids, but as far as being better? Hard to say. Personally, I'll have a very hard time bagging EC, unless I get a vastly better weapon. <br />
<br />
Everytime I get a proc on my EC I get a little tingle. For this soloing ranger, the slow proc blows everything else away. As far as EC sucking... I just don't see it. In my opinion, you'd need a weapon that provides so much more damage as to offset not having the slow.</div></div><hr />

myself i kept my haste belt to wear when i use 2 hand weapons so i keep 1 of each type in a rallic bag with me for various encounters (damage shielded mobs or very high ac mobs 2 handers work better).<br />

What's better than Earthcaller that's easy to get?<br />
<br />
Depends on your definition of easy... I'm in a guild, just killing Vindi, IV, Zland/Kland and whatnot... If there's a better soloing weapon out there for me, I don't know what it is. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone defined the question in terms of soloing until you did, and then you only mention soloing after telling us that you're in a guild, in which case I'd imagine that you'd be more inclined to think in terms of the team and not the individual. The original question was regarding which weapons are more damaging, not more useful solo.<br />
<br />
Earthcaller still has a place in every ranger's arsenal because it does something few other weapons do. But it's a situational weapon. If I saw a ranger in my guild using earthcaller on a raid, I would assume it was there by mistake and tell them so. It's a slow swinging weapon, and it has a proc that is useless in nearly all raid scenarios. Even when it procs immediately in a fight, that's not necessarily a beneficial thing since your main job as a ranger is not to draw aggro. The flip side of that is that if I were in a group of 6 fighting hard-hitting stuff with no slower, and the other ranger in the group wasn't wielding Earthcaller until it proc'd, I would also assume that was a mistake.<br />
<br />
Tox axe is definitely more damaging than Earthcaller against raid mobs. In extreme cases, even the Rev Whip is more damaging than EC. Speed is that crucial in a mainhand weapon. I used the 10/18 version of the Velium warsword for a while, and that parsed better against raid mobs than EC as well.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit fuzzy on this but 10 is the lowest as from what I heard as the servers cannot parse anything lower(?)) <br />
<br />
I may be wrong on this... but I am just not sure.<br />
<br />
From what I read here, my Ornate sword of the General (10/18) is more damaging than EC?</div></div><hr />

10/17 &gt; 14/24 <br />
<br />
Yes, but how much &gt;?  Is it worth spending 10-15k to get? See my point is for those that have EC, those &quot;better weapons&quot; are either nodrop or hideously expensive. (Yes, I find 10k to be hideously expensive). Why spend the plat to get a marginal upgrade? <br />
<br />
If DPS goes from 75 to 78(pulling #'s out of my buttocks) with a 10k outlay that doesn't make sense to me. Yes, it may be better, but how much better? Especially since I have a 10/18 OSoTG. I could swap that out and use that... but then I wouldn't have twin lightning swords. <br />
<br />
I've never been a rich ranger, most I have had at one time is like 8k, and I spent that in a hurry. As far as waiting for a drop, As I mentioned before, my play times suck. (I'm working on that though). I know there's better weapons out there. Will I see them? I dunno, I hope to. I hope to one day have an AHB, and a Claw of Vyzh'dra, or a render of souls. But for now, I have my EC, and it does me fine. Especially with the rest of my gear sucking : )<br />
<br />
Besides, the Tox graphic sucks. Damn thing's about as big as I am. I'd hate to see it weilded by a hefflin. : )</div></div><hr />

<br />
every single dps increase is priceless, especially if you are in a raiding guild<br />
that is just my opinion tho :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gwindor</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 05:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, killing Doomshade is in no way shape or form similar to killing a miniboss in Hate. Hell it's not even similar to killing Inny (who as I understand it has been proper whooped by a group of 4). Radir isn't even as easy as a miniboss.<br />
Second, the Tox axe is anywhere from 5 less to 5 more dps than Earthcaller. In a game built on random numbers, that's the same damage folks. Parsed it myself at multiple levels between 56 and 60, had to move up to the fleshgrinder to see an actual damage increase over earthcaller (and at that point it was still a nominal increase for a 45k weapon).<br />
Finally, a single dps is &quot;priceless&quot;? Priceless means you cannot put a price on the value of 1 dps. I disagree. 1 dps represents a fluke in the number generators. Parse a trend of 5dps and we're talking, a &quot;single dps&quot; is worth a very small amount of platinum whether you're facing orc_pawn_01 or the avatar of war.<br />
<br />
However this discussion fell off (I fear my post may have hijacked it in retrospect) to a discussion about the merits of the epic quest. The merits are unquestionable. On the other hand, the poster wanted to know which would outdamage which (he was specific in this request) and as everyone has agreed the 2 hander wins for damage hands down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
however in a raid situation.. the 15dmg 20dly will always be in my main hand unless its something that isnt going to kill me in the time it takes to cast jolt.. which i have yet to find a mob i couldnt land it on.. and even when it says its resisted still works for some odd reason.. <br />
<br />
oh and for all the other 60+ rangers i see still wielding EC over any weapon they could have gotten in any other zone.. and i see a lot of uber guilds with 5+ rangers and all of them still using EC.. most of them have guants of dragon slaying so they usually have a primal in offhand.. or tolans longsword of the glade..<br />

<br />
well if you're talking high level, 61+ earthcaller is useless solo in all cases as you will not be tanking anything you solo at that level, you will either be fear kiting or rooting and using your bow and dots.<br />
<br />
also some of the higher end weapons are always better than earthcaller when solo tanking, sure you can slow a mob 50% with earthcaller, but if you are cutting your DPS by 1/2 then there is no net gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an FYI the formula for calculating your reduced weapon delay (from haste effects) is as follows;<br />
<br />
Delay/(1+Haste) = Hasted Delay <br />
<br />
For example, using earthcaller (14/24) with Swiftwind (40% haste), the calculation would look like this;<br />
<br />
24 / 1.40 = 17.14<br />
<br />
So the dmg/dly of Earthcaller with haste effects is 14/17<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Using a BFT bow with swiftwind (40 %), speed of vallon (66%), battlecry of the vah shir(25 %stackable), fleeting quiver(~20% stackable), and Guardian of the forest3 (15% stackable) a ranger could attain a haste of 160 %  (SW+SoV=100% +bard song 25, quiver 20 , guardian aa 15).<br />
So the formula for this one looks like this;<br />
38 / 2.6 = 14.62   effectively making BFT a 30/15 weapon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gavving</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except that the Bard song Battlecry of the Vah Shir wont stack with Guardian of the Forest.  They're in the same haste slot...<br />
<br />
I never really totally understood trying to calculate weapon delay while hasted.  I mean if you compare the printed dmg/delay how is that different than comparing the calculated hasted dmg/delay?  For comparison purposes the only reason that might be useful is if the haste number is different when you switch weapons.  Even then its of questionable value due to minimum damage bonus, 2h dmg bonus, etc.  <br />
<br />
Anyway, as for the question.  I'm pretty sure that with maxed skill a 1:1 ratio 2h will out damage epics all the time.  Assuming that you've got the same haste for both.  But even if you go down to a 36% haste item for the 2h the 1:1 will be better.  Going below that you might want to parse.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SolipsisSaVatar</div><div class="date">12-05-2002, 07:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I agree, there is not much purpose in calculating the delay on a weapon after haste effects. My intent was to give an idea of the insane amount (and impossible amount) of haste that would be required to drop a weapons delay to 1 or something crazy low. Also, I've heard people prattle on about how they think haste works and that given enough haste a weapon delay would go below 0 and thusly they made a delay minumum cap (pretty sure that is how the whole rumor got started). Anyways, the formula obviously disproves that.<br />
<br />
Doh, good to know about Guardian/Battlecry, thanks Gavving.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Earthercaller proc is pointless.  Way to random to be an effictive form of slow for a group.  You'll probably have a chanter/shaman/bard anyway, so you won't need to slow.<br />
<br />
If you are solo'ing, you will be dead long before Earthcaller procs, and there's no need to slow the mob anyway since you will be bow kiting.<br />
<br />
Solo'ing, you're better off using whatever weapons give you the best Stat increases.  When in a group, you don't need earthcaller proc, so go with whatever gives you the highest DPS, which is definately not EC.<br />

I use mine all the time on raids, and I can't think of a single occasion in which it drew agro on me.  Certainly not fatally so.  If you are jolting properly you won't have a problem.<br />

As for superior weapons, they're easy to come by if your guild clears nTOV as a warmup exercise.</div></div><hr />

In the eyes of the soloing ranger.. earthcaller is the best weapon you could have.. no argument.. if you bring one up your wrong.. atm i wield a 15dmg 20dly with ok stats and i would bag it any day for an earthcaller.. i solo a lot.. and im sick of switching out my weapons for my swarmcaller..<br />

also some of the higher end weapons are always better than earthcaller when solo tanking, sure you can slow a mob 50% with earthcaller, but if you are cutting your DPS by 1/2 then there is no net gain.<br />

I think Mistme's assertion is still pretty accurate even for moderately high end weapons.<br />
<br />
Let's say Earthcaller produces 75% of your total DPS when using EC/Swiftwind. Based on that assumption, how good would a weapon have to be to double your total DPS? With Swiftwind doing 25%, you'd need a weapon doing 175% to get to 200%. The new weapon would need a 14 damage/10.3 delay ratio to produce that much damage compared to 14/24. (175%/75% = 2.33. 24/2.33 = 10.3) I think it'll be a couple more expansions before any weapons get that good. :)<br />
<br />
A reasonable ratio to consider is 14/20, which produces 20% more damage than 14/24. Based on the prior assumption for Swiftwind/offhand, a 14/20 weapon increases your total DPS by 15% when it replaces Earthcaller. That's a significant difference, but it doesn't automatically mean that EC should be bagged. I did some rough calculations and estimate that a mob would have to do 10 DPS or less (when it isn't slowed) for me to benefit from using the 14/20 exclusively. I'm pretty sure that's weaker than either small mushrooms in FG or dorfs in EW.<br />
<br />
Based on my calculations, the 14/20 would require extra heals that would increase my downtime faster than it would decrease the fight time, and I'd take more damage per fight anyway (which increases risk).</div></div><hr />

None. Earthcaller is situational as soon as any upgrade is available to you.</div></div><hr />
