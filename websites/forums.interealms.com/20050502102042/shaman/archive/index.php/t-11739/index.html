<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>smile1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was wondering if anyone knows why bear illusion is the illusion that shamans get.  Is there role-play significance to it?  Or is there some other reason why this was chosen?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Its a form of nature, shamans being nature-type casters, not actual faith type as much. Like Totemic armour..think Native Americans kinda with their beliefs. I always kinda thought it was appropriate. Like our &quot;spirit companion&quot; is a wolf spirit. *shrugs*  I dont use it too much with a horse, but its ok in dungeons shrunk, the extra regen helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yea , VI had the native american shaman in mind with the creation of us. I think it fits us perfectly , just need a new grpahics for it ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I disagree. The Druid is clearly the Priest class who is supposed to be the &quot;Priest of Nature&quot;, along with the hybrid Ranger class. Shamans however do not get their magical force from nature, but from the spirit world, the plane of existence above the one we live in where spirits roam around and do spirit things. But as far as the Bear form, I would be more inclined to agree with you, and believe that was taken from the native american culture. I remember being told that the native americans thought the bear was a very wise animal..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reading  this ha made me think of something.  What would you think about a new illusion for Shaman?<br />
<br />
Illusion Spirit<br />
gives innate levitate, and wisdom boost (+15?). Spells would fizzle less.   But would cost you 2-5 hp/tic..cause you would be dead and in the spirit world..so it would slowly kill you.  <br />
<br />
I think that could be a lot of fun.  probably wont happen cause VI would have to update the global file and we all know that they HATE to do that.  Just a neat idea to think about.  Make it level 60 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That would be interesting, an illusion similar to the undead iksar spirit such as Lord Rak from the epic (although a generic one, not an iksar one, maybe a different one per race)<br />
<br />
The main problem is though, necro's would look at it as a lich type illusion, since it's an undead illusion.<br />
But with restrictions it could be plausable</div></div><hr />
