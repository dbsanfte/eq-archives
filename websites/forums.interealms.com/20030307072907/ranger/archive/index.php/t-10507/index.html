<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Syznic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I fat fingered some keys last night and ran across this little oddity.<br />
<br />
Hide.<br />
Have puller pull a mob (velks upper dog) and tank it in front of you, turned so that the mobs back is to you. (typical grp xp grinding)<br />
Sneak.  (that was my fat finger)<br />
Auto Attack mob (hide breaks, sneak doesn't)<br />
The mob cons indiff while you continue to slice away at it.<br />
<br />
Some of the time (i'm guessing the mob was pushed or sneak roll failed) it would scowel after half a fight.  But for the most part I was able to repeat this several times.<br />
<br />
Anyway, not sure if this is just a stupid ranger trick, a bug, or might actually be useful in an agro battle as a ghetto-evade.<br />
<br />
Enjoy,</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Eredril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually if you cast camo while on a mob's agro list it will still scowl at you.  I've done this before while escaping from Chardok a few times.  I also used that green con Herald at the entrance to Chardok to test if I had a successful Hide or not when I'd go AFK.  If I had agroed him because he was in the way of an arrow intended for a mob that was behind him, then he would always scowl at me even on a successful hide when the other mobs regarded me indifferently.</div></div><hr />
