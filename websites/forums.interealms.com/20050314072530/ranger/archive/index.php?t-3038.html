If you just want to help detemine this formula, please jump to the methodology section]<br />
<br />
With only four data sets from the other thread, don't have nearly enough data.<br />
<br />
1) Some of the postings are estimates<br />
2) Only 4 postings to deal with.<br />
<br />
In lieu of anything better, I am working from the notion that the formula for Achery Max Damage (beofre modifiers like TS, NR/NM, etc)<br />
<br />
(BowDAM  + Arrow DAM) * ArchDamX<br />
<br />
Where ArchDamX could be determined by one or more of the following:<br />
<br />
Level<br />
Skill<br />
Dex<br />
Str (reasoned away, see below)<br />
Bow Delay (reasoned away, see below)<br />
<br />
The quest is to determine ArchDam X.<br />
<br />
Based on what VI has said, and observations, I feel that STR and DLY of the bow are NOT Factors. Not STR, because DEX has been indicated as the stat for bows, and not DLY of bow, because the only known formula that uses DLY is the BONUS of two handed melee weapons, and archery is NOT a main attack it is a secondary style attack, and no place in eq do secondary attacks get a bonus.<br />
<br />
So that leaves Level, Skill and Dex as possible components of ArchDamX.<br />
<br />
I looked at the posters on the last threads numbers, and using excel to compute backward, it appears that the Archery Max damage Formula is not too differenent from the melee one.<br />
<br />
ArchDamX  = (DEX + SKILL + LEVEL) /100<br />
<br />
Prroduces numbers that are close, but not ACCURATE to peoples reported numbers, but at least two of the four samples I got were &quot;I think&quot; or &quot;If i recall&quot;, what I need is more data that is EXACT.<br />
<br />
I need 10 volunteers for the greater good of Rangerdom to do exact tests, and post them. We can pin this fomula down, but not with anecdotal data. We need to shoot greens (for true maxes) and we need to control the test. The more data the better, DATA, DATA, DATA!<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
The Test Methodology.<br />
------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
()----- Ruleset: -----()<br />
<br />
1) Don't have any points in AM, sorry, AM is the shiznat, but messes with the test.<br />
2) Dont use Trueshot<br />
3) Ignore crits, if you get a crit, don't count it<br />
4) Root the mob! to remove the double damage<br />
5) If possible, and you have the time and gumption, lather rinse repeat with different bows and arrows, the steps below and record the different Maxes. At worst, get a terrible 1gp store bought bow and try it to.<br />
6) repeat the steps below as many times as you feel you need to get a hit that aint getting any higher<br />
<br />
()----- The Test -----()<br />
<br />
1) Find a total Greenie, as green as possible, the greenest thing that can live through your lowest root.<br />
2) Root them, negating the Non rooted code<br />
3) Without TS, or any AM points, or archery buff let them have it.<br />
4) Find another mob of similar level, if they are green enough the exact level is not as important, but try to be as close as possible, a level 1 or 4 should still get hit for Max.<br />
5) Repeat until you cant seem to get a value that is any higher,  the more samples you get the closetr you get to the true max. WE ARE LOOKING FOR TRUE MAX DAMAGE, not practical max damage on raiding mobs, etc. PLEASE IGNORE CRITS, crit values are applied after the normal formula.<br />
6) repeat above if you want with different bows and arrows.<br />
<br />
For each MAX you obtain note the following:<br />
<br />
The Max<br />
Your Level<br />
Your Archery Skill<br />
Your Dex<br />
The Stats of the Bow (DAM/DLY for posterity)<br />
The Stats of the Arrow<br />
<br />
Sorry to be a stickler, but anecdotal data is useless, dont bother to post unless you can control the conidtions and record the data.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
I know this seems like a lot of work, but this is something I think we all would like to know.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much, EQ has been out for 3 years and this formula is not known, and we need to knock this one out, Gladers.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Level 60<br />
Skill 240<br />
Dex 111<br />
Bow is 40/40<br />
Arrows are 3dmg 50rng<br />
<br />
No archery mastery<br />
<br />
ArchDamX = (DEX + SKILL + LEVEL) /100 <br />
(111+240+60) / 100 = 4.11 * (40 + 3) = 176.73<br />
<br />
So your initial hypothesis does not fly with my numbers, at least.<br />
<br />
Using the formula from the first thread:<br />
<br />
(BOW DAM + ARROW DAM) * ((DEX + SKILL) / 200 ) <br />
(40 + 3) * ((111 + 240) / 200 ) = 75.465<br />
<br />
So that doesn't work for me either.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, 114 X 1.7 = 193.8, and my max crit during this testing was 193.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 05:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks for taking the time to do the test!<br />
<br />
Much appreciated.<br />
<br />
At 114, the ArchDamX for this test is 114/43 or <br />
<br />
2.6511627906976744186046511627907<br />
<br />
If I am right and the formula is (BOW + ARROW) * ArchDamX, the question is what potential working of 60, 111 and 240 could give the above number.<br />
<br />
Again thanks for the hard data.<br />
<br />
EDIT: <br />
<br />
Working from just his numbers gives<br />
<br />
ArchDamX = (3*(DEX + SKILL)) / 400 = 2.6325<br />
<br />
For a Max of 113.19 with his Bow and Arrow combo.<br />
<br />
I am pretty certain that is not the formula, but it matched his data eeirly well, and VI has been known to use 4 and 3 in the AC formula.</div></div><hr />

Don't have Archery Mastery yet but I do have Endless Quiver :)  Archery skill is at 240.<br />

Dex shouldn't figure into this because it only affects how often you crit and the average damage of the crit I believe.</div></div><hr />

--&gt;&gt; My new formula gives 74, he got 71.<br />
<br />
Could (BOW + ARROW) * ( 3*  (DEX + SKILL) / 400) be THE fomula, or close to it? Getting closer...<br />
<br />
Need some data from the 30's, 40's and 50's level players.<br />
<br />
Also of note, is that the ratio of MAX  /  (Bow + Arrow), was pretty constant at 2.84, 2.775 and 2.84.<br />
<br />
This is pretty exciting as if that number stays constant it validates princple #1 of this process that ArchDamX * (Bow + Arrow) is the right idea -- we just have to get the formula for ADX.</div></div><hr />

I tried Bloodmaw in GD, he was green and is permarooted so thought would be nice, but he does seem to have an unusually high ac...<br />
Shot more than 550 arrows and max hit was 92, BUT i only got 2 hits for that damage and they were in the first 10 or so arrows i shot, next lowest hit was 90 and i only got it once. DEX was 152, wanted to do tests with different DEX values, but if you can shoot 500 arrows without seeing a maximum damage hit no accurate results are possible.<br />
Oh yeah, bow 30/39, level 60, skill 240 but as i said i don't think my results are accurate, quite possible that the max damage is 93 or 94, maybe even higher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khelzor</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 08:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you think the max potential isnt just bow + arrow dmg?<br />
<br />
Is AM3 + primal bow + dmg 10 arrow max not 492 if you only have 190 dex as opposed to 255 dex?  It is for me. Hitting for max potential is more closely related to ATK than to dex.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-15-2002, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Khelzor, yes ATK has to do with the rate at which you hit for Max damage, not what that number caps at.<br />
<br />
Looking at melee damage formula which has been scruitnized for two years its:<br />
<br />
DAM * ((Skill + STR + Level) /  100)<br />
<br />
(and + the DAM bonus if its main hand)<br />
<br />
That has nothing to do with ATK.<br />
<br />
What ATK does have to do with is the frequency you hit for that maximum, or whether you get the opportunity to hit for it at all. So, when you fight mob X, your ATK does determine your Max damage in that encounter, ie, the rate you can get Max damage type roles. <br />
<br />
This is why I say attack level 1-5 greens, we are looking for theortetical Max damage PER HIT, which is independent of ATK I am hypothosizing, just like its independent for melee, a known fact.<br />
<br />
I am using DEX, because I am working from the hypothesis that the Archery MAX is similiarly constructed to the melee max.<br />
<br />
I am not married to DEX as part of the equation, I want numbers to prove or disprove this, not my opinions.<br />
<br />
--<br />
<br />
Kirywen and others , lower the con please, we want theoretical MAX.<br />
<br />
Kirywen my current fomula, shows your max at 97 which is not to far off. I feel like I am getting reasonably close on level 60 players, but less so with other levels -- need more data.<br />
<br />
My current guess formula for Arroe is 53 vs his 41, what level was that mob? Did you do it on a low level mob, and repeated times?<br />
<br />
Try level 3-5 mobs they should live through your root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whew, need more data.<br />
<br />
I have been working on this here at work in my down time, and I have a big spreadsheet, that is looking at ratios and combinations of Dex, Skill and/ or Level as factors.<br />
<br />
Working backwords and sideways, I cant find a combo of any all or none of the above three that is consistent among the 5 good data sets I have gotten. (Chromite's 3, Oatsagi, and Arroe)<br />
<br />
I need a more data.<br />
<br />
I can make a formula work for one data set but not others.<br />
<br />
I will say this if you look at the Maxes for people that are level 60 with 240 skill, if you devide their max by their BOW + ARROW, regardless of Bow and Arrow the ratio is right around 2.8, leading me to belive that the formula is BOW+ARROW DAM * X, its just how is X calcluated that is the rub. I am tending to think DEX may not be involved, or may be weighted down.<br />
<br />
I can also make a formula work REASONABLY well for some of the people that are 60, but not the lower levels, leading me to belive that pure level may be part of the number, or that skill is double dipped. (skill is similar to level in some ways, as it goes up every level in theory till it caps)<br />
<br />
Please, anyone interested, root and shoot 3 5-10 low level mobs next time you in EC or something and post.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Though, all classes except monks are on the same table at 50+ though, and monks have their own.<br />
<br />
Everything is based off these tables + a couple multipliers here and there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 01:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We (the eq number crunching community) THINK the way combat and the tables work is this.<br />
<br />
1) You make a &quot;to hit&quot; roll against the Mob. This % is based on your Skill/Level ATK vs their Avoidance AC component.<br />
<br />
2) If you hit, you hit for either minumum damage, modal damage, maximum damage or somewhere between, based on your STR/DAMAGE ATK vs. their Mitigation AC component.<br />
<br />
MAX Damage, how it is calculated is known for melee.<br />
<br />
The Tables dont effect MAX damage, they effect the frequency with which it is acchieved.<br />
<br />
That is why monks at 60 never hit harder than Rangers with same weapon and stats, just more often, and for more DPS over the long haul.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 01:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wrong, the tables do affect max damage. And monks DO hit for more max damage. Ask any 60 monk with a 15 damage weapon and they'll tell you they hit for more than I do with my Tolans. Non monks max at 97 with one. Monks max at 99, or 100, cant remmeber, one of the two.<br />
<br />
Tables are also why you can hit for your absolute max at around 220 Strength if you have high enough attack. Because the tables are used to calculate every single thing. They just use the attack numbers to determine what part of the table you can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sean, is that monks Weapon skill or str higher?<br />
<br />
The established formula for Max damage is DAM * (STR + SKILL + LEVEL) / 100<br />
<br />
+ DAMAGE BONUS IF MAIN HAND, OR TWO HANDED<br />
<br />
This formula has stood up for a long time.<br />
<br />
I am also not saying things aren't tabled based, just that MAX damage formula has been tested over and over and over, including in the monk community.<br />
<br />
I am about to give up tho, I need WAY more data, on the order of 10x what I have gotten and much more spread across levels, and in leiu of it, this is fruitless.<br />
<br />
I can tell you your max bow damage at 60 within 5%, whoop-die doo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sean SpiritArrow</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First, that formula isn't perfect. Second, they upgraded the monks tables months ago. It was in a patch message, they also explained it in the EQ forms.<br />
<br />
Your Strength + Atk determine how well you can use the table, and strength's usefulness caps out early now due to how high everyone can get their atk with buffs.<br />
<br />
Ok, the formula does work for the main damage table. But it doesnt work for monks anymore obviously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vodyr</div><div class="date">05-16-2002, 02:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok, I agree that the new monk tables could have fubar'd the formula in those cases, since the formula is pre new tables.<br />
<br />
Based on the general max damage formula as a reasonable start,   I still think that the Archery formula is of the form...<br />
<br />
(BOW DAM + ARROW) * Mystery component<br />
<br />
Mystery component being related to skill and most likely level, and perhaps, although I am no longer convinced, DEX.<br />
<br />
The reason I belive this so strongly now is that the ratio of Max hit / (BOW + ARROW) for the reported level 60's with max skill so far has been right around 2.8, its fairly constant.<br />
<br />
The question is how did we get 2.8 from? I can make a formula that produces 2.8 that is fairly elegant looking, but it dies for the lower level peeps that have reported.<br />
<br />
I am working from two basic assumptions above all<br />
<br />
1) The formula will be elegant, IE X + Y / /100 not x*.38657 ^ 1.3, etc<br />
<br />
2) The formula will be similar to other formulae they have employed<br />
<br />
<br />
NEED MORE NUMBERS.<br />
<br />
Considering this Avatar is only 16, I only ever get BOW DAM + ARROW DAM, so I cant run numbers myself, sadly.</div></div><hr />
