<br />
Surely Sony wouldnt stoop this low.<br />
<br />
Just wondered if anyone on here has experienced this or if its a whole lot of nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't understand the problem.  Some guys got d*cked on their /movelog because they waited too long to get their first choice?  How's that a big deal?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Were you sick from school the day they taught people how to read?<br />
<br />
-People on the Zek servers get a free /movelog off the new consolodated (that means brought together) server.<br />
-They are not allowed to /movelog to Stromm, apparently because of some special ruleset on the server.<br />
-They are allowed to pay $ to do a character transfer from one server to Stromm, ignoring the fact it has a special ruleset on the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">And?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GrimbearEQ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think the point that people are trying to make is ... Apparantly the SoE guys are saying ... &quot;Sorry we cant move you too Stromm becase to do so would violate its special rule set .... However IF you should choose to pay us we will gladly violate that special ruleset np .&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that the point the poster is trying to make is .. if you set up special &quot;rules&quot; they should stand as rules regardless of wether someone pays you money or not ..<br />
<br />
Just a guess but that seemed like the point to me anyway /shrug :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As far as i remember they didn't open up any transfers to Stromm. You couldn't even pay for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Personally, I don't really care what happens to the PvP players.<br />
<br />
They are getting a free move to almost any server if they wish to move off the PvP server, so what if one or two are not free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I suspect its much like being able to pay to move to FV server.  According to the rules, you cant.  However, there have been folks who got moved simply because the person doing the moves didn't know it wasn't allowed.<br />
To the best of my knowledge, Stromm was never supposed to have transfers.  There was a server they closed to transfers for first 6 months, but I think that was Maelin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Been playing on Stromm since they opened it for a breath of fresh air. They've allowed transfers to Stromm for quite a while now. Originaly everyone there was real unhappy they opened the server to transfers, but with everyone and their brother bailing from EQ it's working out ok.  Friday we got quite a large number of folks from the Zeks show up in PoK, with their PK flags intact and no GM online to help. :) I feel real sorry for the poor GM who logs in first and gets that list of active petitions unless they have a script ready for changing 'em over to standard care bear players. No idea if all them paid for the service or not, I'll ask tonight when I log on. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wulfbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And?<br />
<br />
Um so Brohg you really think this is acceptable customer service ?.<br />
<br />
If you actually read the post you will see Stromm was offered as a choice.<br />
Now when they patched the patch that was to do the movelogs they removed Stromm from the list.<br />
<br />
If you can pay to move to Stromm even though it apparently has a special ruleset (anyone ever noticed this) how can they deny you a free movelog (which after all is really a forced move).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>KB1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It would have stayed the way it was if not for a pretty large outcry, rightly warranted, and from several places.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jentriken Aspenbark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stromm has no special ruleset. I moved to it when it started, it was basically just listed as a newbie server, and no transfers were allowed for economy reasons. the server had to start from the ground up.<br />
<br />
1 year into it, they opened em up. stromm is no different than any other server now, and should be on that list.</div></div><hr />
