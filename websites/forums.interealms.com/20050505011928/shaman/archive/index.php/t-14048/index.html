<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Okay, guys.  I have seen a few posts where people are confused on flags.  Here's a roadmap to get into the elemental planes.  I wrote this up for my guild a few months back.<br />
<br />
Caveat--keep in mind that flags done out of order may not show up with the seer until you have killed the predecessor mobs and then unlocked memories.<br />
<br />
Hope this is of some use.<br />
<br />
Chutoi<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Plane of Nightmares line:<br />
Hail elder poxbourne in Plane of Tranquility and follow script for pre-FLAG<br />
Complete hedge script for FLAG for TT's lair<br />
Kill Terris Thule for FLAG to PoTorment<br />
<br />
Plane of Disease line:<br />
Hail the guy outside the ****pipe to CoD. Ask What ward? for pre-FLAG<br />
Kill Grummus for Crypt of Decay FLAG<br />
Complete high priest script for KEY to bertoxx (all need)<br />
Kill Bertoxx for FLAG (note: killing bertoxx will also get you access to PoTorment if you do not already have TT flag above)<br />
<br />
Plane of Innovation line:<br />
Do save the gnome scipt for factory FLAG (ONE per guild needed, so most guilds need only do this ONCE)<br />
Kill Manaetic Bahemoth for PoTactics FLAG<br />
Kill Tallon and Vallon Zek (no order) in Tactics--text, no flag<br />
Kill Rallos Zek in Tactics for FLAG (RZ needed for elemental planes entrance, but NOT for Sol Ro tower entrance)<br />
<br />
Plane of Justice Line:<br />
Hail Mavuin. &quot;I will plead your case&quot; for FLAG<br />
Complete a trial for MARK OF [trial name] (note, keep mark--get all 6 for access to the 7th Hammer, though not needed for elemental access)<br />
Tell a justice, &quot;I wish to plead the case of Mavuin?&quot; for FLAG<br />
Hail Mavuin again for FLAG. You are now PoV/PoS enabled.<br />
<br />
Plane of Valor Line:<br />
Kill Aerin Dar for FLAG to Halls of Honor<br />
Complete Save the Lady Trial (this and next 2 trials--no order needed, and no flag--you just get text)<br />
Complete Dragon Trial<br />
Complete Save the Townspeople Trial (can zone into HoHb with 3 trials)<br />
Kill Mithanial Marr in temple of Marr for FLAG<br />
<br />
Plane of Storms line:<br />
Collect 1 medallion from each of two of the three races of giants. Also collect one giant head and a beard, a sash, a bone. Give the head to Askr and follow text to get Bastion of Thunder KEY<br />
Complete a courtyard key (one no-drop gem from each wing combined in a box off a 65 named from any wing boss)<br />
Complete an Agnarr key (combine one no-drop sphere from each wing in a box off a tower boss)<br />
Kill Agnarr and say to Karana, &quot;I wish to follow the path of the fallen&quot; (I think) for FLAG. (needed for elemental planes, NOT sol ro tower)<br />
<br />
Plane of Torment line:<br />
Once TT flagged and Bertoxx flagged, say to Fahlia in PoTranquility, &quot;I will go to Torment&quot; for pre-FLAG<br />
Hail Tylis in PoTorment and follow script to kill Keeper of Sorrows for FLAG<br />
Kill Saryn for FLAG<br />
<br />
Elemental Planes:<br />
Once you have RZ and Karana flags, ask the Grand Librarian &quot;What information?&quot; and it will open elemental planes of water, earth and air<br />
<br />
Tower of Solusek Ro line:<br />
Once you have Saryn, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek, and Mithanial Marr flags, Hail the Grand Librarian in PoKnowledge and say What information? for FLAG<br />
Kill 5 tower mini-bosses for FLAGS<br />
Kill Solusek Ro for FLAG to plane of fire. <br />
<br />
One last thing.  I don't remember which line it goes to, but there are 3 flags from the Grand librarian.  One you get from hailing him after completing all the above.  One you get from, &quot;What information?&quot; and one you get from &quot;what lore?&quot;.  If you are having problems, just make sure you did all three.<br />
<br />
Good luck guys!</div></div><hr />
