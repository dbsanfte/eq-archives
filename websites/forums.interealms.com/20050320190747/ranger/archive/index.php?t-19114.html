THE CYBER THEME SONG:  &quot;Cyberin' Ranger&quot;<br />
Sung to the tune of &quot;Travelin' Soldier&quot; by the Dixie Chicks<br />
By Yendor Lootmonkey of Xegony<br />
<br />
Two levels past eighteen<br />
He was waitin' for the raid in his ivy greens<br />
Sat down on a stool at a tavern there<br />
Gave his order to the girl with the blonde elven hair<br />
He's a little twinked so she gave him a smile<br />
And he said would you mind sittin' down for a while<br />
And cyberin' me I'm feelin' a little low<br />
She said I'm loggin' in an hour but I know where we can go<br />
<br />
So they went down and they sat on the pier<br />
He said I bet you're really a guy but I don't care<br />
I've got no one to send naughty /tells to<br />
Would you mind if I sent some back here to you?<br />
<br />
CHORUS:<br />
I cried<br />
Never gonna talk like that to another guy<br />
They told her he's always in danger<br />
Waitin' for love from a cyberin' ranger<br />
Cybers him in /tells all day<br />
Waitin' for him to come back from /AFK<br />
Never more to be alone<br />
When the wizards say the ranger's porting home<br />
<br />
So the /replies came<br />
From a dungeon zone<br />
In Castle Mistmoore then Naggy's home<br />
And he told her of his guild<br />
It might be leet<br />
And all of his gear that was pretty neat<br />
Said when it's gettin kinda tough over here<br />
I think about that day sittin' down at the pier<br />
And close my eyes and see your dirty /tells<br />
Don't worry but I won't be able to raid very well<br />
<br />
CHORUS<br />
<br />
(Instrumental)<br />
<br />
One Friday night at a GM event<br />
The uber guilds won and the newbies got bent<br />
A man said folks would you bow your heads<br />
For the list of local dragon raid dead<br />
Cryin' all alone at the orc spawn <br />
Was a third level wood elf killing all the pawns<br />
And one name read and nobody really cared<br />
But a pretty little girl with her blonde elven hair<br />
<br />
CHORUS</div></div><hr />
