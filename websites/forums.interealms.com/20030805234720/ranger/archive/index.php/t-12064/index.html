<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is an e-mail I'm thinking about sending to the CBC in regards to the article they did. Any thoughts/etc would be appreciated. =)<br />

Although it is interesting to see coverage of gaming in popular media, I have to wonder what exactly was the point of portraying it in the way that you had done.<br />
<br />
The show seemed to indicate that Everquest in and of itself is an addictive substance and that there is no escape from this horrible game. The 'normal' Everquest player was apparently an addict who can't even honestly answer how much she plays in a week.<br />
<br />
According to a study [ http://www.tvfa.org/images/facts&amp;figs/factsheets/Facts%20and%20Figures.pdf ] done on television viewing, the average American household watches more than four hours of television a night. That's more than Tracy, the Everquest addict plays in a day. Apparently TV viewing is so bad, that TV addicts will leave their television on for more than 7 hours a day, there's a 25% chance that these addicts will fall asleep watching the television three nights a week.<br />
<br />
Television addiction also seems to lead to obesity (From the Journal of the American Medical Association, Vol. 279, No. 12, March 1998.), and has led to violence as a result of viewing it (Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, Vol. 152, P. 712-14. July 1998. Both of these links derived from http://www.tvfa.org/). It's also interesting to note that 98% of Americans own a television, which is a far greater number than the 400,000 people addicted to Everquest and other forms of online gaming of which studies seem to indicate only 50% of that are truly addicted.<br />
<br />
I had played Everquest for approximately a year and a half or so. I no longer do, and haven't had any real inclination to do so. I had approximately 42 days played on my account (with some of this time being when I would just go off and do other things while leaving the game on, the reason being is that there are certain things in the game that would require you to literally sit there and do nothing for hours upon end. Sorry, but I'm not going to do that. I'll go sleep, read a book, do homework, etc, instead. And yes, I do agree that this is part of the problem with these types of games) with three characters...resulting in approximately 7% of the total time I had spent there playing the game. There are certain 'end' points in the game, too. There's a limit as to the number of levels you can achieve with your character, as well as other 'physical' limitations that can exist on your character, for example. Admittedly, it is an involving hobby, but so is golfing, gardening, painting, and taking up a musical instrument, other hobbies which don't have a set 'ending'. Golfing and gardening require money to be invested as well as a great deal of time. Using the logic that Jay Parker did with Everquest, golfing is just as addictive as Everquest...you can't just play 4 holes of golf and be done with it. The makers of the golf courses have designed a golf course in the way where you have to take an extraordinate amount of time to leave if you're in the middle of a game. And once you leave the links, people are still playing. All over the world, golfing goes on. <br />
<br />
With painting and playing a musical instrument, both demand that you invest a lot of time and money with them if you wish to be any good at all with your respected art. Yet people aren't rushing to get the art and music addicts locked up. Due to the fact that online gaming is a fairly recent trend, and not alot of people understand it, I feel that it recieves a rather negative light by the media because of it's newness and lack of understanding. It hasn't become openly accepted in our society yet, so there's a fear associated with it. That's just my uninformed opinion, though.<br />
<br />
Another interesting note that the piece completely misses the fact that Shawn Wooley was an epileptic and his last 8 seizures were caused by being on the computer (http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp). The fact that Mr. Wooley put his own health at risk would've been a rather sensationalistic bit to run in the story, yet you didn't go with it? I have to wonder why. Would it have reflected poorly on Ms. Wooley and her concern for her son? Roughly 30% of all people with epilepsy have it diagnosed in childhood, meaning that the it's very likely that Shawn had been an epileptic for quite awhile. Shouldn't she be concerned that it was entirely possible that her son could've died 8 times because of this game? He lived alone, worked at a subpar job and played a game that was detrimental to his health...yet she didn't try to affect anything until after he had died.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm curious as to how exactly Mrs. Wooley was able to obtain the information regarding the &quot;iloveyou&quot; character that was mentioned in your piece. Everquest has a naming filter in place to block out names such as these, as they do not fit with the 'fantasy' world that the game tries to portray. Other names like &quot;Ilikedogs&quot; and the such tend to get rejected before you can even create a character and go and play the game. While I'm not saying that he might've used this name in other online areas, it doesn't seem to fly that he had an Everquest character that went by this name, and I am curious as to how exactly she would've been able to obtain this information. <br />
<br />
The dopamine study is very intriguing and interesting, yet it seems that dopamine is associated with everything from eating (http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20020704/obesity_brain020704/SpecialEvent1/story/) to sex (http://www.smartbodyz.com/l-theanine-pms-dopamine-Text1.htm) to even addiction to drugs and alcohol. From my quick scan of what exactly dopamine is, it seems that it's a chemical that is released whenever an individual does something pleasurable. That would seem to indicate that doing anything pleasurable would result in dopamine being released in the system, and addictions forming. Also, since dopamine is a naturally occuring substance in the body, it would be impossible to form a dependence on the substance, and thus, gaining a 'physical' addiction from Everquest. The distinction between a psychological and physical addiction didn't seem to be readily made in the piece, and I felt that was something important that was glossed over. <br />
<br />
Regarding the fact that Sony Online uses the terms 'addictive' in their programming, don't other, just as harmful products do the same thing? Frito Lay, the potato chip company, has a slogan that goes 'Betcha Can't Eat Just One!'. McDonald's has ads running where people are so addicted to winning their contests that they physically throw themselves at a garbage can to save a game piece. This could be construed as addiction as well. Pillsbury, makers of Pizza Pops, have advertisements running right now which show two adolescents depriving themselves of sleep due to an addiction to gaming/eating Pizza Pops. Should then, these food companies be forced to put warning labels on all of their food since a man is suing several fast food chains for providing harmful, and possibly addictive food (http://abcnews.go.com/sections/us/DailyNews/fatsuit020725.html)? Especially since dopamine, a substance which has been linked to addictive behavior (http://www.mndaily.com/daily/1998/05/14/news/ap514f.ap/ ), also has been linked with obesity. Therefore, Frito Lay and all of these other companies are acting irresponsible as a result.<br />
<br />
Also, common logic would dictate that having less addicts playing the game and having more casual players would be in their best interests. Each player pays a flat rate every month to play the game, yet 'addicted' people would end up costing more resources and getting more value for their dollar than a casual player would be. Casual players would take longer to achieve certain in game 'goals' and thus, would be paying more to achieve these goals as they would be playing for more time than an 'addicted' player would. They would also be taking up less space and resources on Sony Online's servers, thus giving Sony Online more value for their dollar, as there would be less stress on their servers allowing even more players to play on existing resources. Having more hardcore addicts would appear to be more costly for SO than having non-addicts playing the game.<br />
<br />
Additionally, all casinos should come with warning labels denoting that gambling could, indeed, prove to be addictive. Bars should also have a sign on the front stating that drinking could prove to be habit forming. And so on and so forth. Yes, people do become addicted to certain things, such as gambling, alcohol, hard drugs, online gaming, or anything else. However, the amount of people who actually gamble, drink or game that are addicted is a small portion of the people who represent those groups. Not all gamblers are gambling addicts, nor are all people who drink booze alcoholics. Nor are all online gamers gaming addicts that will shoot themselves in the head. Even Mr. Parker, the expert quoted in both your piece and the article from the Milwaukee Sentinel (http://www.jsonline.com/news/state/mar02/31536.asp) has admitted that the games themselves aren't inherently bad, yet, that is not the impression that I had recieved upon viewing your piece. Curt Schilling, pitcher for the Arizona Diamondbacks, plays Everquest. ( http://espn.go.com/mlb/columns/stark_jayson/1201283.html ) As do other famous people, such as fantasy author R.A. Salvatore (I apologize for the lack of a link, I recall reading this from a magazine about a year or so ago ;)<br />
<br />
In all, people, in our society, need to start taking responsiblity for their actions and owing up to the fact that they are, ultimately, masters of their fate. What happened to Mr. Wooley is tragic and nothing something I'd easily laugh or shrug off, but as someone who plays video and computer games, and to have what I consider to be a fine station such as the CBC, to paint online gaming in such a black light, is something that does bother me. I do realize that there is a problem with people who do play video games...as evidenced by the near fanatical devotion some Asian gamers give towards their games (http://www.ananova.com/news/story/sm_382915.html), as well as closer-to-home cases such as what happened with Shawn Wooley. I just felt that both sides regarding this issue were not equally represented and thought I would give my 2 cents regarding this.<br />

Thank you for taking the time to read it, it's most appreciated.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wwen Valimar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nice. They probably won't care, but its worth a shot. Maybe someone will feel ashamed of their sensationalisim.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I know that some shows on the CBC have been known to post retractions and there's always the possibility that they would do a follow-up story. I think it's foolish to say that there aren't inherent problems with these sorts of games, but to be placing the blame on the companies or the game itself is silly. <br />
<br />
You never know when replying in a rational manner could/would help things. ^_^ I'll tidy up some of the grammar in there (I wrote this at like 1 in the morning cause I couldn't sleep :P) and send it off and post a reply if I get any word back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Mezumiiru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">/agree with Dedolito<br />
<br />
ALSO, I wanted to say about this that this guy was apparently made fun of his whole life for being the sickly fat kid. I didn't watch the thing, but I assume if he played EQ that much, he was probably some crazy high lvl dude, head of his guild or summat. In short, EQ probably gave that kid the best time and friends of his life. You may think it sad, but he had no life, and if he was happy in Norrath, then they should be glad he had that much. No one cared if he was fat or unmotivated or anything else in EQ. He probably loved it. His mother should bloody well &lt;i&gt;THANK&lt;/i&gt; Sony for that.<br />
But not Verant and their crap coding. Definitely not them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Pwned. Very well written with sources to back yourself up. Very respectful. Hell, I wish I could write that good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frayja Arres</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">send that it was fantasic ... <br />
<br />
question did they the experts say all if this 15 years ago as well when D&amp;D was all the rage before compters ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taolil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">D&amp;D was blamed for everything from ritual suicide to sparking the rise in Satanism amongst young adults (and we all know that Satanism is the way to go these days ;)<br />
<br />
There was an incident involving...uhh.....some guy in the 70s who suffered from severe self esteem issues. He started playing D&amp;D in college, and one day ended up disappearing. Well, a manhunt ensued and the police determined that he had taken roleplaying 'too far'.  What actually happened is a little more interesting...this guy suffered from a bunch of self esteem issues and had ran away from his parents because they were overly demanding of him. He did eventually end up committing suicide...but this was years later and no real correlation between him killing himself because of the game was ever really found. This fact is glossed over when people who are anti-RPGs decide to bring it up.<br />
<br />
The other, more popular instance is the Mazes &amp; Monsters book, which was later turned into a movie. The book/movie is very loosely based on real events, but is not an accurate account of what actually happened. Again, that fact is glossed over when people talk about this movie. Yes, someone did committ suicide and yes, they played D&amp;D, but you also have take into account that buddy also had a substance abuse problem (he did cocaine) and was a social outcast (and presumably had mental issues of his own). D&amp;D may have played a role in his death, but it wasn't the cause. ;)<br />

http://www.theescapist.com/faq_encyclopedia.htm - One more quick link. Gives you a bit of a background on some of these organizations...read up on BADD and their stance regarding suicide labels. Geez, I wonder if I'm becoming some sort of uber nrrd here with all this information I keep posting. ;P</div></div><hr />
