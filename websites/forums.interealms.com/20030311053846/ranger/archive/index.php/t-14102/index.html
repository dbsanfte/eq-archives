I know  stuff on test is. . .well, to be tested, but I somehow find the idea-er, disturbing. Paladins? snare? Shadowknights being included is a bit wierd though, they already have snares, though nowhere as good as ours, IMHO.<br />
<br />
But I still find it disturbing. Reducing class dependancy is one thing-making a class completley redundant is another, and I feel they're stepping awfully close to doing just that now. Harmony going all wierd, dangerous sounds being made around archery, and now everyone and their grandmother getting snare? <br />
'Odd' describes what I think of the spells, and 'worrying' describes what I feel for the on-going trend.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, just wanted to express my feelings on this test spell-they may scrap the idea yet, or change it. This is test server, after all. <br />
<br />
What do YOU think?<br />
<br />
(Edit-I cannto sepll tongith)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nift Trailhunter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well that is a odd spell even for testing. This looks to me to be ensnare with a level 55 limit so the lower level time limit was increased from 6.8 at L29 (when Druid's get it) to 12 at level 55 for the four hybrid classes.<br />
<br />
This &quot;Idea&quot; in and of it's self bothers me.  This would mean that there is one less thing that I as a Ranger can do that the other hybrids can not.  Even though Shadowknights can snare now they can not use that snare to control aggro on a mezzed mob since it is a dot also.  This means that with them getting this version of ensnare they will be able to.  This would mean groups that do not know the full knowledgable abilities of a well played ranger will want a SHD or Pally over a Ranger since when they take the agro they can tank for longer in most cases than rangers.  So if I were lucky enough to get a standard pickup group I could see the first sentence upon joining to look something like this...<br />
<br />
&quot;Hello Ranger, Please relize that you are here since there was no one better LFG and you job it to wait for the assist call then stand behind that mob there and hit it. We never want to see you cast on the mobs other than jolt when you are gettting hit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ok maybe a little extreme but this is one job I fulfill often is making sure the Enchanter is not hit by a mob when Mez is broken.  Since I am not 60-65 I do not use Archery as a good source for damage so having a spot in a pickup group is based on need of the group and I am often choosen for agro managment skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Celestra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If paladins get snare I want groupheal and stun!<br />
<br />
And you're right about snare having multiple purposes. I always say snare is my BEST taunt. Forget your tauntkey, snare works ten times better. If I snare and press taunt too I will have aggro in experience camp 90% of the time. I use it a lot like you said, to divert aggro from the enchanter to me, or in any case, to make a re-mes easier since the mob is slowmoving.<br />
<br />
I normally don't really care about what other classes get or not but this would be a really bad idea for paladins to get. I don't much care about SK's getting it since they have other spells to aggro with and they already have a snare. But paladins - definately not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ueauvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">its now live and just think i needed another snare spell lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dathom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Paladins just became even harder to kill in pvp...<br />
<br />
/bonk Verant for this one, only thing i can think of is taunting issues, snare would be good agro control for SK's and Paladins.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sasandra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">umm, it's not a real spell, it's a test spell, notice the name? STaylorTest, Ancient MGB True South is on the live server spdat, that doesn't make it a real spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, crikey, a Paladin with Snare and Stun in PvP?  Not something I wanna see. <br />
<br />
Just ruminating, I'll keep playing, no matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">There is a message on the General Board Apperantly they are working on the Hybrid Fizzle rates and they are using this spell to test it. Apperantly there is a response by Absor on the Pally Boards where the were discussing this spell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Cal the Dude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good. :)<br />
<br />
Otherwise I would want stuns and be able to cast symbols.</div></div><hr />
