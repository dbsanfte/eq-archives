<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I went Linkdead in the blood room, and can't log back on.  I figure since i am stuck down there anyways, I might as well try the Emporer and have a shot at getting Malo, but I have a few questions.<br />
<br />
Since the caster changes, do you think he is still soloable?<br />
I am 60, have torpor, jbb, epic, bane of knife.<br />
<br />
I have never been in a situation to slow him before tash was cast, how hard is he to slow without malo or tash at level 60?<br />
<br />
I know how to pull him solo, and If I fight him close to his door he doesn't gate, but what about when he starts running?  Since I don't have snare, can I realistically kill him before he gets to far away and gates?<br />
<br />
Approx how long does the fight take?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, and if you have any special tricks feel free to add them.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd recommend you have high resists.  Times I did him in a group, he wasnt too much of a pain to slow.  I think at 59 I pulled with malise and it stuck.  <br />
<br />
And only way to keep him from running is root.  I'd use the level 14 one since it has lowest cast delay.  If done right, an oracle with torpor can solo a mob down to 20% and still have 80% mana left, and that's the time I burn my mana down the most, keeping him rooted, dots, dd's, etc to kill him as quick as possible when he's low on health.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Emperor is a wuss.  He is a necro, I believe, not a wizard.  So don't expect any ice comets.  Keep cancel magic up and you first few buff slots open and he won't be able to keep any dots on you.  His melee is pathetic, as are his resists.  I went down there once and killed him 3 times with my group.  Our 60 puller didn't have any ranged item to pull him with, so he asked me to pull with slow.  I am level 59 and it stuck all three times without debuffs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">after you kill blood/ph, i'd recommend waiting at least 5 mins before attacking chottal/ph, so when he respawns he wont have the time to summon a pet.<br />
<br />
pull him with sini, slow, then run around corner so he doesnt cast on you. just jbb/epic him down, he isnt that much of a challenge. got 2 copies of malo off him in 30 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Check the combat forum, long post in there about solo'n chottal.<br />

<br />
We had a snake in Ssra gate 2 inches from us. Maybe new AI changes messed up gating. If Emperor gates, it will summon, then 5 level 49ish skellies will carve a new one for whoever was trying to solo it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Erm, snakes in Ssra are very wierd tho. They move so incredibly fast that it might have seemed like it hardly gated any distance, when in fact it gated, got the obligatory 20% hps from the Gate, and charged back all in like 1 or 2 seconds.  They move so fast . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If you have torpor, I'm 100% convinced you can solo Emperor Chottal.  The only factor that may cause problems is his running, and how you plan to deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well any suggestions on how to deal with the running?  I gave it a try today and while i was killing Blood, he walked into the outer crypt door when he got low on health, he summoned me outside the room.  This normally wouldn't be a problem except that i couldn't get back in :(<br />

How difficult and time consuming are those snare items to get from Fungus Grove?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Rigu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">keep sini on, when he's low try and get a fresh epic and bane on him, and keep him rooted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">&gt;How difficult and time consuming are those snare items to get from Fungus Grove?<br />
<br />
They drop on the callers quest, three different difficulties that you can choose from. The lowest and middle easily done by a single melee heavy group. A certain named drops the glands, they are random spawns in the cycle - entirely possible to go for a few hours and not see any, all luck of the draw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">How do deal with a the runner....<br />
<br />
1.  Get a fungal snare gland thingy.  This has saved my life 2x while I was camping him for a few hours.<br />
2.  When he gets down to about 10% health, try to keep him permarooted.<br />
3.  When he gets down to about 30% health, try to get pox, plague, ebolt, and bane all stacked on him before he runs.<br />
4.  Nuke him with your ice nuke when he's low on health.<br />
<br />
Basicly, the key is to kill him as fast as you fugging can when he's about to run, and to keep him rooted as best you can while he is running.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stay below 2 bubbles of health and he won't run.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I tried him before I had torpor and could not keep up.  I would think he would be very doable with torpor, but I have not tried it personally because, well, I have torpor ;)<br />
<br />
He is usually slowable with moderate ease, but like any other mob I have had a few times where it took a few to get one to land.  I have never seen him gate when you fight him in the doorway.  Can't help you with the running as every time I have fought him I have been with a snarer or I have snared him with my necklace. <br />
<br />
If you try, I would suggest getting an instacast gate potion just in case.  Unless you have a necro friend in Sebilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Banthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">snare ....<br />
/hug spear of constriction ...<br />

i think the problem might be gating moreso than running,<br />

i am gunna give it a try .... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slithis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Never fought him, but would it be possible to pull one of the other mobs in the room once the emperor is pretty low health?  With a friend around before he wants to run, he should stay and fight to the death, no?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Hammer of Spirit Calling procs an 18-second snare. Might help too...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">In a group we always kept him right at the door on Blood's side. Have never had him gate, not sure if he tried to run or not.<br />

Insofar as &quot; snare thingy's &quot; the Crystalline Spiders in CC drop an Ensnaring Net (2 Charges) with a casting time of 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
Am I correct in assuming that Jobarer is a complete no-no in this encounter?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you can't pull any of the skeletons in the emp's room without getting them all...which ends up being really messy.<br />

<br />
These proc a root actually, not snare.  Minor difference, but it does mean a lot on whether you are going to have to take the beating at the end or not :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">You can use the pet.<br />
<br />
You just need a LOT of control over it. IE: Back it off the second Chottal casts on you if he's not in camp. If your pet runs into his room before Chottal reaches you, you're toast from skeleton aggro.<br />
<br />
I always use a pet as a DOT. It can do surprisingly high amounts of damage during long fights when hasted. Just make sure it is behind the mob to avoid enrage/riposte damage. It's also good for holding a mob (possibly the emperor for 10-15 seconds) off that you aggroed with Malo, to get it debuffed. (Can taunt an incoming mob off you if you only used Malo/Malosini.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Azmodai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I've solo'd the emp twice now since I hit 60 a month ago.  Camped down there one night.  Even with the caster changes, Emp is still a puss.  I've got Torpor and Bane, but no Malo, so you know what I was after.<br />
<br />
The hardest part about the Emp is getting him when no ones in the Crypt..:P</div></div><hr />
