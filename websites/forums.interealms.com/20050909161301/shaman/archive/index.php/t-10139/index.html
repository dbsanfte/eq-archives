<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kruzk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you are a shaman then the only place to be leveling is in Kurn's Tower.  Get a group or solo but you can hunt here ...right at the entrance killing entrance spawns for 10-14 and group for 15.  it has a 20% exp mod!  You would not believe the exp you get.<br />
<br />
Yes thats right even if you are a kitty get your tail over to Kurn's Tower in Field of Bone.  There is a book in FoB far from the guards.  And as long as you are careful to stay out of the pit and off any paths you see you will avoid being jumpped by guards and by mobs.<br />
<br />
It blew me away just how fast exp came.  Absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
Of course after that head on over to Paludal Caverns to continue the raging experience!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>theknightmax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Kurns is the second best exp at that level.  I have leveled players both there and Padual and padual is about twices as fast as kurns.  Kurns has the appeal of not being over crowded.<br />
<br />
Also if you are an sk / necro or even if you need money bone chips sell for around 1pp in the bazaar and you can get bags and bags of them there.</div></div><hr />

Actually, in my opinion Kurns is greater because I can kill more in Kurns than in Paludal. Although, when I get to level 16 and get cure disease(playing my necromancer atm) I'm gonna go to paludal and own some fiends until 20 or so. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">for the 10-15 push kurns is much better (at least on my server) because during that time it is hard if not impossible to get a group in PC. on most servers i've played on the level range for most pc groups was about 12-18 or a little higher. but on my current server, Bristlebane, the camps were dominated by ignorant lvl 22s who stayed in pc for reason unknown to me.<br />
<br />
i guess it didn't help i was carrying a bronze shortened spear and had only a splitpaw tunic =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ssalad ddressing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">right now i  am hunting in pit (lvl 12) and i get  good xp, not that bad but good, at 14 i plan moving to kurns and there till about 18, then ill move to paludal :p <br />
<br />
Thats mine</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">is it safe to go there if i'm a troll shaman?  Sounds like some great xp.  ATM i'm level 5 almost six, but got that in one night so should be to 10 pretty fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Kurns is safe for any class as there are no guards/npcs (that are of high level) near the entrance or inside.  Just take the pok book, run as fast as you can to avoid yard fodder and zone into the tower.  Then setup shop at the entrance (or any other camp).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">kurns was my place of choice at level 12-18. after than it was PC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>MrLiquid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">PC? whats pc, wheres it at? Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Paludal Caverns.  It is via Shadowhaven.<br />
<br />
PoK &gt; Nexus &gt; Shadowhaven &gt; PC</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Paludal Caverns. Hit up eqatlas.com for downloadable maps in game and for printables. I wanted to avoid the place as I don't like following where everyone else is, but the loot and exp at that level are the best. Thankfully I managed to avoid crushbone this time around heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Hollierth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I get 3 10 percent a kill in unrest, hmmmm gotta try Kurns if it is better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenoah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just wanted to chime in here.  I went to Kurn's Tower last night and lvl'd from 10-14 in the span of an hour or two.  It was unbelieveable! I have a lvl 17 DE SK that has been thru PC and never lvl'd as fast as my Shaman. And no crudding in the tower!  It really helped that we had a good group with a great tank.  He was pulling left and right nonstop!   And the majority of the time we were in the main level too.<br />
<br />
The only thing I don't like is that you don't have a map for the tower.  It's pretty easy to find your way around but when you're SoW'n throughout the place trying to keep up with the lead it can get confusing  :(</div></div><hr />
