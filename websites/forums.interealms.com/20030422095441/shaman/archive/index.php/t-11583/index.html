<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Krupp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Glad to have the Crucible up and running! Sad to see my four year old moniker (and 3 year old email address) lost in the shuffle. Thought I'd post this in case some other of my brothers or sisters have run into the same problem. Any suggestions Sunmoon (when all the post crash hubbub has settled a bit!) ? <br />

Are you sure your account is gone Krup?<br />

The passwords were all reset during the upgrade, so it could just be that you have to request a new password ot get back your old account.</div></div><hr />

Same thing happened to me Krup, cant login with millman, cant reset password, says invalid email. I sent a note to one of the mods, I thought perhaps my french bashing got me booted, but think there is a problem with some user ids.<br />
