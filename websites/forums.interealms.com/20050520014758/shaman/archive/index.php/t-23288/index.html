<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm trying to compile a short list of the Shaman spells for GoD, where they drop, and what level of force is needed to obtain them.<br />
<br />
Here's what I have so far from combining Allakhazam's Taelosian Geomancy Stones (GoD spells) (&quot;http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2849&quot;) and Chaos Runes (Ancient GoD Spells) (&quot;http://www.allakhazam.com/db/quest.html?quest=2866&quot;) quests.<br />
 <br />
Any feedback would be appreciated.<br />
(and if a Shaman shortlist has already been compiled please disregard and post a link to it.)<br />

<br />
Shaman:<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Yiktu = Balance of the Nihil<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Eril = Daluda's Mending<br />
Taelosian Geomancy Stone Jelki = Breath of Trushar<br />
<br />
In my experience the Jelki stone seems to be the most common in kod'taz and ikkinz. Drops in the ikkinz raids off some of the named and single group stuff is both zones. Yiktu seems to be the second most common dropping of the signle group stuff in both zones. Eril seems to be the rarest but definitely can drop off the single group named in kod'taz. Just got one last night on our way to ikkinz 1 actually.<br />
<br />
Also vxed is an instanced zone that only allows one group sho charvoon definitely isn't a raid mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">First off, Balance of the Nihil is a magic slow that adds disease counters, not a disease slow. As a few others said, Chavoor is a 1 group mob, because Vxed is instanced and can only take 6 people at a time.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm not 100% positive because we have just got up to Uqua level, but I think the raid window is only 54 people, not 72 as you have listed.<br />
<br />
Just a few changes I saw =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yeah, Uqua is 54 raid limit.  Also, I got my balance from Sludge Eating Fly and my Daluda from the Diseased Larva, which is the opposite of what you have.  Just need to switch the two spells around.  And, just like Tenjhai said, Balance is not a disease slow, it's a magic based slow with disease counters (it always amazes me how many times I've actually had to answer this question for people who think that it's a disease slow).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tyck,<br />
<br />
Great list, just what I was looking for.  Please make the corrections and see if it can be saved to the Medicine Cabinet.  I'm sure lots of folks like me would like to have this as a permanent reference.</div></div><hr />

Noooo ... Chavoor the Trickster is a one-group mob.<br />
<br />
Balance of the Nihil is NOT a disease-based slow.<br />

Also, Iqthinksa Karnkvi is easy as hell. Killed her with as little as 30, and the arbitors for cyno with the same #.</div></div><hr />

Yes, your group can quite probably Charm-kill much of this single group content in the Trials, especially in Vxed. There is a spot in Vxed where you can pull to 2 named PHs fairly easily, with little risk. The only real problem I see with your group is the lack of Snare, so add the Druid instead of another cleric, and you should be fine. Might take some practice, and you might die a bit, but in the end, you can farm a TON in Vxed and Sewers and get some EP level XP doing it.</div></div><hr />
