<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">hey im wondering something....everytime i go to the tables in fire, when i get to where the charm birds are, and i hug the right wall, i pass by a sort of circular formation with yellow mobs in it thats like right along the wall....they see invis so usually i make a hell run thru the middle conning everything i see and it takes a really long time...im wondering...if u know the circle thing im talking about with the see invis mobs in it...if i hug the wall past it will they see me? would make getting to tables ALOT easier for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im not sure of the circular formation you are talking about.  Doomfire mobs all can see thru invis.  They are all over castle 2.  You just have to avoid them and wait for them to path by before making a run into the castle.  Here's the route I take.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Solusek.Spirituous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">wow thanks larns that REALLY helps....by the way..the circular formation im talking about is the first pentagon thingy on the wall on the way....i guess it works..thanks tons!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Manson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The pentagon thingey is called a Gazebo.  Once you pass the birds, beware of roaming nameds in the courtyard.  Once you get to wall everything sees invis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dugok Grumblehawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I just got Plane of Fire flagged last night and I had a question about getting to the tables.  No matter where I run from, I just can't seem to get high enough to get over the first castle.  Am I tryin to get there the right way?  I mean, do you run with sow/levitate on and run over the first castle?<br />
<br />
If anyone has any tips that they could provide to get over the first castle I would really appreciate it.  I kinda wanted to try out tables this weekend not that I am finally Plane of Fire flagged. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>papiraul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Just go up high up the wall before the first castle with lev on.. just climb as far as you can up the north wall.<br />
Be sure to look up when you run towards the castlewall or you will miss it..</div></div><hr />
