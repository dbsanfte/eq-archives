<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok, everyone is wining again about how bad the upcoming expansion is going to be and how they are not going to buy it.  Now, honestly, who out here has actually skipped an expansion?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not me and I preordered OoW the first time too lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I own 7 of 7 on 3 accounts.  I only ordered 2 copies of OoW though - that'll show 'em!  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I stopped just before GoD and I sincerely thank everyone in the Crucible for that.  I held off buying GoD and don't regret it.  Sure the links shown are to die for, but I'm in a smaller guild that raids, but not the high-end content so I'd never have a real chance to get the &quot;good&quot; stuff.  As for OoW, just like with GoD, I'll wait and see what the feedback is.  Chances are I'll break down and buy it just for the increase in levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">GOD is not as bad an expansion as I thought it would be, and my guild does no raiding in that kind of content (yet, lol). I don't use it as much as I thought I would -- same with LOY -- but it's given me a couple nice things. OOW ... I'll wait a bit and see what the feedback is ... but more than likely I'll break down and purchase it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I bought G.O.D. when it first came out.  Could've held off six months while I caught up with LoY and LDON.<br />
<br />
I sporadically visit that expansion now that I've maxxed LDON (charm).  But as somebody much wiser than me once said:<br />
<br />
&quot;There is always something to do in EQ.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Exes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i bought GOD when i was around level 30, and i still have used any of it yet, should of bought it when i get a higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">6/7 and i'll NOT buy OoW</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I broke down and bought GoD just so I could buy canni II on the big brown boat when I hit 39.  Sad, but that's probably all I'll use it for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">When GoD was released I had 2 accounts, and only bought GoD for the one Thor is on.  I have since transfered the characters I wanted to keep and shut down the second account.  At this point I dont plan on buying any more expansions untill I head that the good outweighs the bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">7/7, and this is the 1st time I have considered not buying an expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am an addict...<br />
<br />
I will get Omens as well simply because I am weak. But that doesnt preclude my right to bitch, complain, and moan in no certain order about how unhappy I am about it.<br />
<br />
For the cost EQ is the best fun factor for the money involved. I mean I spent more last night on three measly games of bowling than a months supply of EQ for two accounts. <br />
<br />
(Sigh)<br />
<br />
I know the bastards don't care but would having my respect and a smile on my face be worth more than simply my money...<br />
<br />

Oh yeah... Who am I kidding.<br />

Hehe 7 of 7 on 7 accounts, may need another account for 8 of 8 on 8. Hmm what am I gonna level next? :)<br />
<br />
That being said only doing OoW for 70 and the spellgem (boxing makes it doubly worth it).<br />

Those bastards!  Me too, prolly, but I plan to hold out as long as possible, since I've barely touched GoD yet.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, 7/7 here, just one account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>haruuq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">7 of 7 and even though guild isn't raiding GoD (yet), i've actually been out there enough to thoroughly enjoy it and be glad i got it. aside from the aa, the visuals there are great, and there are little throw ins--like the any slot, +20 hp augs that drop in the Lost Souls camp from time to time (for those who don't know, Lost Souls camp is common place for ppl to attempt to farm the 2 very rare neck drops in GoD, so the hp augs are a side bonus), that make me enjoy it a lot. additionally, the continuation of instanced content makes me happy, and the trials were definitely a good idea. <br />
<br />
that said, it's also fun having the option to train in the critical affliction aa, and others from the GoD expansion.<br />
<br />
can't wait to see OoW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Got 6 accts here, 7 of 7 on 2, 6 of 7 on 2, and 5 of 7 on 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I only have 6 of 7 expansions.  Gates of Discord didn't have anything for me then, and it still doesn't.  I may buy OoW if I am still playing EQ then, but the only way I am going to have Gates of Discord is if it is free.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually  now it says i own 6 of 8......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Really for the price - you can't go wrong.<br />
<br />
$30.00?<br />
<br />
Shoot, I spend that much in less than an evening. I mean between the cover charge, the dollar bills on the third dance, the obligatory lap dance...<br />
<br />
Oh wait...was I posting out loud again?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I bought GoD for both accounts, and Seremont's account has a high toon of 58... if I'd known what GoD was, I would never have got it for that account. For that matter, my best computer has troubles there, so I'm not sure any of my accounts would own it in hindsight.  OOW or whatever is completely out of the question.<br />
<br />
SoE gets too much of my money already.  How about fixing the current expansions.  Sure they said the were, but I'm not convinced.<br />
<br />
IMHO<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">never bought LoY , i think it was a waste at 65.<br />
<br />
not going to buy GoD as a shaman, i think it is a waste.<br />
<br />
just about ready to cash in the chips and call it game over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was forced into buying GoD by my girlfriend... I have already warned her that no amount of sexual pressure will make me purchase OoW.  EQ dies to me the same day that Quarm does... and I don't need OoW for that.</div></div><hr />

Only $30 for cover charge, dollars on the dance and lap dance? Wow thats cheap. Here that would be like $60 or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Lemy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I own all the expansions, but at this point Im seriously wanting my money back for that piece o crap GoD.  At this point Im not planning on getting OoW.  When it comes out I'll prolly switch mains and start playing my rogue full time.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">7/7 on beastlord account<br />
6/7 on shamans<br />
<br />
I was cheesed off enough buying 1 copy. I am planing on leveling some alts or doing AA.. so no presure for me to get to 70 yet untill I hear reviews.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">i have all and will prolly buy Oow, too.<br />
honestly, what are 30$ anyway for a game i play rather often? i spend more on a good evening with friends when we go out drinking, so i have more from the 30 bucks i spend on everquest than only a big head on the next day :)<br />
<br />
and as being in a raiding guild, there wouldn't be an option anyway, too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">although i now own 7 of 7 , i only bought GoD a week ago, cos my guild is now raiding it, but from what i have seen of the expansion so far if just one big zone to get some more loot in or rather one big timesink to get to another nice end loot zone?  sound like you heard it before?<br />
<br />
the design is bad, POP (apart from all the flags) is nicer. GoD  looks cobbled together, and feels rushed. As such the &quot;challenge&quot; is just harder hitting mobs, ae`s and traps. And at the bottom line its is amazingly boring. Despite soe popular belief that short fight are the thing, funnily killing 1 mob after another with very little to do is boring, i had much more fun (once got mages in place) in VT with those huge long fights, and Emp fight in sraa was great (although i think they maybe should have given mobs 4 to 6 loots for these). What they should have done isnt make fight shorter but ramped up the exp it would have given the same effect as it is all about speed of exp gain, and not really speed of fights.<br />
<br />
but the current soe devs using thier own ideas misunderstood speed of exp gain to mean we need faster fights which inturn makes exp gain faster rather than just increase exp given by longer fights to give the same effect.<br />
 And that is the problem the soe devs have theor own ideas and arnt really listening to the game players.<br />
<br />
if it is more of the same for OOW it wont just be the hard core raiders leaving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gaesekki</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I own them all and I have preordered Omens.  I still find EQ enjoyable and GoD has made it an added challenge when not raiding (I think I am one of the minority that loves this expansion).  I spend most (if not all) of me non-raid time in GoD now....</div></div><hr />
