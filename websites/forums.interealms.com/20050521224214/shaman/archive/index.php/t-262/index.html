<br />
Can't blame a guy for flaming FoH, though.<br />
<br />
While I do agree with FoH that the focus items do throw the game out of whack, I'm looking at FoH's latest update and comparing it to LoS's updates along a similar vein and thinking that at least Tig doesn't come across as a completely arrogant dip**** every time he posts. Tigole says, 'this is out of whack, this stupid, this isn't well put together' while on the other hand Animal Mother says, 'not that noobs like you will ever see this, but this is out of whack, and while you're too stupid to understand nooblet, this is stupid, and I understand that your mother dropped you on your head when you were a child so your guild licks balls, but this is clearly not well put together'.<br />
<br />
Makes it hard to have a whole lot of sympathy for any of 'em. Tigole on the other hand has mastered teh funney, so GG LoS.</div></div><hr />
