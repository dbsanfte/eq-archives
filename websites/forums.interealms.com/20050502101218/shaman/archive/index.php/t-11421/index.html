I cant speak for warriors but personally I would always rather have a shaman slowing than an enchanter.  Shaman generally stand up much better against mobs turning on them then robes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shamans can take a beat, Enchanters can't...<br />
<br />
Shamans are gods<br />
<br />
Shamans are the buff/debuff kings<br />
<br />
<br />
Myths never die.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The holy trinity doesn't exist anymore. Personally I hate having a warrior as ma, they can't hold aggro for anything. Wheartes a sk or palli can hold it non stop. Clerics are nice but after slow their not needed that badly and a druid with ch or even myself can keep up with healing even in places like guardians in pon or cy in pod. Enchanter is a nice addition but unless crowd control is sorely needed it's not a big deal.<br />
<br />
Holy trinity really doesn't exist anymore I just wish people would try different combinations of classes you'd be surprised what you can do.</div></div><hr />

Hmm all chanter are not n00bs wearring paper robes..<br />
The thing I hate the more in our guild debuffer channels is chanter with more hp than me...<br />
Actually I saw chanter still alive and slowing mobs / mezzing while the 4 shaman died on pull in a raid.<br />
for example..<br />
here is a chanter of my guild http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=46781<br />
and here is me http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=50140<br />
<br />
I have 100 hp and 200 ac more than this enchanter... 00ber !<br />
And no, AC means nothing when a mob quad rampage 2k each round.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sorry to make you feel worse, but with rune the chanter effectively has more hps than you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">The Holy Trinity is alive and well<br />

Paladin the father, Shaman the son and Rogue the holy ghost :)<br />

<br />
Sharp Ended Broken Lever (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=24771)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">An enchanter effectively has about 2.3k+ (depending on spells they have) more hps than they show due to Rune.<br />
<br />
{EDIT: Err, a 61+ Enchanter, that is :)}</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">If i'm reading the description of the effect on the &quot;sharp ended broken lever&quot; it only works on things with poison counters. As such it's a de-tashicide stick rather than helping with slow agro. It is damn easy to get though.<br />
<br />
The chanter rune AAXP is really nice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Here was the group in PoV inner last night for an hour or so. (while we couldn't find Clerics).<br />

Bard<br />
Warrior<br />
Rogue<br />
Monk<br />
Shaman<br />
Chanter<br />

I didn't have any trouble healing after slows, and I was 90+ mana at the end of most of the pulls.<br />

Don't you think a low aggro tash is useful for slowing ?</div></div><hr />
