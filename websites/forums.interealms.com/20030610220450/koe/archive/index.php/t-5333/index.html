<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've finally gotten the Silk Coldain Shawl!(number 5)<br />
<br />
Last night I got tailoring to 123 and couldnt wait any longer to try the combination :) So I equipped my newly purchased tailoring gizmo (the plus 5% thingy that tinkerers can make), said a little prayer, and hit that little click button.<br />
<br />
Cha CHING<br />
<br />
For those of you not familiar with this quest, i'll sum up the 5th part as best I can.<br />
<br />
Combining 5 crystalline threads(unstackable off of spiders in velks)<br />
will get a crystalline fiber<br />
<br />
three fibers plus a glowing wurm bile from wurms in GD makes a glowing silk piece.<br />
<br />
five glowing silk pieces plus my 4th coldain shawl yields the 5th shawl.<br />
<br />
so basically i need 75 crystalline threads (I actually needed 85 due to failures in combining them) And 5 wurm biles. Those wurm biles took me 4 days of camping 3-5 hours for. Big thanks to Seran for helping me get those last two and thanks to vaemas for the first two :)<br />
<br />
After that it's all a matter of getting tailoring up to and past the trivial of 115 that the final combination requires. If you fail, you get to do allllll that work all over again. You do get shawl 4 back, but you have another 75 threads to get and 5 more wurm biles... not exactly a fun position to be in. <br />
<br />
Well I got lucky so now I have this masterpiece gracing my shoulders :)<br />
<br />
Silk Coldain Prayer Shawl: +5 AC +5 Wis +5 Int +5 Cha +5 Save vs Fire +5 Save vs Cold<br />
<br />
WHEEEEEEEEEE!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Big grats on your shawl!  :)<br />
<br />
I'm at 50 tailoring.  I am seriously considering hitting combine (have had the 5 sheets for a few months now) because I cannot stomache the BS that is tailoring.  Spending hours in EK gathering pelts to raise your skill by 2-5 points is not my idea of fun.  :)  I don't know how you made it.  If only a vendor sold those pelts . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Congrats Wynnie!<br />
<br />
<br />
That's three more shawls than I managed before giving up.  What a pain in the rear quest.  :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aaeamdar, the fastest way to raise skill is silks.  First I spent time in EK around the bottom of the ramp to highpass hunting the spiders that roam there.  They can drop up to 5 silks at once.  Or you can just buy a ton of them in nfree if you're lucky :)  After I trivialled out silks (before going to wus) I switched to crystalline silk.  These can be found in abundance in crystal caverns down by the Queen room.  I've spent a few nights there collecting crystalline silks.  In order to gain more skill, however, I need to go back to regular silks and making Wus armor.  This stuff is a pain in the wazoo because it requires 4 heady kiolas for every attempt as well as a vial of crystallized mana from an enchanter.  Ugh ugh ugh :)  Good luck! (and hold off on that combine, I know i'd have quit the quest at 4 had i failed that combination.  Those wurms suxx0r!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Timbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Congrats Wynnie - that's quite an achievement!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Aaemdar and any who need I have a Grandmaster smith with tons of Int raising stuff on him.  Most any class/race can use.  With that int stuff my tailoring and pottery went up fast as well as smithing.  Let me know in game or PM if you need to borrow some gear.  I think total int raised on my all/all gear is like 45</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thank you much for the offer, Willow.  My problem with tailoring isn't the skill increases on attempt.  I have a 255 Wisdom.  The problem is that I can't buy the materials off a vendor, so they take forever to get.  I'd happily blow plat to increase my skill, I just can't take the camping greens for hours to get the materials.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Willowwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I hear ya but at least you have track right :D.  I couldn't imagine trying to gather without track.  Did Verant change how you increase in skill from straight int to the highest stat you have?  Never knew if they did that.  Would greatly help any troll or ogre trying to say get up to grandmaster in smithing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Most trade skills work off of the higher between Int and Wis.  Smithing works of STR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lorilea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">grats Wynnie !! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
/cheer</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gratz Wynnie...:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Hoarmurath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Gratz Wynnie!<br />
<br />
I am working on my *second* attempt at the 5th shawl...failed my first attempt with a 109 tailoring.  What can I say, I was getting jumpy...learned my lesson.  Now you get to start on your 6th shawl!  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Klydon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Wee! Congrats Wynnie..<br />
<br />
I also completed the 5th shawl, but have not really started working on the ingredients for 6 yet.. <br />
<br />
Give me a yell when you are ready to do some gathering of materials and maybe we can go do this together..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Adelrune Argenti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Grats. I was impatient with tailoring when I did my 5th shawl. I actually tried and succeeded at a 92 skill. Even tried the 6th shawl since I had all the pieces and failed. At that point, I was done with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Barain ni Melangell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Congo Rats(tm)<br />
<br />
I have most of the parts for the 6th...but I have not finished the 5th...just cant stumach the riff raff that has taken over in Velks so that I can get the rest of the threads I need....:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Rowandil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Grats Wynnie! It's definitely a long a painful quest. I have the 7th one and had gotten my tailoring up to 148 before the attempt. After the 5th one I figured that it was easier to collect the components then to practice tailoring more. I always made sure to get enlightenment and some shammy dex buffs before practicing tailoring at the higher levels or before hitting combine. The tinkered tailoring item didn't exist when I did the shawls but I'm sure that helps too. Good luck with the next one!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Wynnie Walaryn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Wow! Someone who has the seventh!<br />
<br />
*is wery impressed*<br />
<br />
I'll have to look you up in game some time and pester you about hints and suggestions on making 6 and 7 easier :)</div></div><hr />
