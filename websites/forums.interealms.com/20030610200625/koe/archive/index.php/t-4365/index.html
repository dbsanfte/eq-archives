<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Windigo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I am in kitty town now and plan on exploring it this evening some more when I get home from work.  If anyone has a new Vah Shir that they would like to transfer items to just give me a tell and meet me there or Hollowshade and I'll be happy to do some transfers to equip your chars.<br />
<br />
I also plan on making a beastmaster this weekend and would like him tagged if any officers are planning on being in the area.  I can play him without the tag but it would be kinda lonely until I got high enough to port out to the old world :(</div></div><hr />
