<br />
I 'retired' in April of 2003 and didn't sign in again (and cancelled billing) until 16-18 months later - September 2004.  Character was still there, buffs still on him, everything just as I left it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I believe the official line from SoE is 6 months.  However, from my experience that number is complete BS. Even SoE doesn't actually say &quot;we will delete your character after 6 months,&quot; instead they say something like &quot;w reserve the right to delete your character.&quot;  I've known people who quit the game and came back years later to find their characters still there.<br />
<br />
When you think about it, accounts really take up a negligible amount of space (10 megs or less I'm sure); even one with 8 level 70s on multiple servers will cost SoE less than a penny a month (I imagine) to keep in storage.  And the more space the account takes up, the more likely someone is to reactivate it (I mean, would you waste an account with 8 level 70s on it?).  So if SoE actually deleted characters, they'd save themselves a few pennies a year per account, but they'd miss out on the $15 a month from anyone who would have rejoined EQ, but didn't after discovering their character was gone.<br />
<br />
The main reason for the 6 months as I see it is A) they need to ensure that they have the right to clean up their servers; if there is an account with a single level 30 that hasn't been active since Kunark, they may actually want to delete it, B) they make more money by letting that threat hang out there.  I have a friend who quit EQ back when we were in to SWG, but he continued paying for his account, even though he also knew people who had come back after over a year of inactivity, because he wanted to be absolutely sure his character wasn't deleted.  IMHO it's kind of diabolical: SoE can make people pay for a game they don't even use, just by (baselessly) threatening to delete their characters.<br />
<br />
If cost was really their main concern, they could easilly have a lifeline account level, where you pay 1$ for insurance that your char would stay on the server.  But to make that work they'd need 15 times as many people as my friend, so of couse they don't have such a service.  So I'd say you have absolutely nothing to worry about, unless your account contains only one level 35 character, or unless EQ starts doing so poorly that they begin taking down servers or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah the buffs thing is funny. I still have a level 4 mage with KEI and hand of virtue cause Ive never played him :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I seriously doubt they ever really erase them. I had a RL friend that stopped playing shortly before Luclin came out and he recently logged back in with his toon exactly as it was nearly 3 years ago, my gimpy level 51 buffs on it and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silverfawx Bertie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What about if you delete your toon? How long before you cannnot request it to be undeleted?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">What about if you delete your toon? How long before you cannnot request it to be undeleted?<br />
I would like an answer to that too if anyone can say. I have a level 51 alt I might like undeleted if possible, not my main but stilll....<br />
<br />
It's a few months ago though when I did it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A year or so ago I logged into my very first EQ account during a free month period.  This account was from when EQ first came out which I quit like a month later because the game wasn't very fun to me back then.  All of the characters and equipment and buffs were right where I left them.  I think this is a testament to the &quot;forever but they might some day&quot; statement being a fact.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">deleted toons need to be handled asap, they need to be restored before the TEMPORARY files with that info are lost.<br />
<br />
as in as little as a week wouldnt surprise me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm pretty sure you have over a week, just because there is this overly dramatic enchanter in one of our server's uberguilds who deletes her char whenever she percieves the slightest offense to the enchanter class.  I have friends in her guild, and they've told me that she has gotten her character back after deleting it and not logging on for awhile, pretty sure it was for more than a week.  But I wouldn't expect they keep backups for too much longer than that, and unless you have serious mental issues like this chanter I wouldn't delete your character at all unless you are 105% certain you will never want 'em back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">VI/Sony has made it incredibly hard to quit this game even if you delete your characters. Here's a little story about what happened to me with this game and with DAoC.<br />
<br />
I started my shaman in March 2000. I played until somewhere in 2001 before SoL was scheduled to be released -- the exact date is kind of fuzzy. At that time I was halfway through 45th level when I quit coldturkey. I deleted my shaman and a few other alts and cancelled my account, uninstalled EQ and threw my CDs away. I thought for sure I'd never return to the game ever again. I heard about DAoC and bought that game when it came out in October 2001. I played DAoC until June 2002 and cancelled it but didn't delete my characters. <br />
<br />
Fast forward to September 2002 when I made the mistake of reading these boards which gave me the itch to play again.  Even though I quit cold turkey the first time there was one thing I did remember and that was my Station account name and password. I sent an email to support asking  if I could get my characters restored but oddly I never got a response. I figured what the hell, if I have to start over again who cares.  So I bought the CDs , installed EQ and all the expansions. To my utter amazement when I reinstated my account my 45 shaman was still there. Still wearing uber leather mixed with some totemic and a few pieces of JBB and even a few buffs on him lol. <br />
<br />
I then played him up to 65 and quit again in late 2003 where I picked up DAoC again and where I found my characters were still intact since I quit that game in 2002. Played DAoC till early 2004 and quit that game again since they ruined it with ToA and NF.<br />
<br />
You can say all you want about Verant/Sony and Mythic Entertainment but one thing they did right was keeping your old characters around because they knew you'd get that itch to come back to the game again someday. I've been tempted to reinstate my EQ account but with WoW and EQ2 on the horizon I've held off until I try those games out first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I know that about every six months I get an email from Mythic for DAOC, and now from both EQ and SWG (usually coinciding with a release of a new expansion) stating that my characters are still there waiting for me to return, even though I've had DAOC cancelled for 2+ years now and at least 6 months cancelled on EQ.  I truely believe they would never actually delete the account because if I would never even consider unretiring if my old characters werent available to me.<br />
