<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gripp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Are there any more mobs around that are still DB to a 55 and dont aggro so i can whack the crap outta them for weapon skills without the risk of them beating me senseless?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">at 55 i was fighting in the armory and on dando boat in dulak.  i would let the mobs beat on me (because dog-dog can't tank worth beans) while my pet did damage and i sat on my drog casting.  then i would hit the mobs when they dropped below 20% and started walking away to get my weaps skills up.  if you offense is high, then you should skill up fairly fast.<br />
if you have a decent amount of ac and hps, you should be able to survive a beating with regen on.  if your defense is low because you didn't tank much, then your ac will be a bit low and you will not be able to take as much of a beating without constantly healing yourself.<br />
mobs start going lb at 56 here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get your DR up and go play in fungus grove or something.  Most of the mobs chain cast, so you can just melee/stoicism for a good long while.  Kill it about at about 20m, then med up for another one.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Make sure you keep dex as high as possible when working on weapon skills.  IoS, Dex and Rage do nicely.  With that combo my dex is maxxed at 255 which really seems to help.<br />
<br />
Now if I could just put the JBB  away and actually swing the weapon more often......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure whether be is LB to a level 55 but Erandi Nataasu, the Erudite SK who stands outside the entrance to the Warrens in Paineel, was DB to a 53 Shm. He is definitely LB to a level 56.<br />
<br />
He doubles for 20 points each hit (yes, only 20!), gives no faction hit for killing him and repops every 15 mins. Just buff yourself to the max (HoS, (or IoS + hp buff if you have it), Dex, Agi, Alacrity, Fury or Rage, Regrowth) and wade in. He has a 401 hp harm touch that he'll use after the first few hits but it is nothing you can't handle. Don't slow him! Using stoicism to heal yourself when required. If things go pear shaped, step backward into the Warrens.<br />
<br />
I got my offense and defense to 200 this way. I also got my piercing up from around 40 to 170 ish. I'd recommend any shaman around level 50 who does not have their melee skills maxed to spend some time here. I only wish I'd spent more time there to get my 1H Blunt and 2H Blunt up.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">One thing I'd like to add, though, is that I've found myself meleeing less and less as I've levelled. Even when I'm soloing, if I'm outdoors and on my mount, I'd rather leave autoattack off and get the mount's mana regen benefits than add my pitiful melee DPS. I like having the option to melee but remember that Shamans, despite their buffs, get no double attack, dual wield or damage bonus. We are not a melee class! Our best bet is to get a weapon with a large proc and max out our dex to help it proc. Consequently, I think getting defense 200 is far more important than offense or weapon skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you can get someone to let you into the PoI factory, the researcher doesn't attack back (he can riposte). hail him so he is facing a corner, then melee him in the back and go read a book.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Another alternative to get offense and weapon skill ups is to duel a high level pet class who has the Pet Discipline AA. Get them to use /pet hold and just beat on their pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Can you duel a player and get skill-ups? I leve my newbie ranger beat on me all night since my regen is more than his damage with the fast/low damage weapon I gave him, 0 skill-ups..guess that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I did the dogdog thing with my lowbie ranger and man, skill-ups came painfully slow.  Is there something where if there is a big level diff you won't get skill-ups?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yes u can dueal a db con player and get skill ups........certainly on defense anyway, have done that on an alt; didnt try offense.<br />
<br />
agil helps with def skillups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'm thinking that it doesn't work on offense.  My level 15 (yeah, why am I twink training a level 15) but anyway, ranger beat on me all night and got 0 skill-ups.  His 1hb is still like 3 or something.  So after about 8 hours of constant melee, got no skills.  I think it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">granted, i did this at lvl 65 but for anyone still wanting to max melee skills at that level i found Poi zone in to be the best place. pull a mob, slow it and start flailing your arms. Q yourself as needed. takes about 10 to 15 minutes to kill a mob but everytime you kill one expect to have gotten mucho skill ups. the closer you get to 200 the slower they occur. and tell people in /ooc what you are doing. the n00b melee like to KS you cause they think they are saving your life or something.<br />
<br />
another good place is Akheva zone in. there are more LB mobs though but rarely any trains or groups congesting it. plus you can get the required faction hits to do the Aten Essance neck quest thingy if your guild is enroute to VT or presently there.<br />
<br />
sry if this doesn't help you at lvl 55 but i felt like sharing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmmm, I have always read that it is not possible to get defense skillups dueling a player, but it IS possible to get them fighting his/her pet.  When you got defense skillups dueling, was it a pet class?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Researcher is cool, you need the factory flag.<br />
<br />
WARNING: The Researcher ripostes.  The Cartagrapher next to him is non-aggro, but will PWN your butt.  Found that out on my 52 Ranger after I moved the Researcher up a wall and couldn't target him.  Think the lowest hit was 600-something.</div></div><hr />
