<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just hit 24 and want to solo things so I can keep my defense up.  I'm a troll and don't have the luclin expansion.  I just spent what seemed like forever in the LOIO and am burnt out killing sarnaks.  This is my only character and I am not sure where to go.  I would like to get some good loot so I can afford my spells at 29.  I'm having fun playing the shaman because it seems like I survive pretty well unless someone else makes a mistake.  Is there anyplace else to go than back to LOIO?  I dread going back there again.  Thanks.</div></div><hr />

&quot;at&quot; is a preposition, and it's improper grammar to use it at the end of a sentence...<br />
<br />
it's just my &quot;thing&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Normally I'm not a RTFM (read the expletive deleted manual) type person, but whenever I see a &quot;where should I hunt&quot; question my RTFM tendencied really start to boil.  Check the forum called Hunting Grounds, level 20-30 (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/forumdisplay.php?s=&amp;forumid=17).  Also, check www.eqshaman.com, under the guides section, theres a nice little list of mobs/places to solo at various levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Boy you ask a question and you get yelled at.  If you would have read my post it says I don't have Luclin and that is where the link that was given me says to hunt at my level.  I don't know what your little letters mean because I don't really care to know what they mean.  If you don't want to respond to my question then just pass it by.  As far as &quot;at&quot; being grammatically incorrect I really couldn't give a bugs rear at.  It must be nice to be so brave  that you can talk to people without being kind.  If we were to meet face to face you would probably be the most courteous person in the world.  I guess maybe I won't be donating any money to this forum because I would hate to donate to something where I was treated like trash at.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There should be some stuff around your level to kill in uguk (upper guk) at 24, correct? Great exp in guk as well. <br />
<br />
The sarnak for for sure gets boring after a while. I belive the goblin ruins around the lake might also be blue at that level, might provide a little relief from the fort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 24 I ran into a rut as well, I had been hunting in LOIO since 19 and got very bored. And Luclin wasn't out then. Now that I have it I still don't hunt there, I use Luclin for the Bazaar and the Nexus (but that's another subject)<br />
Anyway back my original statement, to break up the monotony I went to the Giant fort in Warslik Woods and started crushing them at 24. I'd kill Forest Giant Greenwoods and Evergreens. I made some good money to and got me out of the boredom of LOIO. Being Iksar I didn't have many/if any banking options other than Cabilis so I stayed away from the &quot;Old World&quot; enitrely. I would switch between that and the Brutes near Dalnir's entrance. I did that until 26 and then went back to LOIO until 29. <br />
Then off to Fountier Mountains until 31, then I went to the Golra Iceberg in Timorous Deep until 34. That's when I established secondary residence in Velious. Been there pretty much ever since, taking time off to kill Hill Giants in Rathe when I need money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gnolls at the spires in SK, eventually move inside Split Paw.   FS weapons out the wazoo when you hunt in there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xalbus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Sol A. if you can get a group is fantastic exp at that level. I did 24, 25, 26, 27 and 28 in 2 days there with an insane monk and his cleric sidekick. Got me some Kobold Hide Boots (which I still use when soloing) a CGS, an obsidian bead loop (sold it) and sevel hundred plat We actually got multiples on most of this but I had to split it with the others and the drifters that came in and out of the group. Once you hit 29 kill Golras in TD cant beat that solo exp with a stick. plus they take some whacks at ya so you get defense skill too ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow!!!  Thanks alot guys.  That really opens up my options from having no idea to having a bunch.  I am going to go to Eqatlas and download the maps for the areas.  :D</div></div><hr />

That is a form of arrant pedantry up with which I shall not put!<br />
