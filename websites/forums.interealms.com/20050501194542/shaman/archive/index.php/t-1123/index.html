<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cappi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Maybe someone else has posted this already but I thought I should give a heads up. Verant being the sticklers they are for balancing have added a KOS troll NPC to the alchemy vendors in Grobb. <br />
<br />
This means that ogre shaman can no longer make sow potions in the old world. This NPC is named Gargh. He is blue at 53, runs at sow speed, and hits for a ton. This has pissed me off more than anything in awhile. <br />
<br />
Sorry just needed to vent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He's the guy young Troll Beast Lords can do quests with for some armor pieces. No clue why he's kos though :confused: .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well I talked to a friend. It appears they added a vendor with SoW components in Ogguk. So I am a bit more calm now. Still it's good to know just because he is in the direct path to the bank. <br />
<br />
Damn intolerant smellies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hey, well how do you think it's been for us Troll Shamans with Chef Dooga beating the poop out of us every time we get to close to her in Oggok? I say it's about time for some payback!<br />
<br />
Seriously, though, that's really harsh with the Grobb NPC being right in the path to the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Lagger</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I got killed by a skeleton in grobb once.  Went in to buy components and a skele standing there (shouldnt have even been there) decided it didnt like me and attacked, next thing I knew all the trolls were helping the skele.<br />
<br />
Also happened sitting outside of oggok, a zombie walked past, the ogres killed it, then both decided to smash me into the ground as well.<br />
<br />
When I petitioned for both cases I was told it was the way it was intended.<br />
<br />
Kinda funny in a way having the bouncers bezerker :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was probably one of the skels spawned by a newb Shaman quest, they hang around until the person who spawned them talks to them. They probably have a timer when they despawn too because I don't see them up all the time.<br />
<br />
EDIT: A little off-topic but that reminds me of when I got ganked by the guards in UO for picking up something I dropped on the floor in a shop. It wasn't bad enough to be gang ganked everytime you left town but now the guards did it too. That was my last day of the full week I played that awful game. I remember the PK's would drop a pile of gold or some spell components just outside of guard range and when the unsuspecting newb went to pick it up, wham, bam, thank you Mam, a dozen guys killed you and then looted your dye kit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I actually completed that skellies in the closet quest back in my youth and got an ac4 mana +15 doll. Woo F'n Hoo. Since then, I would occasionally make the butcher's skelly pop just to change the scenery (and laugh as I watch those ogres get aggroed), but it looks like they took that quest out of the game now. Can't jump start it no mo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wasn't it always like that?<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else but when I was a n00b Ogre Shaman and hunting in Innothule (pre-Luclin) I figured it'd be easier to buy spells in Grobb than walk ALL the way back to Oggok. So I went in to the vendor and had some crazy troll (Jokca) hit me for 336 and I died. Happened again when I went to get my corpse. Had to make a new troll and give him permission to drag it to the zone line  and pick it up there (big thanks to the Fear raid that told me about this!).<br />
<br />
So hasn't there always been a KoS troll in with the shaman vendors in Grobb?<br />

Evils are truly screwed when it comes to faction.  Not only does Verant decide to make you KOS in most of the towns, but in the 3 towns that you CAN go into you have to worry about faction.<br />
(only talking about the orignal continents).<br />
<br />
Speaking from the Ogre point of view:<br />
<br />
When I was very young, level 4 or 5, I was NOT KOS in Grobb, I was wandering all over the place checking it out.<br />
<br />
But look at some of the faction hits you get:<br />
<br />
Turn in Lizard Tails and Lizard Meat to the Ogre Shaman guild, and they mention that they are allied with the Greenbloods (Ogre ShadowKnights)...but you take faction hits AGAINST the Crakneks (Ogre Warriors).  Yes, you could theoretically tank your faction in your own city (right next to the bank, no less).<br />
<br />
<br />
And any quests you do for the Greenbloods give negative faction with both the DarkElf and Troll Shadowknights factions...Same goes for Warriors.  Quests for Crakneks give negative faction for IndigoBrotherhood (DarkElf Warriors) and the Bashers (Troll Warriors?), and of course the Greenbloods.<br />
<br />
So now I am KOS in the Troll SK guild area...which is coincedntally right next to the troll Shaman Guild.  I've gotten wacked by a damn troll there as well, Beeg.<br />
<br />
And I've gotten creamed by Dark Elves when I was wondering around in Nerkiak...The only place I can truly let my guard down is in Oggok.<br />
<br />
And lets not even start comparing OT vs FV over in Kunark.. GRRR   :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Aye, some o' the faction alliances are odd.  Nothin' like questing to make you KOS to somebody you need to have at least tolerate you... like your banker.<br />
<br />
Doing smithing in my home town (Halas) got a bit uncomfortable for a while.  Closest truly 'safe' town was High Pass or Erudin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually I was hoping they would make bouncer Hurd L60 as well so that with the revamp to CT we could hear the Hurd to CT! shouts all over again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I always hated porting a newbie char into N. Karana, then get attacked by a bear or wolf..then the stupid druids attack you.<br />
<br />
I don't recall druids doing that at any other circle.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">When I was first figuring out how to buy sow potion herbs in Grobb, I thought I  had it down, when I walked too close to Jokta and got the living crap beaten out of me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guess being a Barb has some advantages afterall :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Anuenue</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Its not much easier being a barb shammie in the quest department.  Theres only a couple of quests you can do in Halas and the good ones CAN make you KOS to the banker.  So when you stuck in Kunark and you need to train, you run to the bank in FV and get money, etc, buy a port to NK and run to Halas because you can't go the bank in your own home town!  And if you want to do cultural smithing (no need now, but at the time) you can forget it, you can't put the stuff in the bank.<br />
<br />
There was good money to be made doing the Langseax quest.  Especially with gate and sow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Cappi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The quests for halas no longer make you kos to the banker so thats fixed. As for the npc trolls. The shaman have always been kos but never attacked because they were mechants. The new npc is a bl quest guy, since he isnt a merchant he does attack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Just last weekend I stoped by Grobb to do a bit of banking on the way through since it was closer than Oggok for the first time in many moons, got punked by the troll. Big nasty suprise that. Knocked me out of lvl 36 back to 35, grrrrrrr. Everlovin Jocka ran over to get her licks in too before I fell. Ran back to Grobb and figured I'd find out where this punk was located before I got the corpse back, snuck up to Carver square and started lookin for ol Gargh from the tunnel, didn't take long at all to figure out which one it was, he agroed me from all the way in the tunnel, bamm, another Tuga corpse. Next time I just went ahead and invised and drug the corpse out and left, I know where I'm not wanted. That does suck prety bad though, at least there's two paths to the bank in Oggok for the Trollies, without invis Ogre Shamen have no access to the bank or Soul Binder in Grobb, that would have to suck prety bad to have to beg a bind to hunt froggies at low levels again and not be able to bank at all. I clearly remember learning the hard way about the skelleton standing next to Carver and was glad to see that quest go away. Jocka's never been a problem for this version of Tuga, since I made shure not to do any anti Grobb quests as a youngun growing up, as long as I didn't hail her I could sit and med next to her with no problem. Sigh, ya got to love Verant. :)</div></div><hr />
