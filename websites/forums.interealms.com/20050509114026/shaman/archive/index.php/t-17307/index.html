<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I'm one of those shammies that's decided to hold off on aa's until lvl 65 (except for run3/Metab3).  I'm now lvl 64 and I find I'm having a very tough time managing my mana.  <br />
<br />
What I want to know is will Cann5 help me aleviate this problem or is there something wrong with my gear?  I hate to say this but is my wisdom actually too low?  <br />
(Magelo:  Bamana (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=80631 ) )<br />
<br />
I have torpor and I have saved up what I *think* is enough pp for Q.  I mainly do single xp or LDoN groups but I also raid about once or twice a week.  I do better with my mana on raids but I still find I'm running lower than I used to at lvl 60.  (I quit the game for about a year after raiding for a good bit at lvl 60 pre-pop.  I wasn't having much in the way of mana problems then, but I seem to be having a good deal of trouble now for some reason and my spell lineup hasn't changed all *that* much really on raids since I have no Malos/F07.)  <br />
<br />
I guess what I want to know is CannV really the &quot;magic bullet&quot; people make it out to be?  This cann4 mashing at 64 is slowly driving me insane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Banana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">CanV is the best aa we have, period. In 3sec you gain about 1200m and you can do that every 3 minutes. I got it at 62 and I am glad I did, made leveling so much easier.<br />

Yes, Canni5 is the magic bullet. :cool: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It's a huge boost to your mana regen capabilities.  Every 3 minutes, you can get back 1066 mana, which you generally use 200 of to heal back up, so you're looking at 866 mana every 30 ticks, which is almost FT29.  Not too shabby. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bamana,<br />
<br />
I think you need to provide more information regarding when you are running out of mana. Are you solo'ing? Are you running out in groups? Indoors? Outdoors?<br />
<br />
I have less base hp than you and wiz only slightly higher but I rarely run low on mana. I am constantly casting/canni'ing but if I know I am ready to have to rebuff the group I might hold off for a minute or two to make sure I am close to fm when a key buff comes up.<br />
<br />
Canni V is really helpful and I use it pretty much whenever it pops but it isn't a magic bullet if you aren't comfortable with mana management beforehand.<br />
<br />
If you are outdoors a lot get a horse or drogma asap. That will do wonders for your mana. I presume you are using kei where possible. That will help you. To answer your question in short I think that you will only have the right balance between wisdom/hp when you don't really care if kei/tranq/voq drops as you don't need it. Sounds lame but there should come a time.<br />
<br />
You don't have any mana preservation items which also help. Look into getting one of those and see how that improves your mana.<br />
<br />
Are you grouping with good players? If you are finding yourself constantly healing etc. you will notice the difference than if you are patching while buffing/slowing/dd'ing.<br />
<br />
My points in short:<br />
1) Horse/drogma<br />
2) Mana preservation item<br />
3) Outline of the places you are falling short on mana to help dig deeper into this area.<br />
<br />
The only real difference in base stats we have is that I have less hp add ons and a much higher stamina.<br />
<br />
BTW: Canni V really is a great aa and I highly recommend getting it asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Cann5 is fantastic! Just be sure you have a few HPs more than it eats or you will get low HP agro. It definitely makes life easier and relieves the canni dance tedium. I recommend all shaman get it as soon as they can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cann5 will make the biggest difference to your mana mgmt.  It just rules.  Nothing wrong with your gear.  After that, working on SCM/SCR/SCRM will help a lot too.  Cheaper, longer lasting buffs help a lot.  That and some FT if you can find it will make your mana much easier to manage.  <br />
<br />
Increasing your wisdom and mana pool, although helpful, will just make it take even longer to regen it back up.  I try to stay just high enough on wis that I max out with chanter buffs.  Its not often that mana pool size is an issue for me, I only go oom when solo buffing raids, chain nuking etc. <br />
<br />
Mana Pres IV is a great focus to get, but kinda hard to come by, as ornate boots are extremely rare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got canni 5 at lvl 59, and even using only Stocism to heal myself back it was amazing.  After mob was slowed, it was chain nuking for me.  So I agree with the others.  Canni 5 &gt; all, get it asap and you wont regret it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Cann5 is the best AA we get, no question.  That and Q/torpor make an incredible combo that in groups or raids allow us to use our mana inefficient spells with great frequency.  In soloing it's more touch and go as it can be dangerous to cann too low.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am one of those twisted people who is in no hurry to get to '65'...<br />
<br />
I see so many people running around who are higher level than me and who, in my opinion, can barely play there class, its ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Anyone can be twinked up, PL'd in a few days to level 65, it really isnt any kind of accomplishment in my opinion.<br />
<br />
Anyways...yes Canni 5 is great...SCM3 is great...SCRM works wonders...frankly, right now my shaman is lvl 60, and has about 70 aa's and he never runs out of mana...it's just not an issue...if I get KEI..then I just canni less or nuke more...but I don't need KEI...<br />
<br />
Unless your in a guild that absolutely needs everyone to be level 65...take a break...get a few AA's...they really do help<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">At 62 Cann5 is amazing.  Probably amazing at any level, but it changed my life when I got it.  So glad I got it early.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Bamana DeMoro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">To answer a few questions:  <br />
<br />
I've been mostly having the difficulty in LDoN groups, using Torrent/Tears to dish out some decent DPS.  (I'm 3 adventures away from Bane so I look forward to that spell to help with doing some damage.)  <br />
<br />
I realize those can get mana intensive, so I try to only use them within reason.  Is there a more efficient way to deal out the DPS?  <br />
<br />
Soloing I'm largely having trouble because I lack the 60+ Dots.  I realize that and I'm doing my best to rectify that situation.  <br />
<br />
Raiding I tend to be either the only shaman or one of the few shamen on raids so it's obvious where my mana is going to, it just seems like it used to be easier to manage.  (Although I admit that was a year ago and my memory may be a bit fuzzy as far as how easy mana used to be to manage.)  <br />
<br />
Thank you all for your advice and comments.  I'm thinking it might have been less frustrating to get CannV earlier, but I'm so close to 65 now I might as well tough it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">canni5 is game altering; its the one thing that is definitely as good as everyone says it is.  <br />
<br />
Rains cost a considerable amount of mana if you chain them, and that would be my guess on your mana issues.  Also, just look at the mana cost on your spells now..<br />
<br />
The other issue is our most efficient way of doing damage (DoTs) dont last full duration in most situations, and this hurts us the most in terms of mana usage.<br />
<br />
When i do LDON i usually use the 61 psn nuke (spear of torment).  With ornate gloves the mana cost is comparable to velium strike and the cast time is MUCH less.  If i'm using too much mana i'll switch to velium strike to limit what i can do in a certain period of time, and that usually helps me save mana.  The other thing i tend to do is alternate damage dealing rounds (i.e. i nuke one mob down and next mob i'm in recovery mode--canni'ing down).  It ups my efficiency rate because i'm never full hp or full mana, and it saves my sanity from trying to nuke/dot/rain/etc down every single mob.  The downside to this method is sometimes the puller doesnt realize what i'm doing and they run out and grab a new mob and current mob will be at ~20% &gt;&lt; so then i'm forced to nuke it down.<br />
<br />
Its also dependant on your buffs.  If you have a druid/chanter/bst/bard in your group you're probably having trouble spending your mana, but if you just have a druid or a bst or chanter or bard, then you're going to have to compromise on how much mana you can use per mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think I'd worry much less about DPS in LDoN groups as a Shaman. I think of myself as reverse DPS, I keep the mobs slowed which means the melees take less damage which means the cleric doesn't go low on mana and you can keep pulling non-stop. Also on the inevitable over pull, no one is going to die when all the adds are slowed. I don't have Canni 5 yet, so I rely on KEI. I find that I can slow/haste and throw in nukes and even dots from time to time, I just know when the next round of haste is coming I need to conserve my mana. Just a matter of play style really, no one is going to have enough mana no matter what combination of equipment/AA's if they use more mana than they can possibly replenish.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Heya -<br />
<br />
I am not at all suprised that you are having mana difficulties. I think you will need to work on the following to get your mana to the point where you have a ton extra:<br />
<br />
1) Canni5<br />
2) Spell Casting Mastery 3<br />
3) A Mana Preservation item<br />
4) Level 65 (fewer resists will save you a lot of mana)<br />
5) SCRM (to prevent having to redo buffs mid-adventure)<br />
6) Flowing Thought Gear<br />
<br />
For the immediate short term, I would suggest that you grab an obulus death shroud or similar (if you can't afford a mana preservation 4 item). Mana Preservation 3 will work on Turgur's and Malo, which are probably where most of your mana goes. Since you are already 64, you may want to just stick it out and get 65 before you work on aaxp.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of Shamans have a macho attitude about our mana regen once they have Canni5 - but I am a big believer in getting the aaxp, focus effects, and flowing thought needed to really live up to the Shaman's reputation of having the best mana regen in EQ. Just try casting Malosinia, Turgur's, Bane, and Velium Strike on every single mob in a hard adventure while keeping Ferine Avatar on every melee and pet - you will rapidly discover that we have great use for every bit of mana regen we can possibly get.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My low mana situations tend to last less than 15 seconds...  You're right in thinking that canni5 is the first in a long line of AA's that completely change your rate of mana spending.  The other ones mentioned here (SCRM and SCM, most notably) round things off nicely.  The rest?  They're bonuses.  But I want to point out that with zero healing AA's, FT1 (solstice earring, of course), and zero focus items -- I am frequently the slower and prime healer for my LDoN groups, and do very very well.  <br />
<br />
Get canni5, get a couple other big AAs, and those problems will disappear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Slurm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Canni 5 will help. A lot.<br />
<br />
But its really just the first milestone.  MC3 is the same as FT3... and is a prereq for canni 5.  It helps a bit.<br />
<br />
SCM3 helps a lot too.. 10% savings on every spell you cast adds up.<br />
<br />
SCRM so you cast buffs less often helps a lot on raids, and in LDON... nothing like having to recast a group buff half way thru to suck your mana away.<br />
<br />
It really makes a difference.  As do focus items.  Its all about percentages, and how they add up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Canni 5 is like KEI x 2<br />
<br />
lots of time I don't have time/lazy to use canni4(many of you high level shaman will do same), so mana ususlly come from buff/song/ft/canni5; and Canni 5 = FT30 which is at lease 1/3 of your mana total regen, or 1/2+ without FT/song</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Get an Obulus Death Shroud for mana conservation and grab a KEI between now and Cann V.  You'll be OK.</div></div><hr />
