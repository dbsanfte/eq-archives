<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've noticed this for a while, but unsure if it's just my setup, or everybody's seeing this.  Go ahead and summon a pet (I'll wait... *snores*), now... sit, and look at it like it would be looking back at you, can you still see the tail moving around? Almost like the transparency is gone, but the model/textures were never told otherwise? (Basically, you can still see through it, despite the fact it doesn't look transparent anymore and looks solid now)<br />
<br />
If it's just a driver problem on my end and it works for everybody else, I'll play with it. If it's an EQ problem (there's a shock...), then I'll bug it, but if it's just my problem, I'll figure it out myself :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

I've never really cared for the whole transparency thing though, even though it is a spirit wolf.  I find it hard to tell where the mutt is if there are a few melee clustered around a mob; my pet gets kinda lost in the melee.</div></div><hr />
