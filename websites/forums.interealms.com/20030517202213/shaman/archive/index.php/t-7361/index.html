<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mulsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First post, even tho I have read this board for a year :-/.  Wednesday night, my guild will be heading up to fear to get some tears.  That's the objective, if the bosses are not up, we are going to raid somewhere else.  Anyway, I am wondering if it is possible to get two on a raid if all 3 golems are up.  There are two shammies needing the tears.  Secondly, how slowable are these guys.  I'm 55, (only halfway thro...not really gonna be able to push for 56) and the other shaman is 60.  But, he also has a 59 monk and we are looking a little lack in the melee dept for the break in.  My thought that maybe he could park the shaman and loot after.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's possible to get two tears from three golems. My guild has seen it happen. Fright and Terror both dropped tears, one went to MQ, one went to a friendly shaman.<br />
<br />
Since the broodling is a level 1 spawn, if he parks his shaman outside the portal, and you have cleared the way, you can hold off killing the broodling till he runs his shaman in and is ready to loot. Simple enough if you manage to keep your tanks from killing everything in sight :)<br />
<br />
Dunno about slowability, I was too low level to do slowing duty then. :) (Was 55, so the 60 shaman did the slowing :))</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 55, I think it unlikely that you will be able to slow the Golems at level 55 - I tried, I died.<br />
<br />
Basically, if the golems are slowable, it aint gonna stick without a level 60 casting malo, and then slowing. I am not sure that the golems are not actually immune to magic based slow. At level 55 you have zero chance<br />
<br />
I have been told that our disease based slow will stick, and using Insid Decay drops the disease resist, unresistable. I tried this last night, and I got aggro, and hence dead before I could stick the disease slow.<br />
<br />
Go with the 60 shaman.<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Is the tear part of the epic MQ able? <br />
<br />
Yes if held by a shaman who has completed epic himself.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kingwhip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Don't even try to slow the golems, you will just end up dead. If you do want to try it, don't bother with turgur's, go right for ID/PoI.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes, its quite common to see 2 tears drop in fact. I forget which 2 gols now, but 2 of the 3 gols will (have a chance?) to spawn the broodling, and the 3rd will never spawn him. Every time i have been, 2 broodlings have spawned, 1 off of each of the 2 golums that have a chance to spawn him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">2 tears drop per fear break.  Fright and Terror I believe are the ones who drop it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>rebul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">SK Epic fight that lowers TS faction? - Which fight? I remember I participated in the final SK epic fight at CoM against Lhranc or something but don't remember if there was a faction hit..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>IzahTP</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">My guild just finished clearing Fear earlier tonight.  Yes, two tears did drop.  They were off Fright and Terror.<br />
<br />
As for the slowability of the golems, I was only using Tirgir's, so didn't try PoI.  Yes, they did NOT like me after I tried to slow them.  They smacked me quickly. :p  I think they are not slowable by our normal slow.  Might be able to use the best Malo we have and that might work.  I might go again to Fear sometime and experiment w/the Malo line and PoI.<br />
<br />
Good luck to all you uber shammies!!<br />
