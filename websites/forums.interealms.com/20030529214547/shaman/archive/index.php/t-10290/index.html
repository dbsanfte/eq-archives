<br />
Are there good sites for grinding in PoV/PoS that the two of us can handle, or do we need to get a bigger group?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Desert in PoS is a good place to duo, but tbh, exp will be quicker if you can get a group in PoV.  I only duo when I am not on for long and me and my mate cant be arsed trying to get into groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">full groups are far superior to duos (unless you're grouped with someone that's charming mobs).  my xp/hour has been much higher in full groups than solo/duo ever since pop release</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">... And then there are days when you sit lfg for two hours.....<br />
<br />
I was extremely pissed off about that on Sunday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If your set on duo in PoV and/or PoS... I would suggest frogs in PoV they yield nice exp and are good for duo's.  Great PL place too!</div></div><hr />

Stealing from FC, are we?</div></div><hr />

  Don't think a group has beat what I can get from razors soloing yet.  Even with tougher mobs pulltime and spawn competition/limited spawn has really cut into group XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well, my wife and I got in a guild group doing desert trash in PoS, and the XP was AMAZING compared to PoN.  Looking forward to trying it again soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Good places to hunt in PoV:<br />
-Wasteland:  metallic liquid is a money item from there for tradeskillers.  it's where I go to solo by root-rotting golems and centipedes.  need a healer most likely.  lots of pull locations (stairs, right and left side of barracks, near the lever to Aerin'Dar, North East corner, etc...)<br />
-Cave:  razerfiends are another popular target to kill.  you might want a healer for here too.<br />
-Water's edge:  from the zone in, keep the zone wall on your right and stop before you get to the river.  the frogs and larvae there are relatively easy to kill, and you don't need a healer to do them besides just the shaman.  also it's close to the zone out.<br />
-random undead:  if you have a paladin with slay undead around, you might want to pull the undead skeletons from the ruins<br />
<br />
Good places to hunt in PoS (every camp in PoS will need a true healer from what I've experienced):<br />
-Bees:  Find the &quot;ewok village&quot; in the forest area of PoS.  The bugmen there mitigate slow, but they drops tradeskill items and sometimes some really good pieces of loot obtainable by a single group.  Every few days boss mob bees spawn too with even more loot (usually eth parches, but sometimes other stuff).  tied for most often camped section.<br />
-Coastal giants:  giants along the coast down a ways from the zone in.  they proc feign death and mitigate slows.<br />
-Desert giants:  giants in the desert section.  mitigate slows and proc a DD of some kind.  I've seen them drop a really good tradable mask with 8ac and 40hp and other stats (I gave mine to my monk)<br />
-Forest giants:  giants in the forest section.  mitigate slows and proc something I can't remember.<br />
-Frog cave:  big cave with the tornado in it.  lots of big frogs, with some smaller cleric frogs thrown in to annoy you with lots of cheals and gates.  :)  boss frog with some loot if you clear the frog cave 2? times in a row.  tied for most often camped section.<br />
-there's treants and other animals all over the place, but I seldom see anyone killing them.  very easy to get lots of adds.<br />
-there's an NPC at the far end of the forest section, in the diseased section of the forest.  if you follow his quest, he ports you into some section of the zone where you have to clear the area in 3 hours.  there's boss mobs in there.  I've heard of people xping in there.  bring evac, or you have to wait 3 hours for the quest to end to get out, or die and wait for corpse to go to GY.<br />
<br />
I like PoV's xp more than the xp in PoS.  I do like like PoS a lot though.  I like the very distinct sections of the zone.  Also, if you kill giants in PoS, you start working your way to getting your Bastion of Thunder flag, which is where the real xp and loot and spells come from for most people.  All of my rune spells have come from this zone, and same for my specs.  Any 3 random pickup groups in this zone can work together and take down the named giants for some nice loot, and the last quest pieces needed for BoT.  If you hunt only in PoV, you'll never get into BoT.  And if you get into BoT, you won't want to hunt in PoV or PoS, since the xp is even better in BoT.</div></div><hr />
