<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Maximillien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, i have been douing with a Monk from the start, hope these areas will still be of use.<br />
<br />
For starters i -=H A T E=- Overthere &amp; Dreadlands... I will not do that again.<br />
<br />
So, here are a few areas i found to be fun.<br />
<br />
I did 30-34 at the Giant fort in Frontier mountians (Booring but it got me my good spells) and a little of Netherbians Lair.<br />
<br />
34 - 36 i was outside of Cazic Thule - I cant say how much i LOVE this area! I got a Ravenscale coif and BP there and the exp flew! I would still be there if the monk wasn't getting tired of killing lizards! Not to mention the kind high levels that pass through and hand out a few good buffs :)<br />
<br />
36-37 We went to Paw to quest for some guantlets. i didnt much care for this area, but the exp and loot was good. just didnt like gnolls that charm! monk loved it though ;/<br />
<br />
Well, brings me to level 38 - 40+ (where i am now) went to Velious. Killed some Kodiaks in Great Divide, good experience, NO loot. Then headed to Crystal Caverns. Tenticals seem to give GREAT experience and loot is good too! Don't think i will be leaving this area for a while. Already got a Blacked robe, 2 bags, and some no drop 10 cha mug! Pretty good for one night exping.<br />
<br />
If i were to do it again, i would probably have skipped Frontier mountians and headed straight to Cazic Thule. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
