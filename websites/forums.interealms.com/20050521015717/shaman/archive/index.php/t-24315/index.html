Well guys , since im the class correspondent for the Shaman class I guess you all deserve too know a bit about the way I play EQ &quot;Level of content , Casual or hardcore , ect&quot;<br />
<br />
I have been playing Grimbear since roughly Kunark release . In that time I have managed 70 levels and 300 - 400 aa's &quot;Cant recall exact number right now&quot; . In short I play a lot of EQ , Its rare that a day goes by that I dont play . Typicly I would guess I get about 40hours in weekly on average .<br />
I dont consider myself &quot;Hard core&quot; I am in a family guild on the Drinal server . Our level of content is PoP &quot;Elemental but Pre Time&quot; .<br />
My level of gear is fairly good i feel for someone in my Guilds content range . I have lots of VT stuff still but the elemental gear is slowly replaceing it . When im not raiding I have been greatly enjoying the new OOW expansion . Very often I hunt in WoS or MPG's .<br />
<br />
I hope that lets you all know a little about me .<br />
<br />
70 shaman of undivided faith .<br />
Drinal Server . <br />
<br />

If Grimbear on the soe boards = GrimbearEQ on these boards, here's his posts.<br />

I don't know Grimbear very well, but I wish him luck and success in his new role! <br />
<br />
As far as post count goes, it isn't very reasonable to expect SOE to check the post count on this board, why would they?<br />
<br />
As I said earlier, I didn't apply for it. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Warning to Grimbear: I can be a very negative person, and to be honest I'd be very harsh to any correspondent who I din't already know and respect (ie. glorianna, sammana, landragon, etc.).  Please don't take the comments below personally.<br />
<br />
On the whole post count issue I really think we should focus on quality and not quantity, but even so I think I understand what Giac is talking about in &quot;starting to see a pattern in who they pick.&quot;  To be brutally honest (not that I'm ever any other way), just looking at the posts Ungkor linked, I have some real concerns.  For instance, almost half (3 of 7) are just Grim repeating stuff from SoE (which I imagine helped for applying to a job where parroting the official line is a requirement).<br />
<br />
In one of the posts Grim admits he doesn't even know how to make a link.  Now, I don't think this makes him stupid (as he joked), and I realize making links is not what the job is about.  But I do think that for a position involving mass electronic communication, over multiple boards and through countless emails, one really needs to feel completely comfortable working in the medium.  The posts about link colors didn't help raise my opinion of him on this matter.<br />
<br />
And then there were the three posts with his thoughts about EQ.  The majority of his posts seem to have a lot of SoE boosterism to them, but I will admit he hasn't been a blind proponent of them either: &quot;I was STUNNED ..'Role' of slower was NOT NEEDED in GoD content.&quot;  However, despite this amazing grasp of the obvious, I really didn't see anything new or insightful in any of his posts.<br />
<br />
In one post he astutely noted that a heal which heals more hp, and a nuke that causes more damage (with &quot;reasonable Casttime&quot;) would balance us.  Well, we'd be &quot;mostly balanced,&quot; if in addition we also got some &quot;minor tweaking.&quot;  To me that essentially said &quot;make our two most basic numbers bigger and, along with some other small stuff I can't think of right now, then we will be sort of kind of balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was the post about our DPS.  Now I don't mind his position (it's arguable, but certainly not unreasonable).  However what bothered me was the method with which he arrived at it.  The post asked how others &quot;feel&quot; about shaman DPS, because Grimbear felt he was doing respectable damage.  To support this, he threw in some numbers that he  didn't research much, if at all, and then without any sort of log parse or other actual study, he arrived at his conclusion.  Now this is no bigee for a random poster (we're a game forum, not a scientific community), but when we have an issue with presenting carefully researched evidence on agility being pointless to the devs, and having them totally ignore it, the last thing I really want is a correspondent who might say &quot;We get something like X AC from the Y (I think it's Y) Agility from Wrulan, and combined with the roughly Z AC from Ancestral Guard I feel we contribute a lot of AC.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly there was the egregious spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization errors, which drive me insane because I'm a literature major.  But again, this is a forum for a game, so there is no need to seriously proofread.  Especially considering that I'm probably the only one who cares if a sentence is actually five sentences combined like Voltron to form a single run-on sentence.  However, this job is about communicating with people, and I think a weakness with some basic rules of English could potentially impede communication.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it seems to me that maybe SoE picked someone who would make a good mouthpeice (for them), and a good punching bag (for us), but wouldn't be like that last guy who quit just because he expected to actually accomplish something.  On the other hand, Grim does keep abreast of two major forums (Crucible and SoE) which is more than I can say, and in the same vein I didn't even bother to apply so who am I to criticize someone who did?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if our correspondent says &quot;I do consifer myself 'from here',&quot; then until he demonstrates otherwise I'm going to accept it.  Plus, his friend went out of his way to come and extol his virtues here, and even though I don't know eximius, the fact that he came to support Grimbear is all the endorsement I need.  So Grim, please try to watch the nitpicky language stuff, 'cause it drives me crazy ;).  But congratulations on becoming our new representative, thank you for volunteering your time to do it, and best of luck to you in your new position.<br />
<br />
P.S.  Faern, you win at life (IMHO anyway) because of that post.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I consider myself to be a &quot;really nice guy&quot;, but some here (and elsewhere) would definitely not agree with that. :)<br />
<br />
The community is charged with deciding if you 'represent' them or not, and it's just my opinion that someone who has hardly exchanged any ideas with the community on this forum isn't who I would have chosen to represent the community as a whole. Your lack of voice here (and yes, post count DOES matter in this type of situation since it is 100% indicative of the feedback loop and idea exchanges with the rest of the community, which by your post count hasn't occurred on any real level)  gives the impression that you're not truly involved with the community on any grand (or even minute) scale.<br />
<br />
Either way, I wouldn't want to be you. Hope you've got thick skin, a lot of patience, and won't let it ruin your enjoyment of the game.<br />
<br />
You couldnt' PAY me enough to do what you've voluntarily gotten yourself into. :)<br />

We should not comment about his talent as corresondent before he does.<br />

<br />
I agree with you Giac. They do seem to be picking someone detached from the end game. It's not necessarily a bad thing. I hope they have done this because they either know the issues with the end game Shaman and want to make sure that the rest of the Shaman community (those not at the leading edge) gets represented as well. <br />
<br />
I don't know if someone who fights the top mobs of the game will be posting much about issues in zones they no longer go to.<br />
<br />
This is just my view on why they have now picked someone from a relatively low tier in EQ to represent the class as a whole.<br />
<br />
In terms of the amount of posts Grimbear has made on the crucible, I think we are lucky to have them pick someone who visits here at all. Frankly, we say this is the hub of Shaman information because we come here. It's not official. SoE could have picked someone from their own boards who never came here at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>tassie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Looks like we all have to Grim and Bear  it  :cool: <br />
<br />
I do wonder though.. If Sony had any respect for the shaman community and this website they would've conducted a poll on who we might like as a representative.<br />
<br />
For transperancy and a form of democracy it would help for us to elect our own representative wouldn't it? - The moment I'm told from SoE this is the person (without asking) looses any respect I have for the position.<br />
<br />
Grim, this is the way I feel about the position and has no reflect on you personally or your abilities, and I whole heartly appologise if it looks like I have offended you... certainly not my intention. <br />

No need to appologise to me for that . You didnt offend me in the least . I also would have liked to see a poll or something . However , that wasnt the way it was done . Thusly im going to be trying to do my best to help out .<br />

<br />
True - but you (or for that matter, I) are not being asked to be the correspondents representing our class.  It would be best if our representative demonstrated his writing and thinking skills in posts rather  than his attendance or reading skills.  (Although reading will still be important).  Too bad there is no way for him to demonstrate his ability to wade thru horse manure to find the valuable things.  <br />
<br />
Of course, he need prove nothing to us - he does not require our approval - he has SOE's.<br />
<br />
Personally, I am happy to see that SOE found someone experienced at being a shaman willing to fill the role.  Our guild just had 2 of our best shamans retire, or at least back away from EQ this month.  Experienced shamans that are not too frustrated to play are getting rare.<br />

<br />
I for one would never want to be a 6rd grade class secretary.   I watched SWG &quot;correspondents&quot; burn/flame themselves out over and over again during a EQ break.  It is going to happen for EQ and EQ II as well unless those that offer their services in such a forum have more enablement than just being a note taker.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Warning to Grimbear: I can be a very negative person, and to be honest I'd be very harsh to any correspondent who I din't already know and respect (ie. glorianna, sammana, landragon, etc.).  Please don't take the comments below personally.<br />
<br />
On the whole post count issue I really think we should focus on quality and not quantity, but even so I think I understand what Giac is talking about in &quot;starting to see a pattern in who they pick.&quot;  To be brutally honest (not that I'm ever any other way), just looking at the posts Ungkor linked, I have some real concerns.  For instance, almost half (3 of 7) are just Grim repeating stuff from SoE (which I imagine helped for applying to a job where parroting the official line is a requirement).<br />
<br />
In one of the posts Grim admits he doesn't even know how to make a link.  Now, I don't think this makes him stupid (as he joked), and I realize making links is not what the job is about.  But I do think that for a position involving mass electronic communication, over multiple boards and through countless emails, one really needs to feel completely comfortable working in the medium.  The posts about link colors didn't help raise my opinion of him on this matter.<br />
<br />
And then there were the three posts with his thoughts about EQ.  The majority of his posts seem to have a lot of SoE boosterism to them, but I will admit he hasn't been a blind proponent of them either: &quot;I was STUNNED ..'Role' of slower was NOT NEEDED in GoD content.&quot;  However, despite this amazing grasp of the obvious, I really didn't see anything new or insightful in any of his posts.<br />
<br />
In one post he astutely noted that a heal which heals more hp, and a nuke that causes more damage (with &quot;reasonable Casttime&quot;) would balance us.  Well, we'd be &quot;mostly balanced,&quot; if in addition we also got some &quot;minor tweaking.&quot;  To me that essentially said &quot;make our two most basic numbers bigger and, along with some other small stuff I can't think of right now, then we will be sort of kind of balanced.&quot;<br />
<br />
Then there was the post about our DPS.  Now I don't mind his position (it's arguable, but certainly not unreasonable).  However what bothered me was the method with which he arrived at it.  The post asked how others &quot;feel&quot; about shaman DPS, because Grimbear felt he was doing respectable damage.  To support this, he threw in some numbers that he  didn't research much, if at all, and then without any sort of log parse or other actual study, he arrived at his conclusion.  Now this is no bigee for a random poster (we're a game forum, not a scientific community), but when we have an issue with presenting carefully researched evidence on agility being pointless to the devs, and having them totally ignore it, the last thing I really want is a correspondent who might say &quot;We get something like X AC from the Y (I think it's Y) Agility from Wrulan, and combined with the roughly Z AC from Ancestral Guard I feel we contribute a lot of AC.&quot;<br />
<br />
Lastly there was the egregious spelling, grammar, punctuation, and capitalization errors, which drive me insane because I'm a literature major.  But again, this is a forum for a game, so there is no need to seriously proofread.  Especially considering that I'm probably the only one who cares if a sentence is actually five sentences combined like Voltron to form a single run-on sentence.  However, this job is about communicating with people, and I think a weakness with some basic rules of English could potentially impede communication.<br />
<br />
So yeah, it seems to me that maybe SoE picked someone who would make a good mouthpeice (for them), and a good punching bag (for us), but wouldn't be like that last guy who quit just because he expected to actually accomplish something.  On the other hand, Grim does keep abreast of two major forums (Crucible and SoE) which is more than I can say, and in the same vein I didn't even bother to apply so who am I to criticize someone who did?<br />
<br />
At the end of the day, if our correspondent says &quot;I do consifer myself 'from here',&quot; then until he demonstrates otherwise I'm going to accept it.  Plus, his friend went out of his way to come and extol his virtues here, and even though I don't know eximius, the fact that he came to support Grimbear is all the endorsement I need.  So Grim, please try to watch the nitpicky language stuff, 'cause it drives me crazy ;).  But congratulations on becoming our new representative, thank you for volunteering your time to do it, and best of luck to you in your new position.<br />

I guess I could have made it clearer, but I wasn't trying ot bash Grimbear, I was trying to bash SoE's decision to pick Grimbear as our correspondent.  I never said he was a bad guy, or that he should be kicked out of the Crucible for making poor posts or anything.  What I did say was that his posts suggested he had some flaws which really didn't make him seem like a good candidate for being our correspondent.  I have some flaws that would make me a poor choice for correspondent too, and if I had applied and got picked (and had some sort of split personality thing going on)  I'd be pissed that SoE chose someone who leaves the game regularly, has less hp/ac then a drood, actually cares when idiots give him negative rep bumps, and goes arround harrasing people for minor spelling/grammar issues.<br />
<br />
The point was that several people here who have demonstrated their understanding of the game, the class, the forum environment, and the English language said they were applying, and if they actually did then SoE chose Grim over them.  IMHO (going solely on Grim's post record here, not on whatever was in the application that SoE saw and I didn't) that wasn't a good choice.  In fact, as I stated before, I think it may have been a choice deliberately made to get someone who maybe wasn't as qualified, but who they could be certain wasn't going to make trouble like the last guy.</div></div><hr />

Man, Purdy you nailed our current situation.  I guess I hadn't really noticed it, but you are right, I'm lfg for an hour on average now.  Guess I hadn't thought about it, as I'm off doing tradeskills or cleaning up my bank, chatting with the guild, etc...<br />
<br />
And given the annoying corpse recovery of zones like PG (ever done a trial there yet?  OH, its great.  When you die, you respawn outside the trial area, which has tons of see invis mobs in the way when you finally get back in zone), CC is more important than ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">/agree Purdy.  Just had a group tonight that failed a hard EC LDoN.  At the end I really thought it was the cleric's fault (she had no clue when to start a CH, and kept using the less efficient heals and running out of mana) but since I'm less of an ass in-game than I am here I didn't say this, and instead agreed with everyone else in the group.  They all said &quot;if only we had a chanter,&quot; and only out of politeness to me refrained from adding &quot;instead of that worthless shaman who can't even handle a single add if VP gets resisted, or if he can't get the mob to chase him so he can root it away from the group, or if the mob is immune to runspeed changes.&quot;<br />
<br />
And they have a point, not only could a chanter mez, but they can slow only 10(5?)% worse than me, and actually not even that much worse when you factor in mitigation, plus they bring a pet which, even without charming, is better than mine, and they have better haste and the best mana regen buff.  Only thing I really add over a chanter is melee buffs and DoTs, neither of which really contributes much DPS, and heals, which would have been entirely unnecessary if the cleric (or the druid for that matter) had known how to do their job.<br />
<br />
SoE needs to figure out what exactly we should be doing in groups.  If it is heal, then we need a lot better heals.  If it is add damage, then we either need better nukes or more Bane style DoTs.  If they want us to be more than buff bots, then we need more useful buffs that actually require the shaman to be in the group (this doesn't mean they have to have the duration of FA, instead they could drop when you zone, or when you disband, or they could only work when the shaman is in range, or something).  And if they want us to be damage mitigators, they need to either stop making all the mobs mitigate our only real advantage, or they need to give us some other tools.  I'm not saying we should get enchanter level mez or anything, but would it really be that wrong if we got an unresistable short (10 or 15 second) mez?  Or a slow that worked twice as well (after mitigation) and had a shorter cast time, but broke as soon as the mob got attacked.  Or an AE slow that is truly AE, or that has a built in agro reducer, or that comes with an 8 second DA, or etc. etc.<br />
<br />
It seems to me that SoE doesn't really have a vision for where we belong in groups, and to be fair it seems to lack this vision for a lot of other classes too.  I really don't want to be flat out better than a beastlord or enchanter, but I want to be equally desirable.  This doesn't mean we have to do the exact same things as them: rangers add damage by shooting arrows, rogues by backstabbing, wizards by nuking, etc., yet when you get right down to it they are all close to equally valuable for that role (of course it really depends on the AAs/spells/equipment of the specific character, and it always seems as if there is one DPS class du jour).  The same can be done with us: allowing us to handle crowd control doesn't mean we need enchanter mezzes.  If SoE would take some iniative and try to find uses for all classes in the current content I really think it would do a great deal to improve the game.<br />
<br />
Personally, I vote for giving us greater healing and/or some crowd control powers. There are three viable options for tanks, countless options for damage, potentially a lot for puller (depending on the zone),but only one (maybe two if you count druids, and even then not for any really challenging content) choice for a healer, and likewise only one (again, maybe two if you count bards) for CC (unless it's an undead dungeon in which case you can add necros).  If SoE changed those numbers, there'd be a lot less people sitting around bored and LFG just because no clerics or chanters are on, and I think it would really improve the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I find this isn't really a problem with the shaman versus enchanter thing, but a problem with the way the group is built.  Shaman can work GREAT in situations that require CC, but typically the group should have someone else able to tank the mobs.  Then you're golden.  Been seeing this in PG/RS, where, merely by virtue of having 2 tanks, a cleric, and myself (+ another healer if in RS), we can easily handle 2 mobs.  Not sayin it's a substitute for an enc, but a lot of times people just build a typical group, slap on a shm instead of an enc, and wind up only too late realizing they aren't really equipped to handle cc.  We can also do something that enc really can't do well, which is heal, and this can be really relevant in the right group.<br />
<br />
I do still think enc are more powerful than shm, but I don't really feel threatened by mez... just charm (cc I can handle, havin that class do more dps than rest of the group makes me feel inadeqate).<br />
<br />
On the original subject, I welcome Grimbear, and as long as he listens well to the community and relays their concerns to Sony, should do fine, regardless of whether or not he writes like Dubya.  We should give him a chance, at least =)<br />

<br />
SoE needs to figure out what exactly we should be doing in groups.  If it is heal, then we need a lot better heals.  If it is add damage, then we either need better nukes or more Bane style DoTs.  <br />
<br />
<br />
We did get this with oow, though it will take some time for 69-70 spells to trickle down.  Resist rate on Bane is absolutely stupid and should be adjusted to be like normal spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
If they want us to be more than buff bots, then we need more useful buffs that actually require the shaman to be in the group <br />
<br />
<br />
We got these with OoW.  I get many comments on sense, stamina, and wunshi's like &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;cool&quot;, and &quot;neato&quot;. <br />
<br />
<br />
And if they want us to be damage mitigators, they need to either stop making all the mobs mitigate our only real advantage, or they need to give us some other tools.  <br />
<br />
<br />
Also fixed with OoW, though people may not realize it.  First, mobs don't hit that much harder, while people advanced to level 70.  Tanks will have more hp/ac from pickup WoS gear, and tank better by virtue of being &gt; 66.  We got a better heal in Yoppa's.  As an end result, even though mobs still mitigate, we handle the damage MUCH better.  <br />
<br />
Once again, we see the situation where shammies are really really good whenever they can handle healing (WoS/PG with right tank), and significantly underpowered where their healing falls short (RS/some GoD).  It is a very tricky class to balance, as it just smashes the other healing classes in 'easy' content, and becomes simply a low dps class that can't heal in 'hard' content.<br />
<br />
However, at least in 'hard' content where mobs actually have hps (unlike GoD), we can actually land DoTs for decent damage.  So even OoW improved on this as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or a slow that worked twice as well (after mitigation) and had a shorter cast time, but broke as soon as the mob got attacked.  Or an AE slow that is truly AE, or that has a built in agro reducer, or that comes with an 8 second DA, or etc. etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, OoW provided this... Vindictive Spirit, true AE slow with a self rune, really cool spell.  A lot of your concerns have actually been addressed, once the OoW runes flow your way =)<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't want to be flat out better than a beastlord or enchanter, but I want to be equally desirable.  <br />
<br />
<br />
We are easily more desirable than a beastlord, at least on my server.  We don't really compete with beasts; they're more dps on my server, or slowers when no enc/shm is available... or used as backup slowers/dps.  When I zone into a zone and it's me or a bst lfg, I will almost always get the nod.  Enchanter I can't argue with you on; people still desire enc over shm... however, many like to have both these days for extra heal or simultaneous cc/slow.  I still don't feel like we remotely compete with enchanters (I once argued that a mez is, basically, a shorter duration 100% slow, so, viewed that way, enchanters own shamans in the slow department, yet no one ever complains, because enc have had mez forever... but really a mob just standing there is the same as a mob who has been 100% slowed and is never swinging, heh).<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally, I vote for giving us greater healing and/or some crowd control powers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Agree completely with this.  Adding/improving VP line would be a step (by making a bigger DR debuff, quickened VP timer, maybe a disease root we could actually cast).  <br />
<br />
I actually had a cool idea for a spell.... a disease-based slow that begins at 100% and decreases by 20% per tick, lasting 5 ticks.  So the mob is 100% slowed for 1 tick (effectively mezzed), then 80% slowed, then 60, then 40, then 20, then 0 (spell wears).  Mitigation would apply to keep spell from being too overpowered.  This is what a spell like 'Crippliing Spasm' should really be, in my mind.  This would be a great CC tool.  Maybe a bit overpowered, but could be adjusted to maybe 100-66-33-0, and last 4 ticks, or whatever.<br />

You are 100% correct on this.  As I said, I felt our failure in that group was really more the clerics fault, as we did indeed have a an off-tank (a ranger from an uberguild who may have actually had more hp than our main tank).  But my point was just that, had I been an enchanter, even that cleric's issues wouldn't have made our group fail.  I mean sure, I can heal, and that does help.  But I can't heal and  malos, or slow, or chase mobs around, etc. at the same time.  If there is only one add, then maybe I can mix in a Q or Tnarg's on the off-tank while I try to get it rooted, but if there are multiple adds or adds that are unrootable, I have a lose-lose choice: chain heal against massive DPS, and hope that we kill everything before the cleric and I go OOM (or get agro), or try to slow and ghetto mez while watching people die because the cleric can only heal so much.<br />
<br />
But if I was an enchanter, I have no such dilemna: I just mez adds.  No worries about un-rootability, no worries about healing (every mob I mez does 0 damage, whereas a slowed mob still does a percentage of its damage, and a rooted one continues to do full damage until I can communicate that it is rooted and everyone moves away from it).  Now of course, if mez breaks the enchanter will probably go from full health to a blood stain on the floor in 0.5 seconds, but usually by the time that is an issue, their sacrifice will have bought the group all the time they need.<br />
Some other responses:<br />
My response to most of those is that you are probably right about OoW spells solving the problems (but since all I have so far is SoS I'm largely ignorant of them right now).  However I do disagree with:<br />
We got these with OoW.  I get many comments on sense, stamina, and wunshi's like &quot;wow&quot;, &quot;cool&quot;, and &quot;neato&quot;.<br />
Might: hour and 3 min.  Fortitude, Sense, and Wunshi: hour and 12 min.  All those numbers are before any buff extension, so I'd expect most shaman to add at least 15 min to any of those durations.  Considering that many melees are already used to getting Focus and maybe Sta in PoK before they join a group, I'm sure they will quickly learn to request these buffs as well.  Depending on how long their group lasts, the buffs may run out, but the point is that if they can have them for at least an hour without having a shaman in the group, they have a lot less motivation to get a shaman (except maybe later as a replacement to refresh buffs).<br />
<br />
But if SoE just added a component to these buffs that made it so they only work while in the same group/raid as the casting shaman, or so they dissapear when you zone, people could only benefit from them if they actually had a shaman in their group.  If this was the case, I think it would go a long way towards making classes desired in groups for their buffs, instead of just being desired in PoK.  To be fair, I think this should be done to KEI and 9 too, though not to Virtue since those bastards don't need any help getting groups ;)<br />
<br />
I actually had a cool idea for a spell.... a disease-based slow that begins at 100% and decreases by 20% per tick, lasting 5 ticks.  So the mob is 100% slowed for 1 tick (effectively mezzed), then 80% slowed, then 60, then 40, then 20, then 0 (spell wears). <br />
That's a really cool idea, and it is the kind of thing I wish SoE would consider but don't think they will.  It seems to me that on spells these days they really aren't thinking out of the box (the new buffs are a bit different, but really are just contiuations of the existing lines, in a form that is actually effective, ie. avoidance instead of agi).  My theory isn't that they are lazy so much as it is that they believe by only making upgrades to spell lines rather than new spell lines, they avoid disrupting the balance of the game.  To be fair, they don't have a great record of implementing new things without them being wildly overpowered or underpowered initially (anyone remember the warrior rampage AA when it first came out? or the old days of Dire Charm?).  However, while this may prevent short-term wackiness, it also impedes the long-term growth of the game.<br />
<br />
I hope maybe someday SOE will realize the error of this thinking, and try adding new spells such as the one you suggested.  Sure it may require some testing and tuning, but that's what the live servers are there for, right? ;)  And once the initial issues are resolved, I think the game will have grown, and be a lot healthier for it.</div></div><hr />
