<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beolorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok kind of getting tired of fearkiting I know its the best way to go but damn if I have to fearkite another level I'm going to explode.<br />

Buying an earring of the solstice/Tox axe soon.<br />
<br />
Ideas that I've had are HHK nobles, and SolB.  I'm extremely open to suggestions though.<br />
<br />
I actually went to SolB but amazingly there was about 20 people actually using it for experience on ayonae ro so I went back to jaggedpine to grind out the rest of 51.  Also in SolB I was thinking bats would be good *shrug*<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway please help me by suggesting spots I can't take jaggedpine much longer hehe.  My finger hurts from clicking my panic animal hotkey :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bangzoom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I soloed effectively in DL and at the Spiroc island at 51. Both just involve pulling the MOB to a safe spot, rooting and snaring it, and filling it full of arrows to soften it up before you paste it close up.<br />
<br />
You have MUCH better gear than I did at that level. I was using a Rain Caller and an Iksar regen BP. With your bow and Fungi, you should have no problems at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Although getting singles might be a problem, you can try to fight the elemental warriors at the entrance to the Hole.  I did this at 53; dunno if its feasable at 51 though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Traxxus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bloodgill Goblins in LoIO give good exp up to 53 or 54. They're in the sunken building in the middle of the lake. There are two platforms on the North and South side of the main building that have two static spawns each.  Regular harmony works on them and there are no wanderers. Just bring lots of fish scales. Fighting underwater is always exciting.<br />
