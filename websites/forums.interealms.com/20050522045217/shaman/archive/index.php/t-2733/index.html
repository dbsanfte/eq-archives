<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bozze Blightbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I wanted to say hello to everyone who frequents these forums, and i have a couple of questions for anyone who feels like answering.<br />
<br />
Bozze is my 3rd character on the Bertoxx server, though he is my favorite and the one I will play until I no longer play EQ. He is a 51 Iksar shaman, currently guildless; he has some decent pieces of gear and some garbage.<br />
<br />
I've noticed people here use the magelo profiles.... I'm not familiar with them. I use the one on eq.castersrealm.com ... is there something about the magelo profiles that people like more? And where do you find the site to register one =)<br />
<br />
And heres another silly question: I have been wondering the percentage of iksar vs other races for shamen on different servers. I rarely see any non-anon iksar shamen(women), and as far as I've seen there aren't too many of us. I'm not here to debate iksar vs troll or anything, don't get me wrong. But I can't help but wonder if it's due entirely to JBB that so few people (that I've seen) choose iksar. And I wonder if verant had planned such a racial disrepancy and it's &quot;working as intended&quot;. It seems to me that being KoS most everywhere and having to deal with the invis code (dont get me started on random invis dropping hehe) would be enough to compensate for the innate iksar bonuses. This item is such a &quot;core&quot; item for the shaman class... I know I'm whining but it just seems wrong to me ;)<br />
<br />
Ill leave it at that.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think one of the reasons there are so few iksars is because the majority of us started our shaman long before there WERE iksars, but feel free to complain about the lack of a JBB!  Honestly, I don't think Verant though through the JB armor thing very well at all.  I think they would probably rather take away the JBB from noniksars than give a 263 nuke to level 46 iksars.  <br />

You can set up a magelo profile at www.magelo.com</div></div><hr />
