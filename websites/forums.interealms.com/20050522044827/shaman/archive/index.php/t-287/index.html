<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently we have heard some rumors that VP was made keyless on Test for a bit(not sure if this is still the case).    What do you all think about this?<br />
<br />
   Currently my guild on SZ is starting to do ST, and hope to kill our first warder in a week or so.      There is also another guild that is far ahead of us doing ST already for months.     However neither one of our guilds has any intention of doing VP simply because the risk/reward for VP is simply unbelievably bad compared to ST.     Only one dragon to kill for the key, and after that a extremely boring camping quest to complete the key, often taking days per person.     ALso, unlike ST in which you can start farming priceless with one group, VP is completely worthless until you have upwards of 24 - 30.    In order for us to do VP we would be forced to monopolize the Trakanon spawn for 4 months or more(even assuming we could get lucky and be able to drop him twice a week).   <br />
<br />
   Making VP keyless would in one day of programming open up a very highlvl zone for uber guilds to have alot of fun in.    Frankly I dont see any benefit to keeping this dungeon keyless.     The vast majority of weapons in VP are not that great, and at least for my guild when talking about it, it is mainly a &quot;caster Sleepers Tomb&quot;.       I see it as kinda unbalancing to casters that the one highlvl zone that does drop alot of interesting caster loot, is the HARDEST and most annoying to get keys for.    In fact so annoying and hard that almost no guilds are willing to go for it.    The only guild on SZ/VZ to even step into ST got the majority of their keys before people knew about ST.<br />
<br />
   The only reason I could see for keeping this dungeon keyed is that the people currently doing VP would be upset at how its easier now to get to.    However, from my view, it seems that currently we have one of the most interesting zones in the game going completely to waste because of a ridiculous key implementation.     Verant is making a new expansion to add highlvl content, but in one day they could add this zone back to the game.<br />
<br />
   One other thing, since this rumor came out that VP is going to be made keyless, its made it EVEN HARDER to get people interested in farming Trak for keys, since now they figure we should just wait a bit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dunno, I hate to be one of those people with the &quot;in my day we had to walk 20 miles to school in the SNOW with no shoes!&quot; attitude, but darn it, getting a VP key is really hard work.  Getting a guild of VP keyed folks is incredibly hard work!  My guild made VP a priority and we worked nearly a year to sloooowly accumulate keys and finally, refine the tactics that helped us kill all the dragons, up to Phara Dar and clear VP.  It was an amazing feeling of teamwork and I just can't be happy about the idea of people who didn't want to take the effort of getting a VP key just waltzing in.<br />
<br />
/ooc 60 shaman LFG in VP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Was ST out when you farmed the majority of your VP keys?   Or at least, did people know about what was dropping in ST?     Currently I cant imagine any guild in its right mind working for VP keys currently when there is so much else to do.     <br />
<br />
    Right now its just a highlvl zone that GMs get to hang out in on the majority of servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got my key a long time ago, I'd like to see some reward for my mindnumbing work. I don't want to see someone that didn't do the lame quest reaping the same rewards I get (assuming they revamp VP soon, which I hear they are doing).<br />
<br />
However, I do agree the quest is ridiculously long and some parts are too tedious. Rotting skeleton and pained soul should definetely spawn more often, and Verix should drop 2 medallions per kill. Also, they should eliminate the Trakanon's Tooth part. We haven't done Trakanon for his drops in a long time, so it's hard to get new keys made as no one wants to do Trak anymore. Also, we'd be taking away a mob that lesser guilds still do for loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Our guild began working on their VP keys over a year ago, back when the thought of killing any of the ST key mobs was only a dream (maybe even before Velious even existed!).  My guild is on SS faction and we have only recently been able to kill Klandicar and Sontalek with any regularity (Zlandi of course, but he doesn't have much of a life span on my server) and we currently have around 30 ST keys.<br />
<br />
Two of our biggest goals have been: 100% epic completion and clearing VP, and we stuck to those goals no matter what.  ST and equipping our melee with primal has also been a goal and as you can see we are accomplishing that goal as well.  <br />
<br />
http://www.afflictionguild.com/members.php<br />
<br />
82 members (+30 inactive)<br />
73 epics/89% complete  (+21 inactive)<br />
57 VP keys (+13 inactive)<br />
23 ST keys (+6 inactive)<br />
<br />
Maybe VP is deserted on your server, but on Erollisi Marr 4 guilds have cleared it (Magister, Storm's Fury, Midnight Sojourn and Affliction) and another 3 guilds are working hard on their keys and spend time fighting there (Ring of Destiny, Divine Grace and Pheonix Crusaders).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mikar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You wouldnt need to monopolise Trak for 4 months of 2 kills per week to get 30 keys - he drops 3-5 teeth per kill. In 4 weeks you could have a workable crew for VP.  That aside I dont see any reason why they couldnt remove the key requirement for VP to make it more used - unless they plan to upgrade VP in which case keeping the key makes sense.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't think they should make it keyless. Too many people spent too much time getting the keys. Maybe up the spawn rate of the various key mobs or something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigmeeno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The VP key quest is a pain in the behind. But it is also a right of passage for those that desire to enter the zone. The key should remain in the game, and the quest should remain as it is. Anything less would trivialize those that have completed their keys already.<br />
<br />
The zone is next to useless at this time. However, if they revamp it, those of us that have put the time and effort into getting our keys should be the ones that get to collect the rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Garreth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I spent 17 hours sitting in traks teeth waiting for the dude to show.  I spent 4 sessions of 8 hours each sitting in DL for that guy to show.  In other words the VP key experience for me sucked, and everyone should have to do it if you want to play in VP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JenamdarAL</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">After doing SOL key camps, I miss the VP key quest. Really miss it :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Arorot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Well as far as making it keyless im totally against that notion.There should be some sort of rite of passage for entry into the zone.<br />
On the other hand spending weeks of time completing the quest is ridiculous.(which is why i havent finished mine)<br />
Upping the spawn rate or even the timer on the PHers for the mobs would be great.As the quest is now even if all the mobs required were semi common spawns It would still take a fair investment of time to finish.<br />
At least an amount of time equal to the rewards of the zone itself which are minimal at best in comparision to ST TOV Ssra rewards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">all they need to do is retune the zone and make the level of difficulty harder then NToV as well as up the loot dropped there.  That would attract people with keys and people without keys would then start to farmin again.  The key quest itself is a pain in the ass but at the time it was VI's mother of all zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gothmog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Or make it considerably easier.<br />
<br />
On most servers, VP is a graveyard, due to the fact that it's so damn tedious to pick up enough keys, and because the only people who really have something to gain from going there are casters.<br />
<br />
Open it up so it gets some use.  It'll take some of the pressure off of the other high-level raid zones hopefully, and it'll open up a zone where casters can actually look forward to getting loot from.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I don't have my VP key yet, but I'm working on it.  In fact, at this very moment I'm sitting in TT waiting and waiting and waiting.  No way do I want them to make this zone keyless.  That's just dumb.  I intend to pay my dues like everyone else who got their keys already.<br />
<br />
(Edit - 1 hr 30 min after I posted that, the Pained Soul died.  Took about 5 hours total.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Uggok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The key quest is not hard, it is very easy.  It is also very time consuming and very boring.  Of course, Verant frequently uses the &quot;prove that you have a higher tolerance for boredom than a lobotomized monkey&quot; test as a proxy for challenge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think I had a relatively painless VP key experience.  Pained Soul only took me a couple of hours, Rotting Skeleton I camped several times, got it finally after maybe an hour or so on the last camp.  Verix was good exp, even at 60, so I didn't mind that.  Ancient Jarsath I got when someone trained it into FV, I think I was late 40's or so when that happened.  Trak I got on guild raid, the others were pretty easy.  I think that increasing the spawn rate of PS and RS would be fine, other than that, keep the key quest.<br />
<br />
In VP, I would like to see the respawn rate on minor mobs decreased, so it is possible to clear-as-you-go rather than sneaking around and CotHing everyone.  It would be nice to make VP the caster equivalent to ST, with caster focus items etc. dropping, but doable with a crew equivalent to an ST crew rather than a cast of thousands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">(1) Up mob difficulty.<br />
(2) Remove the silly 2 min respawn.<br />
(3) No key.<br />
(4) Change loot table.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">They definitely need to change the key quest.  I had ungodly luck and had my key 2/3 done in one day, but I have seen people sit on the pained spawn thru 150+ PH's with no luck.  Sad thing is that on mobs like the pained soul, rotting skelly, and Verix you are doing REALLY well if you ONLY waste an entire day per mob.<br />
<br />
I don't agree with the idea of making VP keyless because of the precedent it sets.  If VP went keyless, why not Sleepers?  Heck, open the floodgates and knock level limits off planes as well.  It will be like opening day in Fear everywhere :p<br />
<br />
Only zone that needs a key removed is Sebilis IMO.  They could rename it &quot;My First Dungeon&quot; or &quot;Learning to Color with Frogloks&quot; at this point.</div></div><hr />

- Arguably endgame loot of the game comes out of Temple of Veeshan. Does it need a key to get in? No, only level limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">could someone point me at a link that shows to to get a VP key? got a few pieces and I'd like to see what else is involved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Eoin MacManus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think it needs to have a key, but they should change the quest. Make the mobs involved spawn more often, for example.<br />
<br />
Removing the stupid (and they are stupid) restrictions on getting out of the zone would be a step in the right direction as well. Verant missed the boat big time on the concept of VP. It's just not how most people play the game. Compare to Howling Stones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">&lt;i&gt;Only zone that needs a key removed is Sebilis IMO. They could rename it &quot;My First Dungeon&quot; or &quot;Learning to Color with Frogloks&quot; at this point.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
Why?  The key takes all of 30 minutes to complete, if that.   I remember how excited I was when I finally got to go into Sebilis.  Having to click that key for the first time was part of the fun.  Besides, &quot;my first dungeon&quot; is LGuk or SoLB.  The people who are skipping these zones now in favor of DL are really short changing themselves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The intent is if you are good enough to be in VP, you SHOULD be good enough to get yourself out.  How you do that is your decision.  Personally I would like to see it required to have to kill your way out and remove duel/res'ing but I cannot see how that is possible.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget, VP was the first real über zone created.  I give them some credit for providing a unique experience.  The first time I did VP it was thrilling, a whole weekend devoted to clearing this place.  Now its cleared in &lt;4 hours.  <br />
<br />
They also should remove CoTH from this zone as well.  CoTH trivializes the intent.  While I personally have benefited from CoTH, it still is one of the things that gimps this zone out.<br />
<br />
Keys should be required.. Level limits do nothing.  The intent of the key was that if you could kill trakanon then you earned yourself a spot in VP.  It was the next level in dragons the time Kunark was around.  VI graciously provided a stepping ladder to 1) control who went in 2) make certain only people capable of the encounters were allowed in.<br />
<br />
Lastley, the key quest wasn't so bad.  used to trade druids and rangers thier stones and crap from VS in exchange for them tracking, killing, and MQ'ing the VP key stuff ;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Personnaly I think the real issue is why you are doing it.<br />
<br />
For me there was really nothing that even interested me in VP (when I was playing my sham back then). It was melee heaven of course at the time.<br />
<br />
Today most of the stuff in VP is outdated. Remember when fear weapons were the beat all end all of ubberness weapons? Now some you can't even give away.. thanks vendor/delete key.<br />
<br />
I think a revamp to the zone is in order myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I think you are all &quot;whining&quot;, for lack of a better word.  And if they retune VP I hope they reset the keys to give at least a chance for those who have moved past VP for 1) its long stupid key quest and 2) its overpowering risk over reward (this includes key which isnt really a risk but 'time spent' is considered a compnonent of risk in this game).<br />
<br />
Edit: Well either reset or retool key quest and allow players to use the old key as a jump past begining of quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">i think it should remain keyed<br />
as for the quest<br />
the pained soul should be changed slightly, he has like a %1 chance of spawning i would guess. I think they should add 1-2 more spots where he could spawn. like keep the current solo one and make 2 camps where one of them could be ph.<br />
the ps camp was great to pl with, at 60 i grouped my friends lvl 38 portho, he gained like 2 levels in a few hours of just standing there, i did kill other stuff around there while waiting.<br />
<br />
<br />
vp needs a big boost, 32k dragons vs manaburn, melees with aa skills and primal or better weapons is a big joke. <br />
<br />
but should it be on the same level as ntov?<br />
they should do away with the 2min spawns<br />
move old loot to rare table off roamers<br />
as for doing away with CoH, that imho really doesn't stop much<br />
as you could still drag/res abiet slowly, but still a workable way around, unless you add something that wouldn't allow you to drag all over the place.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">&lt;i&gt;I would like to see the respawn rate on minor mobs decreased, so it is possible to clear-as-you-go rather than sneaking around and CotHing everyone.&lt;/i&gt;<br />
<br />
We only use CoH to get to Hoshkar/Silverwing spot. Some of us skip that and just invis up to there. Then when those 2 are dead, we invis run past the big room before the lava drakes and get ready to plow through them. The fun part is killing the mobs real fast and moving through to the pool room before respawn. It is very possible to do it without CoH, and we are not a real uber guild. We've never killed Tunare, Arch Lich, Avatar of War or even Creator, yet we can plow through the stuff in VP faster than it can respawn.<br />
<br />
I do agree that the key is too tedious and should be changed a bit. I don't agree that it should go keyless. I don't want to share the zone with people that were too lazy to do the work for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Grogsmash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Okay, its pretty clear that everyone with keys thinks its gay, completely pointless, and that it doesnt drop that great of gear, but it must remain keyless because they had to do it.<br />
<br />
   So by that logic nothing should ever be updated because then it makes stuff trivial.    Cant argue with that kind of logic, so have fun in your personal dungeon, because no one with any brains would do the dungeon as it currently stands.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I have a key. <br />
I've never been tho.<br />
My last guild made it a priority to get people keys.  We had about 20 keys in a month.  We were about ready to go check it out when the guild fell to pieces over some ghey sheet.  <br />
<br />
My new guild is much more uber, but has no keys to speak of and no interest in getting keys for a dungeon that only drops decent loot for casters.  We're far more interested in going to NTOV, killing Doze, Kland, Zland, Rhag's, Telk, Lend, etc etc.  <br />
<br />
Solution to VP:<br />
1) up spawn rate of Pained Soul, Rotting Skelly, Verix<br />
2) Revamp VP, make the loot viable, remove the 2 minute respawn I hear about.  <br />
<br />
That'll make the zone viable once again IMHO.  And mebbe I'll get to go eh?  /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I'm not of the opinion that &quot;I did it, it sucked for me so it should <br />
suck for you too&quot;. <br />
<br />
I completed my key, but I think it should either be keyless, or<br />
the keyquest DRASTICLY altered. One Trak tooth and maybe<br />
one or two other parts. It's not a quest, so much as a butt<br />
numbing experience. <br />
<br />
Just after I finished my key, people stopped going there on my<br />
server. They determined that the risk vs reward vs time required<br />
was simply not worth it. I believe this was even before Velious<br />
came out. A couple of months ago someone asked if the key<br />
quest was worth it. Almost unanimously the people who had <br />
been said no. <br />
<br />
I wish<br />
<br />
1) The key quest was revamped (as described above)<br />
<br />
2) You could gate or be ported out.<br />
<br />
3) They'd revamp the drop tables<br />
<br />
or<br />
<br />
4) Move Torpor's and Mala out of there, onto mobs that <br />
    are actually killed once in a while on my server.</div></div><hr />

Rend Robe, Lava Diamond Staff, DMF robe, Yunnb's Earring, Crown of Rile, Phara Dar robe, Bo Staff of Trorsmang, Scimitar of Lifestealing and a few other items are still very nice for us brainless people. <br />

3) Upgrade the drops on the dragons.  Put some of the old drops as rare random drops on the yard trash.<br />
4) Get rid of the stupid no gating out.  Verant soul bound the Sleeper's Key, its time to change the VP restriction.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Sorry but verant is a bunch of dumb ass's.<br />
That said, leave the key and the quest alone. They screwed enough stuff already by Verant doing what they thought was best. In 3 years of EQ, only thing verant has shown me is that they can take a semi-functional quest/item/mob and totally screw it up fully to a non functioning state. <br />
-Drop the 2 minute spawn, make it 6 or 8 minute.<br />
-Make the drops nicer/better<br />
-drop the 40 to 1 melee to caster loot so you can actually convince people to go.<br />
I like having the fast respawn cause if you clear VP, you can go back with six people  and farm spells. (Yes melees, there is more to the game than getting you a weapon with .01 better damage delay ratio than your current.)<br />
The real problem though is the desirability. So make some minor tweaks on the drops and maybe it will foster some interest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Gah, requiring having a key isn't the problem, it's not being able to gate out that is.   With it revamped, I'm sure it's going to take more than 3 hours to do.  Which means leaving corpses outside VP, so you can &quot;ghetto gate&quot; out, will be sketchy.  It's pretty anal leaving corpses out as is.  Just wastes time on a work-around against the no gating thing.  And Verant can't do much about that.   It was kinda like ST.  We use to leave corpses inside, for precaution, in case of a wipe-out against Warders.   Now with the Sleeper awaken on all servers but one (I think just one has Sleeper still), doesn't matter much anymore.  Not to mention ST keys are now soulbound.</div></div><hr />

You don't leave them outside.  You just all bind in GFay at the spires.  When you are ready to leave you die in VP, then die at the spires,  get rez'd back to VP, loot up, get rezed back to GFay.  Done.   Only tricky part is making sure the clerics know what they are doing so they can get each other out.</div></div><hr />

Yet while upping the spawn rates takes this quest from painfully dull and obtuse to skillfull?  If the spawn rates increase it will still have the Trak block and will still be a stupid timesink.  But with the way VI did the Luclin keys perhaps we dont want them to revamp this quest and zone heh...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Valka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">If VP is truly being revamped, I would definitely like to see  the key quest left as-is. Whenever any zone gets redone/opened people tend to flock en-masse, and keeping the keys would prevent at least some of the 'zone overload' that causes. <br />
<br />
If the revamped zone is truly worth the bother, people will get their keys, and some of us *cough* already spent our RL week or so aquiring them. <br />
<br />
Basically, if the revamped zone is not worth the bother of getting a key, then why is anyone touching it?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I dont mind doing the quest. And my guild is perfectly willing and able to kill Trak. The only problem is getting Trak. We never get Trak. Someone always kills him first. For this reason we will never go to VP (nor will I ever see a JB bp). For us the VP key quest looks like this<br />
<br />
Kill Trak<br />
<br />
This is the bottleneck for us. Many people in my guild have the whole quest done EXCEPT for Trak. The tooth is everything. The rest is nothing. I would be happy if they just moved the tooth part off Trak to something equally hard but less contested. Maybe make it drop semi rarely off of something in HoT...the way the staff part drops in chardok.</div></div><hr />

Haha, I have destroyed tons of those, hardly rare.<br />
<br />
If you want to kill Trak just go sit down there killing Juggs and Myco's when he's supposed to spawn and gank him when he does spawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Warwin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Rite of Passage?  I'll never have the key, for the single reason i'm not on when Trak is usually killed. with one VERY notable exception.  <br />
  <br />
My guild was killing Juggs for spells one sunday when we found out Trak was waiting for us.  We realized most of us weren't carrying enough resist gear for it to be anything but a suicide (and there were only 15 of us).  But - we had a non-guild bard along, who was a member of a large guild, who let tem know he was up.  Since we were already there, we asked if we could come along, answer was no.  About 35 min later, 26 lvl 60s and a few lvl 59s come trapseing through our camp on the way to Trak.  It took less than a min for them to kill him.<br />
  <br />
Rite of passage?  Naa, just a sign of how big your guild is these days.<br />

Can't get there without a raid?  Then how do people (like me) do it with a single group?</div></div><hr />

<br />
ps. I concur with Wildaar, 26 is definite overkill these days. I think our last run had 18 or so, but YMMV.</div></div><hr />
