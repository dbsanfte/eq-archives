<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was in Pon helping a friend lvl and we ran into some trouble the druid we were sharing WW with decided to pull the whole camp heh. So we ran and zoned out when i came back we were getting setup at gy.<br />
<br />
varlya tells you, This is senior guide varlya your surname is illegal.<br />
<br />
you tell varlya, ***??? (Forgot if you type W T F together it bleeps it out hehe)<br />
<br />
varlya tells you, your name is a title &quot;The&quot; in Thefreespirit makes it a title which is illegal you must change your surname or i will delete it<br />
<br />
So here i am aitting at my comp and u could have knocked me over with a feather,  :eek: I have had the same surname since lvl 20 and now im 65.<br />
Does anyone else see a problem here? I see so many druids with<br />
American Airlines or frogs with Horny Toad so why does my name get deleted?  :confused: To top it all of he didnt give me any time to answer he just deletes it, he said i could be Freespirit but Salas Freespirit? thats dumb<br />
When he ask me if i wanted to change my name to Freespirit i said<br />
<br />
You tell varlya, Omg i hate gms!!!<br />
<br />
varlya tells you, I'll take that as a no.<br />
<br />
LOL!!! :D <br />
<br />
Has this happened to anyone else?</div></div><hr />

Actually read what i posted before u bash me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Silly that they didn't catch it for that long?  Yes.  But really you can't complain much with something that is an obvious violation, it's bound to come up eventually.  A lot of people drive over the speed limit without getting caught for years, but is it the cops fault when they finally do get caught?  I think not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Don't hate the GM's for enforcing policy.  Hate the policy if you want, and you can hate the fact there are so few GM's and that many don't have time to worry about name fixes because they are busy.  Doing stuff like pulling my sorry bearbutt out of an under-world state, recouping someone's items that poofed in a bug, or negotiating an ubermob camp argument between 2 or 3 guilds that involves 150+ players.  And all the other reasons (valid and stupid) everyone files a petition or report.<br />
<br />
If it is any consolation, my bazaar spell mule Enchiewench was name changes without even so much as a tell (AND while I was off-line) to Enciew.  What the heck is Enciew? Owell.  She is only level 1.<br />
<br />
There is no Grandfather clause on player name policies (though there is on Guild names /boggle).  With the rate someone can PL another to 65 nowadays, there is nothing really but your /play time to show you've had your surname for years.<br />
<br />
I personally am the exact opposite.  Elder Prophet for awhile now, and still have no surname.  Never have had one. =P<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

It is a stupid naming policy and a petty, officious guide who went out of their way to enforce it. The surname neither hurt nor offended anybody.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">So report other people with stupid names.  I don't bother reporting them anymore, unless the person pisses me off.  Then they get reported.  I especially relish it if it's their first name, 'cause then no one will know who they are until they tell them.   :D <br />
<br />
I got a &quot;Siratis,&quot; a warrior, the other day, 'cause he KSed my ranger twink.  Sir is not allowed as a part of a first name 'cause it's a title.  Goodbye, Siratis!  Mwahaha.</div></div><hr />

Just like pi.. er, cops lol.  Honestly Thefreespirit is a fine surname, if your name was Kkkkerrrrmittt Defffffrog and it got changed, I'd be cheering lol.. but yours was fine IMO.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">hahahhaha gwain, I used write lists from each play session and petition 6 or 8 names each and just go AFK for a few hours in hopes the petition would hit the GMs.  People that violate the naming policy piss me off, too bad they didn't delete your character instead of just changing it, might make people think twice if they would just ninja /delete</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
 A petty officious guide? They were doing thier job. I'd like to see you put up with what they have to put up with for an hour let alone do it all the time. Things like say.. oh, someone whining about his name because their name was changed and they're on some vendetta to make sure NOONE has the name they want!<br />
 The name doesn't have to hurt OR offend anyone to be against the rules. As so many others have said, read them before spouting off.<br />
<br />
 The entire point of the story tho? Freespirit sounds MUCH better than Thefreespirit. You weren't robbed friend, the guide was trying to enforce a little style upon you :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'm guessing the conversation was effectively over the second you responded with &quot;w t f???&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Personally, I am glad they changed it.  While I admit your name is/was not an overly annoying example.......<br />
<br />
It annoys me that people can't:<br />
<br />
a) take the time to familiarize themselves with the naming policy before they name their character(s)<br />
<br />
b) have some shred of creativity when naming their character(s)<br />
<br />
c) whine when their voilation finally catches up with them.<br />
<br />
Seeing the hundreds, perhaps thousands, of names that are NOT within the naming policy really ticks me off.  It takes away from the high-fanatasy embience that this game is set in.  Seeing Clerics with a myriad of &quot;healing&quot; referrences in their names or Druids and Wizards with &quot;port&quot; referrences shows just how uncreative and unintelligent these people are.  Referrences to modern day society like &quot;Budweisser&quot;, &quot;Krisy Kreemdonuts&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;American Airlines&quot; are simply not needed in a fantasy genre game.<br />
<br />
If you are one of these people.....please find another game to play and spare Norrath from your disruptive existence.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vixy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">There's a simple way around this.<br />
<br />
Tell the GM you will manually input a new last name at a later date, and let them delete it.<br />
<br />
An hour later, when the GM is long gone, type /surname and give yourself your old surname back.<br />
<br />
 :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you dont like the naming policy so much, go play another game.  Noone is forcing you to follow the rules ... doh ... nevermind, yes they are.<br />
<br />
Personally, if we had less people breaking the silly rules, and wasting guides/gms time enforcing stuff like naming policys.  Maybe we would have guides/gms available for real problems.  So next time you need a gm/guide, and none are available.  Blame it on people like Salas, who continue to waste their time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It pisses me off that I have to wait 6 hours to get some stuff back after it poofed during a zone crash. <br />
<br />
Every time I see a name violation, or just a really, really stupid name (mostly frogs, Grrr!!) I find myself wishing upon them a 12 hour stint stuck under the world... And after the guide rescues them, they say &quot;Now, about your surname...&quot;<br />

<br />
I also had a rogue called Pokerinda Bootae... he was being used as a bazaar mule, i come to check the days selling and his name is now &quot;Jokerinda&quot; <br />

once.. To ask a GM to pretend my cousins name was a violation and had to be changed... GM's said they could do that.<br />

seconds.. to change my surname to Popisux (my friends name is popi) for a few minutes.. as a joke.. the said they couldn't do that ;p<br />
<br />
actually 3rd time.. was to get my surname for my rogue.. and that was along time ago :p.. and was actually the first time ..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Matten</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Well, at least they have a naming policy. You should see what names people get away with in Asheron's Call. I've seen Hand Cannon, Sofa King Uber, Fuc Q, Fig Pucker and so many others its not even funny. Not to mention brand names and other trademarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Wuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I had the surname of Wolvecaller, and they didn't say anything about that.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Quinner</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I really get annoyed with the name filter. It won't allow certain Shakespearean names but will allow such gems as Muleboy and Isellalot. I would love to be a GM for an hour in the bazaar. There would be many name changes and/or deletions.<br />
<br />
Salas, I feel your pain for having an unoffensive name changed but Freespirit does look better than Thefreespirit. As a roleplayer, I understand the meaning behind it and appreciate it much more than the former.</div></div><hr />

The point is i didnt want to keep the name cause it was against the rules<br />

The reason i am annoyed is i have had it so long it was a part of me and <br />
to have a Gm show up and just take it from me was just very frustrating.<br />
<br />
The other point i was making was why he decided to change mine which <br />
is like number seven on the naming policy (and yes i did read it) when theres soooo many names that are much more severe violation and so many other problems out there.<br />
<br />
I hate waiting all day for a reply from a guide when i petition and usually all the guide can do for me is tell a gm  :mad: i hate that why did the guide even answer if all he was gonna do was move it up to a gm?<br />

I have been expecting my Monk's name to be taken at anytime.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Gotta say, Freespirit does sound better.  Its the principle of it though, and I hear you.  All the self-righteous people hollering at you to follow the naming rules are missing one point; your surname was Thefreespirit.  Not Getsdapoontang, not Fukverant, not anything of the sort.  They're bringing up the things that piss them (and most of us) off, frogs named Kkkkkerrrrmittt and such.. but your name wasn't anything close to that.  I think what's most telling is that one of the people on his high horse yelling at you for it has as his handle on these boards &quot;Gandalth&quot; or somesuch.

<br />
Character Naming Policy<br />
<br />
Character names in EverQuest should reflect the genre of the game. Original, high-fantasy names are desired. These guidelines apply both to first names and to surnames, and also to the combination of first name and surname.<br />
<br />
The following types of names are inappropriate:.<br />
<br />
1.  Vile, profane, rude, or racist names including common swear words, anatomical references, racial slurs, and homonyms of these words. <br />
Combinations of words that produce an offensive result (e.g. Hugeaz, Tug Mcgroin). <br />
<br />
2.  Names of religious, occult, or significant historic origin (e.g. Jesus, Allah, Satan, Stalin, Angel, Devil, Demon). <br />
<br />
3. Trademarked names of products, services, or concepts (e.g. , Marlboro, Sony, Band-Aid). <br />
<br />
4. Non-fantasy oriented names from popular media. These names can be either fictional (e.g. Rambo, Darthvader) or non-fictional (e.g. Garth Brooks, Pierce Brosnan, Ronald Reagan, Michael Jordan). <br />
<br />
5. Common words and phrases that would not be found in the place and time setting of the game (e.g. Switchblade, Phaser, Toaster, Sloegin, Anyone). This includes references to drug substances or drug related paraphernalia. (e.g. Ecstacy, Cannibis) <br />
<br />
6. Proper names from EverQuest (e.g. Rathe, Karana). This also includes the first or last name of any significant EverQuest NPC (e.g. Dorn, Trumpy, Karn). <br />
<br />
7. Names chosen with the intent or possessed with the effect of harming the reputation of or used to impersonate a Customer or representative of Sony Online Entertainment. <br />
<br />
8. Names containing titles within them, such as, but not limited to: The, Lord, Lady, Master, King, Knight, Sir, Father (e.g. Sirtallon, Lordeagle, Mothermaggy, Darksister). <br />
<br />
9. Fantasy-oriented names that are easily recognized from popular existing media (e.g. Merlin, Gandalf, Belgarath, Drizzt, Tanis). <br />
<br />
10. Names where the combination of the first and last name violate a previous rule. <br />
<br />
For all of the above, misspellings and alternative spellings of the word or words are also unacceptable.<br />
<br />
If a name is found to be in violation of any of the above polices, a member of the Customer Service Team will then use the following process:<br />
<br />
For category 1 or 2 offenses, a member of the Customer Service Team will change the name of the character as soon as it is discovered. You may be notified of this name change either in-game or by email. <br />
<br />

It pisses me off that I have to wait 6 hours to get some stuff back after it poofed during a zone crash. <br />
<br />
:)<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean you've actually gotten stuff back courtesy of a GM?  Heck, I haven't even gotten a response from a GM for my last couple of petitions (one two months ago and one a couple of weeks ago) for loosing items after a zone pop.  Granted the items were trivial spell quest items, but nonetheless it cost quite a bit of play time to re-acquire them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vixy .. you can't use /surname after it's been removed by a GM.  They put a &quot;_&quot; there so you have to re-petition to get a new one.  I guess they figure if you screw up with a surname once, you don't get a second chance to pick another heh.<br />
<br />
I do think that those whose names were taken when phrasenames were against the rules should get a special consideration with choosing a name now that phrasenames are &quot;allowed.&quot;  A lot of people got hosed back then :(</div></div><hr />

This is really what i wanted to know, this makes alot of since as to why they singled me out when its number 8 out of 10 on the naming policy.</div></div><hr />

False. I remember a monk named &quot;Bakdat&quot; on my server. They removed his surname &quot;assup&quot; and he'd /surname it back later...did it like 3-4 times. Last I knew he still had it.<br />
<br />
I'm partial to non-rp names myself. I got sick of those the 2nd or 3rd time I saw &quot;windmoon leafprancer&quot; or some other variation. <br />
<br />
I get a kick out of things like &quot;Roley&quot; and &quot;Poley&quot; (a 2-boxed set of ogre sk's that used to be on my server).</div></div><hr />

Sorry i have to agree with the peeps here, guide was doing you a favor, the changed name would have sounded much better =P<br />
<br />
Titles are suposed to be rare and special things, the reason they change names such as the above is because if everyone was walking around with Thegreat or Thewise etc it would just cheapen the legit ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Naming policy is a joke.<br />
<br />
If they were serious they would pull every name from the DB and make everyone that has a name that violates the naming policy change them.  Right now it's a judgment call on the part of the GM's and we all know how fair and impartial they are.</div></div><hr />

Believe it or not, I didn't associate the name with The Radar. Honestly, it never occured to me. A GM pointed it out to me and told me my name had to change.<br />
<br />
Since then I have named another character on another server the same name because by luck I found a name that's good for a laugh, till it gets changed. Honestly, if you're attached to a name, make sure it's allowable because they can and will change it no matter how long you've had it. If you're not worried about losing it, go for a weird name. It takes all sorts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a rare day nowadays when I see someone wihtout a retarded name. Back when I started playing in '99 they would ****ing charge your ass for having a name that even remotely resembled a word known to mankind. <br />
<br />
My original name was Karnor Sathir. I played with that for about 35/30 lvls and then it had to be changed. I tried once to persuade the GM not to, by saying &quot;what about all those people that know me under this name&quot;, but I knew that my name was a violation to the rules and naturally dealt with it.</div></div><hr />

I've seen Ateleport Forhire on Povar as well. It kinda griped me when they allowed that and wouldn't allow Atraedes, my druid, Dunemaster but let Dunewarrior through. I mean, really, what's the difference between the 2?<br />
<br />
Oh well, it's their game and their rules. If I don't want to play in their sandbox, I'll take my shovel and bucket (and money) and go elsewhere. Unfortunately, I'm addicted so I deal with it.<br />

One contains the word Master, which could be lumped in with lord, sir, lady, etc, as a title.  Pretty clear cut.</div></div><hr />

What in the hell are you talking about?!?!?  I never said anything about when you get your surname.  I was merely saying he was &quot;digging a deeper hole&quot; by the point he made that because he had the name for so long that that suddenly made it alright that he had violated the naming policy.<br />
