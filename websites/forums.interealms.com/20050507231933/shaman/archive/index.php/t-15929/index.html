<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Toxox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Am I figuring this right with the group bonus?<br />
<br />
Solo = 100% xp<br />
Duo = 120% / 2 xp per person or 60% per<br />
<br />
So lets say you have a mob that takes 4 banes to kill and nets 4% xp solo. If you have 2 shaman that are same level casting 2 banes each you kill the mob twice as fast. Assuming unlimited pulls the two shaman then would be making 120% xp in the same amount of time. <br />
<br />
Is this accurate?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You're putting too much time into figuring this out.   The fastest experience you can make is doing it the way you have the most fun with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vahnisia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That sounds right. It sure does help promote grouping, just like the game was designed to be. Group up and you can kill faster than you can solo hence faster experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes, that's the right calculation.  The trick is finding that unlimited supply of dark blues and staying efficient on the kill rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yep that is correct and the group xp bonuses were one of the smartest changes they made to the game to date.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gafasiycarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is no group exp bonus that was a lie by sony to encourage grouping because soloing is too powerful, I saw a guy solo 1-65 in 1 day because he had a FBSS</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Mojo, Gloriana, anyone...can we please get this guy banned? He is obviously nothing more than a troll.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gafasiycarb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Acctually I am a Barbarian, you don't know my character</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">LOL I kinda think he's funny.  Kinda . . . nah he sux.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Callir Spiritwalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">LOL Land, you crack me up :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Even if your supposed to get more xp in a group then solo i havent seen it pan out<br />
<br />
pov golem gives my 1 1/2 blue of aa xp solo but grped the bar barely moves</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's pretty simple:<br />
<br />
Solo Group XP = 1.000x per kill<br />
2-group = 1.2x/2 = 0.600x<br />
3-group = 1.4x/3 = 0.467x<br />
4-group = 1.6x/4 = 0.400x<br />
5-group = 1.8x/5 = 0.360x<br />
6-group = 1.8x/5 = 0.360x  (not a typo, still divided by 5)<br />
<br />
So, obviously your cut per kill is going to drop as you gain more people.  The question is -- how much faster will you kill?  If your group of 5 or 6 is killing at least 3 more times the number of mobs you'd be killing solo (which is usually the case) you're better off grouping.<br />
<br />
Note: I said USUALLY.  It depends on the group, the environment, and your ability.</div></div><hr />
