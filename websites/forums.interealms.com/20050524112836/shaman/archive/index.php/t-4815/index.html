<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Does the iksar happy dance. Dinged it about an hr ago. Felt more relief for the most part at first than anything. I was getting on such autopilot killing shrooms in FG and didnt want to stop for to long and have to deal with breaking the patch up again since i couldnt single pull usually. Soo it got to the point i knew when every buff was going to drop and which shroom i was going to be on when it did. Now the debate. 100% regular exp to finish 60 up or do a split for aa?</div></div><hr />

As far as xp, it moves quickly at 60. Very quickly! Put AA at 50% and you'll have a full yellow of 60 in 2 hours. &lt;--- not kidding.<br />
<br />
Try to get at least a yellow and a half, so you don't lose your level on death. Then, go full AA.<br />
<br />
As far as shrooms go, at 60 you can easily solo pull them with slow. You will never get an add even if you pull from the middle of the patch. Just don't walk too close. :p</div></div><hr />

I did a full yellow aa now set for split 90/10  (aa/exp)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>FloppyDisks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I would suggest you fill 60 up completely asap.  Once they remove level 59 filling up 60 will take a lot more exp then now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Floppy -- I don't think it'll work that way.<br />
<br />
Let's say you fill up the level 60 bar by accumulating 20 million experience points. Suddenly level 60 becomes 100 million large. You're now 20% of the way in.<br />
<br />
The question is whether your experience is stored server-side as a percentage of the total needed or as a hard number. Most likely a number since mobs give xp as a number.<br />
<br />
Does anybody remember what happened with Kunark's release? Was level 50 incredibly tiny ... and did it then increase in size?</div></div><hr />
