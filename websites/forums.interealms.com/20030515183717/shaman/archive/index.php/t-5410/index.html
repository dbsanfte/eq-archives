<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blamblam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">About to do my final epic battle and just wanna know what exactly is needed for doing Rak other than the obvious magicians and healers and approx. how many hps he has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">He appears to have alot but that's because the 2-3 mage pets take a while to kill him.<br />
<br />
The main thing is to control agro - also get everyone's attention and go through the encounter in raid channel before you start. Even if people know, this is what is expected and how we are going to tackle Rak this time..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you are open minded you can do fine without a single Mage.<br />
<br />
I have Tanked Rak with 2 clerics and 2 rogues, thats one of the 60 rogues tanking btw.<br />
<br />
Also have killed with Warrior, Cleric, Rogue. Chanter.<br />
<br />
So long as your melee DPS is decent Rak's AE doesn't cycle fast enough to overwhelm the healing output of 1 single 56+ cleric in ordinary gear, fight lasts maybe 2-3 mins Tank will need 2-3 CH's and the Rogue backstabbing will need 1-2 CH's, Shaman can spot heal too of course.<br />
<br />
At a guess he has less than 32k HP.</div></div><hr />
