<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most oow zones repopped today with mitigation back in. Looks like only the weakest mobs such as WoS first section are mostly slowable, past that it was back to partial, including all the named mobs. Didn't have time to check the other zones.<br />
As usual no warning was given,thx for the lost experience.<br />
Well it was nice to get a brief trip back to our heyday, I enjoyed it while it lasted.</div></div><hr />

I don't group in OOW that much to be honest (mostly due to trains, which is the reason I don't group in BOT), but the slow changes were pretty exciting, and I had actually wanted to go out there and check it out. Bleh. :mad: I guess it was bound to be &quot;fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Myzr: <br />
Seems like more see-invis mobs were added to Dranik's Scar, as well. I was jaunting around looking for the Ukun Slavemaster (or whatever the name is, the one that's out toward the Bloodfields zone-in for the epic ukun skin) because I really hate camping an area that people run through ... and was promptly killed by something. It killed me so fast I didn't even see what it was, and by the time I popped back in the POK, the OOC spam had already pushed it off my spam window. Previously I'd been able to run through there with no invis problems. Perhaps I accidentally stumbled upon a see-invis named? <br />

Oh well, it was too good to last I guess.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Aniha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've been 2-boxing the hive (68 shaman, 65 rogue) for several days. Yesterday I could tank the named with 2 Quiescence for the entire fight. Today I cannot tank even a normal rat (heh almost died before i realized something had changed).  Be careful - the difference between yesterday and today for the hive is substantial. <br />
<br />
FYI: I have switched to root-rotting which works fine on normal mobs, but Named do summon. It is still doable but if root breaks and you are interrupted a few times that could be all she wrote depending on your gear. Rogue &amp; Dog DPS useless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">None here are suprised by this change... and it probably isnt a truly bad thing. Full slow makes this stuff totally trivial, and trivial in the long run isnt fun.<br />
<br />
I feel the right balance is at Mostly slowable. I feel I contribute when something is Mostly slowable, and that still makes it more interesting than totally slowable. Some mobs should still mitigate to Partially (to keep things interesting), but if all mobs mitigate to this level it makes slow worthless, and classes (like ours) that rely on it equally worthless.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Sounds like a mixed bag.  Obviously they feel they went overboard with the mitigation removal a few days ago (which to be honest I think surprised all of us) and are now trying to find a balance.  Fine with me.  If I can still slow/heal in the easy zones I don't mind taking another healer or slower along for the harder zones.  Hopefully they will find a way to keep the challenge and feeling of progression without totally minimizing us.<br />
<br />
Also, would be nice if folks posted what they are experiencing in the different zones, that way we will know what to expect and be better prepared as we explore the new zones.<br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I wonder if this somehows relates to the reports of the changes they made affects older zones. Maybe this was unintentional and they have reinstated the old system while they fix it correctlyf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yeah!  Let's quit the game over something that's been a part of it for almost 2 years.  That'll show 'em! <br />
<br />
Seriously, get over it.  You'll still get groups and you can still solo things.  The sky doesn't have to fall everyday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Fascaser</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Turning on and off migation in OoW without warning is truly &quot;sloppy&quot; coding by SoE if it is a mistake.   If it is intended, it is mind boggling.  Talk about playing with peoples minds.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, what is new about steath patches within EQ?    And why would anyone get upset about it after all these years.   If you continue to play EQ, you know that it's really &quot;Everpatch&quot;.   Adjust, Adapt, and Overcome.   <br />
<br />
As to Enc's complaining about not getting groups, avoid the group that can't make it without Mezzing in WoS.  Even with partial slow on mobs, anyone with a bit of gear, HP/buffs, and Defense should be able to Tank a Add.   If your group is constantly getting adds (other than trains)- you need to get a better puller.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I don't know about &quot;trying to find a balance&quot;. sounds to me like they went exactly back to where it was before the mitigation disappeared. common stuff was &quot;mostly&quot; and named was &quot;partially&quot;. which would suggest it was an accident as opposed to actually trying to change something to help shamans god forbid.</div></div><hr />

Even before this change back I was sometimes getting instances with mitigators and ones without at 66. Usually there'd be no mitigators, but at least once the one I got all bats and rats were mitigating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats not it, I've always had 6 and I always get the expedition so its not group # or level. Seems random to me so far. Judging by the fact that trash in the open zones mitigates again though I have a feelling that instead of 1/5 instanced zones having some mitigation it'll be more like 4/5.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Honeslty I am not suprised at all by the return to mitigation, because when they removed it the zone became a joke. Shaman-Monk duo's farming nameds was becoming a regular occurance. You could pull 3 and not even bother mezzing or off-tank/rooting because once slowed, it was trivial<br />
<br />
Mobs are also hitting harder, and I am pretty sure aggro radius has been increased. I am actually glad in some ways. At LEAST the zone has a bit more challange to it than the snore-fest it became. <br />
<br />
I honestly do not see this affectig Shaman too much overall. Maybe a minor hit in the &quot;LFG&quot; crowd, but overall, Shaman are still a very viable class in any group. Mitigation sucks, to be sure, but I prefer it to just straight out upping the DPS of the mobs by some factor that would make it exactly the same without mitigation. <br />
<br />
Nihil, Trushar and Bane are still very powerful tools to add to any group. Most pulls can easily be Malosed on uncoming, making first-cast Nihil an automatic. Trushar is enough to keep up with the additional damage the mob puts out due to the slow-mitigation easily. Yeah, I am gonna have to work a bit harder, use a bit more mana, but so what. It was a joke before, I would never go below 80 mana even if I tried.<br />
<br />
Time will tell if Shaman lose groups. Took me about 10 seconds to get a group when I shouted LFG this morning. /shrug we will see what its like next week, but I am not gonna start bitching too much yet.</div></div><hr />

but expedition level doesnt go by who gets the expedition, it goes by the group leader; possibly other factors as well.  but most of all, the group leader</div></div><hr />

<br />
409 / 6 = 68.16<br />

If Sony wasn't lazy (And winged pigs flew out of my butt) and actually added a layer or two to the instancing then you very well may be getting a lower level dungeon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I was hoping that all those /feedbacks had actually made an impact :(  Sounds like it was just an &quot;oops&quot;... I wish they had made their mind up on all of this stuff before releasing OOW.  It's getting old buying an expansion pack because of the features and then only getting to actually take advantage of 0% - 50% of them.  <br />
<br />
The things that bother me the most are the task system being nearly unusable and the 1 zone targetted towards the 45+ crowd that now has roaming see invis 1k hitters that aggro half way across the zone (DS).  I understand that these are for the new epics...but making several zones nearly unusable so 1 or 2 mobs can be difficult enough for these quests is a little rude.  Why couldn't they have done some of this stuff in instanced or isolated areas so everyone in the zone doesn't have to stop what they are doing and just leave or even worse be completely cut off from entering the zone due to instant death?<br />

<br />
I am betting shaman ability to group in WoS is way down.<br />

First, the mobs were over-mitigating. People are whining. They remove ALL mitigation. People whine. So what do they do? Find a &quot;middle compromise&quot; ground? Make some &quot;mostly&quot; instead of fully or partially? <br />
<br />
Nope. The put it right back where it was. And hey, looky here, no need for re-coding anything, already got that version of WoS on the back up HDs. SWEET!<br />
<br />
/Shrug, personally I could care less anymore. I have pretty much come to the conclusion that no matter WHAT they do, people are gonna bitch about it. No matter what. Guess what guys, we are probably the smallest demographic to worry about being pissed. <br />
<br />
But I am gonna say it again, fully-slowed version of WoS was a TOTAL JOKE of a zone. Mitigation makes it a bit more challanging. They might went overboard, but I am sure there is some middle ground that can be reached if they want to bother investing the programming time into it. Guess they are trying to decide whether to pay the progrmmers or just suck up the loss of the disgruntled.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">I can understand them not wanting a shaman main healing and slowing in say MGP or higher but the mobs in Wos should at the most mitigate to the point where they are mostly slowed. Mobs in the lower zone instances like draniks (beyond nameds) really have no right not fully slowing. I can understand ramping up the mitigation the deeper you go but wos experience really isn't very good - theres no reason to make the mobs only partially slowable. <br />
<br />
I am just glad i did not buy oow with my alts account - i was going to duo with him again but since they overly changed this back there is no reason for me to bother with that. would be a stretch to even duo with him in the lower end dranik instances. <br />
<br />
Further proof that soe considers the shaman an expendible class. Hell it was nice to feel useful for a few days again... man makes me miss the good old days - I was enjoying being welcome in groups again. Back to guild only groups again i suppose - or hours of lfg :o <br />

We are the only priest class that has to have crit heals land at the right time in order to have a chance to keep a tank up. If they want named mobs to mitigate that is fine but when trash mobs take your most powerful weapon and reduce it the point where it is not worth bothering to use  there is an issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a question for ya.  Since all mobs are mitigating slow and our healing ability is scaled off of clerics healing based on slow.  Shouldn't that mean that our heal spells in OoW should scale up towards clerics as much as the mitigation level?  <br />
<br />
Why are our OoW spells still the same % they were in the past now that all npc mitigate slow?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u72"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p72">I realy like the damage i cause to mobs atm. Today, in runs of dranik, I was doing up about 8K damage on mobs and our group was SK, rogue, wiz, bard, cleric and me. <br />
<br />
Our rain has the same base damage as sunstrike, our poison nuke base damage 925. I was able to cast 2 rains and 2 nukes on most most, after slow and malos, on single pulls. Of course, if wiz had a big crit and/or rogues was using a discipline, I would not cast the second rain. with malos in, very rare resists on rain and ultra rare on nukes. I never went under 60% mana. Bard was not able to mez (missing songs) so we had to root some mobs for CC (got up to 5 mobs in camp).<br />
<br />
Don't tell me shamans have no influence in groups, i call it BS. casters are happy to nuke a malosed mob, slow is priceless (even if partial), i can deal a good bit of damage without draining my mana. Of course I have my GoD slow and that helps a ton.<br />
<br />
I think shamans are the ones that benefit the most from new AA abilities gained with OoW expansion. Our new heal is nice, got a 5140 crit heal today, I was happy. :) <br />
It is not a partialy slowed mob that is going to spoil my fun. Soloing a named in WoS was just wrong, <br />

I have always considered the 75% slow as being game breaking so I can't complain when there is mitigation. I remember kunark, velious, luclin days when slowed mob = dead mob. I remember wipes only due to the fact slow did not land. Slow had a way too big influence on game at that momment.<br />
<br />
Slow is not the only thing that i consider &quot;game breaking&quot;, snare is overpowered too imo and they should add the same kind of mitigation in it. they took care of charm already so nothing to say there now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">Frakass, no offense, but your example just basically showed that you were a beastlord.  You slowed and then did dps.  Sure malos is nice, but worth a group slot?<br />

i noticed this today when i used drowzy.<br />
<br />
the mob's were doubling, not quadding i could time the hits, and the ocassional bash or kick.<br />
<br />
not to bitch or anything but ...<br />
<br />
sont has ass rammed its customers alot lately, just when people start getting good gear, having fun, and just all around exploring, they nerf it up.<br />
<br />
whats wrong with people getting NToV equivalent gear ?  5 to 4 seperate stats and 90 hps / 90 mana so game breaking ? if so then just remove them all, don't tease us with them.<br />
<br />
i was getting lots of tells when slow was landing for full, wich was exciting, now its fallen way down, enchanters are premium on drinal, if your lfg in WoS as a chanter, you will get at least 10 tells for kei and 6 group tells, how do i know this ?<br />
i botted my friends enchanter and i wasn't lfg, i had people offering me 5k pp to help camp named and be cc and get to roll on loot.<br />

its disgusting.<br />

Boo Hoo, you cant have a Shaman-Tank-Wiz-Wiz-Wiz-Wiz group in WoS anymore. You gotta have 2 healers per group. <br />
<br />
All the people who keep saying that Shaman just FIND things to whine about are right. This class is the most pessimistic I have seen. Shaman are STILL very powerful in groups, even in WoS. <br />
<br />
SOE has decided THEY DONT WANT SHAMAN MAIN-HEALING!!! HOW MANY F-ING CLUES DO YOU NEED!! DEAL WITH IT!!<br />
<br />
Was in a WoS group yesterday, Druid main healing, me back-up healing, SK tanking, Necro and Mage for pet-offtanks, etc etc, went smooth as **** through a goose. Heavan forbid I actually have to PLAY THE GAME now instead of just sitting there and letting 2 Trushars heal the MA on Named and not needing to cast anything else. <br />
<br />
The zone was a JOKE unmitigated. Did SOE go too far? Maybe. Personally I dont think so, but I have my Gates spells and some Time gear, so perhaps I am not a good example of an &quot;average&quot; shaman. But UNMITIGATED IT WAS A JOKE!! Wake up people. This is a GAME, a game that changes and evolves and flows with the times. Bitch if you want too, but DO NOT ASK FOR DIABLO 2!! <br />
<br />
But hey, if they moved all the mitigation up a level in WoS, guess what. There would STILL be a pile of Shaman here bitching and moaning. <br />
<br />
You cant please all of the people all of the time. SOE shouldnt even try. Instances are still VERY doable with 2 or 3, or even soloable with one good player. WoS mobs are still very farmable, with EASE. MPG is no place to go if your tank doent have 10K hps, 1500 AC and a buttload of Defensive AAs, but a druid/shaman is FINE there. <br />
<br />
Heres a tip for all you whiners. Get a few levels, go do the Gates trials, go to KT, get the 2 COMMON dropped spell-runes there, Nihil and Trushar. Sometimes the named in KT will drop BOTH of those spell-runes. The XP there is mighty good, too. Then go hit WoS with those 2 spells and see how you do.<br />
<br />
And dont start with the &quot;Why should I have to get my spells to be a better shaman&quot; crap. Gates sucks. Getting the spells sucks. Getting KT flagged sucks. TOUGH IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOURSELF. Vxed and Tipt are probably the best XP in the game for 66-68, even without a chanter. Suck it up people. Stop trying to convert this game into some Diablo clone where you can just zone your Sorceress in and run around killing everything at will. Thats fun, for about 5 minutes. Then it starts getting old old old. Unmitigated WoS was fun, for about 5 minutes. Then it was just . . . ridiculously easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Been there, tried it, never worked. Killed Mobs without end to make nameds spawn, killed nameds, never a rune dropped. Even changed camps.<br />
Try it now, go to KT and try for a group. On Drinal KT is sooo deserted, it aint funny. And I cannot drag guildmates there all the time because they want XP the most. And XP compared to most ooW is crap in KT, especially with the higher risk (mobs hurt a lot more in KT than in WoS).<br />
Anyway, I never have problems in WoS after the change, what bugs me without end is the Dranik's Hollows change. Finally I found a nice place to farm some runes to get my spells .. without KSing and training. And now I got to bring a full group, hurray.<br />
But I will suck it up and carry on regardless, as long as guildmates want shaman in groups.<br />

<br />
For the non raiders it wasnt rediculously easy. You know the ones that the loot is actually for? <br />
<br />
It was a challange for me an mine. And yet again they balance it based off the 5% of the customers that are plowing through it after they get the loots they nerf everything.<br />
<br />
The game was fun again for me. I was enjoying myself and felt like I was truly contributing. So much so that I started wanted to roleplay more again because there was joy in playing where I was useful. <br />
<br />
That joy is once again mitagated. Now If I want to do something challanging It is requred to bring along another Priest if you are a shaman. <br />
<br />
A cleric can heal a group with no backup just fine. So can a druid. Shaman can't without exceptional gear Or exceptional player or both.<br />
<br />
They do not depend on slow to land first to be able to be effective. We do. They have to cast buff before fight. Then simply heal and let another take over the job of slowing. I guess we can start doing that . Lets make sure to get a beastlord or a chanter to slow for us So we can heal. <br />
<br />
One tank if fine in a group But not one priest if it is a shaman. One Wigglefinger can help a group immensly be it mage wizard Necromancer or Enchanter.  One hybrid of any flavor can add tremendously to flexiblity and overall group usage. But to do challanging content yet again You are requred to get a Druid or a cleric and preferrably a cleric before you ask that shaman to group. And if you have a beastlord or a chanter you do not even need the shaman. <br />
<br />
When will we get in nice red letters constanly hitting home that other classes are only partialy effective. I would like to see it. <br />
<br />
This isnt a slap in the face. <br />
<br />
It is a kick in the nuts.<br />
<br />
<br />
The raiders will be fine thier margin of error is still covered by thier gear overpowerment.<br />
<br />
My gear doesnt close the gap.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I want you all to think about this for a moment. The flip side of our situaton is simple. What could happen so that a cleric could join a group and instead of main healing he was required to have a druid or shaman heal so he could do damage. What kind of crap is this. <br />
<br />
Our healing ability is directly figured on 75% slow. Directly. There is zero argument on this. With mitagation on every mob we just got nerfed by 25 to 75 % of our main god damn duty in a group. (Which is to keep the group alive.)  We keep groups alive by slowing first. Then healing. It is what we all do. <br />
<br />
I do not give a **** if someone things the damn game is too easy with a 75% slow. If they are pulling singles and waiting for the perfect god damn combonation of classes or cercumstances to come about then apply every class to thier full potential on a singular target of course it is going to be simple.  They are not looking for challange they are looking for the optimum path to advancement. Min maxing. They will always be stretching the bondries of that path as well.  75% slow for me allowed me to play fast and loose with my acceptable margin of error<br />
 and I could pull 2-3 at a time and make the game fun again. Now I am forced into a singular role and singular idea of game mechanics due to the acceptable margin of error. <br />
<br />
The extra 25-50 % of mitagation did that. It is making the game more narrow in scope to a single view of playing. It is limiting the game. And I DO NOT LIKE IT. <br />
<br />
It makes the game more simple because there is only one god damned way to play. Big tank. Big healing. Controlled pulls always. It structures the game to a rediculous amount and for someone who likes to make challange by pulling more or taking oddball combonations to things it is simply not as fun anymore. It is limiting the game and forcing all things into cookie cutter combos. There is no bredth to the game when all that matters is hitpoints. And DPs and healing percetages. <br />
<br />
The min maxers win again. We are in thier world now. It doesnt matter if it is fun or not. <br />

And that my friends about sums it up. SoE never announced we would get a main healer role, they have never even lead us to believe that i dont think. I can think of one offical statment from anyone saying that Shaman would be main healers, only that out healing would be looked at.<br />
<br />
For a long time now i think the healing vision behind this new path thats been laid out over the last 2 years is that there is one true healing class in the game and thats the cleric. When you talk about the next 2 healers, which is the druid and shaman, then you essential take the cleric and split up the abilities. Druids get direct healing and we get Healing over time, a trend that started with Torpor.<br />
<br />
Blazz is right, the time to move past expecting changes is gone i think. Its good to fight for you class abilites, please do, keep progressing, but i think the healing issue is dead and if you plan on not hitting the &quot; end billing&quot; button, then you have three choices.<br />
<br />
1. Except this fact posted above and deal with your role as a BACK UP healer and enjoy the game and have fun being who you are.<br />
<br />
2. Be unhappy and complain to the point that you cant stand to play the game, but cant bring yourself to quit, so your locked in a cycle of unhappiness and disgust with the game.<br />
<br />
3. Re-role another class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea it might suck that this is what it boils down to and yea it might be nice to main heal as effectivly as a druid, but i truly believe its not in the cards for the shaman and have believe it for some time now.</div></div><hr />

His position hasnt changes jaidin. Its not a question of what we want is the point of that post i believe. Its a question of what SoE is going to give us and triyng to accept that and move on with it. This healing fight has gone on for a long long time now and it has not gotten us anywhere  we need to be to heal with the current slowing situation going on. This last patch where they added back slow mitigation is obviously how they are dealing with slow and i think in their heads, screwing over 1 class is worth balancing the game out for everyone else.<br />
<br />
It just sucks we are that class.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you feel differently please explain why, cause i hear from the devs that the current healing ratios are fine, that shaman healing is satisfactory or whatever Rytan said and we see druids getting boosts to healing while we still just move along a progression path set in place many moons ago, actualy its gotten worse ratio wise.<br />
<br />
Tell us where your hope comes from, so that everyone can share in it bro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In OoW we make a good back up healer but in GoD we just seem pointless in that role.<br />
<br />
Incorrect. I make a good main healer in OOW (instanced and WOS) and have main-healed Kod'Taz groups, with and without GOD heals. I'm no cleric or druid, but I did all right, and nobody died. It was not easy and was rather hard on the gimpy mana pool I've got, but nobody died. Suits me. <br />
<br />
The slow mitigation to partial slow is annoying as hell in the instanced dungeons. It got to the point where I bothered slowing named only, since they were yellow-con. The rest of the time, I was dotting and nuking and patch-healing here and there. I haven't bothered going to WOS or NC lately, because those zones have become havens for the morons on the server who just graduated from BOT High with a degree in Training Mobs.<br />
<br />
The zone was a JOKE unmitigated. Did SOE go too far? Maybe. Personally I dont think so, but I have my Gates spells and some Time gear, so perhaps I am not a good example of an &quot;average&quot; shaman. But UNMITIGATED IT WAS A JOKE!! Wake up people. This is a GAME, a game that changes and evolves and flows with the times. Bitch if you want too, but DO NOT ASK FOR DIABLO 2!!<br />
<br />
Heres a tip for all you whiners. Get a few levels, go do the Gates trials, go to KT, get the 2 COMMON dropped spell-runes there, Nihil and Trushar. Sometimes the named in KT will drop BOTH of those spell-runes. The XP there is mighty good, too. Then go hit WoS with those 2 spells and see how you do.<br />
<br />
And dont start with the &quot;Why should I have to get my spells to be a better shaman&quot; crap. Gates sucks. Getting the spells sucks. Getting KT flagged sucks. TOUGH IT OUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPROVE YOURSELF. Vxed and Tipt are probably the best XP in the game for 66-68, even without a chanter. Suck it up people. Stop trying to convert this game into some Diablo clone where you can just zone your Sorceress in and run around killing everything at will. Thats fun, for about 5 minutes. Then it starts getting old old old. Unmitigated WoS was fun, for about 5 minutes. Then it was just . . . ridiculously easy.<br />

I have Qvic arms, YM + healing mastery 3 and the average heal is about 2.7k(5.4k is a chunk away from &quot;6k regularly&quot; and you are still missing 2 levels of adept mastery).<br />
Post some logs of those 10-12k damage easy please. If fights lasted a minute, you'd do 200 dps after malos and slow(12,000/60). <br />
<br />
Bull****.<br />
<br />
What you are doing is slowing like a Bard, Enchanter, Beastlord and offering sub par DPS. <br />

First of all, if you look back, I was NEVER a big proponent of the Shaman As Main Healers movement. I said we needed some help. I was a proponent of some change. Didint have to be healing, heck my main desire was a MODERATLY bigger heal, and a MODERATLY bigger nuke. I dont WANT to become a Cleric or Druid in a group, stand, /cast 1, /sit. <br />
<br />
We asked for some help, and we got some. I think we are very viable in OoW. I get tells non-stop for groups when I log in. WoS, Instances, PG, whatever. Mitigation or no, people WANT shamans. <br />
<br />
But at this point Jaid, I am trying to be realistic and move on. The healing arguement has been done to death. You think SOE hasnt heard a  word we have said? Come on. They heard EVERY word, and decided NOT to adjust it. Sorry, buts its time to &quot;Accept the Things I Cannot Change.&quot; Maybe you need the &quot;Wisdom to know the Difference.&quot;<br />
This healing fight has gone on for a long long time now and it has not gotten us anywhere  we need to be to heal with the current slowing situation going on. <br />
I agree mostly Lit, but I disagree with the last part. We are EXTREMELY solid back up healers in this content. In fact, we are very solid choices in most groups. Not many groups are running around in PG or even WoS with 1 healer anymore. 1+, soem form of back-up. Back up can be a tank (paladin), slower (shaman), snare-nuker (druid), whatever, depending on your groups need. Anyone rolling into PG with 1 healer is gonna do some CR time. <br />
What I do not appreciate is how he makes a very aggressive post that is in opposition to his efforts the last several months.  It's ok to realize we can't win, but don't mouth off about how the rest of us, who were right by his side, are crybabies.<br />
The problem is the crying has reached EPIC propoprtions. WoS has mitigation now. Adjust and deal with it. Expansion hasnt even been out ONE MONTH and already I see &quot;Hands in the air, this blows&quot;. How many of you were in BoT in the first month of PoP? gimee a break Jaid. The problem is so many people playing this game are so used to getting spoon-fed everything on a silver platter. PLAY THE FROAKIN GAME. Are you gonna sit ther and tell me you CANT get spells, or you CANT get groups, or you CANT get XP in OoW? Give it a rest. Wos unmitigated was Diablo 2 at its finest. Zone in, play an hour, everyone walks out with a Rune and a 20K pp item. Blech. Not even a month old, sheesh. <br />
Geez, might be easy for you. I've tried trials repeatedly, my friend barely can tank the trash mobs and named are completely out of the question. Try taking a 7.5k pally through the trials and let me know if you can do that. I'm not going to ditch him just so I can go farm my spells either, cause I'm not a jackass.<br />
No thanks, I will find another tank and build a better group. Your friend can be off-tank. If you cant make this adjustment, then I am sorry, you wont be seeing KT. Dunno what else to say. We are back to this same old crap again. Diablo 2 is the game you want. Log in, go anywhere, get anything, over and over, fun fun fun. This is Everquest. You may need to do some things different. Find some new places to get gear, levels, etc THEN try KT again. Thougth I said that, actually. I dont remember saying &quot;Take your 65 bazaar pre-Gaets geared 7500 hp Paladin and whup Tipt&quot;. Might take you longer. Might have to add some outside people. Might have to ::GASP:: Play The Game!<br />
<br />
Yeah I was abrasive as hell in that post. You bet. Its EXHAUSTING to see this barage of whining and moanig when the game is actually MUCH MUCH better. We HAVE some good spells in OoW, GO GET EM. Cant solo em? Cant get em all in the first 3 weeks of release? Have to actually work a little now? <br />

The big picture here Giac is that you have this &quot;ideal model&quot; of a group in your head and Shaman dont fit into it. Last I checked, Bards, Chanters and BLs suck at healing. Maybe at your uber level your groups are rolling through PG and RS with only 1 cleric or 1 druid as healers, but most of us arent even CLOSE to trying that. <br />
<br />
There is a DEFINITE group slot for Shamans out there. We arent the best class in the game, but geez, we are SO much better off now than we were in Gates or late PoP. I always see people saying the same old things over and over, like &quot;Get a BL slower, then just get a druid for your back up healer, and you got a better group&quot;. Yeah? SO WHAT! Just did 7 hours with a group that consisted of Warrior, Paladin, Shaman, Chanter, Cleric, Druid. had a blast. Prolly coulda done 2 or 3 more mobs per round with a Wizard instead of me, or a Rogue instread of teh chanter, or whatever, but SO WHAT. <br />
<br />
My friends and I play like this. &quot;Who is looking for group? Ok, we got Warrior, Shaman, Rogue, Wizard, good start, GROUP SEEKING CLERIC OR DRUID + ONE OTHER, ANY CLASS&quot;. You and your friends can sit there and build the &quot;Picture Perfect Model Group&quot; all you want. I am satisfied with my current role in the current stage of this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">Shamans make a difference, even in WoS and MPG still.<br />
<br />
We have a new 7% avoidance buff, a new 5% damage mod buff, and with Daludas and Balance have more than enough tools for Omens.  The encounters have changed...fights can be a minute in duration or more, which caters to our very strengths.<br />
<br />
Prior to Omens the issue was that mobs die so fast that conjuctively with mitigation that straight healing was a better alternative, thats no longer the case.  Most experience mobs are slowing to 37.5% for a shaman...over the course that makes a huge impact in terms of healing required, mana regen rates, and aggro management in terms of hate acquired from fast heals.<br />
<br />
Additionally amongst the slow classes, where we now find ourselves competing with BL's, Enc's and to a lesser degree bards (who are frequenty on track/pull duty) we again have the tools.  CC is now better handled on the pull than it is in camp, especially in wide open zones.  Once a shaman acquires Balance no class in game even comes close to our ability to slow mobs quickly and efficiently almost regardless of level.  In WoS alone sans Malos, at level 66, mobs are slowing 95% of the time on a single cast, and even farther into the zone against elites are slowing 80 percent of the time sans Malos...with Malos precast I've yet to have a Balance resist in WoS!<br />
<br />
From a damage perspective the duration of fights helps us immeasureably.  With a tooled out puppy, if I'm on slow/malos/damage duty I have no issue dishing ~160 - 180dps per mob from a direct damage standpoint.  From indirect means shamans now have better attack and augmentation buffs than any other class in game with the possible exception of bards who remain in camp soley for that purpose.<br />
<br />
From a healing perspective it simply means that groups are looking for a slower and secondary healer to be present...and shamans fill both roles more than adequately.  The days of Ikkinz pre-nerf are gone, where our class was inadequate to filling a secondary healer role.  With our ability to land slows so swiftly, the new HoT's, crit HoT's, and new healing aa's shamans in the lower half of WoS are main healers without issue. For more difficult content are excellent secondary healers, solid dps through direct damage and augmentation, in addition to virtually guarenteed slowing capacity.<br />
<br />
Currently Im enjoying OoW, even with the slow changes, as our class can make an impact.  The only drawback is sometimes zones such as WoS can become a cesspit during primetimes but I've simply learned to avoid those zones during those times.  We gained some truly class enhancing AA, and with additional levels allows access to content in GoD that was previously out of reach for a casual player.<br />
<br />
For those broaching GoD spells pre Kod as an issue...Sewer 3 trial &gt; Vxed/Tipt, and no chanter is required :)</div></div><hr />

You can look at EQ and say it's a game and balancing doesn't matter to me. That's everyone's own choice. You can definitely have fun with a class that isn't balanced, but having fun or a good time are no arguments, sorry.<br />
<br />
Besides, MPG and RS were the least affected by the mitigation changes, so I am not making a &quot;I am uberer than you&quot; statement. WoS/NC are the zones for the more casual people and before and after the mitigation changes there is no way you can tell me you need 2 healers for it.</div></div><hr />

All slow mitagation does is simplyfy the game into Big Tank. Big heals and Crowd control.  It closes the margin of error to force people into a single set of group dynamics. <br />
<br />
And that is boring. <br />
<br />
Blazz I am glad you are doing fine. Me and Mine are not. Yet we are still playing on. We die alot more. But instead of having fun (much like slow) 75% of the time. It has been mitagated considerably. I would say about half.. So Say My fun is mitagated Partially to 37.5 %.  That means Only slightly more that 1/3rd of the time I am activly having fun again. <br />
<br />
Last week I was having fun 3/4ths of the time. Not because I got runes like water due to Min maxing the bestest place with the bestest crew. But because instead I played the game. Went new places. Got people together and went and had fun. We died a few times. And we pulled off some amazingly fun fights. <br />
<br />
With the mitagation back as it is.That fun is able to be acived through a much more narrow gap.. When a guild cleric isnt on. I cant say sure lets go do XY or Z. Now I can only say lets do X. Because ti is all we can handle. <br />
<br />
It has narrowed choices and Dumbed down the available playstyles.  Catering to yet again a singular form of game play. The min maxer. Or in other words the powergamer. Of which the most common type of representitive is a raider. <br />
<br />
i am glad you are having fun. In three months when the new loots have progressed to a point where mobs are once again dying in 30 seconds, I certainly want you to be a stand up guy and admit just how much of a prick you were to have those other posts on your record. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I still like you Blazz. You are a decent enough fellow. But your ability to stand in anothers shoes sucks ass. And your foresight doesnt reach the end of your Trollish nose.<br />
<br />
Mitigation is lazy game design. If they wanted to lessen the effects of slow then they should make certain monsters only be slowed by Disease. Or by a lesser form of Slow. You would think that after the feasco of a % design they would learn that adding another % is just as dumb. The scaling doesnt work.  Not to mention the rediculous you spell is only patially effective is just a horrible form of negitive reinforcement. I wish that Warriors could get nice combat spam of Nope didnt hit hard enough across thier screen every monster. <br />
<br />
Omens could have been a solid thumbs up. The removal os Mitagation to many of the mobs was a breath of fresh air... But I bet that jerk Rytan saw what the intern did and Squelched it. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Fights in OoW go about a minute in length.<br />
On the average, mobs hit for what, about 300 damage per second in WoS?<br />
So, if you could slow a mob by 75% for the full minute, instead of taking 18000 damage, you'd only take 4500, and prevent 13500 damage.<br />
Should anyone be able to prevent 13500 damge with a single spell?<br />
300 mana to cast Nihil<br />
250 for Turgur<br />
or free for clicky Turgur.<br />
Would you be happy with clerics and druids casting a heal over time that healed 1000 damage per tick for 10 ticks, plus AA/Focus modifications, for 300 mana?<br />
That's what slow does.<br />
<br />
When mobs hit for 100dps, and you slow them, your single spell reduces a mob's dps by 75dps.<br />
When a mobs dps goes up to things like 500 or 1000dps, your single spell on a full slow reduces a mob's dps by 375dps or 750dps.<br />
...for the same mana cost.<br />
Preventing Xdps for a full minute of fighting is identical to healing 60*X damage.<br />
When you can prevent over 10000 damage from a single spell costing 300 or 250 mana, or even *free*, that's overpowering.<br />
That's why mitigation exists.<br />
<br />
<br />
And as for people that say &quot;ya.  just take a cleric and druid as backup healer, and take a BST for slower and dps instead of a shaman&quot;, I laugh at that.<br />
Sure, you could do that.  You can also make the druid heal more because of the ****ty slow.  The BST might add dps, but adding him is taking away the Druid's dps.<br />
I'd rather have a Cleric, Shaman, and true dps class like Wizard.<br />
That combo gives you best slows, fully capable healing, and max dps out of the dps class.<br />
The healer, healer, ****ty slower combo gives you 2 healers, and a medium dps class.<br />
What's better:<br />
a)  full slows/2 healers/pure dps<br />
b)  crappy slows/2 healers/poor dps?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u104"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p104">I'm sorry but some of this is just crap.<br />
<br />
Im a 4100 hps unbuffed shammie at level 67 with 4900 mana at my disposal along with 1150ac.<br />
<br />
The tanks that I guild with vary by class from 6k unbuffed to about 7500 and about 1600ac across the board.<br />
<br />
Most of my guild is flagged for KoD now...even my sk alt is sewer 3 away from it.  We have actively hunted our spells in GoD, gained 100hp/100mana slots in the process and additional augs.  Combined with some LDoN's and raid loot pieces scattered here and there that predominantly represents our gear.<br />
<br />
From an AA standpoint we average about 150 to 200aa between members in guild...We are one of the few casual/family guilds left on Brell.<br />
<br />
However to sit here and tell me shamans can't make a difference or there are limited places you can go without a cleric or a 10k tank is just pure tripe.<br />
<br />
I completed trial 3 in the sewers with a fully buffed 7800 hps warrior with 1560ac and the only defensive AA he had was CA3.  Sewer 3 due to 2 bottlenecks is argueably one of the hardest of the trials without SoS'ing or FM'ing for the turn in.  It doesnt require high end gear, it just requires patience and communication.<br />
<br />
To even hint at the fact that fights in the harder areas of WoS will go from 90 seconds to 30 seconds due to level 70 and gear upgrades is just ludicrous.  As an example with decent buffs (SoT/SoP, FA, Bih'li), 100% haste, BS mod, BS dmg mod 5, and innate attack of 150 to 170 our guild rogues are parsing at 250 to 300dps at level 67.  How do you intend to lift their dps to undisc'd levels of 700+ to drop a mob in 30secs?  Hell even with a group of end game players with 1 cleric, 1 shammie (me), 1 ranger (270dps), 1 bard, and 2 rogues (~500dps each) it was still taking 50 seconds to drop an elite.<br />
<br />
There are paths of progression available to casuals even now, and the options available have actually widened due to new levels, spells and AA's.  Omens is no more difficult than GoD from sewers and up...and ironically alot of our concerns have been answered from the dev team measured against that content:<br />
<br />
Revive type rez<br />
Group FA that is targetable<br />
Crit HoT's<br />
Auto quadding doggie (hits still need to be fixed)<br />
Group AA HoT with additional offensive benefits (MGB)<br />
New 1785 heal (with new 9% aa boost comparted to previous = 1945)<br />
Increased attainable mana regen while remaining 66% active (~+40% mana) <br />
New buffs that are mechanic driven as opposed to stat driven<br />
<br />
Are there some things that need to be fixed...sure...tali of alacrity being 60% haste, rains not having 22% innate resist, aggro on PR dots, etc.  However alot was addressed with Omens...far beyond what many of us thought we would recieve considering the content that was released with mob relative dps staying near the same from GoD and fights lasting from 50% to 100% longer.  Not to mention the lacked of dependence on both CC and Charm for groups has been a great boon to us.<br />
<br />
The content in Omens is in no way any more appreciably difficult than GoD is...and yet we have 5 more levels, new AA's and spells to take advantage of the content that both expansions offer to casual players.  From my guilds perspective we are acquiring more spells, both GoD and Omens alike, flagging those that need KoD through and leveling to be ready to do KoD xp groups and Ikkinz runs in addition to epics and small Omens raids.<br />
<br />
You have many paths available to you that you can take advantage of.  I think many will be surprised what a few more levels and AA in addtion to spell acquisition does to our class in regards to class vs. content parity.  I just happened to agree that unmitigated slow was ruining the game, and completely trivialized the available content as it stood.  I also feel that shamans, even if casual players like myself, are patient and progress then new doors have been opened to us through Omens if you simply choose to walk through them...we are far more than we were in GoD, you just have to look and see it.</div></div><hr />

Would love to see clerics whining about a zone where all their spells are mitigated to 25% effectiveness.  Not a single mob, like XtC, but a zone.  Hell, how about an entire expension.  That's what we got here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">firstly i really dont have a problem with the slow mitigation, because i never wanted to me main healer and slower. I just liked we can slow so its not like beta where all mobs was immune to slow. <br />
but I dont group alot in oow i think its totally crap for the most part to (many trains in wos, to far between mobs in MPG), but rift is still ok, but it do takes a good group to win else its wipe and 2 hours CR, which sucks. so IMO the game is now that you need all the right classes for a group and that makes the shaman very desirable for group and i love that.</div></div><hr />

I will concede you this point Snoww. But geez man, even you have to admit that WoS was turned into a total joke by completely removing mitigation. Soloable 120/120 items? Come on. <br />
<br />
I agree they went too far, as usual. I said that a couple times. But I bet they change it some. Especially Nobles, since that zone mitigating to &quot;partially&quot; doesnt make sense given the levels that are going to be in there. <br />
<br />
SOE is stuck, as usual, having to balance content around their own insane mudflation of raid gear. But you cannot have gear THAT good, dropping THAT plentifully, from mobs THAT easy. An adjustment had to be made. The may have overcompensated, but still, it HAD to be made. <br />
<br />
I hope for the sake of the non-raider, who is just trying to get caught up a bit gear-wise, that SOE cuts some of this mitigation back. But I hope they dont do too much, because honestly, it shuold be hard. It should take longer to farm spells and gear. <br />
<br />
And to the person who neg-bumped me and said &quot;Some people dont have 8 hours a day to farm spells and gear&quot;, my reply is this: Then I guess you will have to spend 4 days at 2 hours a day doing it instead, so its gonna take you longer. Deal with it. <br />
<br />
The rest of you who are so against me here, not bothering to reply, because your all Diablo people (Cept Giac, who makes very solid points, and we just disagree on certain topics and we both know it). You want to log in, maybe 2 box a few runes and a couple really nice items in an hour and log out. Find a new game. This one is harder than that, thank god.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u108"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p108">Pushing people to be competive in general Oow zones (not the higher ones)  by finishing higher end Planes and God for gear and spells - not balanced<br />
What do you mean &quot;finishing&quot;? KT isnt end-game Gates. Sewers arent end-game Gates. Vxed and Tipt (some of the best available XP in the game, BTW) arent end-game Gates. <br />
<br />
If you dont have your Gates spells, you will not be as effective. Now, you can probably skip the heal, and even maybe the HoT, but without the slow, your not as good. Sorry. Don't expect SOE to balance NEW content based on the fact that YOU didn't get a spell from the OLD content. OoW has effectively been balanced against Nihil for us. If you dont have it, I suggest you do whatever it takes to get it. In fact, if you wanna whine abuot how stupuid it is to get this spell, I am WITH you on that one. It SHOULD be more available, eespecially now.<br />
Amazing how quick these situations can reverse.  Would be interesting to watch as your friends take your state of mind and decide to up there potential by leaving you on the side line.<br />
Do you see my group? 4 healers, 2 tanks, plenty of crowd control, extremly low DPS. We didnt take a Wiz instaed of the Chanter to optimize, or a Rogue instead of the Shaman to maximize. It wasnt REQUIRED. <br />
<br />
But by the same token, you cant go into some of these zones with a 7500 hp tank and a Shaman as your only healer either. THATS what I am seeing some people wanting, and it makes me very fustrated. EQ is FAR FAR too easy now, and many players have become totally spoiled. Gates was abusively hard. This isnt. But NO ONE can sit here and tell me an average, balanced group (tanking, healing, dps, cc, whatever) cannot compete in WoS. I see the overall tone of the people whining here as &quot;WHAAAA I want my stuff handed to me!! ITS TOO HARD!!&quot; and it makes me sick. Sorry<br />
Another fan boy, god I am sick of people saying everything is fine. It is not fine and untill they do something about this crap it wont be fine. I was thinking of coming back, will glad I didnt. If you are enjoying the game more power to you but If you are old school then this is crap, anyone who started Kanark or before you know what I mean. Oh well I am having fun with COH.<br />
I started long before Kunark (day of original release long enough?) and while I dont think everything is &quot;fine&quot; I do think things are a LOT LOT better than they have been in a long time for the Shaman class. Not a little better. A lot better. Of course there are still issues. There always will be. <br />
Stuff like this reinforces why i have no problem with 100hp items dropping form exp mobs.

Come on man, give this line a rest. You DO NOT NEED a 10K tank in WoS. Get a regular group. An average BoT group with a healer, back up healing that fills OTHER roles, a tank that wont die in 1 round, soem DPS, a decent puller, and off you go. ITS NOT A HARD ZONE, even now, its just reasonable now, thats all. This isnt Gates type encounters made more difficult with mitigation. Unmitigated, WoS was easier than BoT, but a TON. Mitigated, is a bit harder, but not for long, as people level and get gear and spells. 2 months from now, WoS will be a JOKE again, even in its current format. <br />
<br />
Big problem here is no one has any patience to play the game anymore. It was a problem in Gates, its a problem now. No one wants to &quot;work their way up&quot; anymore. So many people seem to think you install, patch, load up, and let the loot and spells FLOW in baby. Lots of WoS and PG loot is tradable/attunable, go buy some. Prices are dropping through the bottom of the floor. 75/75 items are going under 1K on my server. SPEND SOME TIME PLAYING PEOPLE!! No one seems to want to play, and work on the game anymore. Log in, loot up, log out. Pathetic. <br />

One final thing this morning. I guess I am not following this line of your theory Snoww. 3 months from now, YOU and your friends will be able to handle this mitigated crap with ease. Just like BoT was &quot;hard&quot; at first. Just like LDoN was &quot;tricky&quot; at first (who doesnt have a few losses from time, or wiping on a stupid room). Then these things were solved Snoww, and now they are laughable. WoS will become laughable bro. Those instances will become laughable. Spell runes and 100/100 items will be flooded into the market-place, allowing anyone with 50K to buy a BAG of stuf. <br />
<br />
Don't be in such a hurry Snoww. I realize you have been patient. I understand that Gates sucked the bag, and was almost totally unplayable for half the games players. But don't try to make it all up in a day. In a month your shaman will have 500 more hps, your tank will have 700 more hps and 200 more AC, your resists will all double, you will have  nice spells, nice gear, and a few new levels to help you. WoS is aready BoT now. In a few months, it will be PoD or PoI, totally trivial. Returning the zones to their unmitigated form would only hasten this process. The 30-second fight isnt a factor.</div></div><hr />

And 120 / 120 ? That's sorta low on the power scale. LDON gear (Augmented) can exceed that and EP gear &gt; LDON gear.  So if Super_Shaman_01 gets a 120 / 120 wristband - well, he might replace the one from Trial 6, or he might sell loot rights, but 120 /120 ain't Monica Belluci (*)<br />

I dont think anyone said anything about wanting loot and spells to FLOW in, did they?<br />

Making people look worse than they are doesnt help much if you want people to keep up a resonable discussion with you.<br />

And how does &quot;SPEND SOME TIME PLAYING PEOPLE!!&quot; correspond with &quot;Lots of WoS and PG loot is tradable/attunable, go buy some&quot;?<br />
<br />
It doesnt if you ask me. You can even buy plat for real cash nowadays. But I dont think that its that kind of players that are disagreeing with your views here. Its people that actually DO want to play but because of the insane progression of equipment and therefore also mob power is getting left further and further behind with each new expansion.<br />
<br />
Where's the fun in buying loot that drops from mobs in the new expansion to be able to fight those mobs yourself?<br />
<br />
Is it so hard to admit that EQ is broken for some of us and that that doesnt automatically make us into lazy punks?<br />

EQ dies a little more with each new expansion/patch. And it will soon die a lot more.</div></div><hr />

You can go play for 1 hour or so and still see probably a couple of named.<br />
Yes i was pissed they recoded in mitigation but i was pissed the way they done it not because they done it.<br />
This expansion is what ive been crying out for in the fact i can go there hunt for as long or short a time as i want and stand nearly as much chance as a full equipped raider of getting spells and some for me decent gear.<br />

Yep but MOST of the people who complained about it  being so incredibly hard were the Hardcore raiders who are used to eating up content and ran into a brick wall in Gates.<br />

Blazz,<br />
<br />
The only differance is. Now you have to bring a cleric and a warrior to be sure. The shaman is useful but optional because a Beastlord will slow almost the same. <br />
<br />
All it does is narrow avilable choices for group composition. It doesnt make it harder. It turns the game into more cookie cutter crap.<br />
<br />
If they wanted to make it harder. Take away the static spawns for named. Make random named Spawn a squire to assist when at 50 %. if Fully slowed. <br />
<br />
All mitagation does is make the margin of error more suited to specialist classes. <br />
<br />
I can still do walls of slaughter Just like I could last week. Except now I pretty much HAVE to have a cleric. That is what it did. It narrowed my choices for avialble groups. Was it too easy with a perfect group on.. Yeah prolly. But we made up for that by pulling more or going somewhere harder. And as for 120 120 gear dropping. Who gives a ****. They killed the mob. And it is a couple slots. God forbif someone actually get 60 more hit points on an item. People soloed for Elemental Armour all the time... And How many hit points does that have?<br />
<br />
Oh wait. That is the raiders playground don't bring that up. <br />
<br />
All the mitagation does is make cookie cutter groups more prevalent. Welcome to last year.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the second post. About don't be in such a hurry.<br />
<br />
I am an explorer. It is in my nature. I have been in all the aviable zones already. (And died in most of them) I am level 67 with 465 AA. I have been playing also since the day or release. March 16th 1999 I was in beta before that.  <br />
<br />
We can handle the mitagated crap now. But we have to bring all A team to do it. Or 2 groups. I am sorry walls of slaughter was too easy for the raiders. Why don't you go play in the deeper zones. Where the challange was more appropriate. All the mitagation did was ensure that groups that are at my level of the game are required to be as cookie cutter as possible to keep the margin of error low.  The raiders with the Big tanks and the massive DPS will be able to handle it just fine with a shaman healing. 2200 AC does wonders. But our little 1500 Ac folks are getting slapped around alot more. <br />
<br />
And if anyone has the temerity to say go get better gear it is EASY.  Bite me. We have been for years getting better gear. However when it is a collection of Mom's and dad's and folks who can't always get on everyday who also do not play the game like a checklist of what is uber it all takes time. And since we can't raid the larger targets we need places like walls of slaughter. And Riiwi, ferubi, Barindu. LDON's Tactics. And of course the bazzar. Where the gear that is dropping is a whopping 200K. So that people can get thier Virtual E penis engorged upon how much plat they can make of the shmoes. <br />
<br />
The mitagation change simply pushes people down into the mold yet again. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u119"><b>WhoMe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p119">Honestly, how many people are going to say &quot;Oh, stuff once again mitigates slow in OoW, let's not invite a shaman..&quot; ?<br />
<br />
<br />
 I think it will alot, if you don't need a slower what you need a shaman for? Our buffs Hehehehe, yeah with everyones stats maxed with gear don't need that. Healer? Nope druid better at it pluse then can nuke.<br />
So why would u want a shaman?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u120"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p120">Sure, you could do that.  You can also make the druid heal more because of the ****ty slow.  The BST might add dps, but adding him is taking away the Druid's dps.<br />
I'd rather have a Cleric, Shaman, and true dps class like Wizard.<br />
That combo gives you best slows, fully capable healing, and max dps out of the dps class.<br />
The healer, healer, ****ty slower combo gives you 2 healers, and a medium dps class.<br />
What's better:<br />
a)  full slows/2 healers/pure dps<br />
b)  crappy slows/2 healers/poor dps?<br />
I'll go with a)<br />
Most mobs seem to partially resist slow, so ... would you take a shaman who will slow a mob for 37.5% of a mobs DPS and do say 150 DPS, or a BL who will slow a mob for 30% of a mobs DPS and do say 250 DPS (both DPS numbers are conservative).  It's already been established that for much of the content a single cleric can easily handle the heal load without backup, and from your assessment of the power of slow, I imagine this only amplifies this factor.  Your assessment of 18000 dam done overall by a mob is only impacted by a difference of 1350 between the two heals which is laughable in a 1 minute fight.  The difference is similarly made marginal by mitigation when compared to bards and it's almost unnoticeable when compared to chanters.  When you consider the abilities the other classes bring, a shaman should be last choice for more basic content.<br />
<br />
Giac made a good point on page 5 with where you stand on this issue is based on your expectations of the game and how you play it, yet so many of the &quot;everything is good club&quot; members seem to want to tell you how to play the game their way when many players cannot meet those requirements.  You do not need to min/max if you already have the gear/AAs and you do not need to min max if your regular group of players are already min/maxxed.<br />
<br />
I also enjoyed and agree with Snow's comment on mitigation and having to bring a warrior/cleric making the game boring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u121"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p121">Sony implemented slow mitigation because in their opinion a single spell shouldn't have such an impact. <br />
The majority of the posters who think Slow Mitigation was a necessary evil concur with that school of thought.<br />
<br />
Up till here, I am not going to call these people short sighted as it is a matter of opinions. <br />
But, if you are subscribing to this school of thought, why are you not realizing that instead of nerfing an ability that is easily available(4 classes who can slow) and which actually is a non-vital function within a group, they could nerf Healing or DPS, who are far more vital and more monopolized functions in EQ.<br />
<br />
This is what Snoww is expressing with his post above. <br />
By marginalizing Slow, you are pushing people to be more selective and even more restricted in their group make ups, as it caters to the specialists in the DPS and Healing department, functions that will always be crucial in EQ and which are monopolized by too few classes(sometimes only 1, the Cleric for Healing).<br />
<br />
This, my friends, is the big picture.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u122"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p122">So why would u want a shaman?<br />
<br />
The fights range from 1 minute to 90 seconds depending on zone and group.<br />
<br />
As a shaman I can outdamage a druid with similar aa/gear every single time in WoS.  The mobs live long enough to use puppy and stack 2 dots without issue...160+dps sustainable while slowing and group aug'ing.  If soley focus'ing on dmg that number reaches 180+dps sustained. That number is also limited by a still unfixed level 67 pet, none of the new nukes, rains or dots, but simply pre existing spells available prior to Omens.  Even by conservative means a druid must do nearly 1k dmg per tick to match me...even using Omens spell ratios, max aa, 45% discordant focus a druid must have a mana regen of near 100 mana per tick, must always casting in their primary spec, and never face a resist...gluck with that~<br />
<br />
As a shaman I can now outheal a druid over time in most zones due to mana regen that is a more passive type, requiring, ~3 clicks per minute only, and use the mana efficiency of a HoT to counter CH a druids CH efficiency.  As long as DPS spikes arent severe enough that they top 600 HPS post slow required then I have no issue with healing at all.<br />
<br />
As a shaman with Balance I can far outslow any class in game, doing so in less time, even before the mob enters camp, further reducing healing attrition that the group must combat.  BL's and Enc's, even at level 70, are getting strings of resists that are horribly costly that we as a class simply don't have to deal with.  A BL has no innate or cast mod to affect their slows, a chanter brings neg 40, we as shaman bring a neg mod 95 slow to the table... We as a class have a tendency to take the virtually non-existent aggro and neg 55 mod of Malos for granted in xp environs.<br />
<br />
Our buffs include a 7 percent avoidance buff, up to a 10% base damage mod, an additional 155 raw attack, stamina 40 points beyond the cap (equating to an additional 150 hps on a tank), guarenteed max physical stats almost regardless of gear, 60 percent haste capping most players...and all of this coupled with unbuffed standing mana regen of near 150 per tick...<br />
<br />
If people can't understand how that much mana regen impacts our healing or damage capabilities then I'm almost at a loss at how to describe it.  Mob DPS is no longer so severe in single group content that it exceeds our ability to fill a secondary healer roll like it did in pre nerf Ikkinz.  In fact our healing combined with our mana regen allows us to be used as the cornerstone for atypical groups.  You don't need a cleric in virtually any part of WoS...a necro, druid, or paladin can fill the needed rolls you are missing without issue.<br />
<br />
Itemization has affected the tanks we group with.  Even casual warriors can equip already high aggro weaponry, aug them with Anger III, use incite or its more powerful upgrades and hold aggro while we dish solid damage through a combination of dots, rains, and nukes.<br />
<br />
If you feel stuck in a narrowed path due to the changes in mitigation in WoS, then from my perspective, a casually geared shaman, your path is self imposed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u123"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p123">Which items are these?  And if you have the 'nads to solo stuff like that - more power to ya.  With attunable - you're only gonna do it once anyway.  Besides, what you have doesn't affect me.<br />
<br />
And 120 / 120 ? That's sorta low on the power scale. LDON gear (Augmented) can exceed that and EP gear &gt; LDON gear.  So if Super_Shaman_01 gets a 120 / 120 wristband - well, he might replace the one from Trial 6, or he might sell loot rights, but 120 /120 ain't Monica Belluci (*)<br />
(*) &quot;All that&quot;<br />
<br />
Thanks for playing, try again.<br />
<br />
Actually you cant even get close in LDoN (non raid) to 120/120 wrist. Believe its 70/70 (1492) with an aug could be 90/90 (assuming LDoN augs). You can add the same aug to to the OoW wrist so 140/140.<br />
<br />
Yeah u can get a little stat buffage and maybe a foci out of LDoN item, but my guys are dropping their LDoN equipment daily, refunding the pts, and flushing out items with augs with resulting pts. My 6box had 15-16 pieces of LDoN 1492 gear the day before OoW. I am down to 2 today. Redoing the foci with lvl70 as appropriate and bumping the stats. And NO ONE is even using the new ts augs. Saw a nice hp/mana aug that could be upgraded (was not even jced yet let alone alc/ps) to add something like cleave3 (thinking my warrior). Now that would rock for an aug!<br />
<br />
And by the way I agree with Blazz for the most part. People are used to things being easy. My guys are in a VT guild (basically almost farmed out in 2 months due to all the resets) and we routinely can play in GoD/OoW (MPG, etc.) with little problems, not easy, but not impossible. Can it suck for the casual casual casual player, yes but for most it doesnt. Not fond of the grind (trying getting 60+ runes) but would not want it too easy. And if low population is starting to impact grping (no grps available) then bitch to SOE. I expect the first voluntary server consolidation by the end of the year :)<br />

Slow Mitigation is not a must for challenging content, it's a cheap nerf.<br />
I disagree partly.  Back in the days of Kunark it was easier to balance an encounter because gear was more to scale. Mudflation has created a gap between better dressed shaman and the average shaman.  I do agree that mitigation on xp mobs is stupid and that there are loads of other ways to balance an encounter, but I did enjoy mitigation on bosses and mini bosses.  In those encounters I can do more with my other skills which are more suited for long fights and I could still feel very usefull.  If SoE could fix poisen aggro I'd be happy with boss/mini mitigation.  Mitigation on some encounters was fun and made it more challenging.  Mitigation on XP mobs is a lame cheap nerf though.<br />
<br />
EDIT: mitigation is just another tool to balance content, sadly it's unbalanced it.</div></div><hr />

But I still don't like SOE balancing us against any spell.   Plus I find it hard to believe that SoE built a whole expansion around Balance of Nihil?  If true, this just continues the bad coding instead of dealing with the problems straight up.  Which for SoE isn't that hard to believe.<br />
<br />
As to balancing, Migation should be pushed out on selective NPC's in OoW, not everything in my Opinion.   This sounds like some coder has a formula that they run to flip migation which incorrectly ran against the whole OoW NPC table.</div></div><hr />

<br />

2 points.  First, if you're fighting a mob for the first time, as a shaman, hopefully you've either done your homework and looked the guy up on the web, or you've come prepped to die a lot as your guild heads into new territory.  Guaging an event/encounter is always trial and error unless it's been done and documented somewhere a few times.  It's part of the fun/frustration of top tier raid guilds.  There's a lot of &quot;oh crap, that wasn't pretty!&quot; happening.  I don't see this as reflecting negatively on our class defining ability, especially since boss fights take longer and the shaman class has so many skills in long fights.<br />
<br />
Second, I do agree that mitigation has been used cheaply by SoE on xp mobs.  They went nuts because they lack imagination or have pushed the game engine too far.  MoBs should do other stuff, mitigate physical damage, mitigate spell damage, use more AEs (for xp mobs), use new and powerful abilities that allow burst damage, or AE damage or that get that fresh new car scent.  Mitigation is better than slow immunity which if you look back at velious and luclin mobs was the way SoE was heading.  For the record, no one type of mitigation or mob ability should be as widely applied as the slow mitigation nerf.  MoBs should have their damage reduction abilities varied so when you're pulling different mobs, you fight them different ways.  It would re-introduce the requirement for skill and paying attention to what your doing that so many people here are upset about.  It would also require added time for beta testing and design, which SoE seems unwilling to invest in this late in EQs life.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to see that. A druid can produce about 240 dps by straight nuking.  To get anywhere close that you need to stack tears or saryn/Yoppa's rain, with all it's little problems of increased resists, unusable with mezzed adds and the fact that you can kill yourself in a close quarter fight.</div></div><hr />

Vengance of the sun (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5363&amp;source=Live) Notice the - 30 resist check. 412 damage a tick 5 ticks Cast time 5.25<br />
<br />
Added to  <br />
<br />
Wasp Swarm  (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5357&amp;source=Live)  Please notice the -100 to resist check. And a lack of poisen counters... 358 a tick 6 ticks.  Cast time 6 <br />
<br />
And of course to lead up those   Immolation of the sun (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5348&amp;source=Live) That is 192 a tick PLUS - 35 Fire resist PLUS- 36 AC. All for a 3.5 cast time. <br />
<br />
Then they can finish off with Solstice Strike (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=5361&amp;source=Live) A nice little nuke that does 1926 base.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of this and that isnt even useing a level 70 spell. Gosh. I bet Mutt makes up for that alot. And yeah yeah I know Go play a druid.. <br />
<br />
I don't want to play a druid. I was just pointing out how wrong you are. I DON'T CARE what other classes get. I want to contribute in my own right and be as useful in my chosen class. And Slow mitigation hurts that considerably. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u137"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p137">Well, WoS was a joke.  Any clown could tank these mobs.  CC was not needed and I could tank with my paladin with just self heals against a slowed mob.  Tanks with not even decent bazaar gear were overkill there for gods sakes.  This zone is meant to be 66+, not any dam group who wants to pharm runes/items.  Go to vxed/tipt/KT and tell me that this zone is right.  There should be some challenge and not a lets pull every mob we see and pull a named even though we have 3 unmezzed mobs at camp and still kill them all without sweat.  <br />
<br />
I am not for more slow mitigation, but WoS was WAY WAY WAY to easy at first, and you have to admit it.  You don't even have to be the least bit picky on who heals/tanks etc..   Shaman slow is still better then chanter/bl even with mitigation.  Hell, my enchanter is such a waste in WoS that its silly to even bother playing him.  Who wants a wasted spot on an enchanter when you could have a rogue/wizzy etc. and speeding up exp.  I certainly don't want any enchanter in my group there.  <br />
<br />
I hope that these changes make WoS at least challenging and people actually have to start concentrating and worrying about who is in their group and how well geared/aa'ed they are.  The drops in WoS+ are too good for any gimpy twink to walk in and be fine.  RvR is not right.  In GoD it was way to much risk, in OoW that risk is crap.  Now Proving grounds is a decently tuned RvR zone and what I would expect of a 66+ zone.</div></div><hr />

Why the hell would anyone need cc in an outdoor zone with roaming mobs?<br />
<br />
I really don't get what people mean by &quot;trivial&quot; anymore. I can probably count on one hand the number of single-group fights I've participated in since Oow came out that I wouldn't consider trivial. as for vxed/tipt, charm+snare=... you guessed it, trivial.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u139"><b>Rekcim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p139">I really can't see a way slow can be fully implemented now.  Mobs dps is so high that a full slow is WAY to much dps decrease.  I mean when a mob did 50dps, slow didn't change things that much.  A mob that does 500dps, well, a full slow makes the fight a night and day difference.  How can you balance every mob with slow now??  A mob that will be semi challenging slowed will rip people apart unslowed.  You basically say you HAVE to have a slower in your group if you balance the mobs with slow in mind.  To make mobs challenging, yet doable without slow, but still not way to easy slowed, you have a problem.  The only fix I can see without making mobs slow immune is to reduce the slows effectiveness.  <br />
<br />
EQ would be a different game if it weren't for: Slow/Complete Heal/Charm/defensive.  I think those 4 things make balancing EQ for everyone a nightmare.  How do you balance a mob for paladins to tank, but still keep it challenging enough to make it tough for a warrior using defensive??  How do you balance dps enough so that a druid/shammy can heal without a it being too easy with a cleric CH??  Etc....<br />
<br />
The original EQ was not originally designed with the current level/gear in mind.  what wasn't overpowered then, became way overpowered now.  Even CH got hit, it used to heal for 10k, then tanks started getting more then 10khps and SoE had to retune the spell.  I really can't see slow ever being full on any mob in EQ again.   As mob dps increases, slow becomes more and more powerful.  Mob dps isn't going to decrease from this point, so better just get used to the idea, as sucky as it may be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u140"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p140">No blazz i didnt say I needed a 10k tank. My point is i get tired of people who raid and have a time piece or two and focus out the ass telling me how easy content is or should be. <br />
<br />
I hold nothing agaisnt people who raid and have better gear than me so dont turn this into that. I'm saying WOS is the 3rd zone into expansion should i want it to be tuned to people who's gear is that much better than me? Now i know gear doesnt make a player but i see shaman around here with more hps or at least ballpark hps than my paladin. <br />
<br />
I've put alot of ldon time and quests and baz money into my pallies gear. My point is if you make things challenging to a 10k buffed tank and a 7500 hps shaman how does it make it for a 8500 gears pally and a 6500 geared shaman. See normally that doesnt matter to me i think my head into it anyway its only a rez. <br />
<br />
I'm just tired of seeing people being called whiners who might be in that position. I'm not actuallly even complaining about mitigation yet. I just dont to see a exp zone be made too hard because people who above average gear deem it sooo easy. I never claimed i didnt want mitigation. <br />
<br />
Also the 10k stuff was stuff ive gleamed from online in game talk. Getting told how easy a zone is from these people who have the ultimate group with large mana clerics and a perfect puller. <br />
<br />
I mean really if someone doesnt think its as easy as you or doesnt think it should be same as you that means they are whining and want the game too easy? I never said that myself. <br />

Ive done quests like the marsingers quest in hate 3 times. I spend the time doing quests that would help a non raider like me. The marsinger quest  took me a month a little here and a little there with the rare drops. So i'm not one to want just easy loots. Just trying to tell you dont be so sure people are whining if they dont agree with you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u141"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p141">I really can't see a way slow can be fully implemented now.  Mobs dps is so high that a full slow is WAY to much dps decrease.  I mean when a mob did 50dps, slow didn't change things that much.<br />
<br />
Slow would reduce the DPS by 75% back then, just like it does now. There is no difference as players' HPs and Priests' heals have scaled with the mobs DPS. Slow has not, it just scales by itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
A mob that does 500dps, well, a full slow makes the fight a night and day difference.  How can you balance every mob with slow now??  A mob that will be semi challenging slowed will rip people apart unslowed.<br />
<br />
How about using some brain when designing fights. Make zones that reduce the effectivness of direct heals, make mobs proc DDs, make single pulling not su ****ing trivial. Just look at the past, the answers can be found there.<br />
If you couldn't pull singles every mob could be fully slowed and still be a threat for your group without having outrageous DPS unslowed.<br />
  <br />
You basically say you HAVE to have a slower in your group if you balance the mobs with slow in mind.  To make mobs challenging, yet doable without slow, but still not way to easy slowed, you have a problem.  The only fix I can see without making mobs slow immune is to reduce the slows effectiveness.<br />
<br />
You couldn't be more wrong. Clerics already heal better against unslowed mobs as a Shaman would heal against a slowed mob(even if it was fully slowable). So saying that you'd need a slower is false.<br />
<br />
But let's assume you'd need a slower, what'd be wrong about it? There are 4, sometiems 5, viable slowers in EQ. There are 1, sometimes 2 and rarely 3 viable healers in EQ. What's the difference besides slow actually being the more readily available function?<br />
<br />
EQ would be a different game if it weren't for: Slow/Complete Heal/Charm/defensive.  I think those 4 things make balancing EQ for everyone a nightmare.  How do you balance a mob for paladins to tank, but still keep it challenging enough to make it tough for a warrior using defensive??  How do you balance dps enough so that a druid/shammy can heal without a it being too easy with a cleric CH??  Etc....<br />
<br />
Yet the only ability to have been heavily nerfed was slow of these 4 you are listing(Charm was nerfed in Omens I admit, but it's definitely not what people invite Enchanters for 100% of the time or what their expected group function is).<br />
How do you explain that. Even more so when considering that a Shaman's abilities are actually all designed around that one ability.<br />
<br />
I really can't see slow ever being full on any mob in EQ again.   As mob dps increases, slow becomes more and more powerful.  Mob dps isn't going to decrease from this point, so better just get used to the idea, as sucky as it may be.<br />
<br />
See above.</div></div><hr />

Hell no they haven't.  Mob dps has gone through the roof while player hps has doubled, maybe tripled depending how far you go back.  Complete heal is a level 39 spell.  What I am saying is that 75% of 1000dps is a big difference compared to 75% of 100dps.  Mobs dps has gone up 10x maybe more over the years.  You just can't balance an unslowed and slowed mobs in todays upper level game.  It sucks, but the difference is just too large now in terms of dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Three words - Yes I can<br />
<br />
Most of the time shammies don't fill a pure dps role, typically we add dps while handling slows and Malos while emergency healing.  Recently I had an unusual group in the lower section of WoS during off prime time hours.<br />
<br />
Group Consisted of 1 SK, 1BL, 1 Ranger, 1 Bard, Shammies x 2.<br />
<br />
I entered the group with 4 hour Virtue, and we traded for 70 ext C3.<br />
<br />
I was the damage Shammie as I had the AA and foci for it.  I had BA4, ID4, and detrimental spell haste in regards to detrimental foci and currently have 440aa including all pet aa and damage aa prior to omens.<br />
<br />
My passive regen was ~80/tick and included:<br />
SD - 9<br />
Bite - ~9<br />
C3 - 14<br />
Horse - 20 (hadn't used him in nearly a year...almost forgot I had him~)<br />
FT 14 - 14<br />
MC 3 - 3<br />
Standing - 1<br />
Bard Song - ~10 (bard was out of camp pulling on return would use a pulse or 2 of Wind...normally 23/tick for him with aa).<br />
<br />
Active Mana regen was ~ 90/tick:<br />
Cannib 5 - ~30/tick<br />
Cannib 4 - ~60/tick<br />
note:  As a damage dealer and not slower rarely if ever did I gain aggro precluding the need to HoT myself to any degree.<br />
<br />
We had 2 mobs in camp virtually at all times, 1 bard mezzed and on deck.  For parsing purposes combat was nearly continuous and mobs were dying every 71 seconds according to parse.  Actual length of each fight was ~ 65 seconds.<br />
<br />
Puppy is the level 67 summons and was buffed with FA, Bih'li, Daiku, Fo7, Virtue, Swift, SoT, SoP, SK tap when applicable, Bard songs when present.  Puppy was also armed with Blade of Walnan x 2, girdle and muzzle.<br />
<br />
Puppy was melee parsing at ~47dps from pure melee sources, was proccing ~8 times per minute and was landing just under 90% of 150 dmg MR procs.  If using a conservative rule of neg 20% dmg reduction in relation to landed pet procs, he was proccing 90% of the time, 8 times per minute for 70% of 150 dmg each time.  Rounded down to be further conservative he was landing 7 procs per minute for 100 damage each or ~11.6 dps from proc sources and ~59 dps total.<br />
<br />
Damage deliver per mob (182 mobs total in about 3H 40m):<br />
<br />
1 Bane - ~2700 (2 if first was resisted, had 3 resists in over 3 hours)<br />
1 Blood - ~ 2850 (had no resists)<br />
DD's - ~1945 (Total DD dmg from rains and VS over the parse/# of mobs)<br />
Puppy - 3835<br />
Valkargens pets - 190 /roar (total puppy burn dmg / # of mobs)<br />
<br />
Total - 11520 damage per mob every 71sec = 162.25/dps (used 71 sec to account for actual dps, and not dps per mob while fighting)<br />
<br />
I Currently don't possess either Ancient Chaotic Pain or Pained Memory which would have elevated my mana regen by ~30 more.  Nor do I have any of the new Omens DD's or Dots present in my spellbook.  Bane and Blood average damage per cast are based on my past parses of the spells with BA4 that I did when I gained CA3.  I don't currently have Strength of Might to elevate puppy hits by 2 per swing  and the level 67 puppy summons is still quadding for 60's =x<br />
<br />
I could have elevated DPS higher by staying with DoT casts, but didn't think I would be posting the info...and I like crits and can be lazy at times so don't sass the troll!<br />
<br />
I was parsing to get a feel for where my dps was and to test the new puppy.  I'm fairly certain even with my casual gear I could have reached 180dps with current spells and level and with newer spells (especially the new cannib and curse) and if they fix puppy could reach 220dps or even higher depending on zone.<br />
<br />
I also turned on parse because rarely as a shaman do I get to function purely as a damage dealer.  Usually my damage is an additional source after I FA, Malos, and slow at the least in a group.  I was curious where I stood in dps compared to my guildies in relation to class and similar gear from a casual player perspective.<br />
<br />
I wish I had kept the parse, however usually I just get the info, run it through Yalp/EQC, save numbers after breakdown, and post them on occasion on our board for discussion.  However considering that I'm not using high end gear those numbers shouldn't be difficult to reproduce by anyone who wants a second opinion.<br />
<br />
I am curious Faern how you think a druid with my AA and Foci can outdamage me in WoS.  Hell I'm curious to see how an Endgame druid with a full spellbook and Discordant Foci can outdamage me there considering mob resist rates, that mobs summon, and that even charming post nerf still requires a group effort with my gear/aa.  Bear in mind please that a dead druid shows as 0 dps delivered in a parse :)<br />
<br />
From my calculations, and someone please correct me if I'm wrong, a druid would have to regen at literally over 100 mana/tick to match me.  That includes that rains resist 22% of the time at best, assumes they spec in evo or conj and secondary spec in the other, have discordant Foci, mana savings are ~40% for half damage and 32.5% for the other half, have all spells including Ancients, have max rates of crits, they never face a resist, and never have a fizzle.  With lower foci and using only a few Omens spells that mana number goes up considerably.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u146"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p146">I don't know whether to laugh or cry. <br />
<br />
You took a &quot;Clark Kent-pet&quot; that does 11 dps base and had 4 people buff and equip it to a &quot;Super-puppy&quot; in order to get his DPS up to 59(only using your calcs here) and yet your total DPS was a little over 160.<br />
<br />
Without crunching numbers I can tell you that a Druid will easily outdamage you and, if I might add, if you gave a Druid pet all the stuff you gave your pet, I bet it would parse 35ish DPS.<br />
<br />
Seriously, man, that's ****ed up. Your  pet is doing about 40% of your total damage. You had the Bard do HoS I assume or you could have added a nice 25-30% more to Bane's resist rate.<br />
<br />
And you were doing all that in BoT, where mobs are a good chunk lower than in WoS.<br />
<br />
You know what's really sad? I can already see people here claim our pet does 60 DPS. I am baffled.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess I'd say that a Druid given the same conditions, would top out at 300 DPS(35 DPS from bear pet I tell ya! <br />
<br />
I give you an A for effort, though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u147"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p147">I was eating and doing paperwork while posting so I missed reading a few posts =x<br />
<br />
Snow I know that they can do that damage on a mob, but an xp group is about sustained damage over time.  And while I can't speak for your groups mine typically are constantly fighting, with literally no down time between mobs and usually at least 1 mob waiting.<br />
<br />
Snow the first 3 spells you have listed are dots and are 441, 465, and 400 damage per cast respectively.  I'm not trying to be arguementative soley for that purpose but where is the mana coming from?! <br />
<br />
Solstice Strike is 443 mana for 1926 base damage.  Even if a Druid has Discordant Foci netting an average of 22.5 percent mana savings and we bump that to 40% by giving them a generous rate of crits to account for AA's thats ~ 2700 damage per cast.  At 443 mana per cast assuming the druid in question is primary spec'd in Evo, has an AVERAGE foci savings of 20% (40% with variance) then the spell would cost ~265 per cast or a ratio of 10.2.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that I was doing 11500 dmg per 71 seconds rounded down...and I was being somewhat lazy~ The numbers were NOT calculated at 65 seconds, which was the life of the mob, but the actual rate at which mobs were dying over the course of the parse, netting an actual DPS and not DPS per mob.<br />
<br />
Even at those ratios a druid would have to regen 1150 mana every 71 seconds or 97.1 mana per tick.  That includes max current foci, max damage aa, primarily spec'd in whichever dmg means they choose, all appropriate mana savings aa, that they never have a fizzle and never face a resist.<br />
<br />
Now even with those ratios...which this silly little troll doesn't possess, even with some omens damage spells...which this troll doesn't have /shake fist...where is the mana coming from?!<br />
<br />
ShamuofXev I'm curious to know where that 240dps SUSTAINED came from, truly I am.  Because if thats the case then that druid at a 10 to 1 ratio is pulling in 144 mana per tick...and I would truly like to know how they are doing that! even at those perfect ratios with incredibly powerful foci.<br />
<br />
Again I'm not trying to argue for arguements sake alone, but I truly wish to know if this is an instance of the grass is always greener syndrome.<br />
<br />
In GoD we were seriously hampered by 30 second fights, now fights are about a minute, and usually if a group is killing in less than that they are better served to moving to harder mobs like elites and such in WoS and again fights are just over a minute for good xp returns.  Our dots now run to full duration, we are in outdoor zones again to use horse and cannib at the same time and with pet affinity and baz buyable pet toys puppy is 3500+ dmg per minute...and hes not even fixed yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u148"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p148">Almost done eating and then I'm gonna log on :)<br />
<br />
First Giac:<br />
<br />
1.  I was in WoS, about halfway down the wall on the left from the zone in...not BoT.<br />
2.  My DPS was ~105 sans puppy because I was also handling FA and on occasion hotting the BL or ranger.<br />
3.  Level 67 pet armed with even rusty daggers, FA (puppy timer), and FoS is 41dps<br />
4.  He had SK attack tap because our BL had no C3 and could only Fero himself and our ranger.<br />
5.  I have pet affinity...group buffs, taps, and songs hit puppy...wether I like it or not.<br />
6.  My damage sources regarding myself are very conservative...ie rounding down alot.<br />
7.  The other shammie was Malos'ing on the inc, the bard was not using HoS as it wasn't necessary.<br />
8.  Bane had the 2 resists it had and not more, and in the lower half of WoS with Malos thats not unusual.<br />
9.  I clearly stated that I could have topped 180dps easily...ie ~130 dps just me with casual foci, gear, and no Omen damage spells or cannib.<br />
10.  I Give you a B for effort...mostly because your blowing smoke out your tush!<br />
<br />
Now that I've addressed that its your turn...<br />
<br />
How is a druid doing 240dps, 300dps...or whatever number you plan on throwing out there?<br />
<br />
State what you think their ratio is and I'll even round up for you:<br />
<br />
They will never fizzle<br />
They will always be casting in their primary spec<br />
They will have max foci<br />
They can be level 70<br />
They will never EVER face a resist or even a partial<br />
They will have ALL max pertinent AA<br />
<br />
Then state what you think their mana regen sources are...be sure to round up!:<br />
<br />
Horse (20)<br />
C6 if you want! (20)...duration not a prob, lets assume lvl 70 chanter bot!~<br />
Stealoak (9)<br />
FT20! (20)<br />
Bardsong...with Jamfest even! (23)<br />
Ascendance (10)...also botting a lvl 69 BL~<br />
MC3 and 1 for standing (4)<br />
Sk ninja'd his new bite spell! (13)<br />
<br />
Now that our spoiled rotten druid...shamelessly pampered and fed grapes has 119 mana regen per tick lets see how you plan on spending that mana per minute shall we?!<br />
<br />
Lets even assume mobs are magically appearing in camp, that the bard isn't actually pulling...but WILLING the mobs there so that he can twist mana song, HoS, and rizlona's while hes using a feather fan... granting him an 11 to 1 ratio!<br />
<br />
1190 per minute at a ratio of 11 to 1 is 13,100 damage...rounded up~<br />
<br />
Divided by 60 seconds thats 219dps again rounded up...because we all know the gods smile on druids :)<br />
<br />
Now by all means lets hear your theories if a druid can better that.  Lets here what you think ratios are.  Arrive at a mana per tick number for those druids who haven't been declared Emporer of WoS!<br />
<br />
And for once...just once...try to post some actually numbers instead of blowing smoke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's about as much as you can do as a shaman IMHO in a group setting where mobs are killed in 45-60 sec.  I still don't buy dot's running to duration or poison dots landing anywhere near what cold nukes do.<br />
<br />
And certainly a Druid can pump out 200dps when elemental and up under the same conditons that we are doing 150 (including pet).  But that is understandable considering their potency of nukes.  Will the Druid run out of mana? That's the $100 question and purely dependant on the pulling speed of the group.  Shaman can regen like crazy but that regen only counts in application to mobs (not waiting for pulls, etc.).<br />

I apologize about the abrasiveness of my posts on this thread, but it gets fustrating. We FNALLY seem to have an exapansion where we are VERY playable, and people still bitch and moan. <br />
<br />
Mitigation is the cheap way out, but to be honest, I dont blame SOE for taking that road. Saved them a bundle of money, time (development time, code time, test time) etc etc. <br />
<br />
I think OoW is one of the best expansions period. Ever. The spell rate is a bit too quick, and the drop rate of upper items a bit too plentiful, but I can live with that because people NEEDED something after the Gates debacle, and OoW delivered. 3 months from now, Shaman will be sole healers in WoS easily. 3 months from now, everyone that can play 10 hours a week will have a bundle of cheap, easy-to-get new spells and gear. Lets not turn it that way now. There are a few bigger issues than mitigation in the expasions primary loot-horse zone.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u155"><b>Valkargen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p155">Light I would agree in that group setting where classes fill their typical roles that she will outdamage you...of that I have no doubt.  However thats also based on a few premises:<br />
<br />
1.  You are slowing<br />
2.  You are casting Malos<br />
3.  You are keeping Melee in FA<br />
4.  You are possibly hasting<br />
<br />
This discussion was an either OR comparison.  Wether a group would be better served dps wise with a druid or shaman present...which means:<br />
<br />
1.  You aren't allowed to slow...because a druid wouldn't<br />
2.  You aren't allowed to Malos...because she wouldn't<br />
3.  You can't haste or FA melee...refer to 1 or 2~<br />
<br />
If the choice was between you and a druid for dps, then the group would already have a form of haste...if they didn't the choice would be mute as to which of the 2 of you they would pick~<br />
<br />
For every mob at a minimum you are expending 400 base mana cost (Malos) that isn't directly being attributed to your dmg output and the druid is directly benefitting from that cast by lowered resists netting in increased dmg...and yes its part of our job and what we add to a group :)  <br />
<br />
Also in addition you have a TA, most shamans do not and would expend an additional 250 or 300 base mana cost per mob.  This would cost ~ 8 to 10 seconds and cost 650 to 700 base mana per mob between the 2 or about the same time spent and 400mana.<br />
<br />
For a more accurate comparison group with the druid in the harder part of WoS, which is more commensurate with your gear, and even that is very trivial for you (No dying please!).  Add a mage for Malo, have an enchanter for tash, slows, and haste then fill out the remaining 2 slots that benefit both of your classes equally and ensures that the group doesn't wipe...ie a paladin and BL would be 2 good choices.  Make sure to get pet toys, as casual shaman Do have access to them, be sure to include a muzzle and 2 weapons (Walnans are best for grouping).<br />
<br />
Fight as normally for 30 minutes, while each of you gets a feel for what spells land, which saves are having higher resists using Mala and tash and then turn on logs.  Have you be the healer for 2 hours and then her be the healer for 2 hours while you switch out doing damage.  For parsing purposes just track damage delivered, the length of the parse, and how many mobs killed.  For you also include how many times puppy proc'd with a weapon, but don't include the damage from those procs, as some may have varied feelings about how much that damage represents.<br />
<br />
Don't ask the Dimorfia how much dps she did, just have her email you her log and with the same parser run them through it.<br />
<br />
The key to keep in mind is if you have right clicks, ie malosini neck, etc, you are free to use it...but only when YOU are in damage mode.  If you weren't in the group and a druid were chosen over you then the druid wouldn't have access to it.  You are not to slow, not to Malos, not to haste, and not to FA.  You are back up healer in an emergency situation and to dish damage...much like she is.<br />
<br />
And yes the comparison is highly inefficient.  If grouped with a mage you would Malos over Mala and allow the mage to turn that same mana into better dps.  If in the group you would FA the melee as that mana expenditure nets greater dps rewards.  And also you would slow over any other class as it would be either a free caster or land virtually every time...however this is supposed to be a dps comparison :)<br />
<br />
If you can do that, and I know its gonna be hard to not cast Malos or Slow =x, I think you will be surprised at the results, even more so as that she has almost twice your AA including far more damage orientated AA, and she has better pertinent damage foci than you.  The latter isn't surprising and typically we as a class do have other concerns that need to be attended to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u156"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p156">Good points made by all. I apologize about the abrasiveness of my posts on this thread, but it gets fustrating. We FNALLY seem to have an exapansion where we are VERY playable, and people still bitch and moan. <br />
<br />
Mitigation is the cheap way out, but to be honest, I dont blame SOE for taking that road. Saved them a bundle of money, time (development time, code time, test time) etc etc. <br />
<br />
I think OoW is one of the best expansions period. Ever. The spell rate is a bit too quick, and the drop rate of upper items a bit too plentiful, but I can live with that because people NEEDED something after the Gates debacle, and OoW delivered. 3 months from now, Shaman will be sole healers in WoS easily. 3 months from now, everyone that can play 10 hours a week will have a bundle of cheap, easy-to-get new spells and gear. Lets not turn it that way now. There are a few bigger issues than mitigation in the expasions primary loot-horse zone.<br />
<br />
/agreed<br />
<br />
Not too easy, not too hard, probably still not hard enough for level 65-70 content.  But I'm happy and have gotten more qear upgrades in the last 2 weeks than in the last 4 months.  Fun to play with my buddies, full group, everyone knows their role and has a good time.  Worth my money, so I'll keep playing.  period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u157"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p157">Almost done eating and then I'm gonna log on :)<br />
<br />
First Giac:<br />
<br />
1.  I was in WoS, about halfway down the wall on the left from the zone in...not BoT.<br />
2.  My DPS was ~105 sans puppy because I was also handling FA and on occasion hotting the BL or ranger.<br />
3.  Level 67 pet armed with even rusty daggers, FA (puppy timer), and FoS is 41dps<br />
4.  He had SK attack tap because our BL had no C3 and could only Fero himself and our ranger.<br />
5.  I have pet affinity...group buffs, taps, and songs hit puppy...wether I like it or not.<br />
6.  My damage sources regarding myself are very conservative...ie rounding down alot.<br />
7.  The other shammie was Malos'ing on the inc, the bard was not using HoS as it wasn't necessary.<br />
8.  Bane had the 2 resists it had and not more, and in the lower half of WoS with Malos thats not unusual.<br />
9.  I clearly stated that I could have topped 180dps easily...ie ~130 dps just me with casual foci, gear, and no Omen damage spells or cannib.<br />
10.  I Give you a B for effort...mostly because your blowing smoke out your tush!<br />
<br />
Now that I've addressed that its your turn...<br />
<br />
How is a druid doing 240dps, 300dps...or whatever number you plan on throwing out there?<br />
<br />
State what you think their ratio is and I'll even round up for you:<br />
<br />
They will never fizzle<br />
They will always be casting in their primary spec<br />
They will have max foci<br />
They can be level 70<br />
They will never EVER face a resist or even a partial<br />
They will have ALL max pertinent AA<br />
<br />
Then state what you think their mana regen sources are...be sure to round up!:<br />
<br />
Horse (20)<br />
C6 if you want! (20)...duration not a prob, lets assume lvl 70 chanter bot!~<br />
Stealoak (9)<br />
FT20! (20)<br />
Bardsong...with Jamfest even! (23)<br />
Ascendance (10)...also botting a lvl 69 BL~<br />
MC3 and 1 for standing (4)<br />
Sk ninja'd his new bite spell! (13)<br />
<br />
Now that our spoiled rotten druid...shamelessly pampered and fed grapes has 119 mana regen per tick lets see how you plan on spending that mana per minute shall we?!<br />
<br />
Lets even assume mobs are magically appearing in camp, that the bard isn't actually pulling...but WILLING the mobs there so that he can twist mana song, HoS, and rizlona's while hes using a feather fan... granting him an 11 to 1 ratio!<br />
<br />
1190 per minute at a ratio of 11 to 1 is 13,100 damage...rounded up~<br />
<br />
Divided by 60 seconds thats 219dps again rounded up...because we all know the gods smile on druids :)<br />
<br />
Now by all means lets hear your theories if a druid can better that.  Lets here what you think ratios are.  Arrive at a mana per tick number for those druids who haven't been declared Emporer of WoS!<br />
<br />
And for once...just once...try to post some actually numbers instead of blowing smoke.<br />
<br />

Just an update and clarification:<br />
 <br />
Most NPCs in Omens will mitigate slow, if not all of them. I don't have the exact numbers in front of me so I can't tell you the percentage offhand, but a good majority of them will. The mentioning of Causeway had to do with the fact that the NPCs in those zones and above will mitigate for a larger amount compared to the zones previous to them.<br />
 <br />
Also, the NPCs that triple and quad attack are intended. Basically, we had an exporter problem with the NPC files for the expansion after release of Omens. From Omens release to the first patch, all NPCs were properly mitigating slow and triple/quad attacking. Somehow during the first patch of Omens, which was on the 23rd of September, the NPC files were updated to not have their slow mitigation and triple/quad attack flags set up correctly, due to this exporter issue. The recent updates of Omens zones, which occured on the 1st of this month, set the NPC flags back to their correct values from before the patch on the 23rd.<br />
 <br />
The values for the slow mitigation and triple/quad attack are exactly the same as they were when Omens was released. Those NPCs were not upgraded in power. I'll verify this tomorrow to make absolutely sure, but I'm pretty positive that no changes have occured, besides fixing the flags that were originally on those NPCs.<br />

Yeah, but also read the next sentence where I said or be prepared to die alot if the content is new to you.  That said, you're a liability to those around you if you face tried and true content without looking at the spoilers.  This is especially true of the shaman class.  36-72 people on a raid are counting on YOU to slow the mob, you have to know if it can be slowed, if you need to alternate your spell lineup, or if there is some sort of range limitation, whatever.  If I was a raid leader and asked someone why they hadn't done their job and they replied &quot;I didn't know I needed to do that, it's new content and I'm experimenting&quot; I'd politely inform them to look it up next time, have their team leader talk to them and boot them if they repeated the flaw.  I personally was responsible for a wipe once a LONG time ago (and many expansions away) in NToV to Roy because I didn't know about the range limitation (it was a last minute target for guild raid night) on spells landing.  I had asked questions but it was my first time there, I was the only shaman there, and no one there had any clue on shaman specific items.  I added the links to my second machine (for the crucible and allas) and kept it going whenever I raided again.</div></div><hr />

Aye if youre going on a raid or whatever with a group/raid thats familiar with said mob then yes get to know all about it as its expected of you.<br />
But to me if youre taking on a mob new to you and group/raid youre with then dont use spoilers.<br />
Where is the fun in just looking up a spoiler site and getting however many people together,doing it by the book and leaving with loot.<br />
If you read spoiler sites for mobs is there any skill or thought involved in it ?.<br />
Would you use cheat codes in a single player game before you completed it without using cheat codes ?.<br />
Just my personal opinions and bound to get flamed by raiders saying lots of skill involved but there ya go.<br />

One reason why I hate the raiding game.<br />
<br />
It is a tactical simulation Not a roleplaying game. And outside influances are always removing immersion to make the tactical simulation mroe effective. <br />
<br />
Nothing gets a person farther out of charecter than looking up Alkallas. &quot;To see what I am supposed to be doing&quot; or &quot;What loot drops yo&quot;<br />
<br />
I am responsable for wiping my guild on a regular basis. I think it is part of my charm. (Grins) But it is probably also why we don't raid so much.<br />

<br />
My slow message will make raiders and anti spam advocates cringe in pain.<br />
<br />
It is something like <br />
<br />
/cast 5<br />
/gsay distracting %t with insects<br />
/pause 2, /cast 5<br />
: summons up a massive cloud of insects to harry and distract %t..<br />

Of course my Q message is even worse. <br />
<br />
/pause 2,/cast 2<br />
/pause 10,/kneel say watches as the spirits rise to cover %t in a soft blue light<br />
/cast 2<br />
/gsay Mending %t's wounds slowly through the grace of the spirits...<br />
<br />
Hell I wrote them like 2 years ago. hard to remember exactly what they say. <br />
<br />
Of course My Bane key I made like last month when I got the spell is. <br />
<br />
/pause 2, /cast 4<br />
/gsay With my last breath, I spit at thee %t...<br />
/cast 4<br />
/pause 10<br />
/rude say curses %t with the bane of the spirits long dead...<br />
<br />
I don't have a seperate slowed message. So most of the time if it is needed my message looks alot like this.<br />

<br />

I am not saying I am Bob the uber roleplayer. I do not speak in thees or thou's I just wish there was more roleplay in the game. More in game immersivness building content than what proc was that... Look it up on lucy... Okay now use Cure curse and stay 150 feet away at all times. <br />

Its not like the mobs will politely wait attacking your group until you have correctly spammed your slow message. My groups expect me to slow whatever needs to be slowed. If things arent slowed its my fault but message or not wont matter.</div></div><hr />

Most can tell because the tank is already at half health. (Laughs)<br />

I just can't spare the Hotkey space for a seperate slow message. <br />
<br />
1 is spear of fate for clicky dot. <br />
2 is bash. I will remove this 3 days after I quit EQ for good. <br />
3 is My heal over time message. It is the easiest key for me to hit with wasd based movement. (Also was mez hotkey for My chanter when it was a main years ago. And Backstab hotkey for when the thief was Main years before that.)<br />
4 Was Poisen dot for years. Now is bane cast and message<br />
5 is slow. Will never change. <br />
6 is sit. Been sit since they removed spellbooks from our view at 35th level. <br />
7 is Hmm.. Oh yeah Canni. Click click click.<br />
8 is canni 5. No message so I cna see when it repops. <br />
9 is Root pants. Used to be root spell witha  message but cant spare the spell slot now. FA took its place permanintly when I got root pants. <br />
10 was JBB. I am having problems finding a spot for this now. I think it is currently a warnign for Canna 5 but I dont use it. Might make it a raw assist key. For assisting to target. But dunno.<br />
<br />
Bank 2 is pet controls and AA. Lots of crap in here. All 10 used up. <br />
<br />
Bank three is group controls. And more aa stuff. <br />
<br />
Bank 4 is Corpse stuff,  locs. LEadership stuff and what have you. <br />
<br />
Bank 6 key 6 is spellbook. Not sure what else is around there. <br />
<br />
 Much of all of this is due to starting when there were only 6 banks of 6 keys. With the old UI. (Grins) Old habits are hard to break...<br />

<br />
Anyne else see the parallel here - normally SoE releases an expansion and has uber loot dropping like rain because of a &quot;mixed up item database&quot;, which they then correct after a month..<br />
<br />
This time they kept the loot the same but increased the mob damage because they mistakenly &quot;messed up the mobs slow mitigation and triple/quad attack flags&quot;.<br />
<br />
So now everyone who rushed to buy OoW has been screwed by a slant on their previous &quot;how can we get them to buy this expansion&quot; tactic. <br />

Marketing. Keep em playing. Here is a RL metephor that actually works. TV stations WANT you to stay on their channel, even during commercials. Because they know, even if you INTEND to come back, they know if you switch channels, you MAY not. Sure you still pay the cable company or satellite company for the channel, that doesnt matter to the individual stations. To them, the clicker is death. You see the recent trend on TV to run ads for their future programs on the bottom of the screen DURING the current program? They dont even wanna risk a 10 second spot between commercials man. Keep em tuned in. SOE is the king of keeping people tuned in. <br />

Making crappy expansions with out-of-whack loot at start and then nerfing it does not a good game make.

I think its a dangerous road for them to travel. But sometimes you get the feeling that they already planned with lots less customers in the near future and thats why they spend so little time on listening to their current customers.<br />

All these behind-the-back nerfs in the long run only makes more people tired of EQ.</div></div><hr />

I agee 100% Spirit. And take a look at what happened recently. New games like CoH and the WoW beta took a ton of players. The last expansion, Gates, was the biggest cluster-f ever produced in this games history. The level of customer satisfaction was at an all-time low, and had been falling like the thermometer in December since PoP. PoP was big for SOE, but they followed it up with mediocre releases and game fixes packed as &quot;upgrades&quot; to sell copies. Then Gates, and the Beta WOW was out, and CoH was fun for some people, and the writing was on the wall. <br />
<br />
So what did they do? They pulled the release date for OoW, knowing full well that in order to maintain a respectable level of customer satisfaction, they HAD to have a solid release. I DREAD what kind of condition OoW would have been released in hd they just pumped it out &quot;on release schedule&quot;. But they didnt. They sucked it up, and actually gave the people something VERY VERY strong. <br />
<br />
These &quot;nerfs&quot; are only going to affect the people that let it affect them. The rest of us will adjsut our playstyle for a while, knowing FULL well that once we get a few levels, a few spells, and some new gear, the &quot;nerfed&quot; areas will be CHICKENFEED to hunt in. WoS is NOT HARD. Its STILL to damn easy IMHO, but since I want to be able to buy cheap spells, I will just let the BoT/Sol Ro ornate farmer move there and set up a new store. But its really still pretty darn easy, especially this early in the expansions life-cycle. By Thanksgiving everyone will be able to hunt there risk free. By Christmas Duo's and Trio's will be farming nameds again like its Lower Guk.</div></div><hr />
