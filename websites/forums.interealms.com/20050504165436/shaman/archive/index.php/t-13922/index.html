Like heck it's not!  If it took you two years I strongly suspect that you challenged yourself far more than many others do in the process.  You're a much better shaman for it.  Congrats, Oracle Gindaor, and well done :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Congrats, Dandi!  I'm glad I'm not the only person taking time to have fun along the road and/or keep a life outside it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ailith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">WTG! Some for me to aspire towards.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tavokk Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">2 Years?? Geez....it took me just over 3. :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kashale</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Congrats!  I dinged 60 over the weekend as well  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fulgrim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Congrats.....<br />
<br />
almost 58 here... dont want to know about 59...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kursan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Congrats, Ive just got 60 in the last fortnight too. Then lost it badly in a small death loop, grr. Finally got it back on Sunday morning.<br />
 It is a big step, dont let anyone tell you different.</div></div><hr />

hehe Ive been playing since before kunark and I dont even have 1 60 yet!  :eek: but granted I just started my shaman a little over a year ago, and before him I never really had a main. I have tons of 30-40s all over the place. my main before Faustt was my damn ranger (omg I had 40+ days /played on it before I found out that rangers are teh sux), if only I knew the power of the shaman those years ago! why did I wait so long to start the best damn calss in the game?<br />
<br />
anyway... Gratz man!!! I hope to be there someday... mabye... we'll see.....</div></div><hr />
