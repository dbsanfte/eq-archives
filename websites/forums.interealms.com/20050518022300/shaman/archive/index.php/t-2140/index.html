<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone hear of this or see any stats yet? I think it is the Imbued Heraldic Armor for Barb Shammys (followers of the Tribunal). I have seen some of the other religions armor, and the stats are quite nice. For example:<br />

Would love to see some stats on the Sahmmy/Tribunal stuff if anyone knows about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would suggest checking the forums at eqtraders.com - they are usually the best place to find tradeskilled items.  I know there have been at least one piece of Ogre Chainmail, and a few Iksar pieces as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This is the stats for Ogre/Troll Cazic chain feets, shammy wearable, so it should be about the same.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">blacklaced is for barb bst's we use artificers, 30hp/mana ish +5wis +5 to saves basically (better on tunic/legs i believe?)<br />
<br />
helana made a bracer of black laced, dont think anyone else makes barb stuff yet</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Checked EQTraders, but thanks. Guess Blacksmithing isn't big in the land of Halas as high skilled BS's are hard to find. :(<br />
<br />
Thanks for the stats on the boots... wonder how many HP's a whole suit would give?<br />
<br />
Fitting name for the subject Blacklace :)</div></div><hr />

The cloak and belt were very nice too, just couldnt find the stats out of traders corner offhand to cut and paste here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The bracers are pretty nice too. 12ac 30hps mana 5 wis 5 sv all.  Light on the ac but good stats all around otherwise. I plan to make my self a set of those. The belt should be 15ac 5wis 40hps mana. Currently bugged tho and gets worn on the legs but assuming they fix that it's a descent belt too. The arms aren't bad on stats either, 16ac 5 wis 30 hps mana but really light on the ac. <br />
<br />
I wish the chain stuff had a bit better ac like the plate stuff does but i'll definitely make myself a few peices soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Blacklace</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i'm wearing arms/bracers, decent, if not excactly uber :)<br />
they dont look all bad either, link below if you happen to be interested(arms and bracers only, dont have any other pieces :)<br />

Ummmmm wow.  That's 750hp on a full set, I think, unless I missed one or counted one twice.  AC Is really high too but its not nice even numbers so I'm not gonna add it up :)  Too bad there isn't a stitch of wisdom on any of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Plus...the fact it's warrior/bard only?<br />
<br />
It's a pity, I think the belt, mask and gorget are pretty great.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">the 80hp legs are the best piece on the RZ set.<br />
<br />
i have a pair of artificers bracers, i dunno bout you guys but that was a huge upgrade for me.<br />
<br />
My old set of bracers<br />
were 17 ac 3sta 4wis 15 mana effect ultravision<br />
the artificers are 12 ac 30 hp 30mana 5wis 5 sv all and are onyx chain graphic.<br />
I lose 10 raw ac but gain 2 wis 10 sv all  42 hp  and 30 mana.<br />
<br />
No brainer for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I considered finding someone to make me one artificers bracer.<br />
I am wearing one umbral bracer - ac12, 15sta, 6sv all and either wolfcaller or JBB.  <br />
<br />
I end up wearing the JBB more often than not, so I am holding off for now though it is certainly an attractive option.<br />
<br />
PS - Gloriana.  Henora's fashion levels went through the roof tonight with the looting of some (FINALLY) SS chain pants.  :D</div></div><hr />
