<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My cudgel quest been on hold since alot of my guild havent been on that much. anyway my quest is the cure poison effect of the cudgel limited with charges? I never noticed charges on it but i finally went to use it when my warrior was poisoned and told me i  was out of charges. Ive heard of items that were out of charges for whatever reason and needed a GM to replace it with a new one so i dont know if this is the case or if there was charges on it to begin with that i didnt notice before.</div></div><hr />

hopefully you dont need to have at least 1 charge left to get your 7th (like the pally sword, forget which one)</div></div><hr />
