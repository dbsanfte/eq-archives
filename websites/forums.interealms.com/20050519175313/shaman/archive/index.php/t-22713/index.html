<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shiuna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I particularly liked these quotes from the post:<br />
<br />
Details are still sketchy, but it appears that late last night a rogue EverQuest Guide, now most likely an ex-guide, summoned several players to Veeshan's Peak, cast a bind spell on them, and watched them die over and over again at the hands of Veeshan's Peak NPCs.<br />
<br />
Afterwards, the guide responsible sent out a letter about his or her activities. This site received a copy from the ex-guide him/herself:<br />
<br />
    Hello!<br />
<br />
    Just thought I'd let you have this since you might like it. I was an EQ<br />
    Guide on the Terris Thule server. Last night (Nov 20, 2000) around 10:30pm<br />
    PST I decided to summon around 20 players to Veeshans Peak and bind them<br />
    there causing them to die many many times. For the players I didn't get a<br />
    chance to bind, I continued to summon them over and over until some big<br />
    nasty GM got mad at me, at which time my internet connection became very<br />
    unstable and disconnected me *shrug*. Included are some screenshots of the<br />
    nice event. For those of you Terris players whom I didn't get a chance to<br />
    bind: Sorry I will do better next time.<br />
<br />
    Take care!<br />
<br />
<br />
And this one:<br />

- Fixed the Paladin Epic Quest reward, which was procing a spell that would do around one million points of damage if left to its own devices.</div></div><hr />
