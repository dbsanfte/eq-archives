<br />
Even if EQ was created 5 years ago, the sheer number of perks and details of it make it very hard to beat when it comes to playability.<br />
<br />
I tried playing Final Fantasy Online, but somehow i crept back to EQ again, because there were so many things that were natural in EQ that were completely lacking (to my great irritaion) in Final Fantasy.</div></div><hr />

COH is a great example.  Graphics engine gets an A+, class balance gets a B (plenty good enough to start with), combat gets an A (fast paced, all your abilities are useful), general game design gets an A.  Economy doesn't really exist, but hey.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wow a thread just for me and I might not play much ;).  Touching though.  Thanks Glori!<br />
<br />
I played for a couple months when people were starting to raid the Vex Thal thing in Luclin.  I quit again rather quickly, but I saw these features:<br />
<br />
Luclin stuff - aa points, vah shir, nexus, bazaar, beastlord class<br />
Luclin time-frame stuff - compass, custom UI, chat channels, cross server chat/channels, cultural smithing, CT revamped, horses, stat food<br />
Loot announcements were in I think<br />
Multiple bags<br />
<br />
I'm curious about some more detail on these features:<br />
- EQ IM - does it require an active account?  If so, can I use it from another computer while my account is logged in?<br />
<br />
- LDoN is totally new to me.  I've heard it talked about with the instanced quest stuff, but does it all require a group?  Can I do quests solo?  I doubt I'll play enough to even bother if these are the same old retarded camp quests that EQ always had.<br />
<br />
- DoTs with no DD - which spells are these?<br />
- Curse based DoTs w/ MR, etc<br />
- Swarm Pets?  is that an AA?<br />
- Suspend Minion, AA?<br />
<br />
Do pets still take a chunk of experience?  I never used my pet soloing &quot;back in the day&quot;, is True Spirit good enough to use? I noticed someone obtained that spell for me :D.  And holy crap, first blue pet since like, level 49... four years ago.<br />
<br />
Thanks all</div></div><hr />

I think it is /join...... I am not sure if ;join works. I thought the ; was just for x-server tells. I haven't tried it, so if it does work don't shoot me, just know that you can also use /join.<br />
<br />
This disclaimer brought to you by the letter A and the number 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Oh, don't forget the &quot;find&quot; button and the &quot;lfg&quot; tool also.<br />
<br />
&quot;find&quot;  brings up a list of NPC (merchants mostly) and then draws a nice line of light to them for you to follow hehe.<br />
<br />
/lfg brings up the new lfg window.  You can add comments about yourself, what type of group you are looking for, etc.. Group leaders can also advertise they are looking for players.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I found the find feature mostly on accident.  Quite nice for people like me who haven't the foggiest idea where anything is.  Even in old world places... That LFG feature sounds like they borrowed from some daoc goodness and then improved.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kror</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">* A permanant compass, depending on your skill (LOVE THIS)<br />
<br />
This was true for a short time...then they made all character's Snese heading skill to START at 200.  So the compass is always there and always accurate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">- LDoN is totally new to me.  I've heard it talked about with the instanced quest stuff, but does it all require a group?  Can I do quests solo?  I doubt I'll play enough to even bother if these are the same old retarded camp quests that EQ always had.<br />
<br />
Requires a group to get a dungeon instance.  And by group they mean 3.  So you and any 2 others and you can get an instance and go to town.  <br />
<br />
There is a 7 level spead max, so if you are 60 you  can group with people up to 67(65) and down to people at 53 in instanced LDoN's.  But, a 52 cant group with a 60.  So, take the lowest level member of your group and +7, and the highest and -7, and where those numbers overlap is your grouping range.<br />
<br />
There arent really quests involved with LDoN; its all pretty straight killing and loot.  There are 4 different adventure types you can choose from (slaughter x many, collect x many drops, rescue X NPC, kill x boss mob) with slaughter and collect bing the easiest and therefore most commonly done.  <br />
<br />
There are 2 different dificulty settings; Normal and Hard.  Hards (IMHO) arent worth the effort though they have double the point value upon completion and better drops because I can run 2 normals in the time it takes to run 1 hard.  And in Normans a shaman functions fine as Main healer/slower; Hards will see too hard of hits and mitigation that make you heal now as effective and therefore probably lacking.<br />
<br />
I love LDoN's, but thats because I hate &quot;grinding&quot; in one spot in one zone for hours on end.  Thats not why I play EQ.  Adventure, conquest, loot, and friends are why I EQ; all those are found in LDoN for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Not to threadjack, but as a frustrated power-gamer, I LOVE LDON. You quickly learn who NOT to group with and go from there. Once you have a good rep you get tells out of the blue (even when not lfg) and even for places not LDON (Sol Ro is the latest - what is going on in that zone?)<br />
<br />
Did somebody mention the new TS UI? With recipes?<br />
<br />
Also customizeable UI's. Some are really, really nice looking.</div></div><hr />

It gives a small FAQ as well.  Never heard of this before until today, but it sounds really interesting and I think I'm going to try it from work :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I use IM alot.<br />
<br />
it is great to check for a couple friends online Before you get on or anything.<br />
<br />
It uses your regular EQ account so If inactive you cant use it. <br />
<br />
You show up in channels like normal. But on a who you do not show up in game. <br />
<br />
You can be invis as well if you like to other IM users. But if in game someone blindly sends you a ;t snoww heyas.. It will send so you know they are there. <br />
<br />
Overall if it had guild chat It would be amazing for those times you want to say Hi but don't want to get in game and possible roped into helping someone. (Bastards always so needy)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>isoka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">- DoTs with no DD - which spells are these?<br />
- Curse based DoTs w/ MR, etc<br />
- Swarm Pets?  is that an AA?<br />
- Suspend Minion, AA?<br />
<br />
Thanks all<br />
<br />
*DoTs without DD are: <br />
- breath of ultor, spell 64 ( disease from PoP ) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3394&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
- Blood of Saryn, spell 65 ( poison from PoP ) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=3396&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
- Bane, spell 64 ( Curse based on MR from LDoN ) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4095&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
- Anathema, spell 54 ( Curse based on MR from LDoN ) (http://lucy.allakhazam.com/spell.html?id=4094&amp;source=Live) <br />
<br />
The 2 last ones are the curse based DoTs.<br />
<br />
*Swarm Pet is an AA from PoP. ( Called &quot;Spirit Call&quot; you can train first rank at 61 ( summons 3 wolves ) then the 2nd rank at 63 ( adds one more wolf ) and the last one at 65 for a total of 5 wolves )<br />
<br />
*Suspend Minion is an AA from PoP<br />
The first rank grants you the ability to put dogdog in a bottle, to invis yourself and then, puts out dogdog from the bottle ;) but dogdog will lose its buffs and toys ( it's not instant, something near 2 seconds cast if I remember well seeing my bro playing his mage ;) )<br />
<br />
The second rank grants dogdog the ability to keep buffs and toys.<br />
<br />
You can have one pet Suspended and another one out.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if you are aware ( special hello to Vandam :D ) about alpha dog, but giving him 2 weapons will make him dual wield. Very nice ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, and there is a new torpor :) called Quiescence. It's a 65 one, from PoP and without the snare/slow effect. Enjoy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree, Vigdis.  The sheer volume of content in EQ is staggering, even if much of it is old/outdated.  Any new MMP has got to deal with that.<br />

<br />
OTOH you get tired of cookie-cutter missions VERY quickly and there are just not that many story lines.  That's a lack of breadth there, not just depth.<br />
<br />
I agree that CoH doesnt seem like it will last as long as EQ has. But who knew when that EQ had been out a couple of months that it would last 5-6 years.<br />
<br />
It wouldnt surprise me if in EQ 95% of the players are only interested in 5% of the content. Is that good or bad? Im leaning towards bad.<br />
<br />
Im only about halfways level-wise in CoH and I have already seen far FAR more history - meaningful history - in that game than I have in all my time in EQ. They might have upped the Ever part but the Quest part is definately starting to lag behing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">You get &quot;points&quot; from successful LDON missions.  You can use these points to buy gear or augments to gear.  Looking at your gear in the magelo, I'd not buy any augments right now because you're going to want to upgrade everything.  Looks just like I used to look in Velious pre-NTOV, but that's when you quit so there you have it!  Anyway you're gonna wanna check out LDoN missions.  Fairly decent gear drops from named mobs in those missions, most would be upgrades for you.  In Hard setting missions, the gear that drops is quite a bit better quality and would be substantial upgrades across the board.  I only do hard LDoNs because they are much more challenging and have better rewards.  <br />
<br />
Also, to get those vaunted Curse spells, you'll need to save up LDoN points with which to buy them.  Bane costs 650 points from the North Ro camp, Anathema costs 430 or so from the BB one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Thanks for the information everyone.  LDoN sounds exactly like EverQuest SHOULD have been from the beginning.  I'll try not to use too much of my limited free time on it though ;).<br />
<br />
How many &quot;points&quot; does one get from a &quot;mission&quot;?  650 is a lot to buy a spell... Granted, Talamay is still level 61 and is mainly used by my friend to powerlevel his twinks - evidence being celerity, regeneration and a couple other low level spells memorized when I first logged her in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">At level 65, if your group averages 63 or more, you get 51 for a normal win, 105 for a hard win.<br />
<br />
At level 65, if your group averages 57-62, do a hard (60) for the same 51 points, for the same difficulty mobs as the 'normal (65)' one.<br />
<br />
ps, browse here for what you can purchase with your Adventure Points: http://www.cardplace.com/eq/ldon/list.cgi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">At 65 you get 51 pts for a normal and 105 for a high risk.  So basically need 30 normal adv or 15 hards for a piece of 1492 gear.<br />
<br />
Can't remember exactly, but at 61 you can expect 20's to 30's maybe, no higher.  Yeah, it takes forever.  Just be glad you're not starting at level 20 where you get 1 pt per success and are expected to buy stuff worth 150 pts lol.<br />
<br />
Btw, this sort of reminds of that movie (can't remember the name!!) where the family goes into their bomb shelter in the 1950's and lives there for 35 years, then the son comes out in the 1990's to find the world... umm, different ;).<br />

These are so helpful, instead of flipping through your book to find a spell you can right click on an empty spell gem and pick the spell you want from the correct category and memorize it that way!<br />
<br />
To memorize a spell set you right click on the spell book icon and Load Spell Set, Save Spell Set, and Delete Spell Set appear just pick save spell set and type the name you want, and if you ever want to memorize those spells in that order again you just right click on the spell book and go to load spell set and pick the one you want!</div></div><hr />

LDoN augments - like Faern and Talamay mentioned, Lost Dungeons is pretty much what EQ should have been all along. Outside the &quot;Take this letter from one end of the world to the other. You'll get pps, faction and some xp&quot;, the Lost Dungeon idea is really quite cool. Take on missions (granted: generic after a while), get some half decent loot in the dungeons, save up points to buy ad customise you equipment to have the stats and effects you want. Ok - the stats and effects SOE say you want. Pick of the bunch for me are augs. No more hanging on to a crappy piece of kit coz I'd hate to lose the STA or resists or whatever.

<br />
I had gone through and done that point by point, as well as naming the game that had this innovative feature before EQ did.  AO took the lead for a lot of these ideas.  But I deleted it for fear of thread hijacking and negative rep bumps... I fear those!<br />
<br />
It was particularly addressed at Vigdis' comment about how great EQ is when you think about it :).  No offense Vigdis, hehe.  But basically many of these changes were a result of pressure from other newer games, and EQ made the correct decision to implement them.  Many have resulted in the dumbing down that a lot of us hate.<br />

&quot;We didn't make the MMORPG - we stole the idea from DIKU MUD and implemented it.&quot;<br />

&quot;We didn't make the TS UI - we stole the idea from DAOC and implemented it - better.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Someone needs to create a post with all the game updates, updating it every patch, and sorting by date so that people who are returning to the game can scan them all easily.<br />
<br />
Or maybe that has been done somewhere out there already...?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I can't believe nobody mentioned windowed mode for EQ.  Something they said they'd NEVER do.  (oh nos!  It would be too easy to cheat!)  HAR.<br />

Base 200 for sense heading was mentioned, but they put in 200 for swimming and bind wounds as well, didn't they?</div></div><hr />

No.  At least not for human monk twinks. ;)</div></div><hr />

-Numerical mana readout<br />
-Zoning pets<br />
<br />
Now find is &quot;borrowed&quot; from neocron and numerical mana have been around in anarchy since the launch 3 years ago, same with zoning pets that don't vanish when you die, can see groups mana bars and such :)<br />
<br />
Haven't tried city of heroes, looks nice but seem to lack depth to keep it fun for a longer period of time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>BuzWeaver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The first change that lead to the continued road of &quot;Were never going to do that&quot; was when they changed kits, toolboxs and such from combining without the correct materials. <br />
<br />
The &quot;Never going to do that&quot; has finally reached never, we now know our Mana and we have Buff timers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">Yep.. havent experienced it yet.. but when i hid them. and found the trader.. u couldnt buy from him. pretty stupid.. but thats good they improved it.. wil have to check it out when i get pc back (mumbled whenever thatll be)<br />
<br />
I think they fixed that in the last patch. Now when you click find trader when all traders are hidden it will unhide that trader so you can buy from them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Bruin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Also, to get those vaunted Curse spells, you'll need to save up LDoN points with which to buy them.  Bane costs 650 points from the North Ro camp, Anathema costs 430 or so from the BB one.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure Bane is from the East Commonlands camp.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Yeah, Bane is East Commonlands, which is a bit of a bastard seeing as no one ever runs adventures there.</div></div><hr />
