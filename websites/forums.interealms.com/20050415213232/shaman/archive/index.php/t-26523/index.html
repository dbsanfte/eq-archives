<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Did anyone else notice the change to ice age?<br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Casting Time from 7.8 seconds to 5.5 seconds <br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Mana cost from 375 to 413 <br />
04-08 17:40 Changed Slot 1 from &quot;Decrease Hitpoints by 1272&quot; to &quot;Decrease Hitpoints by 1273&quot; <br />
Casting time change is nice, mana is irrelevant.<br />
But... Notice the damage increase...<br />
<br />
Comedy at its purest form.<br />
<br />
-addendum- <br />
they did restore some of the damage to winters roar, so the jbb nerf wont be as severe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">More interesting is the Spear of Yoppa change.  That's very welcome</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Indeed, a very nice change.  I just couldn't help but have a laugh at the damage change to this one though.  <br />
I think Rytan is talking to a psychologist about how to handle agry mobs.  Give em somthing thats just so out to lunch they can't help but stop and laugh.  Worked for me :D</div></div><hr />

Yea but 1875 mana for a single target 61st level spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Yea but 1875 mana for a single target 61st level spell?<br />
No, go post in one of the Leo/Panther threads, there are only like 50 of them here.<br />
<br />
The yoappa change looks ok. ~200 more damage for ~80 more mana is not what I call efficient but the overall damage increase is good.<br />
<br />
The change from 1272 to 1273 damage on Ice Age makes me wonder what kind of tools the developers are using. That can not be a concious, deliberate decicion of a human being.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">they probably set a damage to recast to mana ratio of some sort and it auto readjusts... maybe the slight damage increase was a roundoff change as they tinkered with ratios?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I think they are messing around with the dps potential of spells, but keeping the dmg/mana ratio about the same. For ice age its reducing the recast times, for Yoppa's its increasing the size of the nuke (the mana cost was increased by a corresponding degree, but net recasting times kept the same)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hmm, thread it getting too serious....<br />
<br />
<br />
Its GOLD jerry, GOLD!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>m970456</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I see that they took the recast on the BL DD spells back up to 30 seconds from 18 seconds. <br />
<br />
It was all in the plans.  They boost BL's by taking recast down to 18 seconds.  Then they COMPLETELY mess up SoP/SoL.  Now they make it better than COMPLETELY messed up, but still screwed and take BL's back to where they were before.  This is all supposed to make us feel better when the end effect is that BL's stay the same and we get worse...some people are so easy to trick.</div></div><hr />

Correct me if im wrong, as it is almost 5am and I have yet to sleep and I work in 6 hours, but that says group to me.. not single... so.. group leopard for nearly 2k mana. whee!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Stinkeye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">BL nukes did not stay the same. The cast time went to .5 sec (or at least that's what it was the last time I looked.) The rangers have been asking for this for a long time because they lose more melee DPS than the nuke provided. The rangers basically said that shortening of recast time was useless (something along the lines of &quot;great, now I can lose DPS more often&quot;.) They must have done the same to beastlord spells.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I understand it, Leopard is now group-only. It is not a group spell, but a single-target spell you can only cast on group members.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Most optimal use of leopard would be sticking all bsts w/ a shaman (or two)...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, that is correct. The version that are currently on test are not the final versions. You'll probibly see the current versions of leopard/panther on test on monday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Serranex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Perhaps this time, 3 hours before the patch so we really don't have a lot of time to whine.<br />
<br />
And they'll say &quot;Oops, we forgot to take out the 30 second timer, we'll get that done in the next patch, in May&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Get the Leopard trash the hell outta this thread, for freakin real.  Not another word.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Looks like SoE plan to use high mana cost group only spell to balance Leopard/Panther line,  also prevent pet from getting panther without spend 12 aa on PA<br />
If group less melee ppls,   dd, rain and dot will be better way to do dps than panther/leopard.     For solo shaman, shaman pet no longer can do over 100 dps without leopard/panther.      For group shaman, high mana cost will require to use it wisely.</div></div><hr />
