<br />
Weak? WEAK?!?!?!? it's 32/31. <br />
<br />
And yes, this bow is very weak *for me*.<br />
<br />
Lord Seru drops a 35/33 bow with a proc, and Seru isn't much of a match now with new DR slow and another 5 levels.<br />
<br />
It takes alot more effort to get to Mithaniel and kill him than it takes to kill Seru, so yes this bow *is* weak considering what it drops of.<br />
<br />
That's a better ratio than any bow dropped b4 PoP came out. <br />
<br />
There is 3 bows in SoL that I'd say is better than this bow, that's Bow of Storms, Bow of Flames and Bow of Shadows. All 3 drops of mobs *much* easier than Mithaniel Marr.<br />
<br />
What else do you want? 99.9 pct of rangers would take this bow. <br />
<br />
No, 99,9% of the Rangers would not take this bow, there's more high-level rangers around today than you think :P. It's time to stop acting like 99% of the ranger population are people below 60, because it just isn't true anymore.</div></div><hr />

I feel so useless now that I'm told I must be one of the few 0.01% of the Rangers, Thank you.<br />
<br />
Pompous<br />
<br />
While there are better bows, from &quot;weaker mobs&quot;, and yes by the time you may take this MOB down it may not be at the &quot;top&quot; of the list I must take exception as one of the few 0.01% of the Rangers under 60.<br />

You can only do an encounter so many times before people stop showing up, that is where this bow and others like it come into play as stop-gap equipment fillers for the people who missed out on the uber bows the first time around. If not for items like this, many rangers would still be using Nightmarewood Compounds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tolian</div><div class="date">11-26-2002, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This bow is alright, but as has been mentioned, its really not appropriate for MM loot.  Maybe put it on TT or Grummus or something.  But not on a mob that has the kind of flag pre-reqs that mith marr does.  Ratio should be closer to 34 or 35/31 with perhaps a decent (100 or less dd) proc.</div></div><hr />

I guess  I am one of those amazingly rare people that are below level 60.  Same thing with about 100 (Rangers) that are below that level that I can think of.  Ah well, I guess we don't hold a candle to your elite Seru-farming self.  <br />
With that off my chest, I have to admit that this bow seems a bit weak from the mob it drops off of.  Nontheless, I would jump for it in a heartbeat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However the statement that 99.9% wouldnt take the bow is false, because im sure at least 60-75% would :)</div></div><hr />

Exactly, you might want to read the entire thread through once again Vanyarian, because I think you missed something.<br />
<br />

<br />
My response was an answer to the quote I made, the quote was that 99,9% of all rangers would take this bow, this is false. That's also what I wrote, ín different words. If you read what I wrote and the quote again I'm sure you'll understand.</div></div><hr />

Im not complaining.. with the new bows, hopefully the &quot;lesser&quot; bows will be up for sale (the ones that can be sold) for cheap :D I mean, BFTs are still 15k+ on my server... velium bows 4k...</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I will most definately not, Mithaniel Marr is part of the PoP story line and needs to be killed to progress in PoP.<br />
<br />
If the items are wanted or not is completely irrelevant.</div></div><hr />
