<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wondering which of the planes shaman armor drops in. I went to fear plane, or whichever one has the epic piece for shaman in it, but didnt get it (damn people left once they got what they needed) nor any shaman armor. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hiho,<br />
<br />
most armor drops in Hate. Some items will be dropped in Fear too, if I am correct (Turmoilskin Belt).<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you want Planar armor skip hate and go to PoG.  The Armor is better there.  Or skip PoG and go to Kael.<br />
<br />
If I were a Shaman looking for Armor I wouldnt bother with hate.  Rune Etched is outdated and junk compared to others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When you got to Hate chances are all that will drop will be iskar sham gear.<br />
<br />
I did a Hate raid last week and at the break-in we had a BP and Leggings drop but were iskar shaman only.  No other drops (.<br />
<br />
Just the way it goes sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Just wanted to reiterate that Iksar drops in Hate are not on the same drop table as Rune Etched (was confirmed at the time the iksar armours were introduced, on the dev boards).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>lomotil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">By the time I got to Hate and started getting armor, I had to pass on most of it because I had better. I have decided to focus instead on SS armor for now.<br />
<br />
I really wish they would have upgraded planar somehow; I mean...they made the mobs smarter there..hmmm...<br />
<br />
But, I know that would be more work than it's worth. It would mean revamping all the no drop loot sets. It was too late to rebalance the mobs long ago in Hate and Fear..not many folks I know go for the armor any more, just epic pieces.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Iksar Hate armor, for the most part, is better than the Thurgadin armor in my opinion.  A couple of toss ups, but a mix of the 2 is best.  Unless you can get Kael or Skyshrine armor.  PoG armor is on par with Thurgadin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">For a level 52 troll shaman you are better off killing in Kael to get Thurgadin armor or go to Growth for armor.  You'll get armor faster killing giants in Kael than in Growth since most of the raids to PoG don't always get to the shaman armor droppers, that and you can usually find a group killing in Kael 24/7.  It doesn't take a raid, just a group or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think people are way off the rate of iksar armor drops.  It's the standard grass is greener syndrome.  I've yet to be on a hate raid where more Rune Etched didn't drop than Scaled Heirophant (and I'm an iksar).  It looks like the armor drops that you can't use are far better, but there's really little difference.  I had 3 rune etched bp's in my bank at one point, and I've definitely looted more of it (that was rotting) than iksar armors.<br />
<br />
As to the original question though, if your guild is doing fear/hate, you'll want to head to hate for your armor drops.  PoG and Kael both have drops for all classes, but I think the drop rate in both is lower than fear/hate.  Have never been to PoG so I can't say for certain, but armor in kael is usually harder to come by than armor in the planes (though you will have good nights with lots of drops).</div></div><hr />
