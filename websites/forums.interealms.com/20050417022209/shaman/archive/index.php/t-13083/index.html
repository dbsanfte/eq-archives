<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off I want to thank all the people that post here. Over the last 51 levels your tips and advice have really helped. Now that I've hit 51 though, I find that I am having a hard time following the advice I've been reading here. Hense why I am posting after all sorts of people have been kind enough to offer advice. My question is simple, with Luclin, Planes of Power, and Legacy of Ykesha where are the best places to solo? So far, I have this list...<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Key: [Place - Target Mobs (reason it's ruled out)]<br />
<br />
High Hold Keep - Killing Nobles and Bards. (camped almost 24/7)<br />
<br />
City of Mist - Hunting the Stables or the Gazebos (to many adds, place is a death trap)<br />
<br />
The Hole - Entrance Elementals (Rev makes it very hard to solo here without having to run every 4th fight or so)<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns - Gnomes (to few of them to make it worth while)<br />
<br />
Dulak - Ships, Wandering Mobs (camped and junk XP)<br />
<br />
Nadox - Elementals at back entrance (to few)<br />
<br />
---------<br />
<br />
Now I don't expect that some people won't want to say that I should go and find my own place. And it's not like I have haven't. I am used to Duoing with someone past 50 and since I am forced to solo because of life restraints I wanted to find places I could do it. I've tried places like Scarlet and the Grey as well as Hoppers in DSP. If someone could also give advice on how to make the above places more viable that would be great too. ^_^</div></div><hr />

You will never get adds if you are fighting in the right places.  You may get 2 or 3 on a pull when you first start breaking an area but if you are ready for this shouldn't be a problem.  Also I'd recomend the temple at your level.  By the time you clear it out, the first ones should be popping.  There are quite a few guides on this so I wont get into too much detail.  Buff up yourself and alpha dog.  Fight your way to temple (easy).  Park dogdog in front and pull the ones on top with slow then kill.  Then go inside and pull leaving dogdog in same place.  Look on other posts for the order to do this in.  You should be able to pull everything to the same spot right out front and you will never get adds.  Dont give up on this place its great! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ajgala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Don't rule out the Gnomes at 51.  There are ten there for your pleasure.  (Twelve to begin with, but after you handle the kings, they won't be back for a long while.)<br />
<br />
The other Echo threads describe how to handle the kings.  One zone is required.<br />
<br />
<br />
How about Scarlet Desert?  I have enjoyed soloing there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Gnomes? What gnomes? this sounds like news to me? Is there a solospot that has avoided my attention?!?!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Update: Leveled to 52 last night. I did it all at the gnome camp in Echo Caverns. It wasn't the best XP but it was steady and headache free. I made 52 in about 9 hours total. Not a record, but not bad I guess. <br />
<br />
For Zamrak: The gnomes I speak of are in Echo Caverns, the one half of it that leads to The Deep. The gnomes are located at the first right hand turn you come to. You'll go up the incline and see two guard, farther up is a open area with a camp of casters of to the right. There's also a tinker merchant. When pulling I leave these guys alone, they were mostly light blue to me and not worth the trouble. After the open area is another ramp with two guards. After then you find a room with the kings and their subjects. You can explore all this without worry as they are non KOS to begin with. With SoW up, I pulled the kings to zone and zoned before I started anything. They will stay at zone in so long as no one kills then and they respawn. Once this is done you can pull all of the mobs single, I usually just faught them in the big open area away from the casters (they got the right side, I took the left side). Just as a heads up, if the mobs have been up a while, they will buff each other. That means that mobs around the female caster (Pomela(sp?) is a cleric and will complete heal) are buffed with cleric hp buffs and the ones around the Court Sage (he's an enchanter and will charm/mez you and your pet if your MR isn't high enough) have a damage shield that gave my Poochie fits til I dispelled it. All and all it's a cake walk of a camp. I'd just slow and sick Poochie on them most of the time, I'd melee/dot too if I felt the desire. Before the camp I got Poochie some mage summoned weapons, mask and belt so that might have helped make it easier too. Hope this helps, if you have any questions, please let me know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sarania</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The Plateau in Scarlet Desert I found isnt too bad especially if you are waiting for the buring priest for the Shield of Bane Warding quest. You can also try soloing in the Grey to the right of Mons Letilis zone. I found it easy to just sit on the mountains when you need to med. If you can pull the wandering shissars along the ridge to the right of the zone that heads toward Ssra temple, You can work on the EB necklace quest ok if you can get into Katta. Of course, with the selection of illusion potions these days it shouldnt be too hard.</div></div><hr />

I did try Revenants and Reavers on the plateu, not for the Shield of Bane Warding but to pick up a Lucid Shard while they were XP mobs. I loved the Revenents, all easy kills even if I happened to pull two or three, but the Reavers just ruined it for me. I couldn't get my resists high enough to keep from getting mez'd and dot'd to fire and gone. I also died to a nasty bug which stripped me of all my buffs and left me dead before I could blink. Still not sure how that happened. As soon as I got my shard, I headed out. It would be a great area with better resists then I have though. As for the Grey, I'll have to try there. I am kinda prefer my mobs standing in a single place. ^_^ Things can get out of hand with my terrible pulling without the addition of unwanted adds from wandering mobs. ^_^ Thank you much for both suggestions. <br />
<br />
After a weekend of half hearted trying I am still 52. I think with CoM I might be able to 53 tonight. I did try grouping in PoI, but like more groups it was nice while it lasted but it never lasts long. ^_^ I prefer the steady if maybe a little slower stream from solo XP. Still trying to think of a good spot to do that at 53. I was thinking PoJ or PoI, but both are over camped alot of the time and CoM might stay okay in 53, but it's already going green and light blue for the most part. ^_^ I will say that I love both my lizard and my bracer they make my XPing so much easier. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">IN the northeast section of Scarlet Desert you will find the Bloodtribe.  Some Warriors will be going light blue but the shaman should still be dark blue and the Scarlet Cheetas will be dark blue as well.  Some of the lightcrawlers will be dark blue but not all of them.<br />
<br />
At 51 I can pull a continuous stream of dark blue MoBs there and do an AA in about 4 hours.<br />
<br />
I prefer CoM though since the loot in Scarlet Desert is really bad whereas in CoM I can get a couple of hundred in vendor loot and an item worth about 1kpp about every 4 hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I finished out 52 last night in CoM, without RL distractions it went rather quickly. Even with a group of people doing the shaman epic (killing Lord R) behind me I was able to keep out of their way and keep the spawns cleared. One thing I love about CoM is it's ability to suprise you with bad pathing and ghosting mobs. Nothing says excitment like a simple light blue mob turning into three blue and all of them beating on you like you were a loot pianta. I stayed after geting 53 and I am going to finish it tonight if things go well. After that I am not sure. I think I might try LoY (the harbor and Nadox), I still need to get the Blood of Nadox spell anyway.</div></div><hr />
