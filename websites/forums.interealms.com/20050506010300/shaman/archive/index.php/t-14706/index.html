<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iceborn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A week ago I found Ancient Scourge of Nife for sale in the bazaar. I have never seen this spell for sale on my server (FV) and I check the bazaar for spells OFTEN. I hastily ran to the bank to gather my coin only to discover that I was short of the asking price by several thousand platinum. I quick phone call to my father in law got me to the 20k asking price. Seconds later I had the spell in my book. I was still on the phone with my father in law and he asked me what other spells I was missing. I told him of the few that I had interest in and he said he would let me know if they ever showed up for sale. <br />
<br />
Yesterday I got a phone call at work from my wife. She was all giddy because her dad had just found Pox for sale in the bazaar. This was all well and good but there was no way I would be able to buy it. I was in debt 12k due to my last spell purchase so no Pox for me. I wasn&#8217;t too unhappy. I figured it would turn up again.<br />
	<br />
A short time later I get another call from the little lady, this time she tells me that her dad bought the spell for me. &#8220;Oh great&#8221; says I, thinking that now I&#8217;d be 30k in debt. Oh how wrong I was. It seems good ol&#8217; dad spent 60k for the spell. He sold his BP and his Lodi shield to finance it. While I am very grateful for his selflessness, I am very unhappy at the prospect of spending the next 2 months in debtors prison farming plat to raise the 72k that I now owe. <br />
	<br />
So hear is my quandary; Is the spell worth 60k? Should I scribe it or try to sell it to get my father in law his gear back? If I scribe it where is the best place to farm plat for me (62 shaman) and my wife (61 warrior). I was thinking Seb. She and I can normally make about 1200 plat an hour there. More if we are lucky. But good grief, it&#8217;s going to take at least a month to raise the coin that way.<br />
	<br />
Help me out folks, which road to I choose?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Ice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ouch, 60k? It's not worth that much. Pox is a nice spell, but like most disease dots, limited in use.<br />
<br />
I don't often solo and I paid 7k for mine, and was lucky to see it so cheap. I can't honestly say I've gotten the use out of it that even 7k expenditure suggests.<br />
<br />
It would depend how much you solo, but if it was me, I would rather sell it in your position.<br />
<br />
Another suggestion is, maybe you could help your father in law get a replacement BP and back/shield slot?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The trader who sold that spell for 60k saw him coming big time.  Did your father-in-law get dinner first?<br />
<br />
Seriously, tell ye olde father-in-law to at least do a price check before selling the farm to buy a fire beetle eye.<br />
<br />
Take your warrior friend and camp cazic sewers for boots.  You can duo that spot pretty easy at your level.  Boots sell for a nice chunk of change.  And the xp there isn't horrible.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, you might as well scribe the spell, there is no way in hell you are going to find someone to buy it for anywhere close to that price.  Well...maybe you will, but if you do, try and sell em some other crap while you are at it :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">60k.  Wow.  That's...  obscene.  It's a good spell, but it isn't THAT good.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
1) Ask your father-in-law to never do you a favor again.<br />
<br />
2) Scribe the spell (nobody will buy it for anything close to that price and if they do, they need help of their own). <br />
<br />
3) Start farming.  Cazic Thule (FT3 boots) is one idea, though rare.  You could perma-camp Lodizal pretty easily, as he drops the shell every time and can sometimes drop more than one shell.  <br />
<br />
Hmm, maybe your father-in-law will buy a Lodizal Shell Shield from you...for 72k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Taabya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm not sure what BP he had, but if it is campable I'd just camp the BP and the shield, replace his eq, call it even,  and hrmmm...maybe tell him you have all your spells?  Acumen of Dar'Khura sells for 80k on my server, I'd hate to see someone spend 80k on a spell for you and you have to pay it back.<br />
<br />
I find this to be a very bizarre situation.  Friends ask me what spells I am missing all the time and I tell them, but I surely don't expect them to sell their eq to purchase the spells.   Sometimes a friend will have a spell drop and save it for me - that's how I got Pox and Voice of the Berserker - but I honestly don't know what I'd do if anyone sold their eq to buy something for me.    It doesn't really put you in a very good position, though it was certainly very generous.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I wouldnt pay more then 15K myself.<br />
BUt on the other hand....this must have been a error on the sellers part....but I bought Pox for 1000 pp 3 weeks ago.<br />
I gave to a friend who didnt have.<br />
<br />
Zim</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Awesome on getting an Ancient spell.<br />
<br />
And...OH MY JEBUS IN HEAVEN...60k for pox...yeesh.  He got taken big time.  I wouldn't even spend that much on the 64 disease dot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First grats on the ancient spell. That was a good price on a nice spell.<br />
<br />
As far pox goes it definitely isn't worth 60k. My initial reaction would be to say tough there's no way it's worth that to me and I even said not to buy it and you still did it anyway so it's your loss. However i'm sure that won't go over well with your father in law and probably not to well with your wife.<br />
<br />
My best suggestion would be to talk with him and let him know he probably over paid for the spell and then the 3 of you should work together to 1)farm him a new bp and cloak or money to buy replacements and 2) money to get all your bank accounts filled back up some.<br />
<br />
Trying to do someone a favor and pick up a spell for them is one thing but selling stuff to pull it off is really a but over the edge especially given his apparent lack of familiarity with the spells. Torpor is probably worth selling your soul for but pox is honestly something you could never get and never really miss.<br />
<br />
CT definitely has some potential for farming stuff. Especially if someone has descent smithing to make tae ew armor.<br />
<br />
Another posibility would be the new zone they just added veskar??. There seem to be some fairly nice drops in there and the market should still be good for them since they just came out. Might even be able to upgrade some of your gear in there too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I totally forgot about the smithing drops in CT.  I've sold some of that stuff for 7k a pop.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vivyenne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My advice is, next time, do PC's on the spells you're interested in, and tell him how much you're willing to spend on each one before you leave him to his own devices LOL.<br />
<br />
I told my BF to keep a lookout for Pox too but not for more than 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It sucks to get ripped off, but just think that you got Ancient Scourge and Pox for 80k.  That would be a deal.</div></div><hr />
