<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Simas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really dont like the use of the word &quot;gay&quot; to mean stupid or dumb or the like but it was common place back in highschool and in EQ and such and i would generally just let it slide.  <br />
<br />
However this happened the other day and pissed me off a tid bit. <br />
<br />
To set up the senario i am originally from the area where the sniper is killing people.  Kind of freaks me out i use to go to the mall (close to the gas station) where the last guy was killed.  <br />
<br />
My friend had gone home from school for the weekend and i caught him online. <br />
<br />
&quot;Sup&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Not much chillin back in VA with the sniper&quot;  <br />
<br />
&quot;For real? Thats so screwed up i hope they catch him&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Yeah hes so gay&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
/sigh that just really bugs me, now a person that is randomly killing people for what appears to be no reason is &quot;gay&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some people are ignorant. Even people who are anti homosexuality are generally aware enough not to do this. Can you imagine the uproar if the guy said &quot;Yeah, that sniper, what a Jew &quot;... HUH???</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Anina_RN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Actually, heh; for a while at my high school, the term 'jewed' became popular. I have no idea how, but it was used basically instead of 'screwed'.<br />
<br />
&quot;Whoa, you paid 2 bucks for your pop? You got jewed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Or:<br />
<br />
&quot;Wow, final chem exam is tomorrow!!? That's jewish.&quot;<br />

Some people are stupid enough to use it after they do. Albeit some comics are funny with it, like one I remember saying &quot;I'm Half French, and Half Jewish. What that means is I love to kiss, but I want paid for it.&quot; Some jokes like that are meant to be nothing more than twists on old ethnic stereotypes. French are all horny, and Jewish people Greedy, is basically the joke. That is where it came in. I say it on occasion, but everyone I know, and I say it around, know I'm not racist. If I don't know the person, I refrain from using such words.</div></div><hr />

EXACTLY! And you would certaibnly never use it around someone you didn't know who might be one of those ethicities.... so why do people treat 'fag' and 'gay' differently?</div></div><hr />

While I do agree that some people take offense too easily (and realize that sometimes I'm ONE OF THEM *g*) the fact remains that with any bigoted statement you have the potential to GIVE offense. Having said that, such a statement doesn't belong in a public forum. The gay and Jew comments are one's you would really have to watch because even IRL you just never know who may be one, the other, or BOTH ;)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tulouis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">What you must realize is that people say &quot;that is gay&quot; a lot, especially in highschool. It's a hard habit to break.<br />
<br />
That said, I never refer to a person as gay if I mean bad in some way, as in &quot;That dude is so gay, why won't he just shut up&quot;. However I am still guilty of refering to something as gay, as in &quot;You have to work at 5am tomorrow? That's gay&quot; <br />
<br />
I don't mean it in a bigoted way, certainly. Hell, I am good friends (and neighbors) with 3 gay women and 1 gay guy. It really makes absolutely no difference to me if someone is gay or straight. However saying things like &quot;That's gay&quot;, well, it's a hard habit to break after doing it for 8 years.<br />
<br />
Reneger is totally different Amdee, because to reneg is a real word and has nothing to do with the N word that we all know and hate. Kinda like that teacher getting fired over using the word &quot;Niggardly&quot;, which means cheap (as in cheapskate).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">You're right of course, Talnari, but I wouldn't say &quot;reneger&quot; outside of my circle of friends just because of the possible consequences (like the incident you mention).<br />
<br />
Not that I shouldn't be able to, but people get so emotional.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jinthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">During my adolesence i totally abused the sayings, &quot;that is so gay&quot;, &quot;this is so....&quot;, or &quot;he is so...&quot; Maybe if I wanted i could use lame instead, but then again i dont like the sound of the word lame, gay seems to fit so much better.  I never really thought about it offending the sexual preference of another. I mean &quot;gay bashing&quot; when i think about it, is pretty gay if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

 Ummmm. That is a real word and they were using it correctly.<br />
 Renege \ verb 1: to fail to follow suit when able in a card game in violation of the rules. 2: to go back on a promise or commitment.<br />
 Reneger \ noun 1: One who fails to follow suit when able in a card game in violation to the rules. 2: One who goes back on a promise or a commitment.<br />

 So how would that word not do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Amdee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah, it's a real word. I was being sarcastic in my example. As in: How some people could be so sensitive that they could see the &quot;neger&quot; part of the word as something offensive. I used &quot;reneger&quot; with my buddies regularly.<br />
<br />
My point being irony about how people can be sensitive about nearly anything, no matter how legit :D<br />
<br />
It was a joke. /bonk</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Aralys</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">And yet if you, out of fear, stop using totally appropriate words such as renege or niggardly because you fear someone might take offense... PC wins. This is the problem that PC perpetuates. Fight it, don't give in.  PC is all about people being so afraid to offend, they simply avoid situations and eventually people who might be offended.  It is destructive group-think, utterly intolerant of dissent.  Don't let the fear win.  For a great read on what PC actually does to people's lives, schools, work, and relationships, read &quot;The New Thought Police&quot; by Tammy Bruce.  She is a lesbian feminist who finally saw how counterproductive and destructive the PC movement really is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>KaninZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Don't be afraid to speak your mind...just make sure you engage ye olde brain first. Try not to hurt anyone and try not to stereotype. A little common sense can go a long way.<br />
  If by chance you DO offend...be big enough to apologize &amp; try to articulate your point in a different way. If the other person is unreasonable about it....at least you tried to do the right thing. Some people seem to take offense no matter WHAT you do or say.</div></div><hr />

Something like that? ;P I wish someone would come up with an original insult for me... <br />
<br />
Insults are only insults if taken and perceived as one. If I am not politically correct and I offend you, and I don't care, you will get more worked up about it. If it bothers you as much as alot of people say, then please, gouge out your eyes, shove sticks in your ears too, the media is full of it.<br />
<br />
To be politically correct nowadays, you need an advisor, and an advisor to that advisor. And even that doesn't work! Take a look at the bufoonary that is my beloved government. First, that proof bullshyte. Then that dumb C-word that called GWB a moron ...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Calling someone a name based on their ethnicity is not the same is using that ethnicity as an unrelated term of derision. If, every time someone showed lack of respect, I said &quot;wow, thats so Christian Fundamentalist&quot; it would be offensive not only to Christians, but to all people who are bothered by bigotry. If I refer to a poor neighborhood as &quot;The Niggerhood&quot; I am showing my own ignorance and lack of respect for a segment of the population, which should rightly be upset with me. And if I decide to refer to all self-righteous self-serving  individuals  at George W's... wait.... what was I saying? Oh yeah... I am just as guilty of offence. I don't care how you feel about the portion of the population you are co-opting the name for... show some respect to the language if nothing else. Anyway, on my server, 'gay' is such a nonissue since we have several VERY out people... the phrase &quot;Thats gay&quot; is usually followed by &quot;Really? Can I get a phone number?&quot;;  the people who really dislike homosexuality stopped using the phrase rather quickly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>TraccAnkeeel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I dont think that anything is meant in particular by the way 'gay' is used, more at how it is spelled and interpreted, than misused.<br />
<br />
If you take 'gay' as meaning a 'homo' then it looks to be politically incorrect, but I'm sure I have seen it used in many posts, spelled 'ghay' and 'ghey' where the meaning isn't referred to as meaning 'homo', rather that it's meant to mean something like 'not the norm' or along those lines.<br />
<br />
So if you say - Oh no, thats so 'ghay', you can take that as meaning - Oh no, thats way off.<br />
<br />
I'm no expert, just seems that way to me, no big deal. (Does get annoying to keep seeing it tho, lol).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">The use of &quot;gay&quot; as a term for &quot;not normal&quot; stems directly from using it as a &quot;derogatory&quot; term for homosexuals.  This isn't complicated philology here, it happened in the 20th century, all in English.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It also suggests that the user is either ignorant or a bigot... so maybe we should leave it alone as a sort of litmus test?<br />
<br />
Gay originally meant happy or cheerful.... though  since saying something is 'bad' can mean good, and saying something is 'hot' and saying it is 'cool' can mean the same thing, maybe saying something is 'ghey' and meaning it is not desirable may mean you have a great deal of respect for homosexuals? My head hurts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Roophus Gunthar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You can call it ignorant or whatever you choose, but many kids are brought up on the word now.  After going through k-12, I know that kids will think up almost anything and if they hear it, they'll say it.  When trends occur, it's normally popular to speak in a certain way or say certain things.  This is exactly how &quot;gay&quot; became another word for stupid or dumb.  You can call the people who say the word a homophobe or ignorant, but they aren't...because they aren't even thinking of actual homosexual people when they say the word.  They think of it as dumb or stupid and nothing else.  It's not easy to just stop saying a word when it's apart of your everyday language.  I dont personally use this word in this way, but I hear it spoke almost everyday in this manner.</div></div><hr />

So someone who grew up around ignorant bigots and calls all black people 'niggers' because its what he grew up with isn't ignorant because he doesn't mean any harm and he doesn't actually use it with a negative connotation? Sorry, if you don't know the real meaning fo the word you're ignorant. And if it is pointed out to you that it is offensive and incorrectly used you continue to use it with no care for the group it offends you are a bigot. Gay is NOT another word for stupid or dumb, and the people who use it as such usually use 'homo' in a similar derogatory manner.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get *jewed* is therfore self explanatory, as Jews became the target of complaints about profiting from others losses, much the same way we complain about exploitative banks and lending institutions these days.<br />

This is not in anyway an anti-semitic view btw,just some historical background to the term that I cam across during recent studies of the James Joyce work , Ulysses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Taamar Bladesworn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Using the phrase 'jew them down' (to mean haggle) in current society will elicit embarassed silence from onlookers... I watched it happen to my mother who thought the phrase was 'CHEW them down' (as in, to nibble away at the price). Turns out there was a rabbi present, and he was the brother of my fathers boss. I didn't know my mother HAD shame. The moral of the story is that if you don't know the source of a phrase as well as the meaning you can embarass yourself pretty horribly. What is 'accepted' as common usage can still be offensive and bigoted.</div></div><hr />
