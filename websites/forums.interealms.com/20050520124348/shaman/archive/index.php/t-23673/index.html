But I was waiting to see what happened with OoW to see if there was any real reason to continue to play. After reading the Posts from the NDA Lifted and Reading that our new pet is a Carbon Copy of the lvl61 pet, its time to hang up the Spear over the mantel. <br />
<br />
So I have hit the Account Cancel button.<br />

See you all in WoW or EQ2...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure the pet thing is a change in progress. Just like the new HoT spell was actually healing LESS than BoT with the changes from a coulpe months ago. <br />
<br />
I honestly do not understand why people who have already invested 100's-1000's of dollars and untold hours into this game would skip something like OoW to save the 30 bucks, without even bothering to try. Personally, I say buy it, try it, and THEN quit if it still sucks. I see a WHOLE lot more optomistic posts about  OoW than negative ones.</div></div><hr />

I guess you just have more faith then the rest of us. I hope it works out for everyone still enjoying the game. However it seems to me the only real way to get them to notice the problems of the shaman class is to boycott this expation or just end billing. I hope I am wrong, I guess we will see.</div></div><hr />

Amazing aint it that they still have those bugs in place after all that beta testing.<br />
And sure just buy and wait for Rytan to fix us, it worked so well in the past</div></div><hr />

Ever try to code a game of this magnitude? Bugs are a part of EVERY SINGLE game there is. You think WoW will be bug-free upon release? Or balanced? Your fooling yourself. Blizzard is far far better at fixing their stuff before it goes live, but they STILL have problems. <br />
<br />
Stuff will get fixed, eventually. Every expansion ever in this game has been buggy, yet we all played through it. This is no different, in fact, if anything, I bet this will be one of the cleanest releases ever, just because SOE knows people are waiting to see how it is.</div></div><hr />

I think that, on the whole, Sony  have a very bad reputation when it comes to bugfixing, and deservedly so. My entire guild missed the Karana flag when we killed Agnarr some time ago on our first attempt, because karana depopped after 2 mins as opposed to 15-20 (which I have confirmed on several agnarr kills since and our server GM has confirmed).<br />
<br />
I started playing City of Heroes on its week of release. Granted it is a much smaller game; However I onlly discovered 1 bug in 2 months of fairly solid gaming, and the GM that came to my assistance (within minutes) had the power to do a workaround (essentially moving a mob from an inaccessible place to in front of my group/squad).<br />
<br />
OOW might promise a lot of things, but i seriously don't expect the bugs to be fixed &quot;any time soon&quot;. Eventually, yes, perhaps years after the bug appears.<br />
<br />
Blazz, we all played through it cause we love the game, and invested so much time in it, not cause we thought the bugs were &quot;not important&quot; or merely a &quot;nuisance&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I couldnt agree more. I dunno, I think its a clssic case of &quot;half-empty&quot; or &quot;half-full&quot;. EQ is getting tired, and I think that a LOT of people shifted from opt to pess over the past year, mostly due to the Gaets debacle. <br />
<br />
I will play EQ for now, since I just dont see better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as someone who is able to see how &quot;balanced and bug free&quot; WoW is I happen to know that even in it current beta state it is more polished then EQ ever was.<br />
And more important Blizzard shows more interest in fixing buggs and balancing stuff then I have seen in EQ since the early days (before the sigil team left that is)<br />
<br />
But keep believing in SoE Blazz, I am sure they don't mind your payments while they blow smoke about fixes and balancing</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Varrish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Sony Online Entertainment does have a history of mismanaging bug fixes, in all their games (Star Wars Galaxies is probably the worst). You have to wonder about their programmers' coding abilities, as it must rate on the same level as Microsoft's. <br />
<br />
But I don't think that's the point..<br />
<br />
Bugs are things that can be worked through - most of us are using Windows, if that isn't evidence enough. Faulty/Negligent/Ignorant Game Design, Vision, Planning is not.<br />
<br />
I'll say it again..<br />
Sony is utilitizing this theory - if they're playing it now, why change it and risk losing players. <br />
<br />
People who want to play will mitigate themselves to group acceptable classes; while those who do not will continue to complain no matter the situation - and are high loss players.<br />
<br />
----<br />
Beyond that crap, did anyone else besides Thorn notice that most spells are copies of Kunark, LDoN, PoP and GoD spells? Two AoE 50pct Slow spells, an upgraded FA, similiar pet, similiar Canns, similiar HoTs... <br />
<br />
And there are only a few shaman players climbing the walls over this? What drugs are the rest of you using, and where can I get some?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">also it should be pointed out that hardly anyone doing the curent expansion is from the orignal eq, as such they just dont have alot of the skills that some of the orginals had.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, our definitions of &quot;balance&quot; are probalby quite different. Wow looks to be oriented toward a more laid-back, non-hardcore approach, which is fine for some people. <br />
<br />
The game I am waiting for is Vanguard, which will be TOTALLY different from WoW or EQ or EQ2. Different people have different tastes in games, and one of the things that bothers me the MOST about some of these new games, and even EQ, is a trend toward a &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;. <br />
<br />
Time will tell, but honestly, how can I NOT spend the 30 bucks to &quot;see&quot; if I can squeeze another half-year of fun out of EQ, bugs and all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>vincenzovs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well as someone who is able to see how &quot;balanced and bug free&quot; WoW is I happen to know that even in it current beta state it is more polished then EQ ever was.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is in line with what I have heard from friends in the WoW beta.<br />
<br />
To give Sony some credit, some of the code in their system is like 7-8 years old. It's hard to keep adding to a large system and eventually you have to throw away and start again.<br />
<br />
I used to work as a developer on banking systems, and with one particular system that was a bit like EQ (it worked, it got the job done, users liked it after they got used to some of the annoying habits/bugs but was a nightmare to work on as a developer) we spent 30 million dollars building a new system to replace it. The project was a success.<br />
<br />
I don't know how many lines of code/classes/how complex these MMORPGS are, but i expect EQ to be pretty damn complex.<br />
<br />
Therefore i expect EQ to remain buggy cause:<br />
<br />
1) Sony are like that (I played Planetside till sick of bugs)<br />
2) With such an old codebase it's hardwork unless you start from scratch (EQ2)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh my, I can't believe I forgot that..<br />
<br />
When Brad McQuiad picked up and left, you knew EQ was doomed :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Thing is, our definitions of &quot;balance&quot; are probalby quite different. Wow looks to be oriented toward a more laid-back, non-hardcore approach, which is fine for some people. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know if we have a different view on &quot;balance&quot; but i can tell you this:<br />
<br />
When I go into BRD (the current high end instance in WoW) I will encoun ter situations where a certain class will be needed to win that encounter in an easy and smooth way.<br />
Now as there are 8 classes to pick from (counting the 2 faction specific classes as 1 for this) and only 5 spots in a group this will ensure that my group will encounter easy tasks and hard tasks.<br />
It will also ensure that no class is not welcome. <br />
<br />
On the other hand when I see the current EQ I see a game where the optimum group can kill all encounters just as easy and the not optimal group can simply not kill some at all.<br />
No effort has been made to get variation in the encounters besides adding a different AE on the mob or tweak the DPS/HP on a mob.<br />
<br />
The devs in WoW have tried to make sure that any instance not only feels like a dungeon crawl but also offers various very different encounters. We have to see how the raid game will look but I have faith that WoW will be something for the casual as well as being something for the hard core raider.<br />
<br />
The Devs in EQ have tried to maintain the current status quo in the game and imo that has created a bland game where each new encounter feels like the previous encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would have to agree.  With LDoN I thought SOE was onto something new and exciting.  Then after seeing that each and every encounter after the first 3 or 4 in each dungeon is most likely to be the same...and the fact that most people will always opt out for the easy part (IE Collects and Slaughters vs Rescue and Assasinate missions).  Then out came GoD with all it's glory and uber new gear, only to realize you have to be almost time enabled to even stand a chance in the higher end zones.  I am not complaining these are just my observations.  It wasn't all that long ago that a Paladin with 8k HPs was the best on the server and a Shaman with 4500 was god-like.  Now if you do not have 9500-10k you can not tank Kod`Taz well - so have been told - and if you do not have real close to all of your spells and 6k HP you will most likely be passed over time and again unless it is a guild or friends group.  So yes they have &quot;upped the high end game&quot; some and kept the rest mediocre as possible.</div></div><hr />

Have seen you on these boards for a long time and have a lot of respect for you. I was in Beta for WoW  I can promise you WoW in its beta form has a  minute amount of bugs and they will not release the game till the character class's are balanced. By the way there is not a class, atm. other then warlocks that are not valuable to the group setting and they are fixing them as well speak.  Eq had their chance to make a difference but every exspansion gets worse and offers more bugs to add on top of the old bugs they never get around to fixing.<br />
<br />
xan out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">just play a new game and if you still have desire for eq you'll come back. You can try asherons call 2 for 14 days free I think or theres several betas going on-WoW, Eq2, saga of ryzom.<br />
Alternatively you could be just looking for non mmorpg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">When the response to the 67 pet being a carbon copy of the 61 pet is &quot;every release has bugs&quot; I have to just /boggle.<br />
<br />
How many threads/posts are on these boards alone that detail the /feedback submitted about this spell?<br />
<br />
SOE's list of fixes/concerns was so overwhelming they couldn't address this one item? Come on. That it wasn't addressed shows a fundamental cluelessness about customer service (for one) and attention to basic detail (for two.) Sure, this is a minor issue in the overall scope, but for a class that is feeling as misused and abused as shaman are it is one more straw. Common sense says SOE should of dealt with this ASAP if only to provide the illusion they were paying attention to player feedback - which feeds the illusion their customer service is getting better.<br />
<br />
In customer service it is attention to the little things and resolving them expeditously for the customer that keeps happy customers. When the big fit hits the shan and it takes time to correct, the customer is willing to wait patiently because you have established a history of good customer service. Once again, on this issue, SOE failed on a simple known issue. How many simple and major known issues have they let stand (ignored) while releasing this expansion?<br />
<br />
Of course there is a third possibility. The 67 pet is &quot;working as intended.&quot; No damage upgrade. No hitpoint increase. It is just the same pet cast with a higher level spell. If that is true ... what does that tell you?<br />
<br />
Then again here is another possibilitiy I wouldn't put past this &quot;team.&quot; Back in my Navy days there was an executive officer who had a 'bug' about a particular crewmate. It didn't matter what he did, how well he prepared, how 4.0 he was during inspections, the XO would find something to ding him on. Everytime, every inspection. The penalty for getting dinged was report back at some inconvenient time later (usually couple hours after liberty) for a re-inspection with the duty chief.<br />
<br />
This crewmate decided to make something obvious to get hit on. So he would leave a pocket button undone or arrange his ribbons so one of them was not 'nut to butt' aligned with the others. Something that took a single adjustment to correct - on the spot. After that this XO would 'ding' him on the discrepancy, which he fixed at that time. Doing this he didn't have to come back for reinspection ... the XO had found his hit and was happy. Weird but true ...<br />
<br />
So, perhaps the 67 pet is SOE's unbuttoned pocket for shaman. The pet issue will get so much obvious feedback and face such shaman outrage that SOE will let it sit for awhile until they have tons of other shaman 'concerns' in their que. Then, graciously they will &quot;fix the pet&quot; and dance in the halls of SOE knowing the rest of the items can go untouched. Afterall the pocket is now buttoned and they can take credit for it.<br />
<br />
It is called bait and switch. So, as this controversy builds, in every feedback make sure you scream as loud as you can that the shaman pet is not as powerful as the mage and beastlord pets. Demand they be made stronger. Not 75% as strong. Not equal to enchanter illusion pets or necromancer pets. Cry for 110% the power of enchanter charmed pets. We won't get it. But, as we reasonably argued for a decent heal upgrade to contribute almost as well as druids was 'balanced' somewhere in midground between what we had and what druids can do ... well, you can see the moderate reasonable approach is just damn silly on our part.<br />
<br />
Demand more. Scream for better. Get outlandish. Then the compromise may actually give us a new pet worth something.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, because we know how much different Beta and Release have been in the past.<br />
<br />
 :confused:  :confused:  :confused: <br />
<br />
Grafsha I'll go ya one better.<br />
<br />
When I was an enlisted guy (before commissioning) we used to have barracks inspections and quite frequently.<br />
<br />
Another two man team decided to play a prank on the inspectors. (Platoon Sergeant, Platoon Leader, and I think CO and 1SG).  So after cleaning their room from top to bottom to include the latrine, they took a Baby Ruth candy bar and spread it on top of the toilet seat, then put the top down.<br />
<br />
The inspection was going fine until the 1SG flipped the toilet lid with all looking on.<br />
<br />
COMPLETE and SHOCKED silence.<br />
<br />
Well the senior of the two pair pulling the prank proceeds to blow a fake fuse and orders the junior to &quot;Get down there and clean that up with your face,&quot; (or words to that effect).<br />
<br />
As shocked as they were to see a huge brown stain on the toilet seat, it was miniscule compared to their reaction when the junior soldier started licking it up.<br />
<br />
Ahh, the good old days.</div></div><hr />
