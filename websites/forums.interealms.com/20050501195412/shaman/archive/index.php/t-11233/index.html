<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok this is third hand, so I am SURE some got lost in the translation:<br />
<br />
1) You can have only two characters per server. Empire or Rebellion. (Sorta like DAoC and their Realm choice)<br />
<br />
2) One of the characters is &quot;locked&quot; however and you must find out how to unlock him.<br />
<br />
3) This &quot; unlocked character is the &quot;force capable&quot; character.<br />
<br />
4) Force characters are exponentially more powerful than non-force characters.<br />
<br />
5) If you DIE as a (for example) level 35 Force character you go back to a level ONE Force character.<br />
<br />
5a) The 'creators' don't forsee Jedi Masters (Force capable types) until about 14 months down the road (ie lots of work / time involved)<br />
<br />
6. You are PvP (PK) eligible in either the &quot;force capable&quot; or &quot;non force capable&quot; character.<br />
<br />
I'll look for people to confirm or deny this framework before commenting.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Strom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">6.01 Will I be able to play a Jedi?<br />
<br />
Yes. Although the details are still being worked out, we are staying true to the spirit of the films. Therefore, the journey to become a Jedi will be difficult, but those players who choose this path with find it very rewarding.<br />
<br />
6.02 Will there be a numerical limit on the number of Jedi allowed on each server?<br />
<br />
No. We're not using artificial means such as quotas or caps to limit the Jedi population. We're designing an organic system that will allow the Jedi population to fluctuate over time.<br />
<br />
6.03 Will only the extremely lucky or hardcore players get to play Jedi?<br />
<br />
Jedi status is not determined based on &quot;luck.&quot; However, Jedi is considered an advanced objective to achieve within the game. Casual and hardcore players alike can reach this objective, because the path is different for different players. However, it might take a casual player considerably longer to unlock a Force Sensitive character slot. <br />
<br />
6.04 Is it possible for other species to become Jedi?<br />
<br />
Yes. Any player, regardless of character species, has the potential to become a Jedi. <br />
<br />
6.05 Can I become Dark Jedi?<br />
<br />
Eventually. Considering that you must become a Jedi first, we don't expect many people to have the opportunity to fall to the dark side when we release. We'll add the capability for player Dark Jedi in an early update. We're creating the Jedi system to take into account Dark Jedi. However, be warned that the life of a Dark Jedi will be very perilous... <br />
<br />
6.06 Can I become a Sith Lord in the game?<br />
<br />
No, although players may be able to become Dark Jedi, they will not be able to become Sith Lords. The films explicitly state that there are only two Sith Lords at any given time, and the two during the time of Star Wars Galaxies have been clearly identified as the Emperor and Darth Vader. <br />
<br />
6.07 Can I have a title like &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; or &quot;Jedi Master&quot;?<br />
<br />
We're planning to include Jedi titles, like &quot;Jedi Knight&quot; and &quot;Jedi Master&quot; in the game. Dark Jedi would likely have the same titles as the regular Jedi (Dark Jedi Knight, Dark Jedi Master)<br />
<br />
6.08 Will you have the &quot;Jedi Trials&quot; in the game?<br />
<br />
We have decided that in order to be more faithful to the time period of the game not to put in official &quot;Jedi Trials&quot;. Player Jedi Masters may come up with their own requirements for whether they choose to apprentice, however we feel the true &quot;trial&quot; will just be surviving.<br />
<br />
6.09 How will Force powers be implemented?<br />
<br />
Force powers will function much like skills in Star Wars Galaxies - we're actually using the same basic set of rules for both systems. Like skills, Force powers will be divided into several disciplines, allowing players to select specific powers and areas of focus. <br />
<br />
6.10 If I am a Jedi with a lightsaber, will I be able to block blaster shots and perform other cool lightsaber tricks?<br />
<br />
Lightsabers will have all the same capabilities as those seen in the film, but a lightsaber doesn't automatically confer special abilities to the wielder - a Jedi will still need the proper skills and training to master things like &quot;blaster reflection.&quot; <br />
<br />
6.11 Can I build my own lightsaber?<br />
<br />
Yes, but we're following a few simple rules that have been established by the continuity of Star Wars such as: Only Jedi can manufacture lightsabers. Building a lightsaber is difficult. Only Jedi can use lightsabers effectively. A Jedi is more skilled with his or her personal lightsaber than with a &quot;borrowed&quot; lightsaber. <br />
<br />
6.12 How long will it take a Jedi to construct his lightsaber?<br />
<br />
This will probably come down to balancing, with our starting duration based on the continuity. We don't want lightsabers to be really easy/quick to produce, but we also don't want it to take an inordinate amount of time. According to continuity, it took Luke quite some time to build his lightsaber on Tatooine and he &quot;failed&quot; many attempts. But, he was also working in a relative vacuum, without a Master and only Obi-Wan's journal to guide him. <br />
<br />
6.13 Can I make a double-bladed lightsaber?<br />
<br />
Learning how to build a double-sided lightsaber will likely be more difficult than learning how to build a normal lightsaber. You will also probably need more components (additional crystals, for example). And, we may make it more difficult to learn how to wield the weapon effectively, since so few Jedi have spent the time necessary to master the double-bladed lightsaber, and it is so rare during the original trilogy's time period. <br />
<br />
6.14 Can lightsabers get old and &quot;break&quot;?<br />
<br />
We will have item decay in the game, and this will affect lightsabers as well. However, a Jedi has the knowledge necessary to maintain a lightsaber, preventing such decay.<br />
<br />
6.15 Can I choose what color my lightsaber will be?<br />
<br />
We will offer multiple lightsaber colors.<br />
<br />
6.16 Will players be able to choose to become a Dark Jedi from the start, or must they become Jedi then fall? <br />
<br />
According to the continuity, most dark Jedi start off as Jedi and then &quot;fall.&quot; In our game system, you have to become a Jedi first.<br />
<br />
6.17 How do Jedi work?<br />
<br />
Your main character does not become a Jedi. Rather, the actions of your main character can unlock an additional character slot which is Force-sensitive. Characters created in this additional slot can then advance through the Jedi skills as well as any of the other skills in the game. Each player account allows for only one potential Jedi slot and the mysterious method to unlock it won't be the same for every player.<br />
<br />
6.18 How are you going to keep Jedi rare?<br />
<br />
Jedi characters suffer permadeath unless they reach Jedi Master status. You do not lose the Jedi character slot, but the character in that slot is deleted. Upon reaching Jedi Master status, Jedi become &quot;blue glowies&quot; rather than permadying when they die. In order to compensate for deaths that are completely out of control of the player (such as ones caused by network latency) each Jedi will be able to die a couple times before death is permanent. The life of a Jedi is extraordinarily difficult, and successfully making it all the way to Jedi Master should be considered the most difficult challenge in the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>carrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in beta, here goes<br />
<br />
1.  so far true<br />
2 and 3 yes you MIGHT be able to unlock the Jedi capable character slot <br />
4. DUH of course<br />
5. death this is tricky, no levels in swg.  Before you reach a certain title you will perma die.  THen you'll have to start over with a new character.<br />
5a.  There's no formula for becoming a jedi so even the 1st one that does it, it's not like he can post a spoiler cause it wont help anyone<br />
6.  THey did an outstanding job with pvp in SWG, here's how it works pretty much<br />
<br />
you start the game unable to shoot any players or npc's that are aligned to a certain faction. From here you have 3 possibilities if you sign up toward a certain faction, either imperial faction or rebel faction<br />
<br />
1. You can be a bounty hunter/mercenary type of character. This means you can shoot rebels/imperials but npcs only, you CAN&quot;T shoot other players<br />
<br />
2. Covery Rebel/Imperial. THis is a bit tricky so i'll try to explain the best i can. You are a full time member of either the rebel or the imperial faction which allows you to shoot either stormtrooper or rebel soldiers, but you're not tagged as a player killer. What happens is let's say your a rebel and you encounter a stormtrooper somewhere. Well, you can attack him but as soon as you do you become Pvp and are volunrable to any pvp attack from the opposing faction for a certain amount of time. So if you walk up to a stormtrooper and kill him while no one is around, all good  , but if there's other players there on the imperial faction they can join in to kill you.<br />
<br />
3. Full out declared member of a faction. With this option if you join as a declared member of the imperial faction, you can be attacked, and you can attack any other declared rebel in the game, anywhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have to say that sounds quite cool. Having masses of leet Jedi twinks roaming the galaxy would ruin the game. And the PvP options sounds quite interesting too.<br />
<br />
Of course, have to see how it works out in reality :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Though I may be wrong, the promises of SWG sound a lot like the promises of UO.  Same lead designer too.  I remember the first I read of UO, with dragons taking over any random cave, til some adventurers came along to kill it.  That sort of spawning system went out in the first month.  So, I'm wondering which of SWG's features will be scrapped/changed after release.  My guess is the PVP features.  Someone will be sure to find a way to exploit to greif PK people, and a less creative system will be put into place.<br />
<br />
This being said, I will still give the game a chance.  Playing a MMORPG with houses again might be fun.  I wonder if the real estate problem will be anywhere as bad as UO's?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The UO designer working for SWG had a great vision in UO - but the moderately cheezy graphics and terrible lag makes the game nearly unplayable.<br />
<br />
One of the big debates is multi-character server versus single character server (MCS/SCS - although 2CS is pretty much SCS).  The current trend is toward a SCS.  If they don't develop a decent method for cross server communication/character search (i.e. /who all across servers) to go with SCS, then I'm out.  I will want to try different classes of character, like many of my guildmates, and if SOE doesn't provide the means for us to get together easily, our choice is made for us.<br />

<br />
I guess the 64K question is - can you get to that &quot; certain title &quot; without being PvP &quot; turned on.'<br />
<br />
Otherwise, I can see bands of no-time-on-their-hands-types, roaming around ganking those who are close.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>carrais</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">my guess is that you can.  Basically the whole idea of SWG (as with EQ2) is that they want the game to be easy to play and fun.  As many of you know EQ stopped being fun for a lot of people especially at higher levels.  I myself am reminded of this when i spend 2 hours LFG in PoN cause my poor monk cant solo or even get groups anywhere.  So they tring to make those games more fun to the casual gamer.<br />
<br />
Just my thought.   All in all i've been in beta since september, and I'm hooked.  The only thing keeping still keeping me on EQ is that the SWG servers aren't up 24/7.  Up untill a few weeks ago they were up 3 times a week for a few hours.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Temuchin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Though I may be wrong, the promises of SWG sound a lot like the promises of UO. Same lead designer too<br />
<br />
<br />
koster wasn't the lead designer of UO.  that was still richard garriot and starr (that's why star got to play Lord B ingame)<br />
<br />
but he was an important figure in that first mmpog and now one fo the leading figures in mmpog across the board<br />
<br />
of course garriot and co are now working for the koreans developing multiple titles for NC soft</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Honestly , this sounds like its not going to be alot of fun , that tis going to be even more of a timesink that EQ is , i cant do that :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Having masses of leet Jedi twinks roaming the galaxy would ruin the game<br />
Yes and no.  How many people want to play SWG to be a farmer or chef?  I'm pretty sure that most people buying the game are set on becoming a Jedi.  It sounds suicidal (from a business perspective) to make it this limited.  14 months before even 1 hardcore 22x7x360 powergamer can make Jedi?  How the heck is your average Joe (the one with the most bucks to waste on the game) with a job and a family and a hankering to swing a lightsaber going to become a Jedi?  Can the game provide enough non-Jedi fun to make it worth continuing to pay for it month after month once it's realized you won't be a Jedi in your lifetime?<br />
<br />
No thanks.  I really have no interest in farming moisture in a desert for RL months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It could just all be &quot;dev chatter&quot; but reading Koster's posts about Jedi it really sounded like Jedi would be on the hit list of everyone in the empire.<br />
<br />
Basically it sounded like if you used your powers in public there was a chance you'd be recognized and horrible jedi-hunting npc's would be dispatched to kill you.  Plus they made it clear that Jedi were MUCH more powerful than other player characters.  So if a Jedi gets into a frakkus with lots of Imperial players, the Jedi will mow the Imps down but stand a good chance of triggering one of these Darth Vader dispatch Jedi hunter NPCs.<br />
<br />
On the surface it sounds like a cool idea.  But game experience tells me it'll play out more like this (yes this is pure conjecture but I think you'll agree I have precedence for this kind of example):<br />
<br />
Basically every use of this nifty cool force power &quot;in public&quot; rolls on the jedi hunter mob encounter table.<br />
<br />
I'm out hunting Jawas or whatever the freak you do to gain xp in Star Wars, I get a little low on health so I use a force power to get out of trouble.  This rolls the dice to trigger an imperial bounty hunter or some such encounter.  So while recovering from the hunt some named bounty hunter NPC shows up and we have a throw down.  And since I was low on health (which is what caused me to use my secret power) I die the glorious permadeath.  And so would all my friends (although not permanently) because they'd try to help but since the bounty hunter is &quot;jedi level&quot; he'd just mow through them too.<br />
<br />
I then promptly get on the more prevelant Jedi class fansites that run message boards and bitch and moan about how horrible the system is and quit the game (because you can't even just think about quitting the game without bitching and moaning after all).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, I get my force power character and make him a hair stylist and never use my powers so I can survive to Jedi Master.  Nothing says &quot;l33t&quot; like a GM Jedi/Hairstylist.<br />
<br />
All of that said, the whole &quot;blue glowy&quot; thing is a pretty stupid trophy for having attained master level and then died.  All it can do is chat and be seen. Wooo I made it to Master by living a sedate Hairstylist life and then got wacked because I used the force to summon up some latte and so I get this stupid chatty ghost as a trophy.<br />
<br />
Sorry can you tell the movies have made me bitter?</div></div><hr />

I want to start a character that honors and mimics my favorite character in the entire Star Wars series:<br />
<br />
Uncle Owen<br />
<br />
Live in the armpit of the universe, toil out a hardscrabble existence with no chance of reward or advancement, raise a whiny brat left to me by my &quot;full of himself&quot; brother.<br />
<br />
Who wouldn't pay $50 a month for the priviledge and excitement? ;)<br />
<br />
Cook?  Architect? Weapons maker?  BAH!  I'm all for the evaporation business myself!  Makes watching paint dry seem like an E-Ticket ride at Disneyworld (well, back when they had E-ticket rides, anyway).<br />
