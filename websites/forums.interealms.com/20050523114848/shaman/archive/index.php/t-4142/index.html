<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">After trying everything I can think of, I'm bored again with the group game.  I've nothing left to do, nothing left to try.  There's AAXP but seriously. . . why?  I can do everything I need to be able to do right now, so why bother with more?  What I want are challenges.  Things that are feasible but difficult.  Things which push the envelope of a small group's abilities.  Can you give me some ideas here?  Zones, camps, etc.  Something you've done or heard of being done that was hard but you pulled it off anyway.  <br />
I guess I'm talking to the other oracles out there, since I need something that would be a challenge for an oracle with group, will travel.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've always wanted to do a single group hate group and clear the first floor at least. I imagine that would keep you on your toes for a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">did that, without cleric, pally, or necro.  Group makeup was monk, warrior, sk, wizard, warrior.  Yes I was the only class that could cast a heal spell.  No class could rez.  We tried breaking in but got wiped to a really bad bit of luck and 3 spites in addition to other mobs.  Monk and SK lived and dragged our corpses to safe spot, monk rezzed with staff of forbidden rites.  We cleared out the ground floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yup.  Single group hate runs are fun.<br />
<br />
Single group PoG runs were also fun, but for some reason the protectors of growth haven't been spawning.  Not sure if that was meant to be a permanent change.<br />
<br />
Take a monk and duo the protectors of zek.<br />
<br />
Take a tank class and see how high you can get in SS.  I went up to the library with a SK before we got tired.<br />
<br />
Try 1 group HoT or WToV runs.  Decent armor farming for your guild, and it's fun to boot.<br />
<br />
Explore all the back areas of SG.  Lots of adds on the break in, and most people haven't explored the whole zone.<br />
<br />
Have you explored Jaggedpine?  Maybe cleared deep into the potameid caves? (take a tank).<br />
<br />
Just some thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mearis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I for one am very much a fan of single group challenges, since I find the high end raiding game pretty much an organized zerg rush :)<br />
<br />
Fun and very difficult things for an all level 60 group (I am assuming there is a level 60 shaman in it:P):<br />
<br />
Va'dynn (one cleric / one mod rod mage most likely)<br />
Lord Dojo (probably need two clerics)<br />
King in Chardok (one hell of a good enchanter :P)<br />
Queen in Chardok (one hell of a good enchanter, a cleric with group CH, and manaburn is cheating :P)<br />
One group HoT<br />
One group Vaniki in DN (get an SK puller, Ghouldan on RZ has managed to get Vaniki solo to the WW zone, but watch gating)<br />
One group 4c/pyramid in CT<br />
One group naggy with an all twink 52 group (hehe that's my pet project)<br />
One group Talen/Gore (Never heard of this happening, but wizards who try to defend MB always argue that it was possible)<br />
One group Rhag 1 (never heard of this being done...  I suppose it could be borderline doable, but you'd have to cheat with outside buffs)<br />
<br />
Dragons in WW are trivial with an all 60 group...<br />
<br />
Just keep us informed :)  Personally I find crawling through DN with one group a lot more fun that making mod rods for clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">As long as EQ isnt designed to offer single group challenges that cant be trivialized by bringing 2, 3, 4 or more groups its not gonna keep you excited for long trying to do it anyway. And as long as you cant be guaranteed to have a zone/area to yourself (yeah right!) there is a very real risk that a jerk or two can spoil a well planned single group event.<br />
<br />
I had great hopes for PoP offering something like that but now I hear that PoP is going to be a linear expansion - oh thats just great. Lets crowd more people together trying to do the same things.<br />
<br />
But good luck trying to find something to do and lets hear about it if you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Admittadly ive never been to the hole, or fought him, so this may seem like a dumb question, but anyway....<br />
<br />
I was told he DT's every 30 seconds or so, which means the whole group is dead in 3 minutes unless you battle rez, which is pretty inefficient...<br />
<br />
Would you have one guy as DT dummy, and have the click-stick cleric rez him just intime for the DT cycle, so that he's rez'd, instantly dies,  rez'd, dead, rez'd dead etc?  Or would you do the anti-flurry tactic and summon low level pets to eat the DT?  that would seem like it could work...</div></div><hr />

its been said by VI that there will be multiple rooms, exactly the same, for some encounters, so that multiple people can do the same camp at the same time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rat Tunnels in DN and any crawl deep into SG are the first two that come to mind. <br />
<br />
Second floor SSra, mud bowl in CT, break Fear...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">suggestions I liked:<br />
1) 1 group PoA, if you can get past the imps on island two that could be pretty fun.  I'd say you could do imp island, gorgon island (not sure bout the bosses as they DT), and pegasus island for sure, possibly Spiroc island as well if you're really on the ball.  The upshot of that sort of raid is that a wipe only entails a few coffins rather than an assload of them.  <br />
<br />
2) Mud bowl in CT . . . not sure where this is but it sounds like a place that I've heard the new stuff that makes resist gear drops.  Whatever it was called . . . anyone have an idea where Thurdar is talking about?  <br />
<br />
3) SS crawl with a monk/sk.  Could be fun, could be boring . . . could be good faction for kael quests.  <br />
<br />
4) One group VP dragons.  I really really want to do this but generally it's hard to set up since my guild has very very few keys and I suspect the group would have to be extremely well balanced.  Enchanter (dam gotta have tash), warrior, cleric, shaman (optional likely, but that's the point eh), monk, rogue.  Maybe sub in wizard for rogue.   Anyone have tips on doing this kinda one group thingy at VP zone in or the like?  And no I dont need tips on how to get out after we're done.  I'm more concerned with how to pull it off on the inside and what we'd be up against.  It sucks, i've had my VP key for almost a year now and still never had a chance to go since my guild has maybe 10 keys total and little to no interest in questing keys/going.   <br />
<br />
5)Ssra temple crawls.  That place is hella dangerous, need a talented team with some knowledge of where yer going.  I really wanna do more of it but I haven't done more than two camps in there so far.  any links to a good map for this zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">have you ever been to Griegs?  It's a fairly crappy zone if you are looking for loot or exp, but it's pretty fun to explore with some friends.   I went in with a monk partner and we explored a while until we died (lots of unslowable mobs in there, and lots of undercons).   We got a cleric and kept going.  Was fun and challenging with 3, we did it for several days, wandering about looking for nameds and taking funny screenshots of us turned into various creatures.<br />
<br />
Such as:<br />
Henora the dead woodelf (http://pandemonium.uoregon.edu/eq/current-screenshots/henora-corpse-welf.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the mud bowl in CT is the end of the planks/sewers area?  I just recall everytime I go there I die badly...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Landragoran,<br />
<br />
  The mud bowl that I was referring to is on the way to the temple pyramid. Not the one past the maze, but out through the back door of the courtyard. <br />
<br />
Ssra I'm not that familiar with, I've hunted some on the 2nd floor and basement but always with a puller that knew the place so I always had a good guide on the way in. 2nd floor really wasn't all that tough except for the elites that hit for over 400 (I think it was) and aren't slowable. It's where group acumen and PE drops, by the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I feel your pain Landragon.. there is only so much you can take a group to do without feeling like you have done it all that you can do with 1 group heh. Im in sorta similar situation. Grinding AA bores me to tears.. soloing yeldema was a rush the first 2 or 3 times.. after that I was sad to notice my faction drop to warmly from ally(lol). My guild(1 group of folks total) wants to get together and go xping in CT or wherever.. its allright.. but not what I would call challenging or anything. Even 4c isnt so tough with a good DPS. Sometimes we get together with a friendly guild or 2 and do some minor raids like HoT etc.. fun and nice to hang out with some new people.. but.. I dunno.. Im an oracle with Malo and Torpor.. at the height of my class.. and nothing all that challenging to do with it heh.<br />
<br />
Real raiding is right out. I pretty much hate the raid guilds on my server(even while liking a few individuals within.. like Coltrane a very cool guy and crucible poster).<br />
<br />
*shrug*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Try HoT with one group :D you can at least outfit some twinks with armor or sell it heh...<br />
<br />
A guild I used to be in did HoT with 11 people and no reliable slow (I was the only shaman and I was only 53 at the time. I think I slowed a single mob - some drake - the entire night :P<br />
<br />
I would try VP zonein to farm spells, it's baddass exp with 2 minute pops... just watch out in case you get one that turns into 2 when it dies :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Griz, how many people of which classes would be best for VP?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">1 group HoT is fun if you need the armor, but gets boring quick =)  When I first dinged 60 and got malo/torpor, we setup there and farmed armor until all 6 of us were wearing a full suit.  Wiped out a bit at the beginning due to bad pulls, not knowing everything etc, but after you learn how to pull it, can do in your sleep (actually most nights we had 3 people 2 boxing).<br />
<br />
1 group fear would be fun, but after the breakin it'd be cake I'd imagine.  Same for poh/pog.  PoA would be fun to do.  Chardok king/queen would be a blast 1 group.  We've got a mage nonkos, as soon as 2 of us finish off those damn ring/cord quests going to coh as far in as we can and see what we can do from there.<br />
<br />
Anywhere in CT is fun, it's a tough zone, but overall not that bad.  WW dragons are fun too, we almost took out esorpa with 8 people, damn gate, and killed off a number of other valley dragons around there too.  Not really challenging though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The terrible truth about the game is that no matter how much it has, the content comes to an end at some point.  But if you haven't played all the classes, go with something completely different and follow the class/race to 00bear-hood.  Maybe try a Scaleybutt SK or Nome Mage.....  something that would be fresh for ya.  How about a Kitty BL?  There's plenty of content and fun out there that us oldies have ignored because we were levels past it when it came out.<br />
<br />
Remember how fun it was in Paw when you finally got the nerve up and proper levels to group past the doors?  That kind of fun is still out there in JPF and on the moon, but it's only fun for the proper levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Israi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Try Greig himself,,   shaman cleric  mage  warrior  rogue ench.. DC one of acerbus's and kick it in that one room so you odnt get adds.. Its been done b4 =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Now here is a thread that is near and dear to my heart. I don't raid - or at least I avoid raiding as much as possible. I can't take the downtime, and having too many people around just makes it so much harder to coordinate actions. I have a group of great friends, and we have an absolute blast pushing the limits of 1 group eq.<br />
<br />
So, really, I am playing a different eq than many of the rest of you. For us, the game is to tackle the toughest encounters that 1 (or occasionally 2) groups can beat.<br />
<br />
Our normal mix is:<br />
<br />
Warrior, Warrior, Bard, Cleric, Wizard, Shaman (me).<br />
<br />
Now bear in mind - we are not a group of Primal/NToV, etc. equipped people. Like I said - we don't raid. Our gear pretty much consists of the best stuff you can get without much raiding.<br />
<br />
FYI - my profile (Magelo does not work for me from work)<br />
<br />
http://everquest.allakhazam.com/db/userinfo.html?char=138643<br />
<br />
Some fun things we liike to do:<br />
<br />
Our favorite single zone in the game has to be Cazic Thule. We regularly do camps like 4c, upper throne room, etc. After every server reset we hurry to Cazic and take down every single named spawn that we find standing.<br />
<br />
I got my set of HoT armor with these guys, doing 1 group HoT. You should see the way our twinks are equiped in Skyshrine pieces too :)<br />
<br />
We regularly fought down to Trak's lair and took out Protector and Tolampuj back when rare Kunark spells were our priority.<br />
<br />
We have crawled all over Dragon Necropolis. We made it to Zlandicar's Lair, and we even took on Vaniki in the city (but he beat us - this time). How many other people have ever done that without an enchanter before?<br />
<br />
We have cleared floor 1 of Hate, including Maestro and the minibosses - may head up to floor 2 next. I want to try Inny!<br />
<br />
We have successfully broken into Fear and taken down epic mobs (wiz and enchanter for friends) with 1 group several times.<br />
<br />
We have assaulted Tormax's throne room area in Kael, taking down Sentinels and all the nameds up to his two bodyguards (no luck on slowing them so far).<br />
<br />
Before we were all 60, we camped every square inch of zones like Siren's Grotto and the new Chardok - great for exp and rare loot items. Too easy for us now though.<br />
<br />
We are interested in tackling some bigger mobs with 1 group, but the trouble is finding them up before others do. We would love to try Va'Dyn, Kelorek Dar, Lodizal, or Summoned Burrower if we get the chance. We did recently take down Servitor of Luclin in a fun fight.<br />
<br />
This weekend, we are headed into Ssra to try and camp for Ring of the Shissar pieces (and Primal Essence/Group Acumen for me).<br />
<br />
I would love to discuss strategies and share fun ideas with people for trying things like this. Your ideas and suggestions are welcome!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Nice ideas Ximix.  I must say some of the targets u name are impressive for the classes you name, specially lack of enchanter and bard being limited to under lvl 56 things to really be any help with CC.  Your group must really rock.<br />
<br />
The Emporer key quest (for ring) in Ssra really appeals to me right now.  That ring is totally kick ass in so many ways.  <br />
<br />
What is Servitor of Luclin?  I'm not up on many of these Luclin mobs.  Also how hard is Va'Dyn?  He slowable?  <br />
<br />
I wouldn't put Lodizal in your list of uber targets.  He's a puss, I took him down with a decidedly non-uber (56) warrior partner (as a duo) about a month ago.  We experienced no real problems in doing that.  <br />
<br />
I'm not interested in one group HoT . . been there done that, got the T-shirt, off dragon faction anyway.  <br />
<br />
One group Fear?  Ahem, I do that practically every time we go there as a guild.  I make a secret group out of the early arrivals, tell them the plan and go &quot;ninja-break&quot; Fear before the rest of the guild arrives.  I love telling ppl to zone in cause it's broken already when they ask what the break groups are.  I also enjoy taking non-traditional classes in the break group . . . for variety.  <br />
<br />
Good suggestions tho . . . also what's this summoned burrower thingy?  That the timed &quot;maturing&quot; mob in Acrylia?  If that zone wasn't such a pain to get to, it would be a lot more popular.  <br />
<br />
I am not sure Vaniki is possible with only one group, chanter or no.  His lifetap proc is wicked fast and will keep him healed unless you are doing pretty major damage to him.  He's like a mini VS in that respect.  Well it might be possible . . but you'd need two UBER rogues, an uber warrior, a cleric, an uber monk, and either a shaman or a chanter.  Possibly a manaburn wizard would do the trick instead of a rogue.  <br />
<br />
I guess there are some places in CT which would be good to camp.  Anyone who knows that place well wanna share?  <br />
<br />
Also Ssra, lots more to be done there.  Maybe I'm not quite out of content yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What is Servitor of Luclin? <br />
<br />
Tall robed looking guy in GE, drops a really spiffy caster mask that is awesome for enchanters (40 cha).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Thanks Landragoran.<br />
<br />
I must say some of the targets u name are impressive for the classes you name, specially lack of enchanter and bard being limited to under lvl 56 things to really be any help with CC. <br />
<br />
We use some different strategies than most groups. With two warlords, we always offtank the second mob, and our bard only mezzes when we have 3+ in camp. It sounds crazy, but we feel under-stimulated unless we are tanking 2 mobs at once !<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't put Lodizal in your list of uber targets. <br />
<br />
True - but we would like to take him down for loot, regardles.<br />
<br />
What is Servitor of Luclin? I'm not up on many of these Luclin mobs. Also how hard is Va'Dyn? He slowable?  <br />
<br />
Servitor and Va'Dyn are &quot;Minibosses&quot; of Luclin dungeons Griegs, and Akheva respectively. Both are easy to slow, but still a tough 1 group challenge.<br />
<br />
I guess there are some places in CT which would be good to camp. Anyone who knows that place well wanna share?  <br />
<br />
What do you want to know? :) I have camped most of the new Cazic. Our group were basically the first people on Quellious in the zone - we had plundered the place relentlessly for months before it started getting popular.<br />
<br />
We have tried the &quot;protect the gnome&quot; quest several times with 1 group - but unfortunately it really seems to be a 2 group thing. Even then - it is not easy by any means.<br />
<br />
Easy Camps:<br />
<br />
Planks<br />
Lower Throne Room<br />
Maze<br />
Slime Pools<br />
Fish<br />
<br />
Tough Camps:<br />
<br />
4c<br />
Upper Throne Room<br />
Mudbowl / AoF pyramid (top area)<br />
<br />
Stuff we have not yet successfully tackled (probably &gt; 1 group):<br />
<br />
Protect the Gnome<br />
Ring of Slime<br />
Ring of AoF</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I hate to say this, but lose the bard . . . or add a 60ish chanter and you CAN do the gnome quest with one group.  Bard just doesn't work for that one tho.  Just not enuf help on a rather tuff expedition.  You really need two warriors, a damage dealer, a cleric, a shaman, and a chanter to pull it off with one group.  Looks like you've got it all but the chanter.  Maybe give it a go when your bard friend is offline so he doesn't get hurt feelings.  I really think they should give bards the ability to CC mobs over 56.  That's really crippling in places like CT.  I tried it once with exactly the group you mentioned and we wiped to a 4 spawn of unmezzables (for bard anyway).  That was about 30 minutes into the cycle, round halfway done I believe.  What happened was I couldn't Malo/turgurs the mobs fast enuf.  I lost too much life getting them slowed and got auto-aggro and died.  The group died soon after as only two mobs were slowed . . . bard was very very little help and in my opinion was the reason we wiped.  Even adding another warrior might have done the trick.  <br />
<br />
Lodi lewt. . . ah yes that stuff still sells decently.  I was able to get 30k for the belt and 20k for the shield.  Not worth it if you have to camp it tho.  <br />
<br />
Finally . . this Mud bowl . . . how do you get there?  Is it thru the maze that leads to the silver temple?  I realize this &quot;silver temple&quot; might have another name to you, but surely you can recognize the place from that description?  Frightchaser spawns in the maze on the way there and drops a nice bp for monk or bst.  I sold that one for 10k.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Dude if you're not doing CT yet you're not living. It's the best one-group content around. Start easy -- planks, slime tunnel, LTR (lower throne room).. then move to the hard stuff: mud temple, 4c, 4c archon temple, UTR (upper throne room).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I never said I wasn't doing CT . . . just hadn't done the Mud camp yet.  I've done plenty of CT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">on VP Landrag.....you wouldn't need an enchanter.  Normal mobs are pretty low MR, i've done unnamed in group of 6 without enchanter (with cleric camped as we were deep and playing around after the dragon killing ended).  Only real prob is the heavy hitting wurms (1550 if i remember), if you have a warrior, it's quite possible he'll blow a defensive on one if you can't get it slowed fast enough, i think a group of 6 would need a cleric in general, although i'm sure on the lesser wurms/other mobs, a cleric wouldn't be needed, but you just never know (ok you do know, but avoiding a normal spawn mob that's right there isn't really fun is it)....that's the prob :)  BTW, my group of 6 was not able to keep up with respawn of 2 mobs for more than 2 rounds i think.<br />
<br />
<br />
Always wanted to try MY with 6, but ever since shoulder quest went in, it's hard to find him up, much less up when good 6 are willing to go with me.  I think it's doable (yes MB is cheating), but i also think cleric click stick might be needed to keep up mana/resses during fight.</div></div><hr />

Probably a bit too easy Faern.  I have done the captain with a group of 4 before (Me, Ranger, Warrior, Cleric) and we sure as heck arent uber, he just takes a while to take down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">Here is something that is fun at least the first time or two. Take a single group down and explore the hole. All through the hole. Go up through all the buildings and see the sights. There are some pretty cool vantages  through some of the windows overlooking the city area. Also, a nifty set of rooms with glowing things in them in the basement of one of the city buildings...looks like maybe originally intended as some sort of a gate point. But the rooms wont open so cant get in =/ There are a couple solid exp spots for level 60's in the hole as well. There is a cool building that we refer to as the golem tower cause there are so many golems in there. The first pull is like guaranteed minimum of 7 rock golems, and thats fun to deal with hehe. <br />
<br />
Anyhow, if you do go to the hole, I advise ya bring a enchanter friend that knows his stuff. It is pretty fun to tear through there with a single group (at least the first time or two).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Ictus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Ok, I have been out of the game for awhile, so forgive me if my suggestions are pass'e.   My other disclaimer is that me and my friends never had really great gear and this was before Luclin and we rarely had an enchanter around, just a bard :)<br />
<br />
1. Velk's Lab - dungeon crawl. Try some of the areas that nobody goes to. I remember golems being pretty fun.<br />
<br />
2.  Hole - buggy, but fun.  Try crawling around the city.<br />
<br />
3. Kael - might be too easy for you, but maybe if you just duo there if you be alittle more exciting. War/Shm or monk/shm. See how for you can get :)<br />
<br />
4. Caller quest - I have know first hand knowledge, but of all the Luclin content I heard about this is the one I wanted to try the most<br />
<br />
5. VP - I think it can be done. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Kronenburg - I like easy.<br />
<br />
Speaking of the Hole - does anybody know if you can get into the first tower you come to? The one still up on the &quot;first level&quot; ?<br />
<br />
There are two Golems or Elementals standing in front of a sloping solid staircase.<br />
<br />
Oh - is OIV guy doable with one group? (Phat lewtz and all)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Gloobonious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">Pfft, I've soloed my way to Efreeti. Heck, I CC'ed 4 imps at once!<br />

Fire Giants... well, if I knew I could single pull them, I'm sure I would kill them too! :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">FGs are easy, wait outside first room for wanderer spider, and kill it.  Then run in and slow both giants and just tank em, let pet and epic do dmg on one til its dead, after one down its cake.  Also, to split tranix, pull him with malo and run down to near the first 2 spawn point and root him, then run out of the FG area and rest will run after ya, fall into lava, and reset.  Then Tranix is alone out there and just run out and slow, rest are cake.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Talamay Crystalspirit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">i haven't really done a lot of single group &quot;challenges&quot; since i started playing again, so my suggestions may sound trivial, but here's some things i used to do when we weren't raiding... keep in mind that the following situations are completely without a cleric or enchanter (you know, the REQUIRED classes, right?).<br />
<br />
dragon necropolis paebala<br />
plane of fear<br />
korocust in chardok<br />
jumpy/protector<br />
siren's grotto<br />
<br />
the following are duos i did, usually with a monk, sometimes a warrior.<br />
<br />
fire giants (trivial for 2 60's though, did this at 54 monk/shaman)<br />
WW dragons (amazingly easy with instant click items)<br />
siren's grotto ;)<br />
some parts of DN<br />
sebilis myconids</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Hmmmm.  I might have to try the 1 woman FG raid.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Monk, Warrior, Shaman, Cleric, Cleric, Enchanter.<br />
Try to fight to PoM after another guild has cleared out the named mobs in the way.  That would probably be the biggest single group doable raid I can think of.  Flurry drakes are a bitch.  You might need 1.5 groups to deal with them (just add more clerics, and maybe a bard for oos).  Depending on what named mobs are up, you can probably kill a named dragon or two.  If you brought 2 groups, make one member a mage, and one someone who can evac, so you can coh up people for the item drops you can't use (SK shield, Warrior neck, Bard neck, Shammy shield, Ranger bow are the ones I can think of off hand).<br />
<br />
Attempting the Ring of Slime is a possibility.  It'll be a stupid long fight, but certainly possible I think.<br />
<br />
WW dragon fights are another possiblity to test your limits.<br />
Some mobs are just not doable with 1 group.  Von comes to mind as one of those with her stupid grav flux ae.  Some others are doable though, besides just the level 53/54 &quot;noob&quot; dragons like Yeldema.  See what you can handle.<br />
<br />
Save the gnome would be another excellent challenge for 1 group.<br />
<br />
You might be able to get Emperor keys with just 1 group, but only on the easy named mob just outside the Emperor portal.  2 of them are too much for a single group.  24 people was generally minimum what's used to farm the symbols there with one of the best equiped guilds on Brell, though 18 might be ok too with enough healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Ulver</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">One group gnome quest in CT. Try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">So I soloed Tranix once.  I got him with only one FG warrior add.  I kept him rooted and worked at the warrior but it ran and got away and reset.  Ok I say no biggy, at least it's gone.  I grab Tranix and get to work.  5 minutes later he's at 5% life and running . . . he gets away too and gets into lava . . resets . . . summons me to his lair where some other giants assisted him in beating my ass down.  <br />
<br />
Morale of the story . . . snare is pretty nice.  I guess I should have left the other FG  up and done Tranix first so he wouldn't flee.  Hindsight is 20/20 they say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">Gnome walk is a crapshoot. You never know what your going to get. It's different every time.<br />
It all depends on what decides to spawn on you whether it's easy or challenging.<br />
<br />
In general, I much prefer to bring a bard along instead of an enchanter for any fight. They help the group out more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">In my opinion the shaman class and the bard class were made to go together. They are a perfect complement.<br />
<br />
Shaman / Bard + two tanks, a damage dealer and a cleric is such an ungodly powerful mix. If you shamans out there have not figured it out yet - believe me. Avoid enchanters and find a GREAT bard to work with.<br />
<br />
Shaman + enchanter = too much overlap of capabilities to be optimal. Shaman + enchanter is like an ultra-conserative investment strategy. You minimimze your chance of loss (read wipeout), but you also give up a lot of potential profit (read DPS / kill speed).<br />
<br />
An enchanter grouped with a shaman frequently has very little to do but buff - and stays FM 90% of the time.<br />
<br />
Now - with that said, the &quot;Protect the Gnome&quot; quest may be one of those rare cases where enchanter + shaman is needed to have the best chance to do it with 1 group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Try Wuoshi with 3~  Bard is a must.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Tranix can be single pulled every time, without any lava dancing/cheating.  Just pull with malo in the right spot (i go onto table with levi and move over so i'm back off stairs but levitating high enough to cast on KT - solo pull every time.  Having said this, i can't pull skarlon single without pulling another FG outta his area using proximity aggro - has anyone pulled Skarlon single with 2 FG's still in his lair?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">IIRC my 60 Monk could never get Skarlon solo either. Been awhile, but I think that to get a shot at him with a shuriken I would proxiimity aggro the a55 behind the wall.<br />
<br />
If there was a longer hallway I could have javelined his butt, but the twists and turns put you nearly on top of all three.<br />
<br />
Landragon..cough Ranger + Shaman cough...give them the Uber Mithril stuff.<br />
<br />
:)=</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Glog Galrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Wow you all have done some very impressive things I must say.<br />
<br />
I was fortunate enough to see a friend oracle solo a seb jug almost a year ago after a trak raid.  Now, I'm not 60 (56 ATM), and I don't have any illusions about being able to solo a jugg (at this time.) ;)<br />
<br />
However, I'm wondering what kind of duo or trio I would need to assemble in order to kill a few of these?  Is it even possible at my level with a 60 tank of some sort and a primary healer?  Or is it a full group endeavor?<br />
<br />
I suppose managing to get there is of some concern as well.<br />
<br />
How many HP's do they have, how hard do they hit, and how difficult are they to slow?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, thanks for all the info, there's still a lot I haven't seen, and I'm really looking forward to experiencing all the things you guys have been talking about. <br />
<br />
Take care.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Well, my group of psychotic risk takers up-ed our personal best last night.<br />
<br />
The Va Dyn fell to 6 - War, War, Brd, Clr, Wiz Shm (me).<br />
<br />
Loot was nice - but no Shaman stuff<br />
<br />
Gold Inlaid Ulak (grats to my monk twink)<br />
Toetwister (grats to our uber-bard)<br />
KEI (grats to our bank accounts)<br />
Nature's Recovery (grats to one of our druid twink's banked spells)<br />
Warsong of the Vah Shir  (grats to one of our bard twink's banked spells)<br />
Lost Composition of Ervaj  (grats to one of our bard twink's banked spells)<br />
<br />
Toughest part was keeping the warriors up before debuffs were on him.<br />
<br />
Hellaciously fun fight - each warrior went through defensive 3 times, I believe. I must have Cast Turgurs / Cripple / Malosini a dozen times out of paranoia of one wearing off.<br />
<br />
The best part was watching the 30 member raid that one of our local Quellious &quot;uberguilds&quot; brought to the zone lurk around us - waiting for us to wipe. I can only imagine what they were saying over their guildchat :)</div></div><hr />

can you give me a little run down on the roll each class plays in your groups and the spells each uses?<br />

I'm a 55 bard main who is trying to get a group together to do fun stuff, and I don't have an idea about what classes to get and what roles for each to play.<br />
<br />
What is the glue that makes the bard/shaman synergy work?<br />
(what does each do that works with the other?)<br />
