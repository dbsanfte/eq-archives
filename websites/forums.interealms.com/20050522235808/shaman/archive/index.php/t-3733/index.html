<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">found 2 people in bazaar selling them, one for 1k and other for 500p, im thinking the 500pp one is much lower than on other servers as everything on AB is cheap</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Can't afford it yet though, i can only pay 100pp hehe, jsut wondering on the price though :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">mean spine chill Spear, i think</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>ShakoBoy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I got mine for 300pp. And since the new Bazaar has been up I've seen them as low as 200pp. Depends on your server I guess. Just keep looking and you'll probably find one below 500pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think they should be in the 500pp ballpark. No way I would pay 1k for one now. If you have the plat though, you should get a rune etched icewurm fang. 12/19 dam/delay with a 81 point proc on it. I saw one for sell pre-bazaar for 1kpp on my server. Might be able to find one cheaper in the bazaar</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ya try for REIF if ya can find a cheap one...but Spine chill isnt worth the cash for it, I always hit up the Ry'gorr Chief when passing through EW and I've given out so many of those BPs and Spears its not funny heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sold my Spine Chill Spear a few weeks ago for 500pp, FWIW.</div></div><hr />

What I saw on Xev must have been a joke, guy wanted 10k for a REIF, yes 10000 for one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tunes77</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Definately spend some time in the new bazaar set up.  On Vazaelle there have been some excellant prices on items with 250+ people in the zone selling.  I picked up 2 owlbear claw earrings for 15pp each and a cloak of the icebear for 10pp also.  I've seen the spine chill spear for as low as 250 there.  Just head up, search for shaman usable piercing weapons and see what comes up.  If nothing is what you want, try again later that day or the next day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's an awesome weapon no doubt, but if that guy can find someone &quot;boneheaded&quot; enough to pay that much for it, than more power to him. <br />
If you are the &quot;lucky one&quot; who pays 10K for it, then allow me to Summon KY because you just got bent over !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Average price on my server for the REIF is 6 - 8k.  I've only seen one around 4500ish</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">3 months ago on 7th REIF were going for 10K quite often.i got mine for 5K from a guildy and was happy with the deal. server economies vary wildly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Guess I got really lucky then cause I sent a tell to the guy who was selling it for 1kpp. Someone else already asked for it (it wsa ligit cause I saw it on my server board) so I offered him 1800pp for it. Other guy would not match so I got it for under 2k but if not for me, it would have gone for 1kpp. Good luck on your search</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>JoarAddam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I bought a Spine Chill for 350p in bazaar yesterday.  Saw it as low as 150 (sold before I got there) and high as 500p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mookle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I've only ever seen one REIF auctioned in a long time (and I've been looking hard) and he wants 8K for it on AB.<br />
I'm not sure if its worth that but it's so rarely sold I'm considering it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I paid 5k pp for mine a few weeks ago.  It makes a TREMENDOUS difference soloing.  Not even close to a JBB, of course...but I don't have 20k to spend (not that I ever see one for sale).<br />
<br />
I tank/melee a lot when soloing, and since I don't have epic this replaced my Centi Warhammer.  Wow - Alacrity on myself with a Dex buff and I *almost* feel like a melee class. :)</div></div><hr />
