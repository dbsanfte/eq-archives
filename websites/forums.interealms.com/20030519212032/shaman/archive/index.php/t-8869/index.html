Like many folks I'm back to EQ after a year or so hiatus.<br />
My old buddies are now in their high 50's-60, and an old friend gave me 20K to &quot;catch-up&quot;.<br />
<br />
As a 36 Shammy and avid reader of the boards I bought the following<br />
<br />
Ikky BP 6K<br />
Horse   9K<br />
CC Shield 2K<br />
Acrylia Cloak 900pp<br />
<br />
Rest of gear is cheap jaundiced (haven't done magelo yet)<br />
with a Spine Chill Spear.<br />
<br />
The only problem is I solo almost all the time due to RL constraints.<br />
<br />
After doing more research, I've learned that horses are best for group situations.<br />
<br />
I know I can trade in horse but I'm not sure of the loss.  Folks I doubt Ill ever see 50 ( I play 2-3 hrs a week) and would like to make the most of my &quot;fun money&quot;.<br />
<br />
Should I keep horsie?<br />
<br />
Thanks fer ya help.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ThatDumbGuy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">IMO, the horse becomes much more useful when you are at 45 with a JBB. Until then, I don't think it will make too much of a difference, unless you are pet kiting. If you are tankin in the face, you'll have autoattack on. If yer root rotting, you can darn well sit anyways. Pet kiting kinda sucks IMO, so I suggest holding off on a horse until if/when you get a JBB. Of course, if you group heavily (I didn't at those levels, and I still solo for xp, group for loot at 52), then it might be of more use as an aggro prevention tool. But I would spend the money elsewhere. If ya make a magelo, I'd be happy to advise ya from there if you have money floatin around. Good luck,  whatever you decide.</div></div><hr />

I tend to prefer to tank in teh face.  Pet kiting seems kinda, I don't know  &quot;?cheap?&quot;, to me.  <br />
<br />
I can do it, and its a valid and useful skill, but I aint no *^&amp;%$ druid.<br />
<br />
I really need to get my magelo up so I can get add'l advise.<br />
<br />
Thanks all, love these boards!<br />
