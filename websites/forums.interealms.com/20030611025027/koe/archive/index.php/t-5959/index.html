<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Temp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This was posted on EQBEASTLORD.COM. There is a very long thread on getting this far, i don't think they have a walkthrough yet. Overall, the general impression is stats are inline with other epics, but the effects are dissapointing. It is however among the easier epic quests to finish.<br />
<br />
note: Last I checked the guild website mentioned below did not have the pics. Also it is one of those guilds that feels their point gets across better with maximum profanity inserted, so be warned. <br />
<br />
The epic consists of 2 claws. Both called claw of the savage spirit.<br />
<br />
<br />
Primary<br />
13/22<br />
5 str, 15 wis, 10 agi, 50 hp, 5 fire resist, 5 cold resist, 5 poison resist, 10 magic resist<br />
effect: sha's vengeance (35% slow)<br />
<br />
Secondary<br />
13/22<br />
5 str, 10 dex, 15 sta, 125 hp, 5 fire resist, 5 cold resist, 5 poison resist, 10 disease resist<br />
effect: fury of the vah shir (90dd)<br />
<br />
edit-correct me if i'm wrong on those procs<br />
<br />
They have a really interesting look to them. They don't look like your typical claws and they have a very nice looking bright blue glow to them. <br />
<br />
For screenshots, they will be up either tonight or tomorrow on the following website on the news page.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice looking, but did anyone else notice they broke the 100hp on an item rule?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Temp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yes they got more than 100HP, but traded it for no mana.<br />
<br />
Also more news, the epic procs have been changed on test.<br />
The slow proc has been changed from a 35% slow to a 55% and a 460 dot in 2 minutes.<br />
The 90 dd lure based proc has been changed to a +30 atk 40% item haste effect (same as ranger epic).<br />
<br />
I would think this would make these quite worthwhile, considering the low level of difficulty in completing the quest. I don't think there are any fights that take more than 2 groups, no planar mobs, or dragons. Only difficulty is waiting for some of the quest mobs (scouts) to spawn, won't be very easy to &quot;plan&quot; the fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mekil Jueaze</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hah, just another class to make it friggun hard on the warrior to keep taunt lol.<br />
<br />
And by the +125 hp thing, its one of 2 items that I can find that have over 100 hps, looks nice to see that there may be more items comming out with more than 100 ;).</div></div><hr />
