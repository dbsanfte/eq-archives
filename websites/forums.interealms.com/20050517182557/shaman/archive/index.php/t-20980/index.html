<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Everything i have ever read on this forum and every shaman i have talked to has said its not a big deal. No where near the significant boost that LR5 and CA3 give you. I have stayed away form it atleast untill i get a crapload of other AA out of the way.<br />
<br />
So i would say, from your magelo that you still have things that would offer more bang for your buck, especialy considering how much all that is going ot cost you.<br />
<br />
Like finish out SC or QB  or your nuke crit AA. YOur healing AA isnt maxed nor is your radiant cure, planar power and you dont have pet hold, which can be invaluable. I mean its your choice and your path, but i can say that i hold all those i mentioned above more important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Parses have shown that CS3/ID5 mitigates about the same amount of damage as CA3/LR5 over the long term.  The problem is that against big, bad mobs, shamans don't live for the long term.  Basically, with CA3/LR5, you hope to get a lucky string of misses that keeps you alive long enough for the tank to regain aggro.  CA3/LR5 can also eliminate some proc damage, which against some mobs can be significant as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">It depends what kind of role your Shaman plays too.  Do you do a lot of tanking?  If so, I suggest it.  For example, I do a lot of ldon normal runs boxing characters and I do a lot of tanking, so ID5 has helped noticably for that.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Personally I think some of the stigma that ID5 is suffering is because of the way it works, not because it's not working well enough.<br />
<br />
With LR5 you get missed completely.  This is EXTREMELY noticable.  You look at the swings when you get aggro and laugh to yourself as the mob misses you a ton more than they used to.  It's a great ability, and I still definitely recommend picking it up before ID5.<br />
<br />
ID5, however, is still very worthwhile imho.  I've noticed a huge difference since picking it up.  Here's the problem though, you have to look closely to really see the difference.  This is because where with LR5 you get hit less per round, with ID5 you get hit FOR less per round.  ID5 cuts ~20% off of each swing from a mob, but the mob still hits you.   <br />
<br />
I know for myself, at least, it's sometimes hard to keep up with the red text scrolling by from mobs beating on me.  Trust me though, this skill works, and works well.<br />
<br />
I clearly remember being in High Risk LDoN missions before, and after getting this ability (already had LR5 before ID5).  When drawing aggro without ID5, I would get misses sometimes thanks to LR5, but the majority of the attacks still landed, and when they did, they hit HARD.  A shaman's AC and mitigation aren't high enough to stop the mob from hitting for max very often.  These things were smacking me for 998 at least once out of their double/tripple attack when they hit me.  After picking up ID5, the average hit is NOTICABLY lower.  They hit me for minimum damage a lot more often, and almost never hit for anything above 800 (max of 998).<br />
<br />
Basically, in a long fight, LR5 and ID5 prevent identical amounts of damage.  The reason LR5 is so much better for us is that we aren't usually supposed to be tanking a mob for a long period of time.  What we're concerned about is that 10 seconds that you steal aggro and the tank takes it back.  For that, LR5 is immensely better, because if you get missed twice for a 1330 point swing, that's 2660 damage you've avoided.  While if you reduce 20% off of the, say 4, swings that would have come in, you are only mitigating 1040 damage.  You can see, though, that these numbers would come closer and closer together the longer you held aggro during a fight.<br />
<br />
Oh, and for the comment about our mitigation not being so great, and a 20% gain wouldn't do much:  Remember, it's mitigating 20% of the Mobs' damage, not adding a 20% boost to our mitigation ability.  Just like LR5 means you avoid 20% of mob attacks, you don't gain a 20% boost to our avoidance skill.<br />
<br />
I don't have any parses, and it's hard to explain the effectiveness of the abillity, but I swear by it, personally.  I tank mobs in Sol Ro when the mood strikes, and I watch their average hit wind up at about 300ish(max 680), and I know the ability is working for me.  I get aggro in high risk LDoN and watch them miss and hit for 250 half the time.  It's improved my survivability a lot.<br />
<br />
Now...to finish SCS so I can stop getting aggro in the first place. :cool:<br />

Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recently saved up 27 AA and spent them all at once on this to see if I could tell the difference. Well it's kind of hard to notice without parsing, and the limited parse tests I did showed about 10% less total damage from mob melee hits - don't take this as gospel though.<br />
<br />
It's not the most beneficial AA for shamans, I spent 200 AA on useful abilities before getting this one. Handy for tank-soloing where you're getting beat on constantly over the long run.</div></div><hr />

Do you often tank or at least pull aggro in exp groups? Then stability will help.<br />
<br />
Is it worth it? As was already said, it mitigates a similar amount of damage as avoidance but since you still get hit it does not help with channeling like avoidance does. Still looks like a good skill to me (I got it right after the avoidance AAs).</div></div><hr />

LR and ID prevent the exact same amount of damage every fight, short or long fights does not matter. They differ in other ways.<br />
<br />
- LR prevents anything associated with being hit - that is being interrupted, being moved, procs that only fire on hits and damage shields. Since shaman generally care more about about channeling then about damage shields this is a plus for LR.<br />
<br />
LR is more streaky. That means several things.<br />
- If you are interested in landing reliable heal chains LR is inferior. ID on the other hand smoothes the rate of damage you take, thus making timing heals easier.<br />
- If you are fighting something that hits so hard that ID does not change the average number of melee rounds to kill you (i.e. you get one-rounded or two-rounded) then clearly ID does not help you. LR however might give you a lucky streak of misses and let you live.<br />
<br />
Overall the two skills are pretty close from all I can tell. LR is slightly preferable and a LOT more obvious when it works.</div></div><hr />

Will it save you in GoD?  Hasn't for me yet.  With decent gear (you don't have to be EP to decently geared), you can tank normal LDoN easily with it.<br />

I recommend you getting them as soon as you're comfortable in spending the aa's.  I bought mine when I was in my 50's of aa's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Greetings,<br />
<br />
I'll have to disagree with you here, veeshan.<br />
<br />
LR and ID prevent the exact same amount of damage every fight, short or long fights does not matter. They differ in other ways. ...<br />
<br />
<br />
What I meant when I said that LR5 is far more beneficial for us, in our aggro stealing situation, is this:<br />
<br />
You aren't supposed to have aggro, in the example I gave.  There is a tank that is tanking, and you're doing your shamanly thing.  As often happens, you steal aggro.  Great...now there is a short window (we'll say 5 seconds) where you have aggro, and the mob is swinging at you.<br />
<br />
In this 5 second window, if the mob hits for an average of 500, and swings 3 times a second (slowed), and ID5 pulls 20% off of every hit, you're looking at saving ~1500 damage mitigated.  This is if it works at MAXIMUM efficiency.<br />
<br />
That's a great feat, and I'm not knocking ID5 at all.  In my post, I was actually suggesting the AA.  <br />
<br />
The big difference, however, is that ID5 will, at maximum, reduce 20% of the damage taken.  LR5, over a short period of time, due to the very streaky nature that you mentioned, can decrease damage taken by far more than 20%.  <br />
<br />
If over that same 5 second window, the mob misses you 6 times...you've already doubled the amount of damage mitigated with ID5.  The reason this works is because you are given a 20% chance to avoid every hit...rolled against a RNG.  <br />
<br />
In a long fight, ID5 and LR5 even out, because ID5 works EVERY time you get hit, and given enough time, the 20% chance to be missed of LR5 will indeed end up reflecting 20% of the potential mob DPS.  The fact is, though, that if you get a lucky set of rolls from the RNG, LR5 will allow you to miss FAR more than 20% of the mobs damage in a short period of time, while even with the best possible rolls from the RNG, you won't be avoiding more than 20% of the mob's dps with ID5.<br />
<br />
If you get 6 or 7 lucky rolls (when the mob swings) and he misses you 7 out of those 15 times he would have hit you...LR5 has done a far better job of saving your skin than ID5 possibly could.<br />
<br />
Boiled down...the difference is that LR5 allows for the streaks you were mentioning.  This can mean it falls far below 20% efficiency in short streaks...but it also means it can go far, far above 20% in opposite streaks.  So it can easily save your life.<br />
<br />
An example:  <br />
<br />
You and your friend are splitting a pizza.  You agree that he'll get 20% of the pieces, provided that for each piece you'll roll a 10 sided die, and if the number is =&gt;9(20% of the 8 sided die), you'll get that piece, and move on to the next one, disregarding his 20% of the pie (I.E. your share doesn't count against the 20% he's supposed to get).  <br />
<br />
Now...you get through your fifth piece.  You've rolled two 9s and and three 10s(yes, you'd have to be very lucky, but it IS possible).  So you've taken all 5 of the 5 pieces.  At this point..the dog comes by, and steals the rest of the pie (Tank gets aggro back).  <br />
<br />
So....his 20% didn't amount to much.  You, however, got all 5 of them due to your luck with numbers..<br />
<br />
Now...if, in that example, the pie had been..say...1000 pieces, instead of 5.  Well then your luck couldn't have possibly carried on, and eventually you'd both end up with equal shares.  But those first 5 pieces still would have been all yours.  And since those first 5 pieces were the only ones that existed...you got a lot better deal than he did.<br />
<br />
Ok..so that's awfully extreme, and a little childish...but I was in the mood to write, and this point makes a lot of sense to me, and I wanted to be sure to get across the difference.<br />
<br />
Anyway...<br />
Be Well,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">LR &amp; ID do not decrease damage by the same amount or in the same way.<br />
<br />
ID increases your &quot;chance to mitigate&quot; a hit to be lower than it was going to be. That number still has to be somewhere between the minimum and maximum hit of the mob. What this means is that the effect of Innate Defense and Combat Stability will vary by the mob you're fighting. That is, for mobs with low Damage Intervals and high Damage Bonuses, ID and CS are almost completely worthless. For mobs with high DI and low DB, the skills will be much more effective.<br />
<br />
You cannot mitigate away the damage bonus of a mob, but you can avoid it. That's one of the reasons that the avoidance skills (CA &amp; LR) are better than the mitigation skills (CS &amp; ID).<br />
<br />
The two skills do not have an equal effect even in the long run, as has been parsed on multiple boards. It's still certainly nice to mitigate more often, but I'd consider the skills a very low priority for non-melee classes. For melee classes, getting an increase to mitigation will reduce the number of max damage hits and therefore reduces the chance of being one rounded. If you can still be one or two rounded when the mob is hitting for minimum or near minimum damage, then the mitigation skills are not very helpful at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, the warriors have parsed them as having equal effects in the long run. And if you can get one rounded or two rounded by a mob hitting at min, avoidance isnt going to help you much either  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Er...avoidance helps you AVOID getting hit in the first place, LOL.  Which kinda helps a ton, especially in the example you give--where even when getting hit for minimum kills ya.<br />
<br />
It's mitigation that does absolutely nothing for you in that instance.<br />
<br />
And since shamans aren't tanks, what works for a warrior is completely different.  They DO get hit on constantly, and actually have the hitpoints and disciplines and AC to deal with it long enough that mitigation comes substantially more into play.  By the time mitigation comes much into play for me, I could be dead, whereas a warrior might be just starting to get down to where he's going to need a heal soon.  For a warrior, both skills are great; for a shaman, LR is far, far superior to mitigation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I'll have to disagree with you here, veeshan.<br />
Why did &quot;Murtak&quot; have to be taken when I made this account? :( Now everyone calls me veeshan.<br />
<br />

The big difference, however, is that ID5 will, at maximum, reduce 20% of the damage taken.  LR5, over a short period of time, due to the very streaky nature that you mentioned, can decrease damage taken by far more than 20%.  <br />
And it can also fail completely - the average effect is exactly the same. When two effects have the same average effect but one is more spiky the spiky one is not better in the short run. &quot;Same average effect&quot; means just that - they prevent an equal amount of damage.<br />
<br />
If over that same 5 second window, the mob misses you 6 times...you've already doubled the amount of damage mitigated with ID5.  The reason this works is because you are given a 20% chance to avoid every hit...rolled against a RNG.  <br />
And if it hits you every time you are behind the effect of ID. You cannot assume that the first six swings of a fight always miss. That is not what &quot;streaky&quot; means.<br />
<br />
You and your friend are splitting a pizza.  You agree that he'll get 20% of the pieces, provided that for each piece you'll roll a 10 sided die, and if the number is =&gt;9(20% of the 8 sided die), you'll get that piece, and move on to the next one, disregarding his 20% of the pie (I.E. your share doesn't count against the 20% he's supposed to get).  <br />

<br />
So....his 20% didn't amount to much.  You, however, got all 5 of them due to your luck with numbers..<br />
And you are just as likely to get less then your 20%. You are assuming that you will be lucky. Assuming you always roll 9s and 10s will mess up any simulation or analogy.<br />
<br />
Now...if, in that example, the pie had been..say...1000 pieces, instead of 5.  Well then your luck couldn't have possibly carried on, and eventually you'd both end up with equal shares.<br />
Of course it could. Previous rolls do not affect the next roll.<br />
<br />
Ok..so that's awfully extreme, and a little childish...but I was in the mood to write, and this point makes a lot of sense to me, and I wanted to be sure to get across the difference.<br />
Please do not think I am flaming you. But you truly do not seem to have any grasp on statistics, chances or averages at all. Given that ID and LR prevent an equal percentage of the damage (they do not, see below) the fight duration does not matter at all.<br />
<br />
Actually, the warriors have parsed them as having equal effects in the long run.<br />
Not true. See below or check Romidar's post.<br />
<br />
And if you can get one rounded or two rounded by a mob hitting at min, avoidance isnt going to help you much either  :D<br />
If you do in fact get onerounded even with ID avoidance is the one thing that can help you. I will give you a simple example. You have a MOB that swings a single time every 5 seconds and hits for 20K to 100K. You can not reach te amount of mitigation required to survive a hit. But you can still dodge it or get missed. Hence avoidance does indeed help you.<br />
<br />
LR &amp; ID do not decrease damage by the same amount or in the same way.<br />
<br />
- snip explanation -<br />
<br />
You cannot mitigate away the damage bonus of a mob, but you can avoid it. That's one of the reasons that the avoidance skills (CA &amp; LR) are better than the mitigation skills (CS &amp; ID).<br />
That is correct - I should have said &quot;similar amount&quot; there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Ya Murtak, except that when you get agro you generally take more than one round of melee, and anything could one round you in one or two rounds with min hits will still kill you anyway, avoid or not  :p. Its more usefull against mobs which take longer to kill you, but CS/ID is just as usefull on those mobs, probably even more so because the damage reduction is more even and consequently more manageable from a healing perspective. The main advantage of the avoidance AAs from a casters point of view is the spell interupt thing, beyond that it depends more on the relative size of the DI for the mobs you are fighting. Low DI favors the CA line, whereas high DI probably favors the CS line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zorash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Greetings,<br />
<br />
Murtak:<br />
<br />
I suppose I should have worded things a little differently.  I wasn't trying to say that LR5 is superior to ID5 or that it will always do better at preventing damage in the short term.  What I was saying is that it CAN.<br />
<br />
In a world where mobs are hitting for 1K plus, a lucky string of misses can easily save your life, where you would have surely died otherwise.  Yes, the skill can also completely fail and do nothing for you, but that doesn't negate my point, since I'm not trying to state that it will always come through, just that it can.<br />
<br />
Under the correct circumstances, LR5 has the POTENTIAL to be far more effective than ID5.<br />
<br />
As far as my grasp on statistics, I don't appreciate being slighted based on your opinion.  You've already agreed with my point.  I'd say you aren't grasping the concept I'm discussing, but that's obviously not the case, as you've agreed with me, yet you are determined to continue discussing it.<br />
<br />
I like ID5.  I like LR5.  I recommend getting both.  My recommendation for getting LR first was merely because it CAN be more effective in a pinch, provided you get lucky with the RNG.<br />
<br />
I hope that's clear enough.  I really don't mean to knock the usefulness of ID5, but my point is valid.  Even though they both say 20%, and yes, that makes the maximum long term efficiency for both the same, LR5 can far exceed 20% damage mitigation in short bursts.<br />
<br />
If the mob swings once, and misses you due to a good roll with LR5..you've just achieved 100% avoidance.  This is more than 20%.<br />
<br />
If it swings four times, and misses three, that's 75%.  This is more than 20%.<br />
<br />
ID5, regardless of the situation, cannot exceed 20% efficiency.<br />
<br />
That's all I was saying.  Yes, I know that doesn't happen every time.  But it CAN happen, and it can happen when it really matters.  If that mob was swinging for 1800 damage, and swung 6 times, ID5 couldn't possibly mitigate as much damage as LR5 would, provided you got a lucky streak, and were missed by 4 of the 6 swings.  Like you said, you may get pummeled all 6 of those 6 swings as well.  I understand that.  It doesn't change my point.<br />
<br />
This doesn't even take into account the fact that being missed is inherently better for players in most situations.  Stuns and interrupts are bad.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm done discussing it.  If you don't agree, Murtak, that's fine.  No offense taken, you're absolutely entitled to your opinion, and I have no hard feelings for it.  I hope I've made myself a little more clear.<br />
<br />
Take Care,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Romidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, the warriors have parsed them as having equal effects in the long run. And if you can get one rounded or two rounded by a mob hitting at min, avoidance isnt going to help you much either  :D<br />
<br />
I haven't seen those parses - I have seen my own and those of others on the Paladin board (check our tomes of knowledge to see some). Because you can't mitigate below minimum hit (that is, the damage bonus stays put), you'd need to adjust the mitigation number higher in order to have the two come out equal in the long run.<br />
<br />
It is certainly possible, however, that warriors with higher mitigation than paladins would parse more benefit from the mitigaiton skills that paladins; just as I know it is the case that paladins get more benefit than druids from the same skills (comparing parses on the druid board vs. our own parses on the paladin board); this would lead to a discrepancy as we're discussing as long as avoidance in the two cases is the same (and from what we know, hit/miss ratio does not vary between knights and warriors).<br />

As for your second comment - the case you describe is EXACTLY where the avoidance skill would prove MUCH more beneficial than the mitigation skill.<br />
<br />
Imagine a case where a mob hits for 1500 minimum and that the target has only 5000 HP.<br />
<br />
If we assume a base &quot;miss&quot; rate of 40%, that person will one rounded at least 12.96% of the time. That is, even if the mob hit ONLY for minimum damage, that person would die 12.96% of the time in a single round (that's how often all 4 blows would land).<br />
<br />
If we assume a 15% increase to avoidance (CA3 + LR5), that's a 46% miss rate instead of 40% and that person will die 8.5% of the time in a single round to that mob (that's how often all 4 blows would land).<br />
<br />
Imagine the somewhat silly case where a SINGLE MINIMUM HIT from a mob will kill you - in that case, your chances of survival when the mob aims one hit at you go from 40% to 46% as a result of having the skill. The mitigation skills would do nothing in this case.<br />
<br />
For mobs with very large DB's and lower DI's, mitigation skills just don't help that much. It's the same story of how AC in Luclin didn't help much - monks were great tanks because avoidance was much more important than mitigation. PoP and GoD shift that so that AC (and the mitigation skills) matters. Whether you get more benefit out of one or the other depends very much on what mob you are fighting.<br />
<br />
I believe others have already mentioned it, but one of the issues also is that even if the damage reduction were the same between the two skills, it is still much better to avoid being hit than to be hit for less. I'd rather reduce how often I'm hit by 10% than to reduce the average hit by 10% in almost all cases. Being stunned and/or interrupted can be extremely detrimental. ;)</div></div><hr />

You should mention that your hypothetical MOB has the same minimum and maximum hit. If it can actually hit higher then minimum ID also helps to prevent being one-rounded (albeit less then LR).<br />
<br />
I suppose I should have worded things a little differently.  I wasn't trying to say that LR5 is superior to ID5 or that it will always do better at preventing damage in the short term.  What I was saying is that it CAN.<br />
Just as ID can. You seem to be working under the assumption that LR fires more often then indicated by it's percentage. That does not happen though, not over the course of a play session (or week or year).<br />
<br />
In a world where mobs are hitting for 1K plus, a lucky string of misses can easily save your life, where you would have surely died otherwise.  Yes, the skill can also completely fail and do nothing for you, but that doesn't negate my point, since I'm not trying to state that it will always come through, just that it can.<br />
<br />
Under the correct circumstances, LR5 has the POTENTIAL to be far more effective than ID5.<br />
Those circumstances being &quot;i am inherently lucky&quot;? Sure, LR can save you. ID can save you too. Having an extra round of attacks to get a heal can be just as beneficial as being outright missed.<br />
<br />
As far as my grasp on statistics, I don't appreciate being slighted based on your opinion.  You've already agreed with my point.<br />
Your point was LR being better in the short run and ID catching up when you tank for longer times. This is simply not true.<br />
<br />
I like ID5.  I like LR5.  I recommend getting both.  My recommendation for getting LR first was merely because it CAN be more effective in a pinch, provided you get lucky with the RNG.<br />
And it can be less effective - of course the streakier skill will be more streaky. I do agree that LR is the better skill but I do not agree with your reasoning at all.<br />
<br />
If the mob swings once, and misses you due to a good roll with LR5..you've just achieved 100% avoidance.  This is more than 20%.<br />
<br />
If it swings four times, and misses three, that's 75%.  This is more than 20%.<br />
<br />
ID5, regardless of the situation, cannot exceed 20% efficiency.<br />
For every time that LR prevents more damage then ID (disregarding damage base) it will prevent less another time. This is what average means.<br />
<br />
That's all I was saying.  Yes, I know that doesn't happen every time.  But it CAN happen, and it can happen when it really matters.  If that mob was swinging for 1800 damage, and swung 6 times, ID5 couldn't possibly mitigate as much damage as LR5 would, provided you got a lucky streak, and were missed by 4 of the 6 swings.  Like you said, you may get pummeled all 6 of those 6 swings as well.  I understand that.  It doesn't change my point.<br />
If your point is that you are going to assume that LR works on average more often then it works on average then yes, it will work better. Of course if ID worked better then it does it would also work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Have CA3 and LR5 and believe it helps a lot. Does anyone have any numbers on what I might expect from CS3 + ID5?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
      Nah the boost is very very small. Soooo small it change nothing ,really :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Help me if I'm wrong here (I admit I ended up skimming the last few posts and might have missed it but it sorta seemed like the same argument over and over).... ID is X% off of the Minimum hit?<br />
<br />
So let's set up a situation... Mob_001 hits for 80-100 damage.<br />
Char_001= Max ID =20% reduced damage per hit (reduced from Minimum hit)<br />
Char_002= Max LR =20% of swings that should have hit will now miss<br />
<br />
Now both folks are fighting the exact same situation... the mob &quot;lands&quot; 5 hits in a row for 90 damage (average damage... work with me :) )<br />
<br />
Char_001: Takes 20% less damage<br />
90-20%=74<br />
90-20%=74<br />
90-20%=74<br />
90-20%=74<br />
90-20%=74<br />
Total Damage Taken=370 Damage taken and ID saved 80 Damage from landing<br />
<br />
Char_002: Dodges 20% of the swings<br />
90<br />
90<br />
90<br />
90<br />
*WHIFF*<br />
Total Damage Taken=360 Damage taken and LR saved 90 Damage from landing<br />
<br />
Not to mention in that one swing you might have had a chance to get off a slow/heal/gate....something other than being hit and interrupted.<br />
<br />
So does this make sense and do folks agree with me?</div></div><hr />
