<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aaeamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">&quot;Previously the Eye of Zomm could be used to aggro NPC's to attack and was used for pulling mobs in certain encounters.<br />
<br />
As a result of this the Eye of Zomm has been changed to be non-aggro on Test Server and this change should go live with this weeks patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
An other example of the lesson - got something you want VI to fix, find a way to 'sploit it.  I have no idea what encounter this is being used in to make easy, but I remember months ago, maybe even a year ago, people complaining that the Eye should be made non-agro so it could be used as a scout.  VI's answer at the time &quot;No, the Eye is working as intended.  If players want to use it to scout, there should be some risk involved.&quot;  Well, find a way to make the Eye's agro useful to players, and poof - problem fixed.  :)  It is good to know that things haven't changed too much at VI.  :)</div></div><hr />

Thanks for nerfing one of the few items that actually added some variety to this pointless, idiotic, boring timesink you've created.  Oh no!  Players have found a way to make a stupid spell useful!  NERF!<br />
<br />
I suppose forged javelins will be nerfed next, because they are used for pulling mobs in certain encounters.  Oh nos!  People aren't pulling by running up and hitting a mob!  NERF I SAY!<br />
<br />
God I hate this game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nindalf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I find it ironic that there is an upgrade to Eye of Zomn - namely Eye of Tallon which is an invisible eye.  I swear they don't know they're own game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This cut my death rate down to about half its normal on pulls.   People will still be able to pull mobs through walls, via eye targetting, so all this does is up the death rate on conventional pulls.  I predict this will get unerfed as well (or Eye of Zomm removed from the game entirely) because now it will be the ultimate scouting tool, which Verant will hate even more.  Also I expect wizards to complain about exactly what Nindalf pointed out.  Necros will still be able to tap eyes, so the item isnt totally useless.</div></div><hr />

Some wizard:  Nothing was mentioned about removing the aggro on Eye of Zomm (which would make it function as a scouting tool, as it was intended to be). <br />
<br />
Alan:  Nope, no mention was made. I just happen to know that it IS intended to work as it does.  It’s not supposed to allow you to scout into dangerous places, that’s why it aggros things. <br />
<br />
Has there ever been a company that has changed its mind as many times as Verant?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jlove Fizzboom</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Eye of Zomm didn't bother me too much - but the pulling aspect was a bit more helpful than when it wasn't aggro before.  Sigh, or well.<br />
<br />
What really gets my goat is the Bind Sight nerf - we used to be able to take some really cool screenshots with that, and I didn't think it was any exploit at all, just fun -- oh, god, make sure you nerf THAT!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They have changed it because yes the Elder Beads are over powered and I damn well agree with them.  The item doesn't even drop anymore but there's enough of them out there to cause a problem.  The ones that do exisit make pulling so easy is @$#^ing ridiculous.  As pissed as Seran is, I have a monk as well and am glad they were &quot;nerfed&quot; in this fashion.  Takes the skill out a pull from hell, the thing that defines a monk.  I take the classes I choose to play seriously, and I feel the beads are/were cheap alternative to doing it the right way so I never got them for myself.  I took 10 deaths before I was able to split the Sentinals at Tormax's Room and Dlammaz Tower more specifically I took 10 deaths before I was even able to get the mobs out of the tower down the bridge to START splitling them not counting the multi times I died after I got them down there due to a FD fail.  Yet someone else can walk up with some crappy beads that dropped off noob mobs and pull those mobs out with no contest...riiiiiight.<br />
<br />
It's not fully a nerf cause you can actually use the damn eye for what it was meant for, Scouting.  I do see how this is another issue with being able to scout where you aren't supposed to but...it's either this or remove both the spell and the beads from the game entirely.  IMO both should be removed.  As it is due to pulling exploits you can't cast this spell in Kedge.<br />
<br />
Yeah it sucks that they keep changing stuff (just cause we simple folk figure out a way to use the crap to our advantage) but...<br />
<br />
If they removed the drop of the beads from the game that should been your first clue that they screwed up and besides... This isn't an arguement over some n00b saying a 15/19 dagger that drops off a hella tough mob he'll never see is over powered.  This is the fundamentals about how the game and specific spells work.  So in this case VI screwed up...AS IF THAT IS NEW NEWS! So please Seran don't take it so personally that VI is taking away your right to cheapen the game and the skill of a monk.  I put it more bluntly that I had hoped, but it's my opinion on the matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It doesn't cheapen a thing.  It's remarkable the number people have absolutely no idea how the eye works in conjunction with pulling.  It does NOT allow you to make any splits you couldn't otherwise make.  It has never done that for me.  It does NOT remove all risk from pulling.  I've died plenty of times, with and without eyes.  It doesn't trivialize any pull that I have encountered.  Eye of Zomm is basically a slightly more flexible version of forged javelins - all it has EVER done for me is to give me a bigger headstart on mobs when pulling them back to camp.<br />
 <br />
<br />
There is NO PULL IN THIS GAME that I have used the eye for that I couldn't do without it.  Not one.  I know because every pull that I have used the eye for, I've done without the eye as well.  I've only had the damn thing for about 2 months.  Fana, if you were having trouble splitting Dlammaz, maybe you need to think about trying another strategy - perhaps forged javelins, for example.  I have never, not once used the eye for that pull, and I have split it many times.  It is one of many, many situations where the eye does NOT help at all, and in fact is not as good as not using them.<br />
<br />
You can talk all you want about the beads, but the fact is - eye of zomm is and has been available to ALL classes for a very long time - walk into Sol B, loot an orb off the stone spider.  Or get a gnome to tinker a few stalking probes for you.  There you go, eye of zomm without the beads.  <br />
<br />
I am so goddamned sick and tired of monks who DON'T have the beads taking joy in this nerf.  It's completely juvenile to take pleasure in your own class being nerfed.  I don't have a Fist of Acrylia, so when it was nerfed should I have been laughing and rejoicing because it overpowered or cheapened the monk class?  Hell no.<br />
<br />
I pulled all the time before I got the beads with no problems, and I'll do it now after they're nerfed.  My entire pulling career is not dependent on this toy.  That's all it is - a toy, to play with on certain pulls.  It is the principle that has me angry.  The idea of leaving something in the game for YEARS and then deciding, suddenly, that it's vastly overpowering and needs to be nerfed.  That, and the principle of watching monks rejoice in seeing their fellow monks get nerfed.  <br />
<br />
That disgusts me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>wulfran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Realistically, in some of these nerfs/changes, I think we are seeing the change in approach by the team running the show now. McQuaid, Butler et al always refused to make certain changes (nerfs AND implementations) because it conflicted with &quot;their Vision&quot; of how the game was supposed to be. Another example of this is the Soulbinders (McQuaid and co always insisted that melee should and would never have the ability to bind themselves...and they rejected the NPCs to do it as well). I think this is why we are seeing some of the changes to longer-standing/existing issues/items/spells.<br />
<br />
Some of these changes in &quot;Vision&quot; or perspective will be welcomed, and others will be hated. All in all, its just part of the cycle that EQ has been experiencing form day 1. And to be honest, in cases where the changes eliminating gimping (such as the CotH single pulls of Phinny), I have a hard time finding fault with them...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Considering any aggro on the eye is transferred to the monk, and that silly arse level 1 eye has the worst level aggro around, I fail to see how it &quot;cheapens&quot; the monk class.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for scouting, an eye with a fifteen second life span, that requires two to three seconds to transfer your perspective, is pretty darn useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jice Virago</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Fanadile, <br />
This has less of an impact on Monks than it does on SKs with how VI hosed our FD fail rate since Luclin release.  Honestly, with the way the Wurms in HoT warp on top of you,  the eyes are the only thing that made pulling there tollerable for me.  Take out the stupid wurm autoteleport and you can nerf the item for all I care.  As it is, the eye would have NEVER ended up such a popular pulling tool if pathing in TOV wasnt so jacked.  I am guessing that Sssra is the same way.<br />
<br />
As for pulling through doors, this change will not stop that as I can use the eye to spot and target the mob and then cast on it with any number of spells that bypass zone geometry.<br />
<br />
Best way to get this nerf repealed is to get all the Rangers and Druids to think that this change makes tracking less essential since you can send the eye anyplace now to check for rare pops.  In fact you can send an eye of zomm through the wall to Traks lair from zone in from Seb as an example which was a major reason the eye was agro in the first place.  Also convince wizards to complain that the change has rendered the level 52 upgrade useless.  No one can whine as much as Rangers, Druids, and Wizards and for as sustained a period of time =p<br />
<br />
Edit: Fanadile, I used Eye of Zomm to pull LONG before Velious ever came out.  Ask Gesler.  I used to buy Stalking Probes (TInker item 5 charges of EoZ) by the truckload from him.  Let me turn around your glee over the nerf since you dont have beads and point out that you could have been carrying probes all the time, the beads are merely a convenience.  I would also point out that Bard pulling (yes good bards do pull and they use EoZ a lot) just got kicked in the ding ding by this. Your opinion comes off as a jealous uninformed cheer for a nerf.  I am with Seran on that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Don't take my comments as a shot at your skill, you are a great monk Seran.  And as you said, you don't need them.<br />
<br />
Pulling the Sentinals was mostly so hard because I was lvl 50 at the time...no Stonestance.  With the beads I woulda had a big enough head start that it would have trivialized the pull at any level range.  <br />
<br />
&quot;It does NOT allow you to make any splits you couldn't otherwise make.&quot;<br />
<br />
Correct, but you forget something.  Take the double sentinals at the double doors to Tormax's room for example.  Sorry but your Javelins won't help you here.  It's all about running up, aggroing and making the run back to the bridge before they stomp you into the floor.  With the eye this Pull (notice not split) is trivialized.<br />
<br />
My point still stands. <br />
<br />
As for the &quot;another version of forged javelins&quot;.  Sorry you can't direct a javelin around a corner into a room.<br />
<br />
My cheer isn't uninformed, I've seen these beads used in many situations, including in NToV a few days ago...talk about cheap way to pull a dragon.<br />
<br />
Oh and the eye being used to take HTs and DTs...yeah that had to go too, again adding to lessen the difficulty of a planned encounter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fallanthas Woodhelven</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Eye taking HT's?   I've never been able to make that work.  The darn thing only has 1 hit point.  Every mob I have tried it on swung before HT'ing.  I still got to eat the HT.  Dunno about DT's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Ashuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I have seen eye used for some very easy pulling where it would have been hard pull without it in ntov. Im pretty sure verant didnt do this nerf just to bother you Seran but cause they actually feel that it makes something that should be hard, easy in some places. I liked the eye cause I dont really enjoy sitting around for 30 min while monk dying trying to split something but I can understand why nerf it.<br />
<br />
:) anyway hi KoE</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I understand the reasoning behind the nerf.  What I don't understand is the sudden decision that the eye needed to be nerfed after 3 years.  It's always a pain in the ass when Verant does this, and it's the main reason why a lot of monks are pissed about this nerf.  Basically, Verant completely contradicted their position from less than one year ago about this spell.  How can a spell which goes absolutely unchanged for three years suddenly become &quot;not working as intended&quot;?  <br />
<br />
The fact is, Verant hates to see creativity from its players.  Creative tactics on a mob?  Exploit.  Creative use of a spell?  Unintended.  Creative ways of gaining experience?  Incoming nerf.<br />
<br />
The around the corner thing will still work, Fana, I'm not going to say how here for fear of another nerf but you probably know already.<br />
<br />
As for NToV, /shrug.  Just like everywhere else in the game, NToV will still be possible without it, but like Ashuran said it will just take more time.  I hear the Vyemm pull being mentioned a lot in relation to this.  I don't know for sure as I haven't done it.  The thing is, if Verant would fix a lot of crappy pathing in various zones, where mobs warp on top of you instead of running after you, then the eye would barely even matter.<br />
<br />
My point is, it's sad to see monks cheering a nerf to fellow monks.  Anything that weakens some of us weakens the class as a whole, even something minor, which overall I consider this nerf to be.<br />
<br />
*edit:  added a paragraph</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Fanadile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Honestly, VI has always been retarded about changes to items.  Their so called &quot;test&quot; server is worth about as much as giving a monkey a computer and calling him a professional gamer.  <br />
<br />
It makes you wonder how long they test things they add to the game, ESPECIALLY, items and spells.  We hear rumors of things then 2 days to 1 week later they are in game...yeah that sounds like a very thorough evaluation to me.<br />
<br />
I do agree with your point that VI tends to take things away from players who are just being innovative.  Just using the things VI gave them but... as we can all tell, VI isn't exactly a bunch of rocket scientists... but actually they could be heh, many many of the first space shuttles crashed into the ground instead of taking off into space yet the government kept pooring money out support them =b.  The problem is VI doesn't have the guts to rip something out of the game they feel is wrong immeidately.  So instead they wait a few months/years and whack it with the nerf stick.  It's almost as if the ppl who design this game don't even play it hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Seran Swiftstrike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Agreed.  It would be nice if all the staff changes we've seen at VI lately would result in an overhaul of the entire testing process, but I'm not going to hold my breath on that one. :rolleyes:  Maybe since Legends will be acting as a test server of sorts, we'll get a slightly smoother implementation process when it comes to changes in the future.  I hope so, but again... I won't be holding my breath  ;)</div></div><hr />
