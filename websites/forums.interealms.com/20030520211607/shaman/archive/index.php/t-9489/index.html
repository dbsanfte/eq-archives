<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Heres my magelo profile, any help would be most appreciated. A friend of mine recently quit playing eq and after a server transfer This is what I was able to buy. The book of rings is being replaced by a crystal chitin shield, just need to stop by bazaar and get it off my mule.<br />
 Main items I wanna replace are arms, legs (gotta do the KML quest most likely since I'm not very rich) and maybe chest. I want to save up for a iksar regen bp but I only have maybe 1500pp at my disposal atm. They run around 7kpp on torv where prices just suck. Was also wondering about replacing my primary and range slots. <br />
I'll be douing (dual box) with a 52 ranger with semi decent gear and his haste epic blade and any suggestions on a good spot for us would be helpful. I like to melee and realize I need hps and ac as much as mana, so not a pure wisdom type of shammy.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">First off, invest in a regen BP, iksar most likely if you dont have money for a fungi.  Replace acrylia mask with either crystal spider mask or enshrouded veil, or anything else with some hp.  Spider Fur belt is cheap and has good ac/hp.  Goranga idol for range slot.  Maybe do the cloak of the wise quest for a new back item.  Not too hard a quest if you will be grouping a lot in PoP.  Id use a sarnak battle shield instaed of crystal chitin shield.  Arms are a tough slot, dont have any suggestion there.  If you group in Seb, you should have a good chance at getting an obulus death shroud for you're shoulder slot.  With that you should be set.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I upgraded most of the slots with what ya sugested, except for the iksar regen bp due to it being out of my price range. Still lookin for an arm slot item, was some acrylia stuff in the bazaar earlier but when i got the money they were gone. So still lookin for a suggestion for arms.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Slargg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">switch the earrings to black sapphire electrum<br />
crystal spider eyes is campable from velks<br />
camp hardened grey flesh sleeves in the grey<br />
barbed rubicite bracer for about 2k from bazaar<br />
dusty soriz boots are less than 1k<br />
brown chitin legs are about 1.5k<br />
shimmering terrorhide cloak less than 500pp<br />
tattered mantle less than 200pp<br />
sarnak battleshield<br />
<br />
should set you up for a while</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Most of your price estimates are way low for torv. Some items cost at least twice what ya quote, not your fault but just proof that torv sucks for prices. Anyways I am going to get the earrings made for me, as i have some gems kickin around that i forgot i had. Also going to steal a crystal spider eyes from an alt. Still haven't seen a sugestion for arms that I can either afford or camp easily. Also was wondering if anyone has doued a ranger and shammy of my level and could tell me wheres a decent spot to go where we'll both get good xp.</div></div><hr />
