Got him to just under 80% :\ i had pot9.. no kei, druid ds, potion ds.. probably would have lasted longer if i had gotten a kazad and a voq</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A damn good try for a noble cause.  How did you aggro him, btw?  We tried to kill him and had to have a warrior AE taunt and pull all the mobs to the nexus stone and zone out, then kept him in place with hails while all the adds went back to the library.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Redspeed</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its a secret,  i never shouldve told anyone anyways ;_;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hahahahahahaha KILL HIM!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I tried one of the mobs in nexus earlier, one of the guys in black robes holding a water staff.  Only hits for 250 but hits FAST and LOTS of hps, fought one for over 8 mins with a 67 pt dmg shield and only had it to 30% or so and had to zone then (cant use horse in Nexus so I was going OOM and torpor didnt heal faster than he did dmg so even cann5 wouldnt keep my mana up).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i tried him again.. fully buffed.. and i somehow did worse, GJ ME ~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">hehe..I was running through the Nexus one day when I saw the message from the Odus Scion &quot;you will not evade me Redspeed&quot; so naturally I stopped, looked around and found him hitting the scion.  <br />
<br />
Red has asked me to help him kill the Mystic...and I will although I had forgotten about it until I red this topic. <br />
<br />
let me know Red when you are ready for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It's great fun stuff to single out one of your enemies who is notorious for zoningjumping to PoT to heal/rebuff when they get beaten in pvp. Then you train all of PoT onto the stones area, and just before you reach the stones you tell him 'Could i bum a randombuff please, coming up to stones in a sec'. And he goes 'uh... sure i guess'. You get the buff then you zone over. *evil scientist laughter*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">asta you are eeeeeeeevil :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I got kunark scion to 17% first attempt but he fled :( by keeping health really low I got him to 3%, but I had like 300hp left, and he fled then... need some way to keep him from fleeing... might have to tank 2 of em at once :/</div></div><hr />
