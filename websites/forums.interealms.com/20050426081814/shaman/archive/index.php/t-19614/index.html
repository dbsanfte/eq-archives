<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is there somebody that knows or somewhere I can go to find out the levels of PoP from easiest zone to hardest?  I was told its possible for me to solo in BoT but quite frankly I think my ass would be kicked.  I guess I am looking for something inbetween justice and bot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Just about everything you can get into unflagged nowadays fits between PoJ and BoT. Here's my take on the non-flag-required zones:<br />
<br />
Justice<br />
Innovation/Nightmare/Disease<br />
Storms/Decay/Valor<br />
<br />
Don't know much about soloing, sorry. I guess yard trash in Innovation/Nightmare/Disease would be possible. GL.</div></div><hr />

Definitely.  just buff doggie up real good first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gheff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Speedbump aka Shaman rune aka dogdog is pretty much a lost cause.... Not a scientific based statement but mobs in PoP hit dogdog so hard that the mana wasted healing him is better spent root rotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xxithiss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I solo a LOT in PoP zones, just give doggie str, FoSpirit (they stack), and haste, then 2 weapons, pull with malo, slow before they get to you, or have doggie take a round while slow casts, then dot dot dot, and tank them yourself.<br />
<br />
Tier 1 trash does LESS dps when slowed than stuff in Nadox.  While they CAN hit for 250+, the almost NEVER do.  Stuff in nadox and similar zones hits for 130ish, and hits for 100+ a LOT.  So the DPS is similar.<br />
<br />
Make sure to load up the dots, as drawn out fights take more mana and give less exp/hour.  Fast fights means less heals and more mana spent on dots, etc.  Out-DPS them, dont try to out-last them like you would on a hard mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">tier1 (pod, poi) is a good place to practice taking knocks in the face. I'd say use a 50% slow on a rat in pod and see if you can tank it. Then go try and do stormriders in bot if you want. I don't think trying to tank the miltis (melee giants) is really doable until you have LR5 (from what others have said). gl. Of course there's always root/rot, but we shamans get to wait until level 64 before we can really do it right.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Rats to stormriders is a HUGE jump, and really is 2 different solo'ing techniques.<br />
<br />
For a steady progression on soloing, try this:<br />
<br />
PoJ is easiest (Gaolers are nice)<br />
Skip PoI - hard to solo there because of zone layout. <br />
PoD - flies<br />
PoN - trees, ravens, etc<br />
PoStorms - Frogs, anything that doesn't summon<br />
-------- stop using pet here ----------<br />
PoV - Golems<br />
BoT - Stormriders<br />
HoH - Basement areas<br />
<br />
Thats a pretty good start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I loved soloing PON trash at 59-60, in Velious-level gear.  Root-rot, using dogdog whenever he was healthy and calling him off when he needed a break.  I'd get 2% regular XP per kill back then, IIRC.  Of course, they've nerfed solo XP now.<br />
<br />
Favorite locations - facing GY on the hill, head left along the zone edge until the zone veers to the right.  There's a static spawn (raven, tree, or spider) right at the point.  Kill that one, then keep moving around the zone edge spike and into the little &quot;pocket&quot; immediately on the other side.  This site has lots of advantages - no spawns right there, no wanderers, and if anyone trains the GY you just hug the zoneline and don't get aggro since everything paths around the bulge in the zoneline.  You have three static trees nearby plus the aforementioned random static to pull, which was plenty for me until 62-63.<br />
<br />
If that gets boring, or if you're clearing all four spawns too fast, cross to the other side of the valley and proceed toward the trench.  Set up camp by the last big rock before the wall on the right runs out.  Pull ravens to this spot.<br />
<br />
Once you've mastered that, you are probably ready for PoV Crystalline Golems, check out my detailed post on that.<br />
<br />
BTW I used basically the same techniques to kill stuff in PoN that I used on the golems in PoV, check out the other post for that as well.  The main difference was that I did use dogdog on PoN mobs.  I would just call the dog off when he got to 40% health if I didn't feel like healing him, or call him off and throw him a Torpor.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Do Not Allow Mobs To Run At Low Health.  I figured this couldn't hurt if they were moving slow and not moving toward mobs, but... if they get too far away from you, they will regain about 20% health and come right back at you.  A real PITA.  At the very least follow them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Boo.  PoI = cake.  In most pulls, you don't get more than one.  When you do, you have a 3 minute root.   :p  The only thing you have to watch for is the unslowables.<br />
<br />
I still go there to solo when I'm not feeling particularly ambitious.  Just pick a direction, and wander down the corridor, killing as you go.</div></div><hr />
