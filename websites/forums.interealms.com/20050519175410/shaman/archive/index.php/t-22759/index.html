i support any class with real issues (i supoort beast when they had problems), so yes i agree berserker need fixing. it was just nice to have a thread where shaman where mentioned and not classed as &quot; but they can solo soinso&quot; or anyother misconception about how great we are.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">hehe, you need to remember also that a lot of the berserker community is ex-shaman who quit their shaman after GoD was released and started a zerker...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Berzerkers need some fixes.  Ive had then in LDoN groups before and they dont bring much to the table with them.  They have a nice epic and some semi usefull abilitites that they can use once in awhile as long as they have endurance.  Because of the need for lots and LOTS of endurance the only class of 'zerks that Ive seen do well were ogres, because of the high statring stats giving them an edge.<br />
<br />
Ive grouped with 'zerks at pretty much all levels of play though one alt or another.  At mid 20's to 30's they tank well though if you need them too.  At level 45 that stops for some reason and they start taking damage like a truck hit them.  Low 50's they are a waste of a group spot and dont get better till about 58-59, when their damage starts ramping up enough to make a small difference.  A nicely equiped 65 'zerk does a little more damage then a warrior but tanks like a rogue.  Their utility (snare and other disc's) are usefull if you dont have another class than can do the  same job.</div></div><hr />

If you want to see how pissed the Berserker community is you might want to take a look at www.goberserker.com www.berserker.org. They are more pissed off the we are, i guess they have been getting banned from SOE message boards also. Stop by and show your support.<br />

Rather than incorporate player-given ideas into the existing melee classes that provided them, Sony chose to keep those classes broken and make a new broken class that incorporates lots of the ideas but in an unfinished, poorly executed manner.<br />

I feel sorry for the zerkers (even the dorf ones), but all I can find it in my heart to do is point to the bar stool next to Mill and hand them a beer.</div></div><hr />

That class should have never been created in the first place.  Why add more when their current set is so outta whack?</div></div><hr />

<br />
i like the idea of a 2h specialist, but they needed to give than better 2h to do it with and more skill linked to the 2h. they way i see them is a dps class similar to rog, but slightly less dps and slighly more tanking.<br />
<br />
but then again soe does tuff then thinks about it for way to long and then eventually fixes it atfer annoying the heck out of the players. which is not a good thing and why i think the other games coming out whether they good or not (though they are looking good) will kill eq this time. Far to many poeple are annoyed this time round. I know it been said before, but it is very different this time round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'm sorry, the Berserker is barely even a class.  Part of me feels sorry for them, and is sort of empathetic towards the fact that they were released in a totally unfinished state and with no clear cut role.  <br />
<br />
Beastlords, although perhaps the bane of a Shaman's current existance, were nicely implemented back when 60 was the level limit (despite the whole temporary zoning pet skill thing).  The 65% slow is my biggest problem with them... 50% I can maybe see, but 65??? They're hybrids!<br />
<br />
The Berserker, however, is just plain crappily done.  They had an April fools post saying somewhere &quot;congratulations to Berserker players, we'll decide soon on whether or not to implement Berserkers as a permanent class.&quot;  Sad thing is, it didn't sound funny to me, it sounded accurate.<br />
<br />
Then again, the other part of me wants to say, &quot;You picked a class that was obviously horribly implemented, and now are angry that you aren't fitting the mold?  What the heck???&quot;  But that would be assuming they know how SoE operates, and I do so enjoy the few innocent ones who place faith in whoever is in charge.  Reminds me of myself as a lad, or something...<br />
<br />
I've met ONE berserker in all of my grouping so far.  He was a very fidgety guy who joined our lazy half-guild half-pickup group in PoV and opened with the statement &quot;Okay guys, I need 65.5 kills till my next AA, so let's make sure to kill things fast.&quot;  He then proceeded to order us all on which roles we would take, though we were all already doing fine.  Then he overpulled on his second pull, trained us, and ran off to the GY to zone, then disbanded.<br />
<br />
I was like, THAT was an annoying warrior.  Then later I /who'd him and he was a Berserker.  /shrug</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually when beastlord were first implemented they were a rather sorry state also.  If I recall they didn't even get the spiritual purity line until much later, and the 65 percent slow didn't come until 65.  I do recall something about their warders being quite aweful back in the day also, though I don't quite remember why.  Overall on initial release I remember them being quite a crappy class until sony decided it was time to over haul them into what they are now today.<br />
<br />
Its pretty much the same situation with bezerkers, another class that I really don't think needed to be released, with pending issues as far as certain classes go.  Though now that they are out, they deserve just as much attention as everyone else, if not more  since they still do kind of need to be finished...  I don't think that people realized that the class wasn't finished until they reached the upper levels and realized that there was nothing there. Well, other than sony...</div></div><hr />

The damn spell was worse than torpor... so most level 60 beastlords only had 30% slow from Sha's Lethargy. Then they vendored it and added in SR at 65, which was way over the line. Why can't we get vendored ACP, huh?</div></div><hr />

Juuuuuust kidding.  They don't.<br />
<br />
Actually, berserkers are supposed to be huge close-in offense and good distance damage.  Instead of spells, they got a couple of decent disciplines, several bad disciplines, and broken disciplines.<br />
<br />
Assuming gear is equivalent, rangers do a little less close-in damage, and a good deal more long range damage.<br />
<br />
The answer to your question is &quot;nothing,&quot; as far as my 'serker experience goes.</div></div><hr />

 So, would someone mind telling me what the zerker was ment to do that a Ranger cannot?<br />
  <br />
<br />
I have had a Zerker (Nubsy on Xev) tank in normal LDON with no problems.  Granted, iirc there was a Shaman slowing and our DPS was through the roof (Cleric for heals), but we had little to no problems with him holding aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Faern, could that be the difference between a competent berzerker and a complacent berzerker?  Maybe the ones I've grouped with were slackers, as their DPS was under what my monk puts out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>TainwulfSilverwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">10-30ish Zerkers do pretty good for DPS.<br />
<br />
Of course I'm sure most Zerkers quit before 10, as the damage cap means your getting outdamaged by any 1h weapon with a delay 150% longer.  Those were the roughest days so far with my Zerker, but I imagine the closer I get to 50 the rougher things will be.  Innate Crits really helped out a bit but still I can see even at this low level some serious flaws.  To be honest though, there is a world of difference between a competent Zerker then someone who hits auto-attack and expects big damage.  Really the whole class is about the Frenzy attack, its just that the frenzy skill is very subpar.  A chance of up to 3 attacks just doesn't work very well.  AA's or simple level bonuses to the amount of attacks in a frenzy would help.<br />
<br />
Well best not to get on that one, there's a lot that could be done to help Zerkers.  By definition, the Zerker is a melee fighter with deals insane amounts of melee damage with little consideration to his defense.  So he should be the highest straight melee DPS because he cannot tank really for crap.  Sure that may overshadow the Warrior, but imagine a sturdy tank taking the hits, while  the Zerker stands next to him dealing large amounts of melee damage, and maybe a rogue is in the background preparing for a major backstab.<br />
<br />
I dunno, but in all honesty maybe groups should be bigger and anything that breaks cookie-cutter groups is excellent.  I left DAoC because it was &quot;We have to have this, that, and that class or we can't do anything&quot;, but really group positions are largely a player-created issue.</div></div><hr />
