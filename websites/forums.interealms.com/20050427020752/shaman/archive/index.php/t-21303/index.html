<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Been experiencing this lately, and it usually seems to be with just one machine/program.  However, it contributed to a wipe on Synthrax last night that pissed me off.  My SK was only able to hit him when he'd bounce up from the floor, or I got him to move onto the rock in his room.<br />
<br />
Other mobs that don't hit for 700 plus aren't a problem, but that fight took nearly twice as long as it should have because of it.  With the bug, I won't count that as part of my tally against him, but waiting for 3 hours to get his arse to spawn, and have him in the floor on the Tank screen pissed me off.  <br />
<br />
Anybody else having this problem?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Makelike</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Has been an issue for at least a couple of weeks now. Same exact instance where the mob will be in the ground on one system but perfectly normal on my second system. When this happens I tend to watch for positioning with the unaltered account since positioning is difficult to judge when you can't see most of the mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Somebody told me this is common with ATI video cards.  I myself have an ATI card and I see this happen too.  What do you have?<br />
<br />
Edit.....I just downloaded a new upgrade for my ATI video card dated 4 days ago.  I will repost if my problem has been solved.  I am going to also redownload dx9 just incase.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">this problem, and the missing ground effects problem happens on both my radeon 9800 pro and on my brother's gforce 4.  the eqgame.exe errors happen on both comps as well.  i went to the tech forums to get this taken care of, but that didn't help.  MANY people have these problems.  the dx9 patch was the worst thing to ever happen to EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Nvidia G3's - 128mb card...with most recent drivers.  It only happens ocassionally.  But this time pissed me off, and cost me a wipe on a mob I like to camp if I'm in Veksar, and the camp is open.  I probably should have camped the SK to see if that cleared it, but didn't want to waste the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mangler Moreau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I had 1 mob in the floor on a Ldon hunt after I patched my video card and dowloaded dx9 again.  I guess 1 mob after 2 ldon and XX number of mobs is not too bad although it shouldnt happen at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beafly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I have had this problem fairly regularly on both of my machines. I've bugged it numerous times. One machine is a Nvidia FX 5200 and the other is a Radeon 7500. Both are updated to the latest DX9 version and both are running the drivers pointed to by Sony. Is a little frustrating for sure when you can't slow a mob that is beating the piss out of your tank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>wakonda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I am running a Nvidia GF3 Ti 200 card, rather old card but i have never seen a NPC in the floor, only guildmates. /shrug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rtugok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You have to spam spells on NPC's in the floor until you get lucky and its out for a second when the casting starts. I hate that damn collision patch. Programming I would think you would fix broken things first, then work to make what exists more efficient or better, but I guess this is not the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Wilcas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Another example of buggy, crappy code foisted on us.  The priority at SOE is to slap out another $30 release ASAP for the cash flow.  It is clear that to SOE, there is no incentive to fix game wrecking bugs if there is no way to charge for the fixes.<br />
<br />
If the quality of the new release is as poor as other recent ones, there is little incentive to buy it.  I am holding my money until EQ works.  Which could be quite a while.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Running 2 accounts with EQW, Gforce 3 Ti 200 video card. I can have the mob in the floor on one account but not on the other. Based on that I would say it is not a video card issue. More likely there is a nerf in the positioning data being sent from the server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just want to chime in here and say that the DX9 patch was the last straw for me.  Just way way too many bugs in the game already and then they go and break almost everything with one patch ... and then go on for months with NO FIX!!   I cancelled both my accounts because the game was basically unplayable for me.   Sony really fzucked this game up bad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">gotta love mobs bouncing off the ceiling. it just makes me laugh- its like they are getting 'beamed' up or something and smack their head on the ceiling and come back down heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jvrebi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Rooting them has worked a few times for me.</div></div><hr />

Same problem here the one time I've had it. using a 64mb geforce, not sure exactly what model.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Peroxide</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I think the mobs in the floor have disappeared.  Anybody still finding DX issues?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Hail,<br />
I think the mobs in the floor have disappeared.  Anybody still finding DX issues?<br />
I still get the occasional mob halfway in the floor. :( <br />
Nowhere near as bad as it was a month or two ago though.<br />
The completely sunken mob experience (can't see it at all while it is hitting you) I believe is mostly gone.  The halfway into the floor mobs I can usually still cast on.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />
