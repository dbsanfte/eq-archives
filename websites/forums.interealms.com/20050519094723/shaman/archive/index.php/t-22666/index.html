<br />
Gart's list for improvement (not the OOW list):<br />
1) Better heal - 1800 base heal should work, maybe 2k<br />
2) Better canni - (ancient can blow me, or put on vendor)<br />
3) Better dot - faster especially.  reduced aggro is an issue, but not huge to me.  <br />
4) Better nuke - 1200 cold nuke in 6 seconds.  We've lost way to much ground on this.  There's a distinction between not being a nuker and not being able to nuke at all.  <br />
5) Better pet - eat a few more ripostes, and innate dual wield please. <br />
<br />
Then, for extras:<br />
<br />
6) 2 hour FA/group FA<br />
7) faster/long duration sow<br />
8) combat effect buff (reluctantly)  <br />
9) group STLW<br />
10) better malos/AE malos<br />
<br />
Not huge upgrades in the top 5, just more than what we have at present.</div></div><hr />

/shrug.  I'm not sure Sudedor has FA in his book yet. ;) <br />
<br />
It has definitely been one of the major 'convenience' complaints on this board for 65 shaman since the spell came out.  Fixing it would ease a daily complaint and make us better in our support class role without improving our soloability one whit.<br />
<br />
Make it a group spell or give it the same duration as our other stat buffs! :mad: <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

This list is a joke I have no clue where it came from.  Lets get a real poll from the folks here at the crucible, I don't want a_Turtle_pet and sub 65 shaman voting for this stuff.  These are high end fixes to the shaman experience, not some half ass attempt to fix alchemy 5 years later.</div></div><hr />

btw there is a good reason why fa was not on list, that is because alot of shaman who would have voted for fa like myself cant post on the live website.<br />
<br />
it was one vote behind? well i vote for fa, there now it even.. what yer do now?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Same answer as on EQLive.<br />
<br />
If FA makes the list, all the folks who supported AE Malos are unhappy.<br />
<br />
Frekkels, I think you were kidding with me, but just to be certain . . . <br />
<br />
I have FA, I absolutely hate the spell as it stands.  I've been pretty outspoken about my disdain for the spell and provided a number of reasons and analysis as to why an increased duration and even a group version would by no means be unbalancing.<br />
<br />
I'm one of the ones who is unhappy about FA being excluded . . . I am in the losing camp.<br />
<br />
But I can stand by the list because I know that the vote was as fair as circumstances allow.<br />
<br />
No Florida recount here.<br />
<br />
And incidentally bara - the votes from Crucible were counted in the total.</div></div><hr />

i have  querry? was a ae version malos suggested by people along with fa? ie poeple voted fa and said that a group malos might be handy too? <br />
<br />
if so it might actually be mis leading? perhaps you should poll fa or ae malo? and see if results are the same? i mean i wouldnt say no to a ae malo, but if it was that or fa i would perfer fa.<br />
<br />
i know that polls dont always show the truth, along with statictics. and i not getting at you about this and it is possible that you did it differently in which case it could be fine. i just like to know how it was worked out?<br />

3.  Drop recast time on Malos or a new AE Malo / Malos series.<br />

5.  Improved Cann series.<br />
<br />
*******************************<br />
<br />
I did not include a change to DOT aggro because quite frankly my trust and confidence in the Sony programmers to implement a change in that area is about as high as whale flop.<br />
<br />
Vis-a-vis Alchemy and Dogdog, well, the Alchemy change should be a non-factor since it's WORKING AS INTENDED RIGHT?  Dogdog should at least come with SOW - he IS A WOLF.<br />
<br />
*********************************<br />
<br />
Finally, it speaks VOLUMES about the Shaman class and how far behind they are of EVERYBODY when you have 10 SOLID improvements that could be implemented simply to bring Shaman EQUAL to other classes.<br />
<br />
This is the result of 5 expansions of being left in the dust as certain people dronned &quot;It's only on test - wait until it goes live.&quot;<br />
<br />
As one with a 65 Enchanter and over 200 AA's (not a lot I know), I would be VERY hard pressed to come up with 10 Enchanter improvements.  <br />
<br />
But Shaman?<br />
<br />
Most of us here could write a BOOK.</div></div><hr />

  I agree FA should have made the list</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I keep seeing people bringing up FA as some sort of huge thing that needs to be improved about the shaman community.  IMO (and it is just that..my opinion) FA, while being a GIANT pain in the arse, doesnt even come to mind when I think of the top 5 improvments we need.  Sure, I know that our rolls are debuffing mobs and buffing people, but there is so much more that needs to be worked on rather than 1 spell.  <br />
<br />
Malos:  Needs to have the recast time shortened severly, I know I dont have the room all the time to keep malo and malos up to rotate on multiple inc mobs.  <br />
<br />
Heals:  Fall behind in the new era of high DPS mobs and short fights.  Our patch heals arnt even 1 top hit by a mob quading for 1200+ in GoD (and that's not even the named)<br />
<br />
DPS:  Heh...what's that again?...oh yeah..that thing that we're supposed to be able to do to make the mobs die...we're supposed to have some of that right?...<br />
<br />
I guess I'm just not understanding why FA seems to be such a big deal, I know for my self I rarely have a prob keeping FA rot up on a whole group (even a pet or 2), It gives me something to do when the mobs die so fast that DoTs are not needed and my pidly lil nukes get resisted..<br />
I agree FA needs a lil boost in duration, but that shouldnt be a huge priority that people seem to think it needs to be.<br />
<br />
again, just my opinion, not everyone will agree...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Fa would be good if either recast was taken off, or a longer duration, or a +5% overhaste addition to it to make it one of the best buffs.<br />
<br />
I personally think of all the ones on the list a cann upgrade would be the most welcome, especially in terms of reducing clicks.<br />
<br />
A malos upgrade would be next, anything to stream the casting line so shaman can actually effectively contribute to a group.(perhaps a malos/cripple combination without the aggro being fast casting)<br />
<br />
Then in terms of dps, a neg resist to bane. Or another idea, I still kinda like my pet avatar idea making it immune to damage and hitting for 200s for a period. Beastlords would be envious.<br />
<br />
Then heals, whether its an upgraded heal or an aa which perhaps crits every heal for a duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">in the following order:<br />
<br />
New Direct Heal<br />
&quot;Ancient Canni&quot; Available to everyone.<br />
*FIX* DoT agro. &quot;reduce&quot; doesn't cut it.<br />
Reduce Malos to 3.0 cast time and 0 sec recast<br />
Upgrade Nihil to the same duration as Turgurs. Recasting Turg over it is stupid.<br />
Either upgrade nuke DPS or make fights last longer. Doubt we'll get the latter though.<br />
<br />
That's about it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">If FA was so important, why did only 16 of the 41 people who voted here include it in their vote?<br />
<br />
Look, I am in the FA sucks camp.  But if I start changing votes and manipulating results I lose every bit of credibility.<br />
<br />
Talk to the folks who didn't include it, ask them why they didn't feel it was worthy of their attention.  All you have to do is go look in the other thread to see who made #2 part of their vote and who didn't.<br />
<br />
I want FA changed.  I want it changed yesterday.  I've been very vocal about it here and at EQLive.  But what I want is not always what the community wants.  25 out of 41 people here at Crucible did not feel that improved FA was one of the first 3 things we needed to add to our list.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">either way.... making alchemy components cost less and being able to mgb shrink is something that I wouldn't even consider thinking that they belong on the same table as the rest of the stuff.  I would honestly just throw those off the list completely.<br />
<br />
I posted what my opinions were on the matter.  Some are better than others, but what I think stands out more than anything is<br />
<br />
Better and quicker dps.  7.8 sec casting spell isn't going to do this for us.. especially with it's low dmg output total.  A good form of dps over a period of time is our dots.  However, with that problem comes agro, and it's pretty obvious to anyone with crit affliction 3, that we just can't stack more than 2 dots without tanking the mob.  This is true for every circumstance.  Last night in Txevu I had bane and anathema on the mob near the beginning of the fight and for about 40% there I did nothign.. then when the main tank when down about 2 min later i was the first one summoned.  This shouldn't happen, especially on a mob that wasn't slowable, and one that I wasn't the one that landed cripple on.. and especially on something that i haven't done anything for the over 2 min.  Either way.. this is our main problem.<br />
<br />
Healing.. yeah, we could use a bit better heal over top of Daluda, however, it's not as important of an issue as damage.  Right now with discordant healing we can get over 4k crits on daluda's, so with the change in the way that crit healing works, this isn't as much of a needed issue.</div></div><hr />

I dunno about EQlive since, well, it's a Sony board.<br />
<br />
Second, I doubt you could get 41 of 41 people to agree on what day of the week it is.<br />
<br />
Third, 25 of 41 is 61 %.  That means 39% DID feel that FA was a top 3.<br />
<br />
Finally, there are 10 things on the list.  Have the rules changed to where only the &quot;top 3&quot; get addressed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Look Sudedor, don't get your heels dug in about that poll or that list.  This process is about reasonable game design, not some high school exercise in democracy.  <br />
<br />
The point of the correspondent function is to convey issues that resonate with folks in the class.  <br />
<br />
It's clear FA is one.  <br />
<br />
Clear to me that is, I guess we'll see how blind the developers chose to be about this.  <br />
<br />
Grizlor's list captures it perfectly.  Feed that to the developers.  Evidently we may have to make a big fuss to get you to bring it to their attention.  I know you are trying to be reasonable, but you are taking an excessively narrow view here.  <br />
<br />
This is not about your credibility.  It's about meaningful definition/balance issues that are effecting shaman.  I don't give a hoot if alchemy components got 30598588382 votes, it's stupid and it doesn't belong there with other issues.  <br />
<br />

MGB shrink, everyone gets shrunk, no excuses.<br />

With the recent clipping changes making things a little different I think shrink has gained in value.<br />

How FA missed the list I just cant understand. If one more kiddy rogue sulks because I refuse to mem it so i can get nagged every 5 minutes cause i need the spell slots, im gonna hunt down the dev responsible for this spell and let down the tires of his car *grumble*<br />
<br />
IT would be ok if it actually made any difference, but stats are minimal and the attack is low. If it had an overhaste component, or a strikethrough modifyer then i could understand the difficulty. but at the moment its a spell where the cost is greater than the return.<br />

<br />
While I understand your point, I don't think that it's a big issue.  For most guilds that raid, including mine, getting a shrink device is something that every guildee must have.  This includes the several shrinking equipment that are available (for instance.. warrior clickie bracer).  Also, there is a tinker made item that you can use to shrink yourself.  Maybe back in the day before the advent of the shrinking device, but since it's around every person that can't cast shrink should have this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More efficent/faster active mana regen (cannibalize) would both be useless and detrimental for our class.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize is the major reason why we keep getting shafted in each and every expansion.<br />
<br />
Cannibalize is the reason for our useless 7.8 cast time nukes and our ****ty heals.<br />
<br />
<br />
So why the h.e.ll is cannibalize even considered getting upgraded? I can barely spend the mana I get from ancient canni (yes, I know most people doesn't have that yet but everyone will get the exact same spell in OOW) so getting even better cannibalize spells would be retarded.<br />
<br />
Mana regen should be one of our minor concerns, just above cha buffs, and getting faster heals and nukes should be our main concerns.</div></div><hr />

I can very honestly say that I would place an upgrade to Spirit Pouch as being more crucial to the Shaman class than those last three, however. They're rather dumb. Might want to change the alchemy one to include stacks-with-all effects that are actually USEFUL. Tinkering makes useful stuff, Research makes useful stuff, Alchemy makes Blood of the Wolf</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I keep seeing people bringing up FA as some sort of huge thing that needs to be improved about the shaman community.  IMO (and it is just that..my opinion) FA, while being a GIANT pain in the arse, doesnt even come to mind when I think of the top 5 improvments we need.<br />
<br />
/agree - That's why, while it's a pain, it's not near the top of my list either. Yes, it's a problem - I AGREE - but I think other things are more important to address.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you gave weighted votes based on experience of our community elders, FA would be on top of the list. But it was a one-person, one-vote scenario; my vote counts as much as yours, and I didn't put it at the top. In fact, not enough people put it at the top to get it on the  list this go-round. <br />
<br />
Maybe as more things come off the list, either as 'fixed' or as 'not under consideration at this time', FA will be added.<br />
<br />
Sudedor doesn't claim to know all the answers. In fact, he wants FA on the list, too. But he's fulfilling the obligation he took on, and he doesn't deserve the grief he's getting for the effort he's doing. <br />
<br />
If you can suggest better methodology to get a community concensus to present to the Devs, please do so. But I don't see how criticizing the results is helping the situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Gart - I understand.  What I'm asking you to understand is that there is a set of rules that was handed down to me as to how the developers would be willing to receive and in their own way respond to ideas.  I am following those guidelines as best I can in order to give the Shaman community the maximum possible chance to be heard.<br />
<br />
<br />
The guidelines say:<br />
<br />
We can have 10 issues.<br />
<br />
We cannot remove anything from that list until the Devs say &quot;Not at this time&quot; or &quot;Yes, we're doing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do I think 10 is enough?  No, I don't.  There are clearly a lot more issues that &quot;resonate&quot; within the community.  I am well aware of the issues that are causing the most grief.<br />
<br />
I asked for input on what &quot;candidates&quot; existed to replace the three issues that we were told &quot;no&quot; on.  <br />
<br />
I collected those &quot;candidates&quot; and asked everyone to pick 3.<br />
<br />
Three were picked.<br />
<br />
Were they the only three that people felt strongly about?  No, they weren't.  But they were the three that more people had strong feelings about.<br />
<br />
If I could rework the entire list I would.  I've said that many times.  Unfortunately, that is not an option I have been given.  I wish it was!  You know what they say about wishes and horses.<br />
<br />
I am doing my best to work within the guidelines presented to me.  I'm sorry that I can't change them to suit everyone.  I would like for everyone to go about their way happy.  I can't make that happen within the framework I was dealt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Would you put FA above alchemy cost?<br />

I certainly would. In fact, I would like to see these three completely tossed out for more pressing issues - which include FA:<br />
<br />
4.  Endurance buffs<br />
5.  MGB shrink <br />
7.  reduce cost of alchemy components<br />
<br />
But that was not what I was asked. I was asked to take the 10 listed, and prioritize the five of them that I would most like to see considered for reworking. <br />
<br />
The options to pick from are not my top 10. <br />
<br />
They are not the top 10 of all Shaman. <br />
<br />
They are the top 10 of the Shaman who took the time to contribute to the decision process.</div></div><hr />

2 DPS (both melee and DD/Burst, not DoTs)<br />
3 Give us a nitch back whether thats Endurance regen or some kind of way to canni mana to another toon or some other ability that is a nitch not just a toned down barely useful version of something 5 other classes have.<br />
4 Wouldnt hurt to make sure we can outspell BST at all times since they are supposed to be a hybrid anyway, I mean Id be ok if I could melee better than they can I suppose.<br />

I might be paraphrasing but I believe the words were something along the lines of &quot;Im sorry your data (and RL experience) of the past 6 to 12 months is all faulty and I dont see a problem from my perspective&quot; <br />

Extra mana would be great, but not if it was attained in exchange for something that I could better use it with.  Also, if they improve the normal canni spells, the AA would be less of an issue.  Giving and Advanced canni AA would be a no brainer for me anyway, since you'll have to keep up with the larger mana costs and larger mana pools of spells.  What used to give you enough mana back to cast 5 spells in Luclin will give you enough mana back for 2 spells in Omens (I realize all spells have different costs, but this is just a percent scale, for relevance sake, I don't mean it literally).<br />
<br />
I'd like to see 9, but I think that if 6 goes in, it will be less of an issue.  The other 4 are ones I am not interested in.  The group HoT thing is redundant with the implementation of a single target heal.  The other three, that samanna listed, are trivial in my opinion, when compared to the importance of the others.<br />
<br />
Direct effects on stat buffs is something I think is VERY important.  I believe so many shamans have never used a buff with substantial direct results (FA on people with situational ATK numbers excluded), and are therefore less inclined to pick it, as it is unexplored territory.  I'm tired of having 1000 buffs and only casting Focus (not including FA, I see that as a temporary enhancement, like haste... not a buff).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">in all the excitment i forgot to post my order<br />
<br />
1, improved dps (dd, dots and there agro from dots should not be seperate its just filling a space we can use for something esle, rain spells)<br />
2, healing (better direct heals, cleric type hots)<br />
3, not sure this is different from healing but a group hot would be very handy.<br />
<br />
the above is  my main concerns<br />
<br />
4. along with fa , adding direct combat effects or anything that is useful to our buffs.<br />
<br />
5, fa.... i dont like this spell and dont mem it because it takes up a spell slot and is a pain in the arse, but if it was a group version maybe, or longer lasting and didnt have that 1 min recast thing? it is a complete pain and as such its a spell i try not to use, making it easier to use would make it more useful.#<br />
<br />
6 ae malo or improve cast recast time , sure dont get me wrong it would help.<br />
<br />
7 u/g to canni? sure  but  oow already has a improved spell pained memory? why bother with more? unless as someone esle said we arn`t punished for having it?<br />
<br />
other things? our dog dog should innate duel weild and sow. i personally think it should be 1 level up too, pet at 54 59 64 79. not the 55 61 66 it is. this was another slight nerf due to perceived power. could be included in improved dps though?<br />
<br />
mgb shrink and alchemy are not class balance issue and should not be on this list.. should they be look at ? yes but seperate not class balance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Avatar is the worst line of spells ever invented.  Get rid of the whole line and add a 10% damage increase modifier to the Focus line.  I hate casting useless buffs, and FA is one of those useless buffs.<br />
<br />
Also, remove the stupid recast on Talisman of the Tribunal.  I know it's so overpowering to chain cast a resist buff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Really lame list.  Alchemy components?  No FA?  Strikethrough ect effect on focus (which was going to be included already in our OOW buffs).<br />
<br />
This list is a joke I have no clue where it came from.  Lets get a real poll from the folks here at the crucible, I don't want a_Turtle_pet and sub 65 shaman voting for this stuff.  These are high end fixes to the shaman experience, not some half ass attempt to fix alchemy 5 years later.<br />
While I agree that things like alchemy being on the list is semi lame, I dont agree that Sub 65 shouldnt have a say in the list. They play the class, and while they may not have experienced directly the problems that shaman face in GoD zones, there is a trickle down problem...if high end players are on a low end toon goofing off before a raid, the same thoughts and beliefs carry over, making our high end problem a lower end one too. Lower level players are impressionable and will follow the pack, especially if they dont peruse class boards and research other classes. Besides, sub 65s will some day be level 65 (assuming the game continues).<br />
The problems are happening to SK and Paladins too, just the other day I had my majorly twinked SK doing a LDON that the group wanted the warrior, totally untwinked 3 levels lower with 200 less ac and over 1k hit points less than my SK tanking. The reason? &quot;Sk tank for crap&quot;. Think about that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now as to the more pressing matter as to what I would want to see in priority:<br />
1) Upgrade to Cann, either by a sub 65 better ratio spell or by a less efficient bigger chunk spell (either way make it so ALL shaman can access it, Ancient Cann is a slap in the face)<br />
2) More efficient blast heal for more healing and faster cast time. I think that cast time is a key here as well, even with a spell haste foci and a buff Tnargs sometimes isnt a fast enough OMG blast.<br />
3) Reduction of DoT aggro. I really want to see this one. I love my DoTs and have spent considerable AA, and considerable LDON points on my DoT ability, as have many others. Make it worthwhile.<br />
4) Burst DPS. Decrease Velium Strikes cast time by 2 seconds give or take. I dont care about the damage as much as I do the fact that it takes forever to cast.<br />
5) Recast time on Malos...what the heck were you thinking Devs? Or give us an AA version maybe (hmm now that would be something worth saving for) with a fastish recast.<br />
<br />
Those are the ones I worry about most, the rest are convenience to me.</div></div><hr />

If I can help get that passion focused perhaps we can together motivate the Designers to make some changes that improve our enjoyment of the game.<br />

You want to tell me the &quot;logic&quot; of ignoring thousands of posts over the last 6 months and doing a flawed poll?  If we have to do a top 10 list lets collect 100-200+ responses with people's top 10.   Those results would speak for themselves. Having items on the list that are content unballancing with little or no chance to happen is just plain stupid.  Would I like a unrestible slow? Would I like an AA that reduces mitigation?  Of course, but that's pie in the sky.  LETS FIX what is illogical and broken spells like FA duration, group haste %, etc. <br />
<br />
Whatever, I was trying to give Sudedor tons of support and slack and  even though it appears that he is well meaning, he has failed representing us miserably.<br />

I was handed a &quot;Top 10&quot; list that already contained seven items that according to the guidelines I was given were not removeable.  I cannot change that.<br />
<br />
I allowed the whole Shaman community to participate in deciding what items would be eligible for addition to the list.  I allowed that same community to decide which three of those items were actually added.<br />

I fail to see how that is &quot;flawed&quot;.<br />

I agree that adding items that unbalance content is just plain crazy.  None of those items were added!  The only one that is really borderline is adding direct combat effects to our PoP spells.  I don't think that's realistic, but a vast majority of Shaman disagree with me.<br />
<br />
Instead of telling me what I did wrong, tell me what you would have done . . . the only thing I ask is that you be bound by the same rules I am.<br />

You cannot remove any of the first seven items from the list.  Your list may have only 10 items.<br />
<br />
What could you do differently?<br />
<br />
If you decide to remove &quot;combat effects on PoP buffs&quot; from the list, you piss off even more people than the FA crowd.  Remove DoT aggro?  Same thing.  Remove AE Malos?  You are still in the same boat.<br />

Aye Sud, combining them is a good idea. It does not hurt us, since they both deal with the same problem (our healing, or lack thereof) and are both &quot;currently being evaluated.&quot; I would, however, reword it slightly to:<br />
<br />
&quot;1. Fix Shaman healing! Shaman need larger, more efficient single-target blast heals to effectively function against the damage done by GOD mobs. We also need access to a group heal, and suggest a group HOT (as opposed to a group blast heal) would be more in-line with the shaman class. The group heal option would help nicely in a raid situation, and should therefore come with an MGB option.&quot;<br />
<br />
What are you looking at as far as how to word the FA request? <br />
<br />
And ... a word of caution ... be careful with appeasing folks. It can get out of hand rather quickly.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u69"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p69">Unfortunetly lists like these almost need to be broken down into the different areas where each shaman is playing.  For instance, I'm betting that most of the higher end shaman (read: past uqua) will say that our biggest complaints is that we need Better burst dps and a bit better heals.  However, if you look at the person doing nothing but exping in earth, they might just say that we need the ability to malos faster and FA longer.  Look at the non-raiding shaman, and he may say that we need to lower the cost of alchemy products as a top priority.  <br />
<br />
This kinda goes back to how Gangaskan and I got into an arguement with Apprey once.  We simply stated that we can main heal or main tank in Earth groups if needed.  There are just certain parts of the game that we function great in and certain parts we don't so much anymore.  Our problems mostly lie in the higher end areas of the game now.. with our lack of quick DPS, our relatively high agro/no damage spells, and our just a little bit too low heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
mgb shrink doesnt make my list but would be number 6, why would I not put FA over mgb shrink? because FA is such a huge pain in the ass I simply refuse to cast it. I consider FA to be broken beyond use. the spell simply doesnt do enough to justify casting it no matter what they do to the recast/duration.<br />
<br />
improved Canni would rock my world, of course it would be nice if there were some kind of balance. as it stands now if I have time to cani I never even come close to going oom, but when I dont have time to cani I am the first one to go oom. thats not balanced. (basicly it would be nice to have either a free spell gem or be able to lose my constant self spam)<br />
<br />
group Q would rule, it would give me a reason to finally burn the aa's for mgb so it would be good for something other than focus.<br />
<br />
ae malo, something I have dreamed of for literal years, shaman spells REQUIRE us to debuff mobs before we can cast on them. either fix that or fix malos.<br />
<br />
direct combat effects? you mean like make Focus something other than a hp buff? yeah that would be nice.<br />
<br />
fix dot agro? as much as I think this shouldnt even be on the list because its a game issue I have to add it, I died the other night after getting summoned on a raid and this was AFTER my dots ran out. the tank didnt even frigging DIE and I still wound up tanking. <br />
<br />
fix shaman dps (hell yes)<br />
reduce the cost of alchemy components...what the ****?!?!?!??! why dont you try selling your potions for a PROFIT instead of joining the ranks of dumbasses who have to be the lowest price in the bazaar? I dont even know HOW this made the list.<br />
<br />
endurance buffs...uh whatever. while I agree we are the right class for the job I fail to see a need for this to even be in game, maybe I need to play a 65 melee on a raid to see a use for endurance buffs.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, that's a really bum rap to lay on someone who spent so much TIME writing the One Voice thread outlining what needs to be done.  That's what makes a 41 person poll silly, when you've got a 13 page thread endorsed by 300 people outlining what folks are interested in.  <br />
<br />
I'm guessing Sudedor would take that line back if he could, because it's not remotely fair to Gloriana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">Look Sudedor, don't get your heels dug in about that poll or that list.  This process is about reasonable game design, not some high school exercise in democracy.  <br />
<br />
The point of the correspondent function is to convey issues that resonate with folks in the class.  <br />
<br />
It's clear FA is one.  <br />
<br />
Clear to me that is, I guess we'll see how blind the developers chose to be about this.  <br />
<br />
Grizlor's list captures it perfectly.  Feed that to the developers.  Evidently we may have to make a big fuss to get you to bring it to their attention.  I know you are trying to be reasonable, but you are taking an excessively narrow view here.  <br />
<br />
This is not about your credibility.  It's about meaningful definition/balance issues that are effecting shaman.  I don't give a hoot if alchemy components got 30598588382 votes, it's stupid and it doesn't belong there with other issues.  <br />
<br />
So, folks chip in on the thread I created on Live forums so there will be evidence of a fuss that Sudedor can feed to the developers.<br />
<br />
This gets funnier and funnier... notice that Grizlor's list doesn't even include FA :).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">It's really too bad that #3 didn't include a change to Cannibalize 4 or equivelant that works like Ancient Chaotic Pain but is actually available to the majority of Shaman.  However, a few months ago I believe Rytan said something about changes to the spell casting engine that would allow him to grey out certain spell gems if conflicting spells had been cast recently.<br />
<br />
It is pretty annoying that certain Shaman &quot;upgrades&quot; are listed when they should just be in the game due to convenience, common sense, etc.<br />
<br />
Alchemy costs?  That's supposed to be an upgrade for Shaman as a class?!  MGB Shrink is an upgrade?...HELLO - Tiny Terror, *group spell*, this should be /tgb 'able and should present the player with a Yes/No box.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing Sudedor would take that line back if he could, because it's not remotely fair to Gloriana.<br />
<br />
I didn't sign my name when I posted on the EQLive board, I hope I'm not blamed for losing the vote because my name couldn't be found...  :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
8, 4, 6, 9, 2<br />
<br />
EDIT<br />
<br />
Tallied up the numbers to see how it all turned out.  I don't know where that 41 person count comes from, I counted at least 85 solid 3 vote posts from both The Crucible and the EQLive forum, but anyway...<br />
<br />
The obvious 5 tops were:<br />
<br />
2 (FA duration) - 36 votes<br />
3 (combat effects) - 35<br />
6 (dot aggro) - 38<br />
7 (ae malos) - 33<br />
9 (slow mitigation aa) - 33<br />
<br />
Granted, this isn't 100% accurate nor does it show the weights of the votes (forgot to keep track of the order, gah).<br />
<br />
FA was in the top running for sure, it's just too bad to see something like DoT Aggro be on the list without first making DoTs actually run their *full duration*.  If they don't, nuking still wins over DoT's in the first place.<br />
<br />
There were an aweful lot of posts with #2 first if I recall :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u75"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p75">Ok we'll just add FA to Grizlor's list then.  Happy now?  <br />
<br />
I take it you are the lone retard who wants reduced alchemy costs on there?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u76"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p76">I might agree with you Gart, but Gloriana took the time to read the thread, reply in the thread, but not vote.  Had she simply not seen the thread or been away, you are correct, I'd be totally out of line.<br />
<br />
However, to simply decide that it was not worth an on topic reply, then complain after the fact . . . I'm sorry, that just seems &quot;wrong&quot; to me.<br />
<br />
I am not in any way trying to trivialize her contributions to the community.  The community would be in a far poorer state without her voice.  I was simply pointing out that in order to be part of the solution you need to, well, be part of the solution.  She is not the only one in that boat either, simply, she is considered a &quot;leader&quot; in the community.  Those folks who have that distinction should be the ones who make sure that they involve themselves in things like this.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, 41 votes was just the count from Crucible . . . there were a lot more at EQ Live as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u77"><b>Macheras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p77">Umm, no, but thank you for resorting to childish insults.  I think alchemy sucks in general and would never vote for any upgrade to it over other things.<br />
<br />
I just find the situation humorous.  I am only saddened that now after reading all the posts, I find that Sudedor is caving in to try and appease you people.<br />
<br />
FA is a stupid thing to worry about, period.  I agree with Valsuvius... increase dps and increase healing.  Why cry about a buff?  So the buff bots have more to do now?  Look... I am in a raiding guild.  I am often one of the only shaman on the raid.  I have plenty of **** to do and aside from an occasional request for FA, no one really even wants the damn spell.  They know it's horrible to keep up, they don't bother me.  If you think your sole responsibility as a shaman is to keep FA up on as many people as possible, you don't play the same way I do... sorry.  FA is not worth the time of the developers to even worry about, given all the rest of the problems shaman have.  The humorous part of it is all of you throwing temper tantrums because you wanted chocolate ice cream and mommy said, wait til after dinner please.<br />

As I said in another thread you are doing a fine job - but the the job sucks.<br />
<br />
Saying that you cant do anything else than what SOE tells you to do is not entirely true though.<br />
<br />
As far as I know you are not getting paid by SOE for all your work - you are doing it out of your own free will?<br />
<br />
This leaves you the very powerful option of refusing to do their dirty work if the terms they give you are unacceptable. You could instead try putting up a thread here asking if people feel justly treated by SOE or not. But I bet SOE is not interested in hearing about that.<br />
<br />
As long as you are not directly employed by SOE you have the right to do whatever you want and I would certainly respect it if you said &quot;Forget it if thats the rules I have to play by!&quot;. If you dont say that then you are inviting people to doubt what it is you are trying to do. You should atleast bring that doubt back to SOE.<br />
<br />
On the prioritizing business I dont really care - if we get even 3 out of 10 wishes implemented this year I will be shocked beyond belief. And anything more than zero will be very positive.</div></div><hr />

If it does, great ... if not, perhaps a 20-minute duration with a 1-to-2 minute recast would fly better. If you felt like pushing your luck some, ask for a 30 minute duration and a 3-minute recast. That'd be pretty sharp with buff extension AA's and foci.<br />

DoT agro - is this really just a shaman problem? Or are we only addressing it because we have no way (outside of dying) to shrug off our agro (think FD, jolt, atone, memblur, etc.)?<br />

I appreciate the work you are doing, Sudedor.  Thank you for taking the time to get, at least, a few of our concerns out there.<br />
<br />
My picks, for those that aren't on the SoE boards:<br />
<br />
Improved patch heal, group HoTs, burst DPS, DoT agro (see above), and END buff.  Those are in the order of importance as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldnt necessarily mind a buff once every 20 - 30 minutes so long as I could truly rebuff and get back to business.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u88"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p88">FA is a stupid thing to worry about, period.  I agree with Valsuvius... increase dps and increase healing.  Why cry about a buff?  So the buff bots have more to do now?  Look... I am in a raiding guild.  I am often one of the only shaman on the raid.  I have plenty of **** to do and aside from an occasional request for FA, no one really even wants the damn spell.  They know it's horrible to keep up, they don't bother me.  If you think your sole responsibility as a shaman is to keep FA up on as many people as possible, you don't play the same way I do... sorry.  FA is not worth the time of the developers to even worry about, given all the rest of the problems shaman have.  The humorous part of it is all of you throwing temper tantrums because you wanted chocolate ice cream and mommy said, wait til after dinner please.<br />
<br />
Mach<br />
<br />
The contradictions in what you just said are really too funny.  A longer duration, shorter recast FA would allow you to buff several people, very quickly, then go back to your business.  Also, if FA were to be changed then it is natural that the next spell in the Avatar line would have the same longer duration lower recast attributes.  Such a spell might even provide new combat effects or +skill modifiers.  Say the next Avatar spell is +15% to *total* melee damage done and therefor is just too good not to keep up on melee dps classes.  Would you rather be forced to keep it up using a 6 minute duration and 1 minute recast, or something much more convenient?<br />
<br />
Keeping the melee and pets FA'd much more regularly would provide a significant increase in DPS.  Sure, you wouldn't see it as a critical nuke (so everyone else can see and you can brag to your group), but you do need to?<br />
<br />
The occassional request for FA might be from one of the few people who knows how good it can be.<br />
<br />
If we don't play the same way as you, that means we are children?<br />
<br />
Yea, I'm one of those Shaman who think we have more important/fun things to do than buff.<br />
<br />
I disagree.  I would like to get back to doing what Shaman originally did a LOT of - buff.  Not caring about buffing really sounds like a younger Shaman more interested with keeping 8 dots stacked for maximum DPS, critting Rains on top of Nukes for a wow factor, or outhealing a Cleric.<br />
<br />
I want to keep my group buffed to the teeth just like I have been doing for years.  Yes, it's annoying to read the parses about agi and dex and such, but the *only* thing I have *ever* gotten from people I buff are &quot;Thanks, that makes such a difference&quot; and &quot;Wow, I proc like a maniac now!&quot;.<br />
<br />
I run into Shaman all the time that only do buffs ONCE while they have some particular buff loaded, then &quot;close&quot; that buff to anyone who asks (or at least get grumpy if they have to actually, gasp, unmem and mem a spell!).  That attitude comes from not wanting to be a buff bot and pretending like it's some huge burden to casts buffs.  I just don't understand - to each their own, but if you don't include buffs into Shaman then we aren't Shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh aye, wholeheartedly agree there. But ... I can just see a dev looking at a 20 minute duration / 5 second recast buff like FA, raising an eyebrow, and finding some way to say it's overpowering or some other crap. If 1-to-2 minutes is too much for you, perhaps a 15-to-20 second recast?<br />

But to me, buffing is what you do before you start actually adventuring.  It's something you take a break for.  It's not my &quot;active&quot; role in the group, it's simply a benefit I bring.<br />
<br />
You are way off base with the effects of FA.  There have been many discussions on the actual effects of FA.  The most recent and telling involved bringing in some information from the Rangers about the value of ATK.  Their parses show that 300 ATK translates to about 10 DPS difference.  FA is less than half that.<br />
<br />
FA doesn't really do much, but melee's are simply too conditioned to it.  They want it if you are around.  Therefore, a longer duration, shorter recast to put it more in line with &quot;medium&quot; refresh buffs is in order.<br />
<br />
Frankly, saying that not wanting to buff sounds like a young Shaman wanting to DoT is really out of line.  I mean really.  /tell solusek.vendaven or solusek.liloliani and ask them how strong a buffer I am.  *shakes head*</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Jaidin . . . FA wouldn't be worth casting as an MGB (if it were group) because in it's current form it would only last 10 minutes from a Shaman SCRM.<br />
<br />
The reasons that have been stated by devs previously against a group (or rather mgb'able) FA is that it would be overpowering.  For that 10 minutes, everybody would have FA.  This implies that FA is actually an effective spell.  Yes I know I am referring to what the devs have said (/cringe).<br />
<br />
I understand the diminishing returns +atk has on characters once they have a huge amount of attack already, but it does have a very large impact on others.  Stating FA only gives such and such % from some parse does not mean it will be that way for everyone.<br />
<br />
So . . . I suppose that . . . if FA were to become a group spell . . . and if FA were to have it's duration increased to a base of 30 minutes . . . you would probably see it MGB'ed at raids.<br />
<br />
I can easily keep FA up on 8 or 9 players in a raid.  I use the raid window and change certain classes to different colors, then just go down the list each time the gem pops.  A few Shaman on a raid, if they were paying attention, could keep the right classes permabuffed with FA.<br />
<br />
My point really was to compare the attack values of SoT+SotP versus FA.  My question really is that if the +atk FA gives is so meaningless, why would SoT and SotP be a standard buff to distribute?  Why would there be any items with vengeance at all, seriously?  It would take 28 levels of vengeance on a character to equal a single cast of FA.  Is it just for that warm fuzzy fealing that many players collect Aura of Battle items?<br />
<br />
But this change that folks are asking for to FA is only to remove the sheer annoyance factor and to give us back our spell gem.<br />
<br />
I totally agree and voted for it :)  I have a spell gem dedicated to FA unless I'm soloing :(</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u105"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p105">The thing is, that's a really bum rap to lay on someone who spent so much TIME writing the One Voice thread outlining what needs to be done.  That's what makes a 41 person poll silly, when you've got a 13 page thread endorsed by 300 people outlining what folks are interested in.  <br />
<br />
I agree with this 110 percent.  Votes on a lists are neat, but you can vote on them with any motivation.  A long, well thought out thread with a lot of input that gives the devs OPTIONS is preferrable, and already in existance.  <br />
<br />
Not trying to knock you personally Sudedor, but whoever implemented the list idea in the first place, be it a dev or whatever, LEARN the game.  How can you be so out of touch with a class in your game that you have to ask the community what is out of balance?  A few of the items are just GLARING.<br />
<br />
There are many roads to take in improving the Shaman class and getting it up to par.  The One Voice thread has proposed options.  All Sony needs to do is take a look at it, pick which path best suits their vision of how a shaman should operate (and they SHOULD have an idea, corporationalized or not, it is THEIR game!!!) and act on it.  Asking the community what they believe a Shaman is, is well, just pointless.  What a Shaman is has been listed in the manual, and in the Vision (TM).  To state openly that you have no idea what purpose is served by a certain class in one of your games is sort of mind blowing to me, from a communications standpoint.  But now I'm digressing.<br />
<br />
And as for FA, if it's going to be such a pain to cast, it needs to have direct percentage mods on certain special melee abilities, such as strikethrough, double attack, chance to hit for max damage, whatever.  Tired of being begged for a buff by people who already have awesome attack and gain little to no benefit from it other than seeing a buff icon in their window.  I wouldn't mind so much if it wasn't such a pain to cast.  I can't take off my clicky root pants because I need that slot for FA.</div></div><hr />

4.  Canni: don't really care, but some sort of passive/larger health+longer recast modifications to the line would be nice.<br />
<br />
5+ don't care.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u112"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p112">This thread wasnt started as a 'Who wants FA changed, what does FA do and is it really worth it?' thread guys.  It was started to get an idea of our TOP 5 major changes that we want.  FA is not a major change, nor should it be.  Its 1 spell amongst many, and many more need to be changed before it, along with abilities and the like.  <br />
<br />
It's aggrivating to see alchemy on the list too because that is not something (IMO) that should even be talked about before other changes happen.<br />
<br />
Eithey way, this thread got WAY off the point with the tangents about FA and stuff.  That is not what it is for and I personaly wouldnt want a Dev to see this thread.  If they did they might change FA before anything else more pressing gets fixed simply because of the stinck over 1 tiny spell.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION TO YOUR FA PROB:<br />
Melee ask...say you DONT have the spell for what ever reason.  There..problem solved.<br />
<br />
EDIT: While in my thinking of FA...there are ways you can make it not such a pain in the but...Extended Blessing aug from EC LDON type7, SCR3 and SCRM, Extended Enhancement4....something...there are ways you can make it last a little longer, even if only for a few mins.  I have time to FA the melee, maybe a pet..un mem FA put in DPS spell...DPS for a few..re mem FA and FA rot all over again...no biggie and it keeps people happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u113"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p113">My choices, in order:<br />
<br />
2.  Some sort of faster, larger, and more efficient quick single-target <br />
heal,  more on par with GoD mob damage (currently being evaluated)<br />
10.  AE Malos or lose the insane recast delay on Malos. (new item)<br />
9.  Reduce DoT aggro! (new item)<br />
8.  Add direct combat effects to all of our level 60+ stat buffs.  (new item)<br />
6.  Improve shaman DPS and burst DPS (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the record:<br />
1) Some sort of group heal or group heal over time (with MGB option). (currently being evaluated)<br />
<br />
Never gonna happen--not part of their &quot;vision&quot; of what a shaman is.<br />
And the rest of the list of 10 are pretty lame.<br />
<br />
Things I'd like to see instead:<br />
<br />
1) a spell at lvl 67 or 68 for new pet, with Innate dual wield, innate SoW, and a dps around 60 (plus enough HP to survive a blow or two from GoD mobs).<br />
2) A Cripple spell that actually does something useful.<br />
3) Group FA, or longer lasting FA (I know, already rejected).<br />
4) A new Slow that is essentially Balance/Nihil, but that lasts 4 minutes or more.<br />
<br />
I don't believe any of those 4 things would be &quot;unbalancing&quot; but each would expand our playability in one of the 3 situations in game, solo, group, or raid.<br />

None of the other stats affect him.<br />
<br />
In other words, for someone whom I would consider FA a &quot;good&quot; buff . . . it doesn't really help all that much.  I'm gonna try to get him to parse a few fights for me this weekend with and without FA.<br />
<br />
<br />
My hot box is a Level 65 Erudite SK with 111 AA now.<br />
<br />
The Str component is useless. Str gear abounds. With focus it is capped. I can cap dex with Diaku as well. But dont bother. <br />
<br />
The only real effect is the Attk. And that really does a large change. <br />
<br />
I think people have parsed around increase of 14 DPS . For a 65 SK With Swift like the wind and 32% item haste the DPS is like maybe meele based 60 DPS.  That is an 8% increase<br />
<br />
<br />
Compare that to a Vallon Where with a single spell you get 8% more haste. Attk And dex. And it is just sad. <br />

Ah, but note what I said: pet spell that has innate dual wield and innate SoW, plus a level of DPS. No way to tell yet if Snarling Spirit will have ANY of that. Likewise, I said a Cripple that actually does something--Crippling Spasm does NOTHING worthwhile. Lowering stats a few points in a system where stats mean almost nothing anyway means nothing, and lowering AC by 39 is a joke. As for Champion, frankly, I don't WANT another single-target spell that lasts only 6 minutes. And as you noted, no new slows. <br />
<br />
Summary: thus far, bupkis from SOE for shaman in any of these areas.<br />

I am not sure what you are trying to say here.  The +ATK is the only thing that anyone ever cared about.  The other stats have only a miniscule effect compared to ATK.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u126"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p126">For comparison (again): <br />

<br />
Disregard the stat boosts, they're relatively useless (yes, folks, I said &quot;relatively&quot; because there are some out there for whom the stat boosts are pretty sharp). Is +20 more ATK a significant upgrade? And is the 10% damage modifier going to make a significant difference?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u127"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p127">Ug - I'm trying to say exactly what you said.<br />
<br />
Tor - the +20 ATK is not a significant difference . . . however, the +10% might be . . . if it moves a melee DPS players max and min hit up by 10% . . . basically shifting their damage table up 10%.<br />
<br />
Would that be worth a recast every 6-10 minutes?  I dunno, I'd really have to try it to see.</div></div><hr />
