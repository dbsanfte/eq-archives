<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Will it be effective for a 49 shaman and a 62 warrior to duo bugs/pyra with no hassle? both shaman's well equiped and warriors decent gear for level, just wondering if shaman will be able to keep me healed</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Sure - that'd be fine (for bugs - haven't been in the pyramid so can't comment). I was in there last night at level 50 doing fine (as the main tank as it happened, but that's another story). <br />
<br />
As long as the Shaman's got Stocism and you don't mind being slowed down every now and then! Just make sure he/she keeps you cloro'd the entire time and slows everything in sight!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>DarkSidhe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">And root stuff at about 25% health. Had 3 deaths at bugs/guardian camp last night due to runners hitting the other side of the bridge...only had to bail once though, when one of the casualties was the chanter and 4 of the 5 adds were casters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shjekai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Maybe wait for 51 and Turgurs. Fast cast and less resists are very important. Slowing and rooting is great CC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>bugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Will that snare necklace be able to keep them from running away or should i just root?, And my big worried is will the shaman be able to keep me healed?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">snare would be awesome for it, but don't expect your shaman to keep a 62 Warrior healed. You will use almost all of your mana doing that. It is possible but your gonna have to pace yourself to keep your shaman in mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>loptar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">healing? what kinda hp/ac does your war have?<br />
I can duo there with a 62 ranger or warrior all day long.. takes about 1 heal per fight sometimes two, if they are wizzy's.. and the bugs are even easier.. though yes, turgurs makes a bit of a difference being resisted less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>bugbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Loptar, i have a lil under 1200 Ac and around 3500 hps atm on warrior nothing special but is mostly champ armor but ill be 62 or 63 when i star doing this so im guessing by that time ill be in 3700+ hp's  :) just gotta faction a bit more for turn ins :( . My other new question is I heard that on the first bug break ill be getting 2 or so mobs, but wondering if due to level 62+ will i be able to single pull everything, or will i still get rare adds?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grayskies</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Not sure about 62+, but at 61 I can't single pull the bugs, nor can I single pull much at all thats still dark blue. What I do to break up the Nec camp is to start out by rooting the closest bug. This will cause the middle one to agro. Sic pet on that bug, apply Turgur's and epic dot, then run and do the same thing to the rooted one.<br />
<br />
I generally use really slow dots at first so the initial fight is drawn out to keep pops broken up.</div></div><hr />
