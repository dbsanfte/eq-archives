Of course, Sony was completely unaware of the damage being dealt by pets. They don't have any form of internal parsing etc, so they were stunned to find out that shaman pets were doing so much damage. Indeed, if it wasn't for this forum we'd all still be looking at amazing DPS for the forseeable future, as no-one else noticed all that &quot;Goner begins to cast a spell&quot; spam going off every two seconds....</div></div><hr />
