<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anybody have any suggestions on what I could spend 50k pp on? Here's my current equipment setup http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=379795 <br />
<br />
Now being 44 I was thinking of getting a JBB but the thing is I two box with a level 39 cleric who can CH me and currently I stay only in old world. With my stone I'm basically as well off as I can be. Now JBB is something I plan to get but is it something I should get now or wait or what?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">hmm, get another electrum BS earring, a velium BS necklace, crystal spider eyes, coldain gloves, shadel bandit ring and djarn's amethyst ring, try n find some of those 15 ac 65 hp/mana dragonwing mantles ..   things like that ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kenton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get the jbb  bracer now. Its main power is between 44 and 55. Even with a cleric bot healing you'll come out ahead using nothing but your dog dog, slow spells and the jbb. With a cleric bot you should be canning back your slow spell costs quickly, cleric healing the canni damage and ready for another pull before you've put your cola down. Normally I would say maybe a fungi but with a full time cleric behind you, even at that level you don't really need any help on mana regen/health regen.<br />
<br />
edited- oops you have a fungi. jbb first you'll never regret it. After that whatever you want. I find the bazaar search feature is better advice for buyeable items that here or the spoiler site search features.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What dannin said + ODS and JBB.  Maybe a heiro?  Earring of Solstice?  (Heh, wait, just those four are most of the 50k)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">One thing and thanks everybody for all the info but whats ODS ?</div></div><hr />
