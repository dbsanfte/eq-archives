<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hangman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was talking to a player on my server last night, and he/she said that when EQ2 goes live no one will be playing EQ1 anymore and that they will pull the plug on it. I have only just started playing EQ, arround  2 months now and don't know that much about the game. But if every one stops playing when EQ2 comes live, there wont be anough people to raid for epics or hard drops (i should be hight enough by then to do them). Do people think that EQ will become a no mans land when EQ2 comes live? I hope not.</div></div><hr />

Personally I'll probably keep with EQ until WoW or Lineage 2 comes out, then jump ship. Unless EQ2 hype grabs me, I won't play it. Chances are they'll up the subscription fee as well.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Eventually a game will come along that will 'kill' EQ, but that probably wont happen anytime soon. The game would have to be more than just a EQ clone set in some other fantasy world. The game would have to take the next step in the evolution of virtual fantasy - whatever that may be. EQ has established the trend, and all other games will only be ripoffs of EQ until somebody figures out the next groundbreaking idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Trena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I can't see EQ lasting except for people who's computers can't handle EQ2, or the addicts that can't stand loosing all their hard work.

<br />
How about those people who hate skill based character development? Or those people who have flashbacks of UO when they think of item decay? Personally, I think skill based &quot;trees&quot; are a gimmick since we all know it won't be long before the 'ideal templates' become known and everyone follows the same path because they want to 'optimize' their characters. Just like AA paths in EQ1 (what are the first 6 AA points spent on in EQ? Run3 and Regen3 more than anything else), people figure out what the best path is to take to make their character as versatile and independent as possible........and run with that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't think there's any ONE game that's gonna &quot;kill&quot; EQ1. If anything, it's going to be the proliferation of competing products splintering the playerbase and diluting the genre. No fewer than 12 MMOs are due to come out by the end of 2004. There aren't enough players to make all those games sport EQ-like subscriber numbers. So IMO, niches will form and we already see that happening now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've read all the public statements about what EQ2 will consist of.... EQ2 will not be getting money from me. There are a few other games coming that might, but EQ2 doesn't have a chance.<br />
<br />
And that isn't because of computer issues - computer upgrades are cheap if you do it yourself and don't go out and buy a whole new machine.<br />
<br />
It isn't about &quot;losing hard work&quot; - I've got no trouble giving up my characters and starting over.<br />
<br />
Its all about game design, and everything I have read tells me &quot;Stay away, its gonna be crap&quot;. See Trena's post for some of the reasons.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Korbis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">everquest has already died, really. it's simply not as active as it used to be community wise, and we will experience similar levels of declined user base throughout everquest 2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I prefer EQs graphics to EQ2s.  Why does every screenshot of EQ2 look like all the models were done with Poser?  It really looks horrible IMHO.  The terrains and fauna look great, but who doesn't turn that off so they can see mobs better and raise their FPS.  Not to mention, I don't want to upgrade my machine, just to find out that it's not gonna help at all(kinda like SWG).  EQ is going nowhere.  If you were earning millions of dollars a month, you don't just pull the plug.  Not until costs exceed income.  I think EQ2 is going to turn out like AC2, SWG and all the other MMOGs that have come, following DAOC.  No content, no one playing.  EQ is fun because of how much content there is.  If SOE ends up moving the instance technology back to the older expansions, EQ will become a different game, and in my opinion, better game.  EQ2 is going to suffer from lack of content, lack of balance and lack of maturity in the code base.  All of this is going to make for a rough couple years before it stands up on it's own and begins to even walk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gabus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dont think sony will pull the plug on EQ as long as its making money.. What I see them doing if EQ2 becomes a big hit, is condensing or merging servers to get a decent player base. It is expensive to maintain those servers for gameplay. If in 2 years they have 26 servers with 2500 players in peak time, they may merge servers to bring the servers back to the point where the playerbase = the required profit to run the server. High level content problem solved. Money problem, solved. EQ wont go anywhere, its much better than UO, and thats still running, heck, even &quot;The Realm&quot; is still running. No worries.. EQ will be around for a long time I believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's funny how anyone can say any game is based on skill.. which would mean people without this skill would not be able to play.. why would a company alienate a group of people.. ?<br />
<br />
What kind of 'skill' does a RPG!!! need? certainly not hand eye coordination, certainly not how fast you can press a button? <br />
<br />
IMHO people should get real and take these things for what they are, an entertainment outlet, no one says &quot;I finished watching lord of the rings III, woot! I beat lr3!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would you want to beat a mmorp game? or play a game that required hard work/skill? baking: you put all the ingridients in a pot with proper spices etc, then bake, BUT there is a little something that checks to see how well it is cooked, and so every 5 min you check it, and finally when you take it out of the pan, there is a random chance that your char will like the food and give you a skillup based on initial characteristics.. yeah sounds like fun.. <br />
<br />
It's probably just me, I still don't understand why people who have 500 to poision/disease resists, will grind another 6 aa to finish bertoxx gift, (naked resists?).. point being, if you want to work hard, do that in real life no?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Scurvey Pestilential</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">EQ1 is now nothing more then a testing ground for EQ2, anyone who can't see that is blind.  EQ1 is self destructing as the developers increasingly bow to the requests of it's player base.  Look at the pattern of each expansion, each one has a gimmik that they said would never be implimented in the past, because they would make the game unplayable.<br />
<br />
There is no room for EQ1 AND EQ2.  They don't want to have two average titles with average subscription rates, they want one leading title.  OK, EQ1 is still the leader right now, but the next generation of online games are nearly here.  Hence the reason they have the carrot of:<br />
<br />
&quot;It has been announced that subscribers to both EverQuest II and EverQuest will have access to special incentives including a special EverQuest II in-game reward; and crossover quest zones, allowing characters in EverQuest II and EverQuest exclusive access to hidden treasures. &quot;<br />
<br />
Just like it becomes necessary to buy each expansion in order to stay on a level playing field with your peers, it will be necessary to buy EQ2.  I don't doubt that EQ2 will be the best game around, they have 51 test servers to make sure they improve on the many flaws that are in EQ1.<br />
<br />
If you're an EQ1 addict, you won't have a choice but to buy EQ2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I can't see EQ lasting except for people who's computers can't handle EQ2, or the addicts that can't stand loosing all their hard work<br />
<br />
Bad spelling aside, I think you're underestimating the second group -- a LOT of people have a LOT of hours built up in EQ, and they'll tend to come back to it or stay with it based on that fact alone.<br />
<br />
My own experience with DAoC was kind of enlightening -- while I thought DAoC had a really good game, they were sorely lacking in content.  When I got bored with it, I stopped playing, and landed back in EQ, but I didn't return to DAoC when it got more content.  Why?  Inertia, mostly -- I had a lot invested in EQ still.<br />
<br />
Based on my pattern, EQ2 *might* be able to break EQ, but I don't think they'll do it right away.  I can envision this: EQ2 comes out, people play it, generally like it.  Then, the content wall hits.  Let's face it, EQ is HUGE, and any new game won't be close.<br />
<br />
A lot of people then migrate back to EQ, where they still have accounts thanks to the bonuses of having a double-subscription.  They keep going in old EQ until EQ2 adds more content in a few months, then hop back to check it out.  If they tire again, they may hop back to EQ, repeating the pattern.  Why not, right?  Your chat system works between games, and there's a direct benefit in being subbed to both.  The back-and-forth of players continues until EQ2 has sufficient content to get critical mass of guilds and communities, and EQ slowly dwindles away.<br />
<br />
If I have to guess, this whole thing under my scenario takes 3 or 4 years, by which time EQ is like 7 years old -- incredibly ancient for a game.  By that point, with scheduled improvements for EQ2, it will probably have won.<br />
<br />
I think SOE is being very very smart about this, they're leveraging their market share to try to be the only ones capable of unseating EQ.  Darned if I don't think they'll pull it off.<br />
<br />
Eventually.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">It's funny how anyone can say any game is based on skill.. <br />
<br />
Skill based games are ones where characters gain power by advancing certain skills (see diablo2, etc).  It has nothing to do with the player having &quot;skill&quot; in being able to play it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I wouldn't take EQ2 if it was free. For one thing, I don't want to <br />
overhaul/replace my PC every two years. Laglin taught me<br />
what &quot;improved graphics engine&quot; really means: more lag. I expect<br />
EQ2 will be at least as laggy, if not more; while they brag about<br />
their so called improvements. Also, I don't want to start from scratch <br />
again. If all EQ characters were wiped, I'd quit rather then start over. <br />
While I'm hooked on my guild and this game, no regrets, I don't see<br />
myself starting another like it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Personally I think EQ2 will have less impact on eq than alot of other games have had on it to date.<br />
<br />
To date I have 0 interest in eq2 from everything i've heard about it. No class's just skill based. Item decay. All sorts of other things I don't like in RPG's. On top of that add in that it's another sony game and odds are I'll never touch it. If Star war's galaxy is any indication of what eq2 is gonna end up being like I see a flop in the making.<br />
<br />
If I had to bet the only game on the horizon that has any chance of significantly impacting EQ would be World of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't it kinda funny about that. I was talking to a few friends the last few days asking why they still play EQ and what draws them. They didn't say fun, or progress, or leveling, or loot. They all said &quot;I put so much time into EQ I dont want to start over with nothing&quot; or &quot;I can't bear the thought of loosing all my spent cash into EQ w/ nothing to show for it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now i'm not saying there is anything wrong with playing EQ. I do on and off when the mood suits me. But how many people still have fun w/ EQ? And I mean fun that they can't have in a ICQ chat or IRC chatroom.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Karshak_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">I see the same few posters on here who lament how crap EQ has become, and how the devs have screwed the game into the ground, how it is just the suckiest thing ever invented, and that when you have finished time the game is done......<br />

The interesting thing here is that most of you are 65's with a stack of aa's. You seem to have played the game since inception and berate any who really enjoy it.<br />
<br />
What's the deal? If you hate the game so much why post about it? If you really think it sucks ass why think about it?<br />
<br />
If you can't find enjoyment in it move on, go do something you do enjoy, and be happy. Just please, stop badmouthing it to all and sundry, it really doesn't add any value. I read all the negative posts and don't think &quot;Wow, I think I will quit because these guys say it sucks&quot;. No, I tend to think, &quot;Why do these guys bother coming here anymore?&quot;<br />

It is constantly evolving, and I certainly have opinions about areas in which it could be improved, or how it has strayed from a better form of gameplay.  <br />
<br />
But it's huge, and deep and has so much history built into it now. <br />
<br />
Can it really be said to be &quot;old&quot;?  I mean, they've redone essentially every part of it.  Why can't they just keep doing that?  Periodically redo the graphics engine or whatever.  Big project sure, but less big than making a new MMPOG.  <br />

Eq does not have &quot;it&quot; any more. The game monopolizes on people's greed, lack of real life &quot;life&quot; (i/e the need to see your &quot;friends&quot;) and the drive to be the &quot;best&quot; (exactly what defines the &quot;best&quot; in everquest anyway?) <br />
<br />
You dont really &quot;win&quot; this game.  You dont have &quot;skill&quot; you have a lack of life. &quot;skill&quot; is only an illusion. <br />
<br />
what drives folks is your magelo, eqranker and other stupid things. Links, Lewts and flags. <br />
<br />
I've over the last few months really started to lose my love for eq. (player since beta here) because all the things that made EQ &quot;have it&quot; are for the most part gone. (true caring for your fellow player, team work in the truest form, more care for friends than advancement &lt;read flags&gt; ect) <br />
<br />
To me is sad.  I've dabled in Swg and all the things that made EQ great , is in SWG. You just have to lose the EQ mentality to enjoy swg. I fear the current mentality of EQ will carry over into EQ2... If it does, I wont stick around. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Rafeeky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">The cause of death for either of these games is lack of players.  Both games require player attendance to succeed with very few solo exceptions.  If a vast number of players don't jump to EQ2 then there will be very few groups and those who start playing will find little or nothing to do.  Without classes, the &quot;new&quot; player is limited to trying to exp to give themselves definition as to what they want their avatar to be.  This can be a viscious cycle that doesn't become enjoyable until the server population gets pretty large.  The same thing will happen to EQ if too many people cross over.  As long as they merge servers when this happens, they can regulate the population on any given server until the very last one.  I doubt it will ever get that small though.<br />
<br />
From my understanding, the MMORPG market subscription rate has leveled out compared to the mass flood of the old days to the genre.  Each new game that comes out takes a piece of this pie.  Sony's games are becoming ever increasingly group dependant.<br />
<br />
What happens if your new to the genre?  Basically you log on, look at all the pretty graphics and then realize their is absolutely nothing you can do.  Not to mention, your a total newb trying to explore a new game not realizing you have to wait until primetime to play because nutrinorat_01 owns you without 6 other people.  SWG is in this state of virtual gaming limbo at the moment.<br />
<br />
The official EQ2 website has stated that the banks will be made universal.  I'm sure item decay will probably get axed too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the introduction of Lost Dungeons I think that will change EQ enough to spark the life back into some semi dieing players and bring some back.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, like pointless wookie dancers and &quot;lairs&quot; (mounds of dirt) that you &quot;attack&quot; until a mob &quot;comes out&quot; so you can kill it and go back to &quot;attacking&quot; the &quot;lair&quot;<br />

I too was hoping this, but am not going to hold my breath. I did pre order it with the hope that it would bring back some of what made eq great to begin with. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shamad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">It's funny how anyone can say any game is based on skill.. which would mean people without this skill would not be able to play.. why would a company alienate a group of people.. ?<br />
<br />
What kind of 'skill' does a RPG!!! need? certainly not hand eye coordination, certainly not how fast you can press a button? <br />
<br />
IMHO people should get real and take these things for what they are, an entertainment outlet, no one says &quot;I finished watching lord of the rings III, woot! I beat lr3!&quot;<br />
<br />
Why would you want to beat a mmorp game? or play a game that required hard work/skill? baking: you put all the ingridients in a pot with proper spices etc, then bake, BUT there is a little something that checks to see how well it is cooked, and so every 5 min you check it, and finally when you take it out of the pan, there is a random chance that your char will like the food and give you a skillup based on initial characteristics.. yeah sounds like fun.. <br />
<br />
It's probably just me, I still don't understand why people who have 500 to poision/disease resists, will grind another 6 aa to finish bertoxx gift, (naked resists?).. point being, if you want to work hard, do that in real life no?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hmm, perhaps you didnt understand, or, perhaps you were being sarcastic...but when he says &quot;skilled based&quot; game he means just that. A game based on &quot;skills&quot; that the character is granted. Take a reference from EQ1, alchemy starts off at level 1, the more you practice it, the better it becomes, thus the more potions you create. It's not your PERSONAL skill, guy, it's the skill your character has practiced....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Merwenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">ive asked tons of people, most say they wont be moving to eq2, now once it comes out it might be a different thing. i also liked the reference to the AC2 and its &quot;success&quot;, which basically was a horrible horrible release. we'll see, and seeing from SWG's release, it might be something even similar to that.<br />
<br />
oh yea, and i hope you know, alchemy in no way starts at level 1, i think its 25 (if thats what you were refering to).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>uglytobone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">My prediction:<br />
EQ will be around for 20 years or more as a cash cow. The game that will drain the most players from the player base will be an interactive online roleplaying game that allows real physical stimulation of various sorts from hardware that reacts to ingame actions and which uses a display device that visually surrounds you by the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">I will move on from EQ some day. But when I move it will be to a system that has gone live, had people kick the tires, test the depths, and liked what they found. EQ is enough fun that there is no urgency to leave for something that is not substantially better.<br />
<br />
And graphics counts for very little, gameplay rules.<br />
<br />
SWG has hit reality and it looks craptacular. EQII is in the vague promises stage and not even those interest me much. The graphics has too many vertex's and too little style or interest.<br />
<br />
WoW excites me, I their sense of style and their approach to gameplay and testing, but it's still got to get the reality test before I consider it seriously.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">WoW will probably be the first new game I play at launch at least to try. <br />
<br />
When I found out they blew up Luclin in EQ2 that really made up my mind right there. <br />
<br />
Blow up my rock.... grrr I'll show them damnit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I'm looking at Horizons, along with:<br />
<br />
http://www.mythica.com<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
http://www.sigilgames.com<br />
<br />
So far Sigils still very hush-hush, so I don't expect anything from them until at least Q4 2005.<br />
<br />
Mythica looks really good to me - but I'm a fan of Norse mythology.  (It took DAoC's promise of Midgard to pull me away from EQ the first time.)<br />
<br />
Horizons looks really nice, and I have it on pre-order, but I'm not in the beta for it, so I can't say for sure.  I really do prefer a 1st person game though, so with Horizons being 3rd person, I'm just not sure about it.  Of course, they may add a 1st person camera perspective soon - it's still a work in progress too.<br />
<br />
I've been playing EQ since 1999.  I don't see myself going TOO far from it for a while unless something truly astounding comes along.  (I do hope that Mythica will be truly astounding.  I enjoyed ActRazor back ages ago... ), and I've got 3 or 4 different translations of the Eddas, along with a roomfull of other Norse history/mythology/lore in my library at home.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">It's not too late for then to scrape completely, remember UO2?<br />
<br />
If they keep making changes to the game like LDoN, I imagine EQ will be around for a very long time.<br />
I know many many people who have quit for a year or more coming back to EQ to try out LDoN</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u57"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p57">Skill based games are ones where characters gain power by advancing certain skills (see diablo2, etc).  It has nothing to do with the player having &quot;skill&quot; in being able to play it.<br />

I'd be interested in Mythica except that microsoft owns it. They tend to push companies to aim for the lowest common denominator...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">skill based sounds cool<br />
<br />
In pen-and-paper games with a good GM, Skill-based is really the way to go. It is very flexible, and lacking in stupid arificial constraints. The GM has all the tools needed to prevent the excesses that tend to occur.<br />
<br />
For MMORPGs, it is a disaster waiting to happen. One or Two sets of skills quickly gets identified as being &quot;The Best&quot;, and everyone takes them. If you don't, your character is considered to be &quot;gimped&quot;. Then the developers notice the problem and nerf that setup in some way. Within days, the new &quot;Best&quot; skill set is identified and every busts ass to get that set instead... repeat ad-infinitum.<br />
<br />
Then you run into another problem : in most skill-based games there is some absolute maximum number of skills (or skill points) which one can aquire. If the players aren't permitted to respend the points they had spent on their now-nerfed skills, the whining that ensues makes the stereotypical druid complaints sound like calm and perfectly rational discussion. If you do let them respend the points, all you have done is slow things down for a day or two.<br />
<br />
<br />
To make it work, the developers have to not only make sure each skill is fair and balanced, but that each combination is as well. To the best of my knowledge, nobody has managed to do that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">I always liked the rolemaster approach. You have levels. Each level generates a certain number of skill points. Your class determines how hard it is to buy skills. So Gandalf the wizard can learn to wield a sword, but he has to invest much more effort than someone with a background and talent in such things.<br />
<br />
WoW looks ok. Core skills are class based while secondary and color skills are class independant. Thus you shouldn't be able to make yourself hugely more or less powerful by minimaxing. On the other hand no two characters need to have exactly the same skills.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Horizons is a 1st person game, with the ability to run 3rd person as well.  Its very similar to EQ in camera abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pop is a hundred times worse than luclin.  With luclin, as always Eq adventurer's could travel together no matter the level, time on line , or other issues. They could still fight along side eachother, travel and see new things. <br />
<br />
PoP requires you to drop your life, pray for a good work schedule, give out your password, and other issues to get retarded flags that if you dont get, force you to be seperated from friends. It has driven people mad, tore up relationships because &quot;they gotta progress&quot; and leave people that actually do have a life behind. <br />
<br />
When you take away the stupid flags and just look at it for what it did for the game, I/E travel, drops and neat battles... yes it was better than luclin. However, you cannot ignore the issue's that flags have caused. It changed the way EQ works forever, and it was for the complete and total bad.  Them taking away the flags for certain zones was like putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound. Flags just need to go away all together to fix the social screw up they have caused.  <br />
<br />
I'm sorry but one minute SOE is screaming they want more social interaction, then they bring out flags that destroy's many people's social accomplishments. That my friends is hypocritical.</div></div><hr />
