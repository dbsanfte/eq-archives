<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thanks to everyone in guild and friends that helped out.  We took a lot of people down, and other than the initial pull, didn't have any trouble with the spawned VS at all.<br />
<br />
Here's some pics:<br />

Unfortunately, in our initial testing, Carnage would NOT stack with focus.  Soon as we dropped focus it stuck, and when I recast focus it overwrote.  Cong~ useless buff atm =/  Still costs and emerald too, absolutely no reason to use it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What's the effect?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nice 1hb, congratulations...shame about the effect though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">is there a walkthrough of this quest? I just looted bones from VS last night and want to get started :P<br />
<br />
what does carnage do?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do my eyes decieve me?! Range slot and usable by all shaman races, WOOT!  Time to work on iksar faction.  On a side note, nice dmg dly to build blunt with (or melee down a caster in a duel).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try here: http://www.championsofcabilis.com/skull8.html<br />
<br />
Carnage is a mini-avatar - 40 to stats instead of 100.<br />
<br />
Can we keep quest discussion limited to the quest forum though please? Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very very nice! Big congrats on getting that :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Daeneil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Ghanimaa your plain friggin rude to jump down Krodahs throat for asking one question for one simple link to the walk thru for this quest.  soo bite me.<br />
<br />
as for the weapon, id use epic or sprinkler of spirits or primal brawls tick over it anyday.  another 15 second cast time for a semi useless buff.  yay thanks verant.<br />
<br />
p.s. putting this into your ranged slot sucks too without ac why bother?<br />
<br />
<br />
p.p.s. yeah im PMSing so what =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mondinga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hah PMS'ing for tr00, thx comparing it to NToV and Sleepers ****.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I answered his question and politely asked that we ask quest questions in the quest forum in the future. Sorry that you read that as snotty or as jumping on his back, it was not intended as such.<br />
<br />
Have a nice day.<br />
<br />
p.s. comparing quest rewards to primal or the sprinkler of spirits is silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Krodah Dirtnappah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hehe no biggy I didn't take offense.<br />
<br />
with new forums everyone is gonna want to try and enforce certain standards, the problem is noone even reads the other boards.  <br />
<br />
until that changes most everything is gonna be discussed here<br />
<br />
thanks for sticking up for me though Dae /hugz</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yeah, the effect is mini-avatar ... 40 instead of 100, still costs the emerald &gt;&lt;  But at least no recast time on it, so you could theoretically put it up on several at a time (lasts 6 mins I believe).<br />
<br />
Btw, there are a lot of people who can't farm sleepers / ntov constantly sir, for those of us out there, it's a quite nice weapon.  Fair bit of hp in your range slot as well.  I'm currently at 1073 ac unbuffed, swapping this for my goranga idol gives me a few more hp at the cost of like 12 ac, which is 1060 or so ... There's very little difference in ac if I don't drop under a 50-marker.  I'll swap back to an idol when I get closer to 1100 I'd imagine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Cradossk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Nice work Cakaris</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Plus, it looks really cool.</div></div><hr />

Plus, it looks really cool. <br />
Yeah, almost cool enough to make me consider raising faction in cab and doing the first 7 quests. Almost... :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spitulski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Most interesting, congratulations =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Ator Fer'Lomarcan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This is actually a very nice range item, would rather use this than most stuff out there. We are doing NToV but could be a long while before I get a serious upgrade for the range slot.<br />
<br />
Anyone point me in the direction to find ways to increase faction so I can do this? I am a barbarian.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Ator.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Ok, kill in seb til max legion of cab, then go to this certain guard in FoB(right side one) and take 5000 bone chips (no joke) and give him them 4 at a time hehe.</div></div><hr />
