<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LISIMBA_SHAKIR</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Recently I heard the the iskar brodling now spawns in a temple in fear and is on a fixed spawn  point. So you can jus run in there kill him get tear and gate out , and he is on 60sec timer. <br />
<br />
Any validity to this or jus wishful rumors?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">About 1 month ago this wasn't changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cappi Aprile</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Rumor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I remember correctly this was the original way the broodling was setup. They then changed it to a triggered spawn linked to the two named golems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>kowalsky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">on last POF raid 2 weeks ago the iksar child still spawned from golem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Speaking of this, would anyone on Tholuxe Paells be kind enough to lend aid to a fellow shaman trying to get his epic? I'm still on the part where I have to kill Kirn in the hole, but I figure since guilds seem to raid PoF a lot, and this seems to be the hardest part for me, perhaps I could get some help with it. :)<br />
<br />
I'm a level 55 Shaman btw. I don't think my guild has enough high level people to do the PoF part. We might be able to do the hole if some other of my friends help. We could probably do Nek in CoM with some more help of my friends.<br />
<br />
I started my epic a loooong time ago, mostly did it solo(except the hard parts - Thanks again Oak for helping me with the black dire. :) ) and I figure it's time to finish it - if I can.</div></div><hr />
