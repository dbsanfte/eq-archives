<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wolf Shadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The rain pattered onto the roof of the Foxglove Inn, beating in time with the wild pace of the womans heart. She looked out a nearby window her heart racing infear. If they caught her she was done for. Shamans weren't allowed in these parts.<br />
 Her slightly pointed ears perked with fright when she heard the inn owners southern drawl. <br />
 &quot;Why shure. We gots' us a knew 'un today. A finer lassie oy never did see. Right afeared a somethin she was. Come shootin in that there door like the dark angel Lucifer hisself was after her. She rushed in an' said her name was Peony. Peony Mryhh. Now ain't that a strange name? Named fer a flower an' a herb.&quot;<br />
 Slowly Peony turned to stare at the man standing in the doorway of the Foxglove Inn. Her heart beat wildly in fear, her mind screamed for her to run, jump out the window if she must. Only she had to escape him.<br />
 As if sensing her eyes on him the man turned to stare at Peony. His eyes were swirling black depths of pain,anger,and hatred. Mostly anger and hatred. His long raven black hair swung as he walked towards her. A strained smile plastered on his lips.<br />
 Peony needed no more urging she jumped from her window seat and straight out the window. She heard the man cursing a blu streak behind her but dared not look. She ran as if pursued by devils. Her bare feet slapped the wet ground as fear, and yearning gave her the ability to escape.<br />
 A second after feeling the wieght of a hand on her shoulder Peony heard a gruff voice, &quot;You canna run from me,lass. I'm yer brother.&quot;<br />
 &quot;I know and that's why it huts me to do this to ye.&quot; Peonys foot shot out behind her catching her betraying brother in the groin. &quot;I never liked ye any way.&quot;<br />
 Peony shot like a bolt from her brothers weakened grasp and into the woods in front of her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 &quot;They'll find you!&quot; he shouted at her receding back.Peony didn't even spare her brother a glance as her feet carried her into the woods, past thickets full of deer, past rabbit holes and fox dens, through thick undergrowth and even thicker vines.<br />
 Tears streamed down her weary cheeks. One more town she could never show her face in again. Peony looked up at the dark sky that loomed above her. Rain mingled with the tears that stood on her face in streams of salty water.<br />
 Why did she have to be born a Shaman Child? Why couldn't she have been born without talent like her brother? Why did she have to be the only Shaman Child born in the last century? Why did it have to be her?<br />
 &quot;Because you have the passion, the care, and the strength to be what we need.&quot; the voice echoed in Peonys head.<br />
 She spun around so fast that she threw the young man standing behind her off balance. He landed in a puddle of mud. Peony glared at him.<br />
 &quot;Lucifer take you!&quot; she snarled as she held out a hand to help the young man up.<br />
 &quot;He can't.&quot; said the young man.<br />
 Peony glared at him, her eyes searing depths of pain,anger,and raw strength.&quot;And just why can't he?&quot;she snapped, anger evident in her stiff form as she turned and began to walk away from the man.<br />
 Peony heard a musical laugh behind her before a wiff of black smog began to uncurl in front of her, uncurl into the figure of a man. Suddenly the smog cleared and before her stood the young man. Her head snapped around behind her to where he had been standing.<br />
 &quot;He cannot take me because I am he.&quot; said the young man.</div></div><hr />
