<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I heard you could fear kite basaliks at level 35+ and some other animals. I am a little worried because I don't want to screw up my faction in this zone. Could anyone conjure up a guide that would be from minimum level to maximum level for this zone.... though the EXP might be rough at some levels, and other zones are better for EXP, JPF is a ranger/druid zone, ... so I would like to roleplay some. Thanks a lot in advance =).</div></div><hr />

Delete this post please. I don't know how I got this chopped up one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In Jaggedpine, I don't know about the Basilisks, as I never screwed with them. What I did was pull Griffawns to the village and kite them. Guards won't attack them and just fear off any adds. That works until around level 40 or so when you can take the occasional Griffon with some trouble. I could also take one anaconda, but I ended the fight oom and half dead, so I don't recommend that one. <br />
<br />
After 45, very few Griffawns will con dark blue, and if you can get a Lupine Dagger, do so. Wolf Form is your best friend here as it reduces the aggro range of the flying birds for adds, and makes everyting but Potameids, Poachers, and Gnolls indifferent. Also, while in Wolf Form, Anacondas will not add, so that's a bonus too if you decide to go after them. <br />
<br />
Whatever you do, DO NOT kill Wolves, bears, or Panthers here. I don't know about Dryads, as I am indifferent to them, so I didn't ever attack one. Wolves, Bears, and Panthers will ruin your zone faction here badly.<br />
<br />
Right now I find myself killing 4 or 5 Griffons to every dark blue Griffawn that pops on track. I don't touch the Gnolls because this is my solo zone, and I don't touch the Potameids either. <br />
<br />
Good Luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Lena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Dont touch the potameids solo.  They cant be snared or rooted and run at sow speed.  <br />
<br />
There should be plenty of griffawns that are blue to hunt to 45 or 46, then hunt griffons  exclusively to 50, then start on the snakes along with the griffons.  The snakes are much harder and not worth the time and effort til 50 IMHO.  Get an iksar regen BP and maybe an acrylia blackened halberd and you will be able to kill nonstop with very lil downtime to med.<br />
<br />
The snake and grifs are decent to 54 at least and I hope they are still dark blue at 55.   It does slow now, and I get maybe 1 and a half blues, 2 blues if everything is right, an hour at 54 there.  <br />

<br />
But the panthers do not have a big faction hit here at all.  It is frigging TINY!  When you spend time here fear kiting panthers/bears/wolves, make sure that every so often (once a week or so) you get into a group doing the gnolls or poachers, to repair any damage you've done by killing the animals.  <br />
<br />
The animals are on two factions; both of Jaggedpine : Critters and Residents.  Residents is the town, critters is the animals.  Critters bottoms out at amiable.  Residents, I'm assuming, bottoms out in the KoS range, but after going halfway through 54 on the panthers I'm still not there (though I'd had a couple gnoll groups too).  <br />
<br />
It does not take long to fix faction with the Residents, so don't worry about the faction hit by killing animals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaelyn DiMathe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While bears/wolves are not on the menu, Panther certainly is ;)  After hitting 54 and realizing the hell it is, decided to try killing panthers rather than griffons or anacondas.  They're not too bad for experience.  I'm currently getting 1% xp at 54 every 2.5 panthers (compared to 1%xp every 2 rats in PoJ).  Plus, you can chain kite them, as there are always a ton of panther's up, and they seem to go down faster than the anaconda's.  Loot is terrible, but you're not in JPF for the cash.<br />
<br />
As for faction, after making it 92% of the way through 54 in the last 3 days, I'm still indifferent.  I do take out the named poacher's whenever they are up, and if I'm near the bandit camp and a group there is killing them, I'll plunk an arrow into the one being killed for the faction hit.  So far noone has cared that I've done this.<br />
<br />
So, panther's are a great option, and at 54 they don't add...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As far as Basilisks go, you can do them pretty reliably as early as 31 or 32.  Maybe even 30. They can be feared with Panic Animal, and don't give any faction hits.  The only ones that will aggro or that are social are the Genitors - and they also have eggs that can be sold for a few gold, or used in Baking. <br />
<br />
To find them, go to the caves on the West wall of the zone.  There's even a bank and some merchants there, if you haven't killed any of the Brell Gnolls there.  <br />
<br />
I found it kind of boring after one level, unfortunately.  Kind of like Highpass Keep, or whatever it's called.  Sure, nice experience, convenient, but kind of mind-numbing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spidaaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Basalisks are great exp, i started them at 30 and killed them all the way to level 40 (when they LB) no factions, merchants 5 secs away, not social (genitors excluded) (rare) and theres the orb to BB a stones throw away inc ase of trouble. then i moved onto WL tiger raptors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks for all your help! I am still level 34 because my computer has been broken for a long time .... I should probably check JPF out. I think I am going to skip the Basaliks and go straight to the Griffawns. Pull then to the town and fear off the adds. Now I should stick with the Griffawns until 40? Then move on to Griffons until 54? Then take out Panthers? It gets foggy passed killing Griffawns. Please reply. But THANKS a lot for posting and caring.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dory</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Unless you are uber twinked the griffawns will tear you to pieces at 34. Probably will even if you are.</div></div><hr />

Griffawns, if I was still playing right now, would be my main source of XP at 43.  Griffons take a lot longer to solo and have the potential to cause a lot more damage.  I get XP much more efficiently with griffawns.</div></div><hr />
