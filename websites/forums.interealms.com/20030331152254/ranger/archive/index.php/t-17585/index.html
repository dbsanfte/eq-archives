<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This has got to be the Great Spelling Booboo of 2003, and we're not even through January yet. Everywhere I look people are doing this. It makes me think half the world slept through spelling/grammar class and makes me wonder about our education standards.<br />
<br />
It's A LOT, not ALOT, dammit!<br />
<br />
If you really can't remember to leave the space in there, use the old-lady-english-teacher phrase: &quot;There is a lot of space between &quot;a&quot; and &quot;lot&quot;.<br />
<br />
FYI - the word &quot;alot&quot;, which is really &quot;allot&quot; misspelled, means to give a certain amount of something. (i.e. I alloted ten minutes for my speech.)<br />
<br />
This wouldn't bother me so much if it were isolated cases, but lately it seems nearly everyone using the Net or any message board I visit has had this word engraved into their brain as the proper way. ARGH!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Riudi Oaknoggin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I know I've done that alot of times (/snicker) :D<br />
<br />
KIDDING, yes bad grammer is getting worse it seems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rogan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I had trouble with that for a while too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">how about a lot of land, or is that a abbreviated version of alotment(spelling?)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Katalaeia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yuma, as far as I can tell, when referring to a piece of land, it is in fact a shortening of allotment, but you would still say, &quot;My parents bought the empty lot down the street.&quot;, not, &quot;My parents bought the empty allot (or allotment) down the street.&quot; The latter just sounds goofy to me.<br />
<br />
Of course when referring to land or anything else context is important. If you wanted to say that your parents bought a huge piece of land, you would say they bought a lot of land. By the same token, if you wanted to say your parents just acquired some new land, you would also say they bought a lot (meaning allotment) of land. The context of the surrounding sentences would determine the meaning of &quot;a lot&quot;.<br />
<br />
Maybe that was a rhetorical question  or a subtle tease, but I answered it anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Elured</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I do try to spell everything properly...<br />
<br />
As long as I can understand what someone means, and it's not some annoying d00dspeak, then it's okay by me.<br />
<br />
Every language evolves over time, including adopting the &quot;misuse&quot; of words as proper use.  There is a great difference to me between &quot;alot&quot; (a long-standing word in the U.S.) and &quot;u prt me&quot; (a sign of laziness and possible oncoming coma).</div></div><hr />
