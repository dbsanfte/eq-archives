I thought I'd try to find some cripple parses.  This is the best one I could find doing a short google search.<br />
<br />

<br />
I was wondering if anyone has the new cripple and has had a chance to parse its effects?  <br />
<br />
The above thread seems to indicate that putting the full spread of attack debuffs, cripple, weakness, etc.. adds up to 33% reduced dps of the mob.  Cripple+Asphy.+Weak alone showed a 14% reduction.  As to whether these parses are valid or not, dunno.  <br />
<br />
If the above is true, then the new cripple should amount to about a 7.5% dmg reducer alone.  Depending on the mob's dps and battle duration, it might be worth casting for its cost.  The parse also showed that reducing the mobs AC by about 64 resulted in the single melee increasing his own dps by 5.  <br />
<br />
I setup a log parser, so when I get the spell, I'll try to parse it a bit.  But if someone already has it, a quick parse or two would be much appreciated.</div></div><hr />

Did you notice further down in the thread there was a post that seemed to say that the original poster's figures were off by half?  If I understand what the correction post is trying to say, it would roughly double the effectiveness of those debuffs.<br />
<br />
Wonder if the older debuffs are as or more effective on  Omens mobs as they are reported to be on PoP mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>maccuul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I havent parsed it no but I can say that the new cripple does seem to have a noticable effect. Have had Clerics comment that healing got easier when I was using it and complain about mana when I didnt :)<br />
<br />
I did find a wonderful stacking bug with the cripple line though that maybe Grimbear can point out to the Devs if he catches this post.<br />
<br />
If your fighting around Shaman mobs cripple gets a did not take hold message quite often.<br />
<br />
There is also prblems with chanter haste, aego line, and dex buffs....<br />
<br />
Frankly that doesnt make ANY sense to me that it stacks with our entire agility line but not a haste that adds agility, not does it make sense for say a level 3 ac buff to block my 66 debuff, let alone any ac buff blocking it.<br />
<br />
I checked and Fo7 blocks it as well but diaku also a dex buff does not.<br />
<br />
I havent fully tested what sticks and what doesnt when buffed with what but the stacking problems definately make the entire cripple line less useful and I cant think of a reason why Cripple shouldnt just debuff them without any stacking issues with buffs just other debuffs maybe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ya, I noticed that, but 33-50% just seems way to high a debuff value for dmg reduction.  Not saying its wrong, just didn't have the time to check the math and it seemed high.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">People need to realize that the &quot;new&quot; Cripple isn't anything special. It's not debuffing anything the old Cripple didn't.<br />
<br />
Check out the numerical differences between the 2 spells:<br />
<br />
old Cripple:<br />
 <br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease DEX by 58 (L53) to 75 (L70) <br />
2:  Decrease AGI by 68 (L53) to 85 (L70) <br />
3:  Decrease STR by 68 (L53) to 85 (L70) <br />
4:  Decrease AC by 30 (L53) to 36 (L70) <br />
<br />
new Cripple:<br />
<br />
Slot Description <br />
1:  Decrease DEX by 100 <br />
2:  Decrease AGI by 100 <br />
3:  Decrease STR by 100 <br />
4:  Decrease AC by 39<br />
<br />
The new Cripple debuffs: <br />
<br />
+25 DEX<br />
+15 AGI<br />
+15 STR<br />
+3AC<br />
<br />
In other words, nothing to expect wonders from in there.</div></div><hr />
