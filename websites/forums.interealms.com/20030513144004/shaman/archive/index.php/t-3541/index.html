<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">VI just announced that all pets may soon have their resistances altered to be exactly that of the caster who cast the pet (on Test now).  <br />
<br />
What I am wondering is how this affects the ability to have Mage fire pets tank Rak.  Fire pets have always been immune to fire attacks (or at least had VERY high resistance to it) but now if they (the fire pet) has it's owner's fire resistance then that would mean it will likely get eaten up by Rak.  I'm wondering if this will be the case or will the fire pet still be immune to fire based attacks.<br />
<br />
I am not quite that far along in my epic to where I have done this part yet.  Therefore, I am hoping the fire pet strategy for killing Rak still works when I get to that part.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on the subject?.......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">They updated it, and the pets will now use the higher of the pet vs. player resists.  So, fire pets will use their fire resists, and the caster's resists for the rest (assuming the caster has better than the pet's innate resists for all but fire).<br />
<br />
Worry not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>iamagator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">certainly good news indeed!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Absor also backhandedly mentioned that /pet report will give more information... like what 'effects' are on the pet... by which I think he means buffs and DOTs.  That would be a GREAT change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah it would be great, if you could actually read the text that /pet report produces! I don't think there's any way of changing the (dark blue) colour of the text :(<br />
<br />
I'm sure this will be fixed in the new interface though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">They have mentioned over the The Magician's Tower that the /pet report health color is being moved to the same color entry as spell casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The pet changes are great. The pet now hits for 53 max (probably every time, haven't summoned enough pets yet) and they indeed resist the same as me.<br />
I was in Ssraeshza Temple yesterday with a friend and the puppy resisted every Tigir!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">maybe i missed something but i wasn't really sure if the pet has set resists of what you have when you make it or if the amount of resists move up and down as you buff yourself and such. anyone catch how that works?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jonaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The latest patch changed the resists of the pets. Before pets usually had very low resists and couldn't be used against ae mobs. Now the pet in general uses the same resists like their master.<br />
<br />
You can read it here (http://eq.castersrealm.com/viewarticle.asp?Article=4414).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The pet resist change is fantastic! My pet used to be slaughtered by AE and was always been slowed and poisoned. Now he's rarely affected. Not to mention that I no longer need to keep resist buffs on anyone's pets. Of couse I'm not sure such high resistances really make sense, considering how low-level my pet is :-P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">galelor -<br />
The pet uses your resists as of the instant the spell lands, not the resists from when you summoned it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Which leads to the interesting conclusion that the pet's resists are undispellable by the MOB under attack.<br />
<br />
There's got to be a situation where that is useful.</div></div><hr />
