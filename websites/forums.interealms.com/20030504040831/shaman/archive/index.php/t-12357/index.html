<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildana.</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello question of Guardian Wurms and Elder Wyverns.  Doing the Veeshan's Peek zoneline, it seemed the wyverns were endless.  Is there some kind of seceret or am I just unlucky.  In two days , approximately 6 hours a day, we killed only four Guardian Wurms. When we first arrived at the camp, two Guardian Wurms were up and I found a wurm wandering soon after.  The next day when we logged on, there was a wurm up.  Im unsure if we were dong something inproper.<br />
<br />
By the way, we were 61 Magician, 56 Shaman and 55 Cleric.  Still no torpor but almost have enough funds to buy it :) but then I need Malo.  :(  Thank You ahead of time for any help available.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Guardian Wurms can spawn over a large part of the zone, not just at VP ent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gildana.</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ahhhh, ok thanks guess I'll have to bring my bard to run around tracking then  :(  is there any limits of where they will wander?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are at least 2 that path towards the Ragefire camp.  My warrior hubby and I usually try to tag them when we log in every evening.  You've got to hold their claws to get them back to ya tho.  Guess they are old and tend to forget why they were chasin ya ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>veggi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yup bring a tracker and pull to Rage spawn, did this last friday for a few hours. We got 2 guardians, first drop pox and mala, and the second drop my copy of malo !<br />
Hope getting torpor will be as easy for me :p <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I believe that Elder Wyverns are the PH for GW's, so any Elder Wyvern you pull and kill could result in the popping of a GW. A lot of it is based on luck too, so you could get some GW's quickly on repop, otherwise it could be a long time before they repop.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">To be honest I don't know if anybody has figured this out.  I spent about 6 hours killing elder wyverns and only got one GW to pop (2 GW's were up when we got there).  I did notice the ancient wyverns we killed were being replaced by chromos, who'm we did not want to kill for fear of getting KEI dispelled.  After awhile my track list was just full of chromos and we left.<br />
<br />
It's possible GW's have more place holders than just elder wyverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ive always just went to VP zone killed the 4 elder wyverns there and have had pretty good success getting a G wurm to pop in that tunnel. Drops success however has been a different story. I got avatar the first wurm i ever killed and havent seen a shaman spell since than. Actually gotten more shaman spells off the elders and some stuff around the area even if it was cann3 a few times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll  hear multiple things. I've killed 50+of them (Still No damn torpor malo!!!) and these are my observations.<br />
<br />
There are wanderers. They path all over the place but seem to stick in the northern part of the zone. Once dead they take a LONG time to respawn. Some people have been saying that it takes them 8 or 12 hours to respawn. I'm not sure about that. I think tis just that they have Elder place holders, and those roam too, so the place holders are rarely killed. Or if they are, its not 100% apparent that the enders only spawn more elders or GW's. Naywhas I tend to kill the wanders then forget about them.<br />
<br />
The GW's I usually kill are the ones right outside the temple. After killing the GW's and elder place holders, more elders and GW's pop. These are NOT on any kinda timer. Elders are a more common spawn than GW's though. Each time i clear the thing I'll get 0-3 GW's pop. Usually 1 or sometimes 2.<br />
<br />
Its easily doable with a melee and yourrself once ya get CH. Just kite it till its maloXX'd and slowed, send in melee and dog dog, heal, and use excess mana to dot. Try not to get agro :P<br />
<br />
It's also one of the most mind numbingly boring camps known to man. God I hate it. However I'll be going back till I get torpor/malo. The REAL problem with this camp is that a spell is not guaranteed to drop. I dont know how many wurms ive killed with nothing on them. Sigh. Wish it was like the Emp where you are guaranteed spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have been hunting GW's at VP zone.  There are a few Elder roamers, and they appear to spawn at VP zone too.  Keeping these all killed, and catching the roamers too I would have some GW's spawn and go into the roaming pattern too.  Same pattern as the roaming Elders.<br />
<br />
It did appear that they all spawned at the VP zone line.  Even the GW's that went out and roamed.  I didn't have a tracker, but I did catch a few GW's on their way roaming back towards VP.<br />
<br />
Been doing my hunting with a 61 SK and 59 Shammy that I two box.  I did have one that resisted slow 3 times in a row without first using Malosxxx.  So now I just kite them until Malosxxx lands and then get in slow.  The only difficult part, was if they were ones that were more resistant, they were resisting snares too.  Kinda makes kiting them exciting.  Only 14 of them killed so far (nothing good dropped), and only came close to dying once when the moron SK got out of healing range.  DOH, wait, I was playing both chars, nevermind.<br />
<br />
I was also hoping they would drop some of the new research components.  Nope, they dropped the research components for level 49 and below spells.  Majorly screwed up if you ask me.  So I put in a /bug report.  I just wish they would remove some of the lower level spells from them, and make their spell drop list more like the emperor's.  Way too many spells that aren't so rare on the list.  Still no malo/torpor/pox, so a few more days of GW's then I guess its time to go get locked in the crypt for awhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Been experimenting by tracking these bad boys.  Over a period of 2-3 days, logging my ranger in at the VP zone and checking track a few times per day, I've noticed that the GW's do not repop on their own.  Apparently the place holders need to be killed to give them a chance to pop again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Spent 3 days killing GW's.  Killed about 30 of them.  The Elders are the PHs.  I went for 4 hrs once, without a single GW pop.  And I also had 3 out of 4 pops be GWs.  On average I was seeing 1-2 GWs per hour.<br />
<br />
Of those 30, less than half dropped spells.  Sometimes it would only be wurm meat, or an old research component (not the new stuff), somtimes nothing at all.  Torpor dropped on day two of my quest, nothing else real good dropped though.  The spawn time/rate of GWs really does not make them good for farming spells.  Especially when you will go 3-4 hrs with no GWs spawning, and then they dont drop anything but wurm meat.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Been hunting wurms for about three months off and on, ever since I hit 60 in january.  Kill elder wyverns and eventually wurms will pop.  Mostly killed the ones at Veeshan's peak entrance as there are three statics and a roamer that spawn there.  <br />
<br />
Typically saw 3 to 6 wurms in a few hour camp of which about half would drop one or two 59-60 spells.  Quite easy with a full group and if you set up on the flat outside the temple you get enough adds to keep it interesting.  With a small group or duo I set up on the roof of Veeshan's peak entrance, near the mountain side.  <br />
<br />
Killed 32 wurms in various guild groups and it was getting to where it was hard to find volunteers ;). So I duo'ed with my wifes 60 monk the last couple of days, and had our 51 cleric parked nearby to keep us in Temperance and to rez us just in case...<br />
<br />
We are decently equipped but not uber by any stretch, both have epics and fully buffed she hits about 3700 hp, and I about 3500 hp (shaman buffs plus temperance). I strongly reccomend you try and get about 4k hp on your melee unless you enjoy really close fights ;). <br />
<br />
I would assist her and cast turgurs as she pulled into camp, I have malo but only have had two resists on turgurs in 38 wurms total, so havent been using it. I would then root the wurm, which kept me from being summoned then apply epic dot, and start the heal cycle, with canni 4 casts and stoicism as needed.  She used Ball's of Burlap Yarn to snare them at 40 percent or so. Best fight I ended at 80 percent mana, worst I was oom, and she used voidance and mend to last the last bit til it turned while I frantically canned for enough mana for chloroblast.   I would put avatar on her for the extras DPS before a wurm fight and we could take a guardian wurm down with her and alpha pet in about 4 minutes. <br />
<br />
<br />
After two camps and 6 duo'ed wurms Torpor dropped.  It was the first shaman scroll a guardian wurm had dropped in 38 attempts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I was kiiling GWs for 3 days running, each session between 3 to 5 hours.<br />
<br />
had about 8 to 10 GWs spawn and only 4 drop spells and the rest dropped meat grrr. Zero shammy spells<br />
<br />
Weird part, killed an elder wyvern and it dropped 2 spells on one corpse. Jacinth and a chanter spell lol<br />
<br />
just thinking about GW hunting now makes me sick lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Just spent the weekend at this camp, on and off. Gotten several shaman spells. Bane of Nife, Tali of Brute, Avatar and Torpor (WAAHOO!!!), along with several other spells. Scars of Sigal and Servant of Bones(I think).<br />
<br />
I just kept the enterance to VP clear. Every time something spawned in there, I knocked it back down and stole it's milk money.<br />
<br />
Got some mild entertainment, when a bard decided to use the area to swarm kite my camp away from me.<br />

few moments later<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Elder wyverns are phs, average one guardian wurm an hour if you kill them. Best spot to camp is left of VP entrance. Killed 100, making my own groups and got a few of the rare shaman spells. Torpor or sunstrike never dropped. Bought torpor for 40k, and then soloed a guardian wurm hehe. Boring camp.</div></div><hr />
