<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i am 56 atmo, and am stuck between geting to 6 aa points and geting to 57.<br />
<br />
I was loking forward to 56 and BON for so long, that i had done NO AA points.  I put point into regen now, but cant get enthusiastic about grinding to 57 as the spells are all naff.<br />
<br />
Did i miss anything here?  are there any pop spells for 57 ?<br />
<br />
maybe i not understanding malosini.. seems to be the same as molosi at 49??  whats the difference?<br />
<br />
thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Malosini is faster casting and no recast vs malosi. Nice little upgrade really when you use it. Also at 57 is group sta which is always nice since it's the one stat buff your regularly casting.<br />
<br />
58 is a pretty nice lvl with KM and cann 4 and you've gotta get threw 57 before you can get 58 =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jeradin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">As Taraddar said, Group sta at 57 is very nice.. and if you were not excited for that.. Cann 4 rocks, hands down. KM is a nice help till Mending also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Wait till 58 to play around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Pretty much just dinged 57 exping in PoD, Malosini ROCKS. Absolutely. Helps me slow much faster, especially if resists.<br />
<br />
Group sta - rules. Regardless of what others say, I have always sworn by agi too. Heck, I'm gonna put a point into innate agi :P (bite me flamers!)<br />
<br />
The smiths and MLers also love when I cast the 2 hour 30 min +68 str buff on them when it also stacks with Infusion of Spirit!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">56 or 58 are logical levels to pause for AA, if that floats your boat; 57 was not as big a milestone IMO.  My impression was the 56 was great because of Bane, and 58 changed life completely with KM.  Not only can you pass for a healer, but the self mana regen from Canni IV and KM is on a different level than before.  <br />
<br />
Personally, though, I think 60 is the right place to pause for AA, especially if your guild is not doing the tier 2+ planes of PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">manical strenght stack with HOS ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sowfor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">dunno, but it stacks with focus (if you have str on first)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">/agree, 58 was really nice for spells, 57 and 59 are waypoints.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>UbercyrusForbeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I had the same quesiton. About to hit 56 and really wanted to get the AA for my regen and mana... BON, speed and acumen (STA regen is something the tankers love) are the major drives for me right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>CrustyOldShaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">One reason for stopping to do AAs might be your gear: if you haven't gotten decent enough ac/hps AND you want to solo, then maybe doing AAs for a while would be a good idea.<br />
<br />
Otherwise get to 58 at least: KM and Canni 4 are mayor upgrades.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I'm aiming for 58 also before AAing. I'm drooling at the thought of KM and canni4. <br />
<br />
And yep maniacal strength stacks with HoS if you cast MS first. How long before that is fixed who knows :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kareck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">hmm MS stacks with HOS?<br />
<br />
I had a warrior tell me that casting Dexterity then Hos will stack, I said no it was fixed a long time ago. Then we tried it on him again he said both are there.<br />
<br />
I tried it on myself and HOS overwrote Dexterity, so what gives?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Mortal deftness the 58th dex buff will stack with HoS just like maniacal strenght does. Again it only works if you cast it before HoS and HoS isn't already up. Any dex or strength spell pre 58th I haven't seen stack with HoS.</div></div><hr />
