<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can someone throw out a link, thread or something on the way Shamans are to use those AA points please. I have not been able to find much on this and I am almost 2 lvl's away from 51. <br />
<br />
*Read the following in your best Pimp voice*<br />
How ya get'em sucka? whatcha supposed to do wit em' once ya got'em? Geb me da info, for I smack da taste outcha moudth!<br />
<br />
yea. word.<br />

foo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">quickly put, once you hit 51, you can officially change the way that you get exp.  By this, I mean that you can make it so that 50% of your exp goes into your regular experience pool, while the other 50% goes into your alternate experience.  Now, just remember that your alternate exp. goes up at a higher rate than your normal experience does, although I do not know the exact reason for this. <br />
<br />
Oh, and if you are wonderingg what to do with them once you get them, well...it's not that hard to figure out.  Every time that you ding (it is just like normal experience where it takes 5 whole yellows to complete a level).  Once this happens, you get a chance to put that point into one of the options under the general abilities.  You have to spend 6 points under that category before you can put a point in one of the archetype abilities (and you have to spend 2 points for any of the abilities).  Then to be able to use the Class specific abilities, you have to have spent 12 points in Archetype, for a total of 18 AA points first.<br />
<br />
All in all, if I am totally off topic on what you asked for, then I'm sorry, I'm at work at the end of my 12 hour shift and since i have the day off tomorrow, the time is slowly crawling by.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm in the same boat as Foo. I don't really know much about the AAs because I thought I'd wait till I hit 60 to put any points in to them. <br />
BUT when I go raid with my guild I've started putting 100% into AA becuase I dont' get squat for exp. I also put 100% into AA if I'm helping out somewhere where I'm getting really crappy exp but I'm killing blues and better. So now my AAs are adding up and I have no idea what to do with them and I can't find any good info on them.<br />
<br />
I saw a shaman the other day with 4 pets!!! I was like &quot;WOW&quot;! I felt like such a newbie! But the only AA pet info I found said something about your pet having the ability to wait before attacking? What's up with that??? <br />
<br />
Where's the AA info hiding? Am I missing something here?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">get 60 first....don't worry about aa's until then<br />
<br />
if you HAVE to get your first title...then go run3 regen3<br />
<br />
IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>foohealer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Valsuvious --- That was right on the money, That is more info then i have read anywhere else. <br />
<br />
<br />
What should a Shaman start with? I hear people talking about Run 3 for dungouns... I would figure Wisdom and healing are important... what are your thoughts on what you should start with and what you should not worry about till later?<br />
<br />
<br />
Henina --- I hear ya! <br />
<br />
Anos |phattie| --- I am not waiting till 60 to use stuff that I can use at 51. People always say &quot; you got plenty of time&quot; and I agree, I have plenty of time right now :)<br />
<br />
foo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">run &amp; regen 3, a little mental clarity, cann5... after that it is a matter of play style, but that should keep ya busy till lvl 60 anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The reason people say to wait for level 60 to get AA points is that at level 60, AA xp can be earned a lot faster. This is because an AA point is always a fixed amount of xp, and at level 60 the amount of xp you are getting for a blue mob is much more than you get for blue mobs at level 51.<br />
<br />
Having said that, do what you enjoy. I got a few AAs before level 55, and then waited for 59 to start getting more. When I obtained my level 60 spells, I made it a priority to get level 60 rather than accrue more AA points. I found getting &quot;Baron&quot; (6 points) at level 54 to be a pleasant diversion from levelling, but other people have different opinions.<br />
<br />
But it is most certainly true that you can earn AA much much faster at level 60 than you can at level 51.<br />
<br />
Oh by the way, the &quot;4 pets&quot; skill is called spirit call, and it's actually a Planes of Power skill - which means you have to be level 61 to get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Belsham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">With the possible exception of Run 3 Levels far outweight AA. At 59 you can get Cann V which then outweighs levels unless you are in a raiding guild. <br />
<br />
Wisdom is not an issue with Cann V and Torpor. HP is the thing to focus on for you toon. <br />
<br />
The best thing you can do for you Shaman is get lev 60, Cann V and buy Torpor (sell you sould if need be (your toons soul)). Then level directly to 65. After Cann V and 65 are obtained you can then pursue the rest of your aa. <br />
<br />
Your aa moves as though you are level 55 as long as you are killing blue mobs at 65 its the same aa exp as you would see off blue mobs at lev 55. <br />
<br />
Getting the rest of your aas early would be like being 35 and an extra 30 pts of regen but having to fight lev 50+ mobs. Levels far outweigh aa. Cannabalize is so ubber though you just can't pass it up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>ridgewall</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">the reason you gain more AA then other exp is because 1 aa point is the same exp as lvl 50 to 51</div></div><hr />
