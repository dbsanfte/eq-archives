<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was just wondering how much you laid out on getting your spells.<br />
Would be interesting to compare with other classes.<br />
<br />
My list:<br />
Malo 30k<br />
Tigirs 8k<br />
Pox 10k<br />
oops forgot the 8k for khuras<br />
Total: 56k<br />
<br />
(Looted the rest, but still don't have voice of beserker.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Avatar 5k<br />
Khuras Focusing 20k<br />
Primal Essence 15k<br />
Torpor - Fungi Tunic<br />
<br />
Fungi was 40 to 60k at that time I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Avatar 3k<br />
couple of my group stat buffs totaling 4k<br />
VoB 4k<br />
<br />
I have all my spells now including both ancients.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Katla SZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Answering in shape of Mums, pretty troll oracle from Saryrn<br />
<br />
Torpor 35k<br />
Malo (looted before I hit 56!)<br />
Pox 10k<br />
VoB and few group stat buffs in a bunch 5k<br />
Group focus 5k<br />
Avatar and Bane looted as well :)<br />
<br />
...never got Tigir to drop (and win roll), and didn't find it for sale even once for more than a year as Oracle... Haven't been searching after the drops were changed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Torpor  93k /bow /cry ALOT<br />
No Malo still<br />
Khura's 5k<br />
Pox my old guild gave me a spell surprisingly.<br />
<br />
 but instead gave torpor later to another shaman who claimed she never even asked for the spell, and bitched that she wasn't getting loot anymore very shortly after winning torpor. /guildremove atrapost<br />
<br />
and all this happened including giving me pox while my offer for 93k+ for torpor was open to the guild to find for me to purchase or anyone on the server. apparently my guild was more interested in the greedy shaman than the one that saved up enough to buy it and sold important gear he had earned to get the spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You forgot 100k+.  I've been collecting for a few months so some of these reflect the pre-Bazaar rarity.  My guild doesn't do Kunark dragons or things at or above that caliber, so I've had to buy just about all of em.  Some of these have been a while so this is just approximate:<br />
<br />
Pox - 25kish<br />
VotB - 35kish<br />
Torpor - 80k + item value ~35k (actual cost ~12k)<br />
Malo - traded items value ~80k (actual cost ~30k)<br />
Primal Essence - 10kish<br />
Tigir's - 8kish<br />
Acumen of Dar Khura - item value 20k (actual cost ~5k)<br />
Focus - item value ~20k (actual cost ~5k)<br />
Khura's Focusing - item value ~20k (actual cost ~5k)<br />
T of Raptor - item value ~20k (actual cost ~5k)<br />
Bane of Nife - 5k<br />
Levitation - partial trade, approx 20k value<br />
Cann 4 - gift from friend<br />
Bear Form - gift from friend<br />
Everlasting Breath - gift from friend<br />
...and the others all less than 2k each.<br />
<br />
Still missing Remove Greater Curse and Avatar (and the 2 ancients and no drop avatar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">1-10k here<br />
<br />
Looted/got from guild Tigirs, Avatar, VoB, BoN.<br />
<br />
Bought Khura's focus 3k and Focus 500pp<br />
<br />
Still don't have Malo/Torpor/Pox so expect that number to change soon :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Malo: 40k<br />
Torpor: 18k (lucky)<br />

Tigir's, Bane, Brute, Cat: free<br />
<br />
Don't have Avatar, Primal Avatar, Primal Essence, any Remove Curse, Levitation, Everlasting Breath, Acumen of Dar Khura, Raptor, or any Ancients.<br />
<br />
Total looks like 87k.  The ones I don't have, I'm not willing to pay much for.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Malo 8k and a GEBS(lucky)<br />

Still lack of torpor, pox, tailsman of raptor, etc...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bearform = 5k (days after it went live...I had to be a bear, just had to be)<br />
Avatar = 1k<br />
Malo = 90k (I paid 45, guild paid 45)<br />
Before anyone gets ****ty about me paying 90 for Malo, I engaged in 2 price wars with Watchers, a guild on Brell. Those bastards even went so far as to send me tells in game to say I should keep out of the auction because they would pay whatever it cost to make sure they got copies (note the plural) of Malo<br />
<br />
Anyway, my guild leader at the time pulled a few strings I think and won. Might have had something to do with the fact that we don't try and behave like uber pricks ;)<br />
<br />
I looted everything else, or my guild looted it for me.<br />
I dont have Pox yet and dont see that being a problem.<br />
I have the PE hammer so aint interested in getting that.<br />
Group acumen would be nice, simply as a dummy buff for Dispellers.</div></div><hr />

Take note, when I dinged 60 all the spells I had were avatar and FoS. Took a while to get them all, but patience and being a good buffsloot for many guilds paid off.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Malo was 40k<br />
Torpor was a gift from a friend<br />
Bane -- Looted<br />
Pox -- 7k<br />
Tigir's (either looted or purchased for around 7k)<br />
Group Focus -- 8k<br />
Avatar -- 5kish?<br />
VoB 3k<br />
Componetless EB -- Looted<br />
Componetless Levi -- Missing<br />
Primal Essence -- Missing, saw it last night in the Bazaar for 30k.  Does it chap anyone else's hide that someone is trying to sell me a fricken buff for 30k?  So I should pay 30k so I can make me tanks happier?  *gnashing of teeth*<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks to me like a level 60 shaman could easily spend 100k to 200k on level 56-60 spells.  Seems like we have more spells than other classes that are selling high.  I've seen malo recently for 40k, Torpor used to be 40k, but folks on the Nameless are claiming to sell it at 75k to 100k now.<br />
<br />
SisterLi Salvation<br />
Got Plat?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Agendon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Same on SolRo...all those nerfed Wiz are pulling theyr Torpor/Malo and White Dragon Scales out of the Bank to sell them way overpriced since they now get much rarer cause no more Wiz are farming Kunark Dragons anymore (rofl)!
