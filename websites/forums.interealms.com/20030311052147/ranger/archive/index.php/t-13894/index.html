<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ariaya</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
Well, I cruised through the message boards as I'm looking for places to hunt.  I'm happy grouping if groups are releatively easy to find, but I don't mind soloing.<br />
<br />
I'm asking for commentary on what I've found or any other suggestions.  I've never been to most of these zones.<br />
<br />
Overthere - I've never been there .. no clues <br />
Crystal Caverns -- Orcs? in a group?<br />
Eastern Wastes - fearkiting<br />
Iceclad - Fearkiting cougers or wolves<br />
DSP - I'm there now and really sick of watching the back end of zalnicks.  Tribals are fun though.<br />
Stonebrunt - I have an issue with getting there ... I tend to fall into holes :-(<br />
Great Devide - Tizmacks? Kodiaks?  I hunted Kodiaks for a bit and they hit HARD!  Can they be feared?<br />
Jaggedpine - Basilisks<br />
<br />
Did I miss anything?  Your comments would be much appreciated.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Ill offer what I can.<br />
1. OT - been there, its ok, but not great, didnt spend a lot of time in that zone, better are around.<br />
2. CC - Yes, do orcs, you may be able to solo at 35 if you are careful, pull to the town side of the mines. The pulls are easier there. This whole zone is fun and I had a great time.<br />
3. EW - as with CC this is a fun zone. I used to interchange between EW and CC depending on my mood. Walrus's are about the best thing to kill here, if you canfind a good group do the Rygorr orcs.<br />
4. IC - Never did it, couldnt see the point, I was happy with EW and CC, plus I hate dervishs and that zone seems to be full of them.<br />
5. DPS - dunno<br />
6. Stonebrunt - Great place but can be pretty boring. Pick your spots carefully.<br />
7. GD - Kodiaks are great if you have a partner that can heal, they hit hard but otherwise are easy to take down. (or am I thinking Ulthorks, cant remember now, hehe)<br />
8. JP - I love this zone, but I dont go here often.<br />
<br />
On the whole I loved CC and spent ages in this zone, pretty much stayed until it went light blue. I still go and revisit nids and spiders every now and again and still get some exp from them.<br />
Go there and learn the zone, it has so much to offer, especially if you couple it with EW. If you have a partner (like a Druid) you are on easy street for the next 10 levels at least.<br />
JP is a fun zone to break up the monotony a bit, same with stonebrunt. The others I wouldnt really bother with.<br />
<br />
Oh and if you are going to go to CC then I strongly suggest you learn how to make the Thurg gate potion, its extremely handy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It explains DSP 35-39, four very short levels (if you know how to).<br />

&quot;The only thing a Ranger knows more about than where he is going, is how he is going to get there.&quot;</div></div><hr />
