<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shakasa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking to start day trading in EQ.  I have heard mention about this but what is the best way to do it?<br />
<br />
Are their particular items you look for? etc  Is it even worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Go for any item that moves quickly and is in high demand.  Ikky BP, PSC, SCHW, etc...   Most of the above get auctioned once whether it be buy or sell and are gone.  A lot of the times you can find people like me that are impatient and will sell an item for less than what they know it is worth just so they can get out of the auction channel and on with their lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Trade? I'll trade my soul for torpor<br />
<br />
Someone just /told me their boyfriend bought torpor 2 nights ago. I was paying 2x more than him! /cry<br />
<br />
I don't trade that often, I farm grey flesh sleeves in the grey (don't tell anyone :mad: )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Buy low - sell high<br />
<br />
Try and deal in items that are very popular and will allow you to turn a profit quickly, or items that are a bit obscure and may sell for more because of it.<br />
<br />
Look for good trades if someone doesn't have cash on hand.<br />
<br />
Make some sow potions to sell while you do it.<br />
<br />
Make friends with a jeweler or some sort of other tradesperson and see if you can get a commision for selling their stuff.  <br />
<br />
Dont auction all your stuff all the time, look for the desperate WTB auctions for stuff you have.<br />
<br />
See if you can't farm while you are day trading.  Getting stacks of pelts and silks can make you some extra cash while you look for a buyer for your PSC.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">My only bit of advice:  <br />
Try to fly below the radar.  Don't get a reputation for daytrading. I would even suggest buying with one char and selling with another.  Neither one should be your main, because once you get a ****ty rep it's gonna be hard to get into groups/raids, etc.<br />
<br />
Many people don't like daytraders, and will refuse to deal with you.  Daytraders have to buy low, and some people get burned up when they give you a deal and you turn around and auction it off for 2k more when they are still in the zone. <br />
<br />
I would rather cut a deal with someone who is going to be upgrading their own equipment.  If I'm selling to a player merchant, I want full market value for an item. <br />
<br />
There are a couple of traders like that on my server, I routinely ignore them because a) they don't offer enough plat for the few items I want to sell and b) they charge too much for the items I want.   They often buy and sell the same item in the same message (WTS Fungi 75k / WTB Fungi PST).  Bleh.</div></div><hr />
