<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Seremont</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious, after serveral hours LFG at 45, I gave up and logged my trader.  Seems I can solo low dark blues, but can't solo in Turg Mines due to adds and resists (the voices sent me there /shrug).<br />
<br />
Is it that nobody needs a 45 shammy? or was it just a bad night or two?<br />
<br />
Just curious I love my shammy but I'd hate to be stuck soloing things 5 levels below where I should be, taking 100+ mobs to level. hehe.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinedorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd head to the entrance to Dulak Harbor and solo Scouts at the entrance while LFG. Alternatively, you could hug the right wall until you get to the contraption that looks like a brew barrel and pull drunken sailors there to get &quot;an empty flask&quot; for the Stoicism quest. Good XP mod and good loot with the gem drops while you're at it.<br />
<br />
Don't worry about missing out on group invites. It happens no matter how good a player you are or what class you play. Just be glad you are playing a class that can viably solo at your level.</div></div><hr />

Well, the stuff I'm soloing is farther in in Dulak. The oceansomethingerothers...  Better exp than the scouts, very easy to single pull, and with the ones on the dock it makes for a perfect cycle with no downtime.  It's just the exp's slowed considerably since I hit 45. Tried Torg Mines like they said, but the yellows are too hard to solo due to resists and all the HPs those trolls have, hehe.  One of my failed group attempts was there when a ranger/pally team turned me down as a group mate. /BOGGLE!  Who wouldn't want haste, slow and buffs out their ears, plus a backup or main healer? <br />
<br />
Of course I've seen folks in their 50s there, I guess they're creatures of habit because they must get squat exp.  I guess I'll hang there til I hit 46 and then try PoJ entrance or something. Exp's still a bit less than 1% a kill, slow but easy.<br />
<br />
Thanks, any more advice is greatly appreciated!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kellenial</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't let the &quot;hotspot&quot; designation solely guide where you hunt. Most of the hotspots seem geared towards groups of that level, not soloing, although towards the higher end of the spectrum, soloing there may be possible. At 45, there are many places you can choose to hunt solo that are NOT hotspots. You won't get the same rate of experience as you did in a hotspot zone, but there may be other perks to it. It depends on what you seek.<br />
<br />
Another option is to be proactive with a group. Start your own. Use the LFG tool to find similar level people and ask them if they want a group. At 45, with average equipment, I'm sure getting two people between 45-50 with you and Torgiran Mines will be MUCH easier, especially if one is a tank. Many people are hesitant to try LoY zones, but if you demonstrate you know what you are doing, you'll make them feel comfortable with it as well. <br />
<br />
In any case, don't get discouraged. Grouping is there although it might be a little hard to find sometimes. Don't forget that at your current level, with average equipment, you can still solo fairly well...especially if you get slow to stick. Just try not to sell yourself short on what you can and can't solo.<br />
<br />
EDIT: As far as 50s soloing Dulak, at 56, I still solo the armory area, etc. The reason being is that, while I still get experience there, I'm also getting a fair amount of pp, gems, etc. Have you seen the price of shaman spells in the bazaar?!</div></div><hr />
