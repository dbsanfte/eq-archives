<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>woramorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Has any else got into seb with no key? I never did the quest and the portal in still worked for me :D :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My brother has been saying the same thing.  Apparently Howling Stones is the same way?  Not sure though.<br />
<br />
I think it's a bug, but we'll see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HS is the same? wow good thing i just got my key today :D<br />
Can a 56 shaman break HS entrance btw?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shenlon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ent is a lil interesting at 56, you might wanna try buffing up and leving yourself, clicking in then running the 2 wanderers over the edge then gate back out to the orb so that you don't have to worry about those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Can do at 55.  My partner LD'd on way in.  Maybe it was a fluke, but: root goo, beat down skeletons.  Torrent is excellent against them all.  HT hurts a lot, Kragg is a must on entry.  I got 1st skell down, got out pet, used him to absorb HT from 2nd sepulcher skeleton, kept epic up on goo and 2nd skell.  None of the golems twitched (like usual) and I had no adds.<br />
<br />
Ended with 20m and 35 health.  Close.    About 1 min after fight ended I had a devourer attack.  <br />
<br />
Am I the only one who thinks that they are what troll sperm would look like under a microscope?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naghite</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If you are a competent soloer, 56 is more than enough for ent.  Go in invis (not like you wouldn't), might get lucky with sperm instead of undead which makes it even easier.  If you don't move when you first zone in - 99% if time you don't get aggro and can select/slow first mob before a DT.  Just one FYI, unless they've fixed it, you sometimes get multiple dt's from one mob (most i've gotten is 3 at once immediately after one respawned on me), but usually it's as intended (1 dt per mob )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">need a key to get into VP still?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>astalus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hs still needs key just a fyi so does VP why theyt toook out sebs who knows to get people away from velks i guess</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">From what I've been able to gather, you still need the keys to get into seb and HS. You just don't need to have them on your mouse when you click to enter anymore, just having it in your inventory will do. That's the word I've heard from a couple friends anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">That was the speculation yes Jukax, but the original poster's post disproves that theory. <br />
I think it's a bug, otherwise they would have announced that the dungeons are no longer keyed as part of some sort of screwed up GM quest or something ghey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">We tested it by leaving key in bank and clicking on Sebilis orb and still zoned in fine.</div></div><hr />

Seb was the last haven for those 51-59 or so who could group decently and weren't a septic by-product of the LoIO &gt; FM &gt; OT &gt; DL &gt; KC &gt; Velks run away train of ineptitude.<br />
<br />
Now I suppose I'll be seeing comments like<br />
<br />
/Puller: INC 4<br />
/Path_of_least_resistance_type_01: ZONE! GATE ! SUCCOR !<br />
/Enchanter: Yawn<br />
/Rest_of_group: LOL at PoLR_01<br />
<br />
Man I wish my system handles Luclin better. HS is out of the question for my DE Enchanter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">To verify that Sebilis no longer needs a key, I ran my level 9 Iksar Necromancer over from Cabilis and zoned in.... He (pretty obviously) doesn't have a key, and made it in just fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">STill need key for HS. I checked it out after a friend was able to take his monk to seb with no key. MY warrior didnt at the time have the key to hs yet and i got the need  a key message. WAs like a day or two ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">is 2k buffed hp enough to hold on in the event i get HT'ed by both ent mobs?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">&quot;is 2k buffed hp enough to hold on in the event i get HT'ed by both ent mobs?<br />
<br />
Some variables in that question depending on how much fighting you've been doing before they pop or if your fighting when they pop etc. Also didnt always get back to back ht mob's in there. If your careful and watch the timing of when they pop i was getting ht'ed by them from about 490 or was either 580 or 530. Lvl wise number seemed like it should be 530 but i wasnt playing that close of attention to all the ht's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">News fom the fan fair was that keyed zones were going to check a flag on your character, rather than your actually having to hold the key.<br />
<br />
Presumably the flag would be set when you obtain a certain key, which you could then destroy.<br />
<br />
However this was all stuff planned for the future, so either some of the code has escaped intothe wilds of the live servers, or its just a plain old bug :)<br />
<br />
So I wouldn't go destroying any keys for now :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Sure hope they do this for places like ToFS it is crazy the number of keys you need to move around in some places. I just dont have the room to keep them all even with 10 slot packs in the bank and on my person.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">This will be sweet for retards like me who accidentally leave their keys in the bank a lot. :)</div></div><hr />
