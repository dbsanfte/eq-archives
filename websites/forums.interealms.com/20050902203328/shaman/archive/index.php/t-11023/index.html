<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">im currently 28, and in DSP, soloing most anything excetp the wolves, <br />
most of the stuff there are reds and yellows, with a few whites and blues.<br />
<br />
so far its been way too easy, <br />
is this the norm? or will it quickly change in the future?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Stays that way until 65. <br />
<br />
At 40 you'll be doing Frogloks in Sebilis.<br />
At 50 the exp flies as you smoke MOBS in POI.<br />
At 55 you can get to 60 on Emperor in Sebilis (Malo and Torpor ya know)<br />
At 60 It's tough, but you can get through trials with gimp mages, Monks and Rogues (Shaman PWN in trials).<br />
<br />
Then it's nothing but AA's and EXP by the basketload as you solo in tier-3+<br />
<br />
(The above was sarcasm btw)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Faern- I thought you were a complete idiot till I read the (btw msg lol). And answer to Ogath yes its normal to solo reds at those lvls when your twinked to hell. If your in leather/chain with crappy weapon and shield you wont be soloing yellows unless your buffed by high lvl peeps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ogath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well i am far from twinked, my main is a 49 monk, <br />
<br />
and i have a few slots that are empty, with kei i still dont break 200 wis, <br />
<br />
im soloing mobs that my monk couldnt take untill he was 42, <br />
and dinged 45 on, <br />
<br />
i just think its cool =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">yes, i'd think this is possible the root/rot method but not in teh face  method (i prefer 2nd becasue it increases offence skills etc and most importantly defense for free AC). All you really have to do it pull of a root then malisement or vice versa and slap on DoTs till mob is dead. If your dongi it with the in teh face method i'm very baffled.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kome_battle_shm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Solo with kei...yes it's normal to solo reds at this level with this buff.<br />
but no difference to solo reds instead of yellows for xp, except to lost your time with longer fights.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">KEI at those levels is better than being the most twinked shaman without kei.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stonienogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">kei + group aego + group focus = free solo xp 1-50 and all are easily bought in PoK with a couple hundred plat every few hours. But then that's not quite soloing is it? you could do almost the same thing for free if you group with a chanter and cleric, and help some of your friends out with leveling too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I’ve been pushing my kitty shaman from 19, trying to get to 34 and my first doggie.  When I was in East Karana I soloed blues, whites and yellows by rooting and nuking till they were low on hit points and then engaging them in melee. I moved to Netherbian Lair and fought up to yellows mostly by nuking due to the confined space. Now I’m in Marus Seru, again trying to melee when the mobs are at about a third health to work my combat skills back up.  My equipment is mostly hand-me-down low level items, including a lot of banded, but I can take a decent amount of damage at this point from yellows on down.  But I’ve not tried hunting reds.  Too many bad experiences in my past I guess. *grins*<br />
<br />
I can fairly easily gain a level a day this way, but that’s mainly due to KEI.  This spell allows me to cast a LOT more magic than I have any right to.  I might be able to fight reds too, but I don’t feel any need to try.  My current method is working fairly well.  Still, it’s nice to know I have a chance of facing a red should the occasion arise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Enkebesh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">KEI makes worlds of differences its like having regrowth with your monk (and then some more, considering the mana pool increase and wisdom bonus). Incidently monks with a fungi Tunic (permanent regrowth) can waltz through the lower levels with ease as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's the KEI.  I was playing my 20 Wizard, who I'd just set up with jboots yesterday when a yellow jumped me.  I took it out pretty easily, and decided, heck, why not a low red, and took it out with no more problem.<br />
<br />
KEI is a sick, sick spell.<br />
<br />
I could have taken them out without KEI I think -- a red drained about half my mana, give or take on the number of resists I got, but I certainly wouldn't have started doing it for XP without it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As Hagle said, try soloing reds in crappy gear and no KEI... good luck.<br />
<br />
KEI has made the game way too easy to level up a caster twink.<br />
<br />
I'm still dreaming of the shaman spell: Kodiak(pun) Endless Regeneration. A 2 hour+ HP regeneration(15-25 per tick). Ah the phat pp I could make off donations for that from melee twinks....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bah... we don't need that to make phat lewt whilst we have alchemy... enchanters are jealous as hell of shaman because of that skill and its pp potential...<br />
<br />
NERF ALCHEMY !!!<br />
<br />
(it's not as if it would make any difference to us after all)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd pay 100 pp for that spell. Any day of the week. I can see a market easily. <br />
<br />
And no dr00ds shouldn't get it. (Although they'd whine they should)<br />
<br />
Hint tho: If they enact such a spell (and I have my doubts) get payment up front.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This should prolly go into the tactics section .. but it goes good with this thread too...  :)  <br />
<br />
Ok, so I'm a newbie shaman, level 22 so far.. and a little new to the game (less than 3 months) But have played mage to 53 so far .. so I do have a good grasp of the game .. <br />
<br />
Wondering what kind of methods are used soloing post 24 ? <br />
<br />
 I did see a shammy soloing at the giant fort in BW, said he lost KEI so he was just meleeing with his bear, and was killing them almost as fast as I kill them with my mage..   maybe DOT / Melee combo?<br />
<br />
 I went from 1-22 meleeing so far, but pretty hard to solo it without using a lot of mana and medding so it's mostly grouping .. looking forward to a new 500 DOT at 24 though..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Our first 500pt dot isn't till 34 with scourge which is also unfortunately very slow, over 2 minutes to do its work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Kolte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yeah my bad .. :)    Getting ahead of myself .. <br />
<br />
but how could someone solo low reds then with just a measly 140 point nuke ?  I was in Echo Caverns and nuked a bogling  with mage that was killing me.. 670 hp's .. and he still had a bar of life left .. how could I possibly deal with that at level 24 ?<br />
<br />
I have that slime coated harpoon and only do like 20 to 21 damage .. and not very often .. with all buffs, even frenzy..  and my piercing is almost maxed..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Having KEI in the 20's isn't solo'ing. It's more like playing in God Mode. <br />
<br />
I remember back after initial release of the game with my first shaman. In the 20's I could solo (actually SOLO, no outside buffs or help) most blue con mobs and everyone thought that was uber as hell, because a lot of classes couldn't solo anything worth exp at all. How the game has changed.</div></div><hr />
