<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harvyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I've done as far as I can go with my small family oriented guild. (The books from CoM)<br />
<br />
Joining another guild &quot;just&quot; to get my epic isn't fair to them.<br />
<br />
What's a good way to find out which guilds are raiding fear and join them for the raid?  I listen to the /auction channel, but my ideas are running dry. I'll faction past the hole, since I don't want to bother other guilds, but I'd like to do the tear myself....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Canabull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Camp Cyndreela, the erudite necro at the mouth of fear.  Good exp until about 56 I think, and between you and your pet she shouldn't be a problem.  Make absolutely sure though that they have at least 30 peeps and a trio of clerics, cause most fear raids end up with druids as main healers.  Ask them first, obviously, and offer a sum of cash if you have it for the tear, say, 5k after you loot it.  BTW, if your small guild can handle Rak, then odds are that you all can handle the hole.  And since other epics go through there, you might be able to get them to go with you for their epics.  Plus the hole is AWESOME exp at any level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I used everquestraids.com to look up folks advertising Fear raids, and told everybody on /friends that I was looking to go up.<br />
<br />
And if you're a competent-to-good shaman and subtly let the raid at large know that you're interested in any and every Fear raid you can get to, you'll likely get invited by folks that don't use that site.  Old school networking works very well, I got 3 of my 9 Fear raids as unexpected invites from folks I'd raided with before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Look for a guild that has lots of shaman epics done, but few shadow knight epics. ;)  Guilds going in just to kill the Golems would probably let someone tag along &amp; get the Broodling.</div></div><hr />
