<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Molerum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Simple question really is it at all possiable to get the chain for thurg armour to drop from giants nt to far into Kael from either WL or EW entrance.<br />
<br />
Am a 52 shammy just come back to game and guildless , Poor items, and no money so buying MQ righting is oput and i dont have a guild to help me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Slissia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Never seen chain drop anywhere but the arena for me.  Don't think you will see any on the mobs near the zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">In theory, you can get armor drops anywhere in the zone. In practice, the farther from the zoneline you get the better your odds.<br />
<br />
At the WL zone I have have seen Leather Boots (once) and Leather Bracers (several). That is it, though I have every reason to believe that more than that is possible.<br />
<br />
From the static mobs in the Bank area I have seen, in the last month or so (I solo there with my Mage quite often - tolerable XP, fixes CoV hits I take raiding, and Armor drops are a nice bonus):<br />
Chain BP<br />
Chain Legs<br />
Chain Bracer<br />
Silk Robe<br />
Silk Bracer (x3)<br />
Leather Cap<br />
Leather Legs<br />
Plate Legs<br />
<br />
I have only seen armor drops in that area from the static Lietenants. They spawn around 1 time in 10 in the place of the 'watchman' type spawns (of which there are 6) and drop armor pieces around 1 in 8. The rest of the time they generally drop Giant Scalemail.<br />
<br />
I do not believe that area to be soloable by a 52 shaman (especially one who is poorly equiped), but if you can dig up a couple friends it should be doable. Or there might be a group there willing to let you join.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jalarm393</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The bank area liutenants are the easiest armor droppers in the zone. i would say there are 6 static guard spawns and 1 roamer guard in the outside area and 4 in the bank which are really hard to get to unless you have a partner. there are 2 200 hitting pally mobs in there one called staff sergeant drioc and the other will be kael militia captain or captain bvellos who will wander and is even meaner. all 3 are really hard to solo at least i havent done it and they will cannot be singled at 57. any of the guard spawns can spawn a liutenant.</div></div><hr />
