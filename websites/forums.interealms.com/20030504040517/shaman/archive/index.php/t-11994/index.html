<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Pretty sure I bought all but 2 or 3 of my 1st-tier PoP spells.  After about 8 parch turnins, having gotten 5 dupes, I just started checking the bazaar every day, and bought every spell I needed that was 100p or less.  <br />
<br />
I bought all the rest of them.<br />
<br />
Admittedly, I think I paid 500p for the pet, and 400 for grummus, maybe.  But the vast majority I paid 50p for.<br />
<br />
Reasons?<br />
<br />
Maybe shamans are just so sick of paying through various bodily orifices for spells, that most are having a little heart and selling dupes cheaply.<br />
<br />
I think that's true, but since I bought a bunch of those 50p spells from high level druid bazaar-merchies, I think the prevailing reason is that these people are used to seeing shamans pay painful prices for spells, so their spare parchs go to shaman spell turnin NPC's.  This gluts the market, and since supply ends up so massively ahead of demand, the prices go through the floor, because now they just want to get the stupid scrolls OUT of their inventory, so they can put up another pair of leaf-scale gloves.  <br />
<br />
As a result, when I end up with a parch now - once everyone else in the group has a full book, too - they can go to the mage NPC.  I got fist of ixblat and burnout V on my first two tries.  Once my man's book is full, I can move on to another guildie....<br />
<br />
Another result of this is that I just didn't feel the parch drop pain like a lot of my friends.  I think the 1500p total that I spent on these spells EASILY outweighs the peace of mind I bought with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Simple supply and demand.<br />
<br />
Parch's are coming into the game much faster than people are dinging 61 now.<br />
<br />
After the initial rush on spells, the rush has given way to many parch's to many people.<br />
<br />
Heck, I was in a pov group, and this pickup group gave me 4 pach's that dropped, because I was the only one without all my 61/62 spells<br />
<br />
*shrug*<br />
<br />
I'd like to think that shaman are being nice to other shammies... but... there's too many greedy people out there for that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">exactly - hardly any excitement on parch drops 61-62.  Other nite I had to prod and prod group to get someone to loot one.  Grats Bazaar trader.<br />
<br />
:)&gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Groz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">No kidding.  I think a bunch of us in the guild all have 14+ ethereal parchments in the bank.  Everyone in the guild who is 60+  already has  their 61-62 spells.  With the new bank space, it's not so bad. Figured we'd save them for twinks or the next set of people who get close to 60.<br />
<br />
Was in CoD, and some group left an ethereal  parchment on a mob to rot.  Hehe, compare that to paying 15K for true spirit (/rude Mystic turn-in for dups in the beginning).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's a lot different for mages.  My man certainly isn't picking up HIS spells for 50p apiece.  <br />
<br />
Also is a royal PITA to find that stupid infusion spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ludgurorf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i got infusion by turning in ethereals to bl and finally got it after getting 4 of their pet spells first. but then what else are ethereals good for?  soon all the 61/62 spells will be 100 pp or less.  cant even give the beast lord spells away.</div></div><hr />
