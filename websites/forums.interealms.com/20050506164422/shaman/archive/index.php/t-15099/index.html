<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I’m still in search of a good spot to solo with my 58 shaman when I’m not in a group.  Since I’ve been unable to find such a spot I feel comfortable with I now have a level 32 beastlord. *grins* This morning a guild mate said a friend of his would pull prisoners into the courtyard from their cell windows in PoJ.  Is this even possible and if so would I be looking at pulling trains instead of single mobs?  The only experience I’ve had in PoJ is taking my druid there to forage Justice Fruit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Katta was great back pre-pop.  The grey was always a good zone too.  Maiden's eye and umbral plains have some decent solo spots, as does Akheva.  Then there's the older zones, Howling Stones, Chardok, Sebilis, and newer zones like Veksar and Droga.<br />
<br />
Take your pick =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try LoY zones.  Good exp and even better loot (cash/gems AND items).  At 58 the windscorn boat in Dulak is still good exp.  torrigan mines and Crypt of Nadox are also good zones (but torrigan you have to go in a ways as mobs near the enterance are only lt blue.)<br />
<br />
Veksar is Ok but mobs there have a whole lotta HP and are pretty resistant to poision and disease from my experience.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Screw LoY, screw Katta and Maidens and Umbral (especially Umbral).   Go to PoJ and go all the way back to the prisoner cells across from the trials entrance.   Better yet check out this thread for some great exp and great loot:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">PoJ is pretty awesome at that level, go down to the second floor of prisoners and fight them inside their rooms.  After level 57 the guards and rats will  leave you alone and you can hop from room to room slaughtering prisoners in semi-peace.  Whack the guards when you see them too, as they can drop decent cash loot. You can play with the two opposing faction, creatures and prisoners, to reduce the adds you might get from the room occupants.  <br />

Edit: spelling is hrad</div></div><hr />
