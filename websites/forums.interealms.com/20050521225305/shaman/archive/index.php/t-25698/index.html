<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Welcome to Zek<br />
<br />
On February 8th a new server will show up on your server selection list. Zek will host the combined characters of the four current PVP servers (Rallos, Tallon, Vallon and Sullon) and will use the Rallos Zek ruleset. It is our opinion that merging the four current PVP servers will revitalize the PVP environment, adding new challenges and players for you to test your skills against.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Purge<br />
<br />
Immediately preceding the merger, all characters that are below level 10 and have not been accessed in the past six months or more will be purged from all four PVP servers. If you have a character on Rallos Zek, Tallon Zek, Vallon Zek or Sullon Zek that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for six months or more, you will need to log them in prior to the February 8th downtime. Any character that is below level 10 and has not been logged in for 6 or more months will be deleted and will not be available after the server merge.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shared Banks<br />
<br />
If you have characters on more than one of the PVP servers, you will need to clean out the shared bank on all but one of the existing PVP servers. Only one shared bank, from one of the four servers, will be available after the merger.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters<br />
<br />
If you have more than 8 characters combined between all of the current PVP servers, after the merger, only the first 8 (sorted alphabetically) characters will be displayed. Other characters beyond those 8 will not be available for selection until characters are deleted. The characters will be on your account provided they were not below level 10 and had been played within the last 6 months.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Corpses<br />
<br />
Prior to the downtime on the 8th of February, please make certain that you clear any character corpses from the world. Character corpses will not be transferred to the new merged server. All corpses will be purged once the merger is complete.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Character Names<br />
<br />
It is likely that characters will have duplicate names on these servers, in the event that characters do share a name, the character with the most played time will be entitled to keep the name, all other characters will have the letter X appended to their name and will be entitled to a name change. You can request your name change using the /petition system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Complimentary Character Move<br />
<br />
Beginning shortly after the merge is complete, a one time move will be offered to all accounts on the new PVP server. Each account will be allowed to move the entirety of their account to the non-PVP server of their choice, with gear. This offer will only last for 30 days and includes all characters on an account. <br />

So, this will either bring a nice breath of fresh air to the pvp servers, or it will ruin it entirely. Kroaks, send me a pm or visit our message boards. I alread let our guys know you want to get in with us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Will be interesting for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>ColtraneRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shinerbokk, I thought our officers were working some alliance with your guild, that true? I know I wanna hang with you out in the tundra chilling like the old wise men that we be, and of course,laying smack down on anyone who might interupt our good times. Send me a tell in game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'll look for you Coltrane and send you a tell. I have been busy the past few months and haven't been on much, so I'm out of the loop as far as the merger stuff goes. I'm actually surprised it's happening this fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boondowk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">heh maybe the retired version will come out of hiding for a while. Or I might just take the move log and sell off my old gear.</div></div><hr />

One of the great moments in EQ history was actually kinda recent when the RZ guys killed the Sleeper.  <br />
<br />
That was pretty cool, even hearing accounts server-removed from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Im wondering how the Sullon folks are gonna take this.  They were running under a completely different ruleset from Rallos, and they got a 20% exp mod in all zones.  Im thinking this will cause some headaches, to be sure.</div></div><hr />

No more GO GO GOOD TEAM!!!   :(</div></div><hr />

SZ folks, while being the most hard core PKers are also the most undergeared in comparison to other servers.</div></div><hr />

Well after day one. They had corpses in every zone they entered. It's really enjoyable to kill SZ top guild (Hate) with such ease. It's funny how the biggest trash talkers in EQ can't back up their words when they face real competition.<br />
<br />
I was forced to turn off all OOC, Shout and auction channels. The spam was insane.</div></div><hr />
