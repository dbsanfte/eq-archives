<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Demi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Quick question, how many people should I bring with me for this part of the quest. I've read the walk through, and it said 2 groups. I do have a few high lvl friends.. (63+) and a guild to help me out on this.<br />
<br />
I&quot;m going to learn the spawn points so I can just get this part done quick, but I wanted to know how many and which classes I should bring with me to make this go smooth and quick...<br />
<br />
I'm 47 btw. thx in advace :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>hebuorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">prolly only 1 warrior 63 1 cleric and a good dmg dealer  can work everything out ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>splunge</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At lvl 62, all the dark elves are green to me. Im tempted to redo that part of the epic.. just to see if i can solo it. =)<br />
<br />
It can be done with a good 61+ pal/sk/rng and a 61+ dru/shm/clr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well i tried it twice with just me, a level 51 ranger and a level 62 paly.  We failed both times but not because we died, the elf just kept de spawning.  The third time we got a level 63 druid to help and it worked out fine.<br />
<br />
The thing is you just need to deal massive amounts of damage fast,  which is why the paly and i couldnt do it.  If you could get a 60+ druid or wiz then you two can dou it.<br />
<br />
edit:  When we did it with the druids help we also killed all the elves so i didnt even have to wait for the druid to respawn.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Dunaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Did this once with 2 rangers (52, 58) and 2 druids (50, 55).   Took out the corruptor fast, then caught up with the 2 reavers and killed them as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Enorme</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1 58+ druid can do it piece of cake</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Demi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Are these things slowable? I got a 61 shaman friend. Mezzable? cuz I can prolly get a 60+ chanter as well. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overkill.  Doesn't need to be slowed because he shouldn't be alive long enough to do much damage, except for the HTs<br />
<br />
A couple damage dealers and the shaman would be fine.  You really don't need 2 groups to finish it.  Just a couple people that can do damage quick and someone that will kite the Reavers around till you kill the Corruptor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I did this with a 59 druid, a 53 mage and a 48 ranger(my self) with no problems at all.</div></div><hr />

Well i tried it twice with just me, a level 51 ranger and a level 62 paly.  We failed both times but not because we died, the elf just kept de spawning.  The third time we got a level 63 druid to help and it worked out fine.<br />

We, 62 SK, 59 Wiz, and me, 53 Ranger, tried the Corruptor last night.  I handed in the coin, then the amulet to all the other druids, the Corruptor popped, SK had him to 20-30% health in less than 30 seconds and he despawned.<br />
<br />
Did we do something wrong? <br />
<br />
I petitioned, still waiting for a GM to respond.<br />
<br />
Should I just start over and not worry about it?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fufinski</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hello  Taelor  /bonk   welcome to the glade.<br />
<br />
Sadly I believe that you have a limited time to kill the corruptor before he despawns.  Just make sure you kill him quickly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last time I did this part was a 60 ran 58-59 ran 55 ran and a 60 druid pre PoP.  We had no problem killing him.  I was teh 58-59 and kited off the adds while the other two ranger butchered the corruptor with just druid heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rashgaal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yes there is a time constraint.  You can not let the other elves get past the farm house.  Im not sure excatly what it is, but either its that they kill the farmer, they kill the druids (who are like lvl 55) super fast, or just them running past the farm.  Thats why the paly and i could not solo it.  With the druids help the corruptor was dead even before i made it over there and i had wolf form and thats when we decided to just grab the other elves.  The entire scene was maybe a minute long, my friends just mauled them insanely fast.<br />
<br />
Anyways what you can do is have some one grab the DE reavers and run them around while some one else kills the corruptor.  Rooting the corruptor DOES NOT stop the despawn, just thought i should mention that because in the guide i was using it was stated that if you root him he will not despawn which is false.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Yuma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Ive done this part of the epic several time(for different people) with just me and a 55druid, only had him despawn once on us, but other than that its gone off without a hitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Bhuhdiy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The key is definately to not let the Reavers get away.  If they get far enough on their way to the Quest druids, the corruptor will despawn.<br />
<br />
As was suggested, have someone kite the reavers around while you kill the corruptor, and you should have no problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Raltar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just root them all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Taelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Thanks for the info.<br />
<br />
The corruptor despawned before the wiz finished casting snare.   Not sure what happened this time.  Next time though, I will have a majority of the guild on the hill.  The corruptor won't even have time to time look around and say &quot;Oh Cr@p&quot;.<br />

Off to talk to Telin</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Feniix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">just killed him today with me, a 51 ranger, and my friend, 55 bard. killed the corruptor and the 2 reavers, was pretty easy. well i didn't do anything, i just turned the stuff in. he did all the work.</div></div><hr />
