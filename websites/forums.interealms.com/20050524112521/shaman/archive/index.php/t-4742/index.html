<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, I love the idea that DoT stacking will be going in soon.  Talk about some nice Shaman damage coming down the pike....<br />
<br />
But, just a few issues...<br />
<br />
1) The message stated that we will not be able to stack lesser DoTs.  Looks like a shaman nerf coming on this bit.  We will only be able to hit with Bane and would not be able to double with VoS or another poison line.  Pick your DoT and stick with it.  Oh, if someone is lucky enough to have Poxx then the other shamans are screwed because we would not be able to drop one of our lesser disease DoTs.<br />
<br />
2) Aggro - chaining Bane and our Epic would seem to be an aggro issue.  Does anyone think that we will start to generate too much aggro from the 3rd Bane and then be told &quot;Shaman's don't DoT&quot;?  Unless the fix our aggro then we may only be able to cast 1 or 2 Bane spells after maloxx and slow.  We may be a class that generates so much aggro that we are not allowed to DoT on raids.<br />
<br />
3) What is consiered a lesser DoT?  Have there been problems on Test where other class DoTs were considered a better DoT and then stacking was a problem?  Are the kinks worked out of this yet?<br />
<br />
Well, just a few thoughts on a Sunday morning</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">This is good news.  I was never one till I just now am exp'ing in the high 50s to take it upon myself to memerize high level shaman spell dots with lower ones.   Bane of Knife and Envenomed Bolt being the recent exceptions.  Being able to cast Bane twice would be sweet.  Not to mention being in a group with another shaman, trying to decide who's going to cast what.  <br />
Is this going to apply to epic dot as well?  Anyone tried that out?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tryg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The message didnt state that we would not be able to stack lesser dots, it said that lesser dots would still not stack and shaman ones have always been able to stack whereas necros for example cant.<br />
<br />
Aggro surely will be the same as normal? if you stack dots from anotehr shaman then thats the same as if one shaman was dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Tryg,<br />
<br />
  Since the message did not say that shaman DoTs will still stack then I must assume that they will not until someone proves otherwise.<br />
<br />
  Yes, aggro will be the same and we know how high that can be.  Imagine if all of the shamans take aggro from the MT during a fight - heck I can out aggro our MT in HoT just trhough the slow process and an occasional bracer click.<br />
<br />
Em2johns,<br />
<br />
  We will not be able to stack the same DoT, instead we will be able to hit with Bane along with another shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I think you misunderstood the change.  DoT stacking does not mean one shaman can cast 3 banes on one MoB at the same time. It means two DIFFERENT shamans can cast the same dot on one MoB.  There wouldnt be any extra agro since you are still casting one DoT like usual.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fatsow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If Bane and Ebolt wont stack, im going to be seriousely pissed.<br />

The dots will continue to stack. They said that the SAME dot would not stack with itself and that they'd take measures to prevent exploits that would make this happen. <br />
<br />
Chaining Nife has always been an aggro issue. If you stack a bunch of dots on a mob, it'll come after you. Each person attacking a mob has a &quot;hate value.&quot; Example: <br />
<br />
Nife Hate: 300<br />
Epic Hate: 100<br />
Pox Hate: 150<br />
Plague Hate: 100<br />
<br />
During a long fight versus a high-HP mob... at 6 minutes into the fight we've got the following hate list values:<br />
<br />
Main Tank is just barely holding onto the hate lead with 1450.<br />
<br />
Shaman1 casts: epic, nife, nife, epic, nife, nife. Total hate = 1400.<br />
Shaman2 casts: pox, plague, epic. Total hate: 350.<br />
Shaman3 casts: nife, nife. Total hate = 600.<br />
<br />
The first shaman has the most aggro and chances are he's gonna get smooshed. The third shaman has generated less than half the aggro of the first shaman. He's much lower on the hate list. The MT's next taunt fails, dropping him below the hate generated by Shaman1... Shaman1 gets dropped.<br />
<br />
These are all just made up values... but illustrate the idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ok, let me re-illustrate my point:<br />
<br />
Shaman1: malo, slow, bane<br />
Shaman2: bane, epic<br />
Shaman2: bane, epic, EB &lt;-- nope.  Lower poision spell will not stack according to the patch message.<br />
<br />
I know that solo we can stack every DoT in our spellbook.  Welcome to 2000 ;)<br />
<br />
My question/concern is that we will only be able to stack DoTs solo.  Raiding/grouping will prevent this.<br />
<br />
This is also in response to the people (including myself) that think we will be able to do massive damage on a raid.  I think that the high aggro of Bane will limit our ability to chain DoT the mob every 42 seconds unless we want to replace rangers as the rez target of choice for clerics.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This is a big issue to me, since a lot of my time is soloing; as soon as I get Bane I expect Bane+Ebolt to be a big part of my soloing strategy; that's a lot of hit points to rot off in under a minute.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">What's your source? I've seen no mention of a change in the way that our dots stack. You seem to be misinterpreting something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's a post made in the &quot;Spells&quot; forum a couple days ago bout this thing.  It's got quotes and a link to the Mobhunter article that caused the original concern. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=4699)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm i do use Bon and ebolt together some when i solo. When i group i dont find the need to do both but mini raid type things would be nice to still be able to cast Bon , ebolt, epic and another shammy be able to cast the same thing. Speaking of say high hp mobs in umbral. Hope this doesnt get changed. <br />
<br />
   As for raids and dots flying i was just thinking would have to deal with it more like wizards/druids/mages and the such nuking. If you have quite a few shaman there dot later in a higher hp mobs life and dont stack em right off the bat. Sounds like if everyone went wild on em early would get some pingpong effect as hate values rose and dropped back down. But to me sure will be fun to stack some dots off to drop the health down later in a fight. Will take some of the tedium out of being the 2nd/3rd 4th shaman on a raid and having nothing to do but heal once in awhile. Guess bottom line though will have to wait and see. I like the idea of it in theory but time will tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Well s'hit.<br />
<br />
This would be a very bad thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Just checked my baby necro; a lower &quot;Blood&quot; won't stick with a higher one as it is... so no real change to the Necros, I'd hope.<br />
<br />
This could really hurt our high-level soloing godhood.  Maybe poison/disease are seperate stacking procedures since they add the poison/disease counters, as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The necro spells listed in that article DO NOT STACK NOW, the article is simply stating that the dot stacking will not cause these to start stacking.<br />
<br />
I doubt they will change ours, there is nothing to indicate that this is so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Still stacking ebolt-bane on test as of today.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Torelorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Snow79: Are 2 shamans able to stack Bane/EBolt on a single mob?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>snow79</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Yup. There might still be bugs with multiple dots of the same type stacking, but so far i havent noticed, duo'd with a necro using ebolt at the same time as me, seemed to work.</div></div><hr />
