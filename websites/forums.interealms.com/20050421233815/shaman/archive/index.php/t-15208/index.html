<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chernobul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello I'm a level 35 Shaman. For a partner I have a 32 Shadowknight and we have a monk levelling up to join us. I spend a lot of time playing EQ, like a whole lot, on my old server I was high enough level to raid and get AAs, but when i moved to Bristlebane I started all over.<br />
<br />
Right now I'm slaving away in DSP either on my own at the fungi temple or sometimes grouped for the tribals. To me that is just really really slow exp, even if I play straight for like six hours I don't come away with much to show for it. Can anyone reccomend a few places I can go to get back up to raiding level? I hear a lot of talk about SolA but getting to the camp spot is lethal and normally it's perma camped.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any input you can throw my way. I just need to find a way to get to 50 then I'll refer to myself as Prophet Chernobul in no time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaral</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I dont remember exactly how good the exp was and which level I had. But try ranger/druids at druidring in WC and terrors at broken bridge room in Crystal Caverns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Phread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Also try Sol A Clockworks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>sir0die</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">i think at that lvl i was soloing geo somewhere for xp and plat. or i was grouping in dreadlands, i was also soloing HGs in rathe.(i was concerned about killer xp, i was more oriented towards plat with an xp bonus)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">36 I was bouncing between EW ulthorks, RM giants and GD giants, keep a little flavor in the mix. <br />
<br />
I really liked RM, decent xp through around 45 and loads of plat (even if I did have a few KS'd) Ok, so I had alot KSd, /ignore and move on. Ulthorks weren't hard, loot was so so, tusks were the prize as they are quest items with the Othmir in CS, so don't sell them.<br />
 <br />
Check Shabby's guide here, I added a post to it with my take on the leveling. Shabby has some good ideas in there, I like to think mine were too. Somewhere in all of it, you'll find quite a few options to choose from.<br />
