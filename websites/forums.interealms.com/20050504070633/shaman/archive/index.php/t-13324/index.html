<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Busstah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">If you had to build a trio to 3-box with that would be at least tier 3 capable, what would you use?  I'm currently going to go with Beastlord/Shaman/Druid or Beastlord/Necro/Druid, unless someone can think of a better combo.  I can't decide if a Shaman would add more post 60, or a Necro...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xorlov</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">beastlord/shaman/neco,  that's 3 pet classes,  that is a nightmare 3 box good luck  :)    <br />
<br />
I 3box a Cleric 62 / Shaman 62 / Warrior 63,   not the best DPS, but I can do a lot of things on my own.   My cleric is basically set up with hotkeys and requires little maintence so i can consentrate on shaman debuffs and keeping the mob under control with the tank.  The shaman is my main, and is my most busy toon with canni and torpor and all the buffs and debuffs and dots and the pet.  If i were to do it all over again, i would almost concider a monk in place of the warrior, but since the monk nerf not so sure of that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hendadar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">57 Warrior, 54 cleric and 61 shaman here, not past tier 1 yet as the warrior and cleric need some more levels but this trio certainly does well at PoN.<br />
<br />
Took a Monk to 54 but he just couldnt cut it tanking in PoI so never even bothered to try PoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">We run an SK (65), me (shamina 65), and have been playing with different 3rd box characters.  So far necro, ranger and cleric have been tried.  Added DPS is nice, but a cleric really adds a lot to the trio with very nice buffs and superb heals.  Been looking at a beastlord as the third, due to a combination of great attack buffs and decent DPS, but I'm not sure that's efficient.  Another potential option is a druid, which combines great heals, good nukes and dots and nice buffs.  Might have to see if we can borrow a druid and try that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I 3-box a 63 SK (my main), 65 Shaman, and 60 Druid and it's proven to be very effective thus far in Tier 1 and 2 planes.  My best spots thus far have been (not surprisingly) the Golems when open, or the larvae and undead in PoV.  I've also done BoT stormriders and the High Guardians in PoJ.  I've done 10-12 of the WW dragons just for kicks (the dispells and AE get to be interesting hehe).  As far as tactics overall, I set up hotkey macros so that I'd only have to press one key to Malo and Slow the mob, about 5 seconds after I have SK engage, to make sure he has agro.  I then send in dog dog for the attack, with the SK pet alongside.  Thus far, I've primarily used the druid as primarly healer and for regen, DS, and free Epic/ES Vamb DoTs.  I'll occasionally have the shaman toss on a DoT, but only if mana is plentiful.  Before going out on a hunt, I grab KEI from someone for all 3 toons, because I've found myself being a tad lazy on the Cann4 - mainly due to the fact that I have no Torpor or Quiescence.<br />
<br />
The combo has proven pretty effective - plenty of healing, evac, snare, slow, etc.  The only downside I've noticed thusfar is DPS.  The only way I've thought of maybe improving is to have the druid dire charm something, but I really don't want to put the energy or time into the Druid - he's pretty much where I want him to stay.  Throwing more DoTs on does help a little - but then I find that my chain pulling suffers - due to the fact that mana is too low.  I try to keep all chars at 80% mana or better at all times - in case of emergency.  <br />
<br />
I would like to find some challenging hunts (exploration, fun, not necessarily uber exp) to take my trio on - maybe deep DN or something - and would welcome any suggestions. :)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Edit : NM, dont think this would be doable without quiescence on the tank at all times and using qui to heal dmg from his AE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm doing BoT atm with a shaman (63), sk (62), and cleric (51), and am doing fine on everything but mini-bosses and bosses.  I expect to be able to take this group at least as far as tactics arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grixx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Do you think my combo (65 shaman, 63 SK, 60 druid) would be able to handle regular giants in PoS?  (not-lords)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PoS giants are actually tougher then BoT ones due to there nasty habit of mitigating slow.</div></div><hr />
