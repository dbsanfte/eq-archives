<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bearbone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Is bearform like wolfform in that you con better to hostile races.  I was wondering if my troll could enter the nicer cities in bearform.  I'm not lvl 29 but it would be nice to know.  Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hi bear, <br />
<br />
    Nope bear form doesnt change faction up or down. Anyplace i was kos before still kos in bearform and has never taken my faction lower in places i'm not kos. I'm iksar btw.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no faction modifier in bearform.  What it can do though is, enable you to get through small doorways, where shrink doesn't work (Like wood elf structures for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">After getting used to bearform over many months, imagine my surprise when I cast wolf form with my twink 30 Druid in the pirate camp in Iceclad...<br />
<br />
I started running immediately and noticed the aggro messages AFTERWARDS.... the gnomes are SOWed but I had a bit of a head start and gained very slllowely.... managed to get a gate off and channel through the first round.  Welcome to the Nexus.  ARGHHH.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Angle running is yer friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Why would I want to bear form anyways :p I have such nice kitty fur already. Plus the bear models have always looked deranged to me.. ? They should have revamped them with Luclin like they did the wolf form.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>dirtybax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Does Bearform make Jaled Dar's Shade hate you?  I seem to remember him DTing any non-playable illusions.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Bearform makes it easier for us large races to get into the tiny elf building though.  Shrink only works in dungeons *sigh*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>kaid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Bear form also grants you 150 skill in picknickbasket pocketing.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am fairly certain that you can now shrink outdoors with potions.  I didn't think you could but I sold a 10 shot shrink to a barbarian in Kelethin.  He used it and got in the doors.  Then I saw someone actioning &quot;WTS 10 shot Shrink Potions (Indoors and Outdoors)&quot;.  I haven't had a chance to make any more shrink potions to try it out but it seems to work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Evel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I recall correctly the spell effect from our shrink potions is 'Ant Legs' and not 'Shrink'......which is nice because it is castable both indoor and outdoor</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Yup - definately usable both indoors and out.  I used to use it to get into The Hole before I got bear form, and when in HHK on a horsey.</div></div><hr />
