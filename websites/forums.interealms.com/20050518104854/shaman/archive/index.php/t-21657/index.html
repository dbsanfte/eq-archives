Looks like someone has been listening to us. :) Wonder about the stacking however. Will avatar overwrite focus?<br />
<br />
<br />
On the downside however Omen-Shaman-Canni got changed to Anc Omen-Shaman-Canni. Just what we didn't want to hear the canni spell in OoW will also be Ancient.<br />

i am seriously the last shaman in my guild, thier are no new recruits, almost NO new players that are elemental looking for guilds, we have hit a HUGE dry spell of players.<br />
if things don't change then my guild will be out of a shaman, and a raid leader. because im sick of just sitting there and casting ferine avatar and Q on random people and doing nothing else because i bounced 36 + slows on a raid mob and the beastlord lands his in 2 casts.<br />

give us an acessible canni that is WORTH using.<br />
give us BUFFS worth casting WITH LONG STAYING TIMES<br />
give us the power to SLOW again, none of this nihil crap<br />

Dude, your gonna blow a vein about something that is in the EARLIEST possible stages of development. Of course they arent gonna be staying like this. They will be tweaked, probably TODAY after 500 other shaman like you visit the EQ Live boards and blow similar veins. <br />
<br />
And honestly, how do we even know what &quot;ancient&quot; truly means anymore? It COULD be the new word for &quot;turn in&quot;, perhaps you visit an &quot;Ancient&quot; of your class and learn the spell by turning in something. (Personally, I always felt this would be a COOL way to getspells. You turn in your &quot;rune&quot; or whatever, and your Ancient asks you what spell you wish to learn, then you can pick from the list of spells you dont have. No muss, no fuss, no hoarding spells and selling them for 100K) Anything not labeled Ancient is a dropped spell. The thing is WHO KNOWS!! There is no real point in getting all worked up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Something tells me our buffs will go unused on raids because there are only 15 buffslots available.<br />
<br />
Lets see how it turns out.</div></div><hr />

All i want is some bumps in the %'s and I will proceed to the SoE forum and communicate this in a human maner.<br />
<br />
That ancient canni needs to change though. I think we all know what it means blazz and what they are proposing. Something like that needs to be addressed now before it settles.</div></div><hr />

I hope everyone will come and talk about what they think of the spells. Without freaking out. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I like the agi and focus upgrades - 10% avoidance and 5% damage seem reasonable to me.<br />
<br />
Avatar keeps the 140 ATK and gets 10% damage - call it 15% damage total, maybe even 20%. Thats not too bad but could be higher. A little more damage would be nice, or maybe 100% strikethrough or a decent amount of +combat effects.<br />
<br />
But I see no need to complain about these spells at the moment. For the first set of changes they look pretty nice to me and are just what we asked for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually these spells aren't worth anything at this stage.<br />
<br />
Statts buffs modified... great, it's new, it's ... different, but still, how many free buff slots does have melees classes actually ???<br />
<br />
Focus upgraded, but still way behind the druid or cleric buff in utility and hps.<br />
<br />
Avatar who is supposed to give a huge advantage, only 10% ... bleh... and still 6 mins duration stupid idea.<br />
<br />
Cani... ancient... and still an active method for mana, give me a passive cani like necros...<br />
<br />
Dots, Dots, Dots... 3 of them... look nice but I wonder if the mobs in OoW will survive more longer than those in GoD. If not, DoTs = useless<br />
<br />
Our 2 new DD... still way too low (clerics still overnuke us by more than 500 dams  :mad: ), casting time still damn too long, reduce it to 5.5 secs, the poison one still way underpowered...<br />
<br />
Our healing spell... still the same crap. Still this stupid idea that our heals should be 47% of the clerics one. Our healing should be equal to druids not less. I don't give a crap about slow, mitigation still nerf us bad in high end. Druids can nuke better than us, can DoT same than us, we should be EQUAL back healers dammit.<br />
Still no group heal of any kind (direct or HoT, spell or AA).<br />
<br />
Our spells would be upgraded as for everyone spells, but at this stage, our concern stay the same. Poor DPS, poor Healing, nerfed main debuffing and useless DoTs on the expension they goes live.<br />
<br />
Seems no new pets, bah, not a prob, we aren't a pet class and even an hybrid (SK ???) have a far better pet than us.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zoggmak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The changes look nice but they will still be pretty much useless if the max number of buffslots remains at 15.<br />
<br />
**Edit**<br />
For raiding shaman that is. For normal grouping these will get used alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Everyone complaining about slots. Lets see a list of stuff folks will want more than +attack for melee DPS, +avoidance for tanks, etc. These are prety darn good effects for a slot.</div></div><hr />

While I agree that Kurth needs to settle down with a couple ice cold beers, I do think you need to re-evaluate what you're saying.  Yes, it is early, yes these spells MIGHT get tweaked, but unless 500 blood thirsty shaman scream and bitch then any hope of this getting tweaked will die hard and quiet.  How many expansions have many of us said &quot;it's still early&quot; and then we got hosed?  Too many, that's why many shaman are screwed today.<br />
<br />
And honestly, how do we even know what &quot;ancient&quot; truly means anymore? It COULD be the new word for &quot;turn in&quot;, perhaps you visit an &quot;Ancient&quot; of your class and learn the spell by turning in something. <br />
Every expansion since Luclin Ancient has meant one thing ... a no-drop loot item off of a heavy named mob in a keyed zone that only 5-10% of the player base sees within a year of the expansion release.  It's a VERY safe bet they haven't changed it.<br />
<br />
Everyone complaining about slots. Lets see a list of stuff folks will want more than +attack for melee DPS, +avoidance for tanks, etc. These are prety darn good effects for a slot.<br />
I completely agree, but the problem with all the buff spells is that they do nothing to keep the number of active shaman up.  A BOT could as easily cast these and keep them up.  Again, I like the buffs, but shaman need something cast during combat that isn't easily duped by a hotkey macro (like buffs and canning).  We still getting that DR dot? ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I like the changes. They are listening. I would love if they upped the duration on Avatar and upped the recast time if that's what it takes. Hell make a group avatar last 20 mins and change recast time to 10 minutes. Or 30 minutes/15 minutes. <br />
As far as new cannibilize goes, if they don't make it ancient it cheapens our current ancient cannibilize spell. I don't know why people are claiming it's a necessity, I never run out of mana on raids unless I am chain healing the MT and I never run out of mana in an exp group unless it's LDON where I can't use a horse and I am going nuts with nuking. I don't think they should give us passive mana regen, cannibilize is our baby. We can be the best in the game at mana regen but with a cost, click click click. It's a nice trade off. I'm not woprried about nukes so much, we were always known for DoTs, let's see some imagination here. And yes heals, give us the chance to be a secondary healer in the upper tier stuff like Ikk trials etc. If not by healing, then by a superior slow that makes up for less healing, making stuff immune/mitigate slow just gimps the hell out of us if you don't give us the healing to make up for it. Use some creativity here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Popu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't see how these use up any more buff slots than then we currently do. Oh, people might actually want AGI now as well as Focus. Whoopee.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank you Dev Team!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unless these spells are actually attainable this discussion is a complete waste of time.<br />
<br />
I personally refuse to jump through anymore of SOE's hoops to get stupidly rare spells that for the most part doesnt have a noticable effect on anything you do. I dont have a single LDoN spell and I dont have a single GoD - a while ago it just stopped being worth my time getting these spells. For me this will be a major factor in me cancelling my account.<br />
<br />
I simply refuse to believe that the devs dont tune encounters in new expansion to suit a player with all their new spells. If they didnt then either the encounters would be trivialized when people got the spells or the spells arent really doing anything.<br />
<br />
Devs at SOE should wake up and make all new spells resonably easy to get and then spend some more time on finetuning encounters to challenge and entertain.<br />
<br />
I dont think they have much choice about whether to do this or not actually. City of Heroes already has easily attainable spells that you can tweak to your own liking (far far more advanced than any silly stat buff in EQ). And when WoW comes out I bet they will have far more exciting spells than EQ ever had. So if spells in EQ continues to be stupidly rare SOE will be sawing off the branch they are sitting on.<br />
<br />
When I stopped playing the reason for not also cancelling at the same time was 90% friends still in EQ and 10% hope that EQ would change for the better. Now after a while its more like 50% friends and 50% hope. But thats only because my total amount of &quot;reason&quot; is much smaller, meaning that I am much closer to cancelling. And as time goes by I will realize that most of my EQ friends dont really miss me that much and that it is possible to live without EQ :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Looks nice for a start to me, not sure whats wrong with more buffs people will want, just means they have to prioritize and think a little on what they deem more necessary, takes away the black and white, adds a little color to the game at least until the bazillion parses are done again and they figure out agility is still worthless ;).<br />
<br />
In all, if they stack, those 3 damage buffs add a 20% damage increase to each melee you cast them on, thats a pretty sizeable damage upgrade for an entire raid or even just your xp group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hmm nice buffs maybe, although I did think initially it would be a change to present spells. The rest of the omens spells just look like a lame extension to the spells already, pop was the same just extension to existing spells. Maybe I am just being overly demanding but I thought characters should develop 1-70 and not 1-60. In my opinion they should really make some &quot;innovative&quot; spells for level 70.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Banadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Overall, still pretty worthless. You all tend to forget that most likely, every other class who can right now buff the attack rating and such like we do - sorry, much better then we do - with their means, will have significally better utility spells, while we will still be left with a short stick. So we get some silly stat buff which adds STR and some patheric percentage to damage output. And, then, some BST buff will add loads of HP, together with mana and HP regen, bunch of resists added to it and to finish it off, twice or trippe better attack rating then we do. Just an example out of the blue, but anyways, look around yourself. We lack the utility big time, our future buffs can't be called upgrades due to pathetic little bonuses added to it, non-damage casters (i.e. clerics) already outdamage us in DD spell area and will do so even more, and hybrid classes, supposedly having SOME of our abilities, offer significally more utility in form of much more useful utility spells.<br />
<br />
Do you really think that SOE will now suddenly learn and realize it and actually improve us? Nope, I hardly believe that. I know that these upgrades are just a preliminary data, but look yourself already, even this data is pretty pathetic, with quite little utility added to it. What tank in their right mind will take 6% damage increase over few thousands of additional HP's (well, just a guess, but heck knows what new buffs clerics will get)? If the tank has to decide, whether click off AGI buff with it's 10% avoidance, or HP buff with it's few thousand additional HP plus bunch of AC, which buff will go down? AGI.<br />
<br />
This &quot;upgrade&quot; is just as pathetic as was the one from lvl 60 to lvl 65. If not even more, considering that the level cap as such is raising even higher. Who knows, maybe that expansion pack will be the one, which will finally give to BST's and chanters and whomever else the spells/abilities, allowing them to overcome the last caps between the shamans, in the areas where the shamans still are wee-bit better, and then we're be totally outdated.<br />
<br />
Doesn't sound optimistic? Nope, all the last changes implemented by SOE leave no reason to feel so, considering how the feedback from customers has been, and will be, ignored by SOE. If they'd listen to the feedback, they surely would not keep cranking up such pointless things over all these years.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Urgh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">What tank in their right mind will take 6% damage increase over few thousands of additional HP's (well, just a guess, but heck knows what new buffs clerics will get)?

<br />
<br />
Oh, tanks only have one buff slot now? Get a grip... Noone is going to click off their best hp buff for it, but they might click off one of the other 14 less useful ones... Let's maintain a sense of perspective here.<br />
<br />
After years of useless stat buffs, this is a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

pure joke.<br />
question... what is it now?<br />
Also, is the new one more HP than the old one? I thought so, **** grimp!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">What I'm worried about, which is a huge concern with me are: <br />
<br />
How long are they going to end up having these buffs last?<br />
<br />
Will they be group castable (and MGB'ble)?  And the spells easily obtained.<br />
<br />
How will stacking be (not really with shaman other spells, but with other class spells)?<br />
<br />
Am I going to end up needing to keep 6 spell slots perma memmed because I'll be swamped with tells from melee and casters (I bet chanters, clerics, wizards will want avoidance) at the start of raid, when they are rezzed, and from the new folks who just arrived at the raid?<br />
I don't want to do the mem-demem spell dance half my night.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping these can be rolled into one spell or 2 only.  The new Focus should also have 5% strikethrough and avoidance.<br />
<br />
I'm not a buff bot and buffing is not our primary role, nor should be.  It should be no different that how much clerics, druids, chanters, rangers, etc. do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">wow.. we got a % increase to our hp buff. I bet its... the same as the cleric one! $$<br />
<br />
Lets get minor upgrades. After all, effectiveness doesnt matter to guys liek Ophidion. 5hp upgrade is an upgrade, no complaints from me, humperdy doo!<br />
<br />
Its like giving flat % raises to all emoployees in a company. It may seem 'fair' but for the lowest paid guys (us) it doesnt even cover the cost of living increase from year to year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">As long as other classes only get these effects in place of stat buffs they had previously (and the exchange rate is the same) I do not have any issues with that.<br />
<br />
And I can't understand why people think these are bad effects. 10% avoidance is big. 5% damage is big. If you want to complain complain about the effects of avatar not reflecting the mana/time/spell slot cost or about focus not having enough HPs.<br />
<br />
Or about the heal, DoTs or nukes. But Agi and Focus look pretty solid to me, effects-wise.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Obviously we'll have to see how this all pans out, but I think it's a good start, on the buff side of things anyway.  10% avoidance is the equilivant of CA3, isn't it?  That's a buff that does as much as 12 points worth of AAs.  Seems decent enough to me.  I know, I know... some of you can crank out 12aa in a day - I can't. ;)  Hopefully all of these exist in group form as well...<br />
<br />

<br />
Except, currently the new Avatar does not stack with the new STR/DEX spell that gives +5% damage.  So Avatar would only net +5% for a short duration and cancels your base long duration +5%.  Gotta wonder about the utilty of this upgrade.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Geal Icehammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">After some sleep, I noticed that Focus has its 5% mod in a different slot than either avatar or the str buff, so it will stack with either. However, avatar and the str buff are both in the same slot. It will be a choice of 10% for a short duration or 5% for long duration (assuming no changes are made).  Also looks like the Beastlord IoS upgrade will stack with the new focus, str buff and avatar. <br />
<br />
In checking for stacking, I noticed that the agi mod is the same as the monk disc quick feet. So if you want to test out how effective the 10% avoid melee is you can.  May take a while to build up enough data with an 18 sec duration on the disc.<br />
<br />
I hope that FA does not stack with the new Omens Avatar, I just know some ranger or rogue is going to demand both spells be cast on them otherwise.</div></div><hr />

I'm trying to head in the direction of actually having a damage spell memmed every once in awhile.  Avatar does not need to be memmed period, unless it is boss mob time.  If you want to make Avatar useful, put it on a 40 min timer.  Long enough not to be a hassle, but short enough not to turn us into buff whores in PoK.<br />
<br />
I like the additions to our stat buffs, but when we need them the most, will be when we don't have enough buff slots to take advantage of them.  I would have been just as happy to see our normal spells and just raise the stat cap to 400+.  In theory, AGI should give you damage avoidance already...why tag an actual new focus to it?  Ditto with STR and our other stat buffs.  There is a reason people max these things out you know.<br />

<br />
And honestly, how do we even know what &quot;ancient&quot; truly means anymore? It COULD be the new word for &quot;turn in&quot;, perhaps you visit an &quot;Ancient&quot; of your class and learn the spell by turning in something. (Personally, I always felt this would be a COOL way to getspells. You turn in your &quot;rune&quot; or whatever, and your Ancient asks you what spell you wish to learn, then you can pick from the list of spells you dont have. No muss, no fuss, no hoarding spells and selling them for 100K) Anything not labeled Ancient is a dropped spell. The thing is WHO KNOWS!! There is no real point in getting all worked up.<br />

<br />
Tested, yes. Actually listened to the people doing the testing or asked for recommendations, no.<br />
<br />
However, even the most dire nay-saying pessimists have to admit there is a different . . . I dunno . . . &quot;feel&quot; about this current situation. SOE is on their heels. Oh, they know they have a cash cow that will continue to rake in money for a few more years EASY with even just minimal effort, but I think they REALLY want more. I think they WANT the lions share. In the past, the contenders looked good when the bell rung, but they all had weak left hooks, and that overhand right of EQ is so dominating. Now, they see WoW (and the power of Blizzard). They see Vanguard (Brad with MSs money = frightening to them). They see that there are probably some guys coming into the ring ready to go the full 12 rounds and not lay down in thr 3rd or 4th, like DAoC and AC and AO seemed too. <br />
<br />
Thats my take, anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">all I can say is, this is a step in the right direction. Its just on test now, if you care, play on test, and constantly feedback what you feel needs changed so that it ends up better. I doubt ill see these spells soon, but, just the idea that sony is trying to listen, and trying to show they care about what we want, shows that they are not utterly hopeless. They havent gotten my trust back yet, but this is a start in the right direction. The classes are broken, the reason we see it so much is, well, Sony made the wrong hybrid type, and didnt think it through when they made beasts. They are essentially to blame that we notice these glaring problems, but, would we care as much if we didnt see the glaring differences between a class made for DPS that slows just fine, or would we not make such a big fuss? As much as beastlords and our comparitive balance is a problem, it is also a big help I think, because it gives us a prime example of something we can compare ourselves with. We could compare it to enchanters, but, enchanters are not a hybrid, it would not make the problems as noticeable with out a hybrid involving our class, and showing the lack of use we now currently have in some of the new content.<br />
<br />
So, in closing, while this wont &quot;fix&quot; us, it brings us much closer then what we are now, it shows sony is at least trying, and face it, if they did some major changes on us on test. You sure as hell know, druids, clerics, necros, rangers, and beasts would be in an uproar saying that shaman imbalance the game. So, this may not fix us, it could end up in possibly balancing us a bit more, and making the game more enjoyable in the GoD and LDoN atmosphere.<br />
<br />
Some other points I would like to make on things that I have noticed, people dont want to be buff bitches, I understand you, and feel for you, but, if we get useful buffs, it will give you a much needed raid spot, and while you will spend sometime buffing, how often do you actually buff in a raid. Sure, you have more people with &quot;buffs please&quot; or &quot;buffz plz dud omg rotflolerskatesomg&quot;, you will then have a spot on the raid, and you can add dps, you can add healing, you can play. You also can feel that much more useful. So, in closing, this is likely just the first of many changes we shall see, dont get angry over it, because, well, its not worth it. It isnt worth it to get so angry, when this shows sony is stepping towards trying to balance us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">You are all missing the point.<br />
<br />
It's not the fact that we finally have meaningful buffs, it's the fact that we are still not the king of melee buffs.  <br />
<br />
When your guild is raiding, and the only difference if you're not there is 700 hp, something is STILL wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Froggar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I understand that, but baby steps, its only in its test phase, if they made it a HUGE improvement, you know other buffing classes would be trying their hardest to get it nerfed and shot down instantly. When its small like this, other classes wont complain as much, and will give them time to see how this even, isnt adequate. Then it can be pushed to something we can use more. When they are testing it, im sure its going to start out small, just give it some time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">If I had to do it, here's the changes I would make given the relative buffing level of the classes now.<br />
<br />
Focus:  Keep the duration, at least 900 hp (about half as many hp as a clerics, without peridot cost), 45 to all resists, 5% melee avoidance.  Not stackable with BL hp buff.  All other stacking issues the same.<br />
<br />
We should buff for more hp than a paladin, because they're a stinking hybrid.  Right now, they buff for 700 more hp than we do.  But apart from that side note, we should buff at least 900.  As king buffers of melee, we should be 2nd best at hp, 1st (by a wide margin) at stats/effects.  Beastlords should see their hp buff have reduced resists on it.  As much as I hate to say it, but I want the duration to stay the same.  I don't want a group to ask me for focus without grouping me; by keeping duration low, I stay in demand without becoming a buff bot.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Group/Single Haste:  At least 45 minute duration, both versions should haste for same amount, that being 65%.  No other effects.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no logical reason, that makes good sense, why group haste should be 50% and single haste be 60%.  There also should not be a huge discrepancy between enchanters and shaman for hasting % like there is now.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Agility/Strength/Dexterity: Finally they got agility right - put in the effect intended, not a useless stat.  This spell should have no stacking issues with other spells.  Strength/Dexterity should maintain its current status of +5% dmg mod, however, it should also allow for slightly more procs/crits.  It should also not have any stacking issues.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Avatar:  Pick one of two versions for this spell: long duration, short duration.<br />
<br />
Short: 250atk, 10-15% damage modifier, 5% strikethrough/hate modifier, significantly more crits/procs.  High mana cost, long recast so you can keep it on 2 melee max.<br />
Long: less atk and lower damage mod than short.  Make it group castable (and mgb'able).<br />
<br />
Both shouldn't have stacking issues with any other spell, especially our own spells, with the exception of agro increasing spells.  Yes, this spell should raise you on the hate list, above and beyond additional hate from damage mod.  Not castable on charmed pets.  I would rather keep this in short duration form despite the hassles.<br />
------------------------<br />
<br />
Slight changes to our spells and other classes spells (especially our hybrid's) would go a long way towards putting us where we should be in the buffing line up.  At the top.</div></div><hr />

Noone is going to click off their best hp buff for it, but they might click off one of the other 14 less useful ones... Let's maintain a sense of perspective here.<br />
<br />
After years of useless stat buffs, this is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know how many buff slots the tanks on your raids have (groups? I don't even bother play EQ lately at all, I only participate on guild raids), however, tanks with the raid buffs plus needed 2-3 free buff slots (HoT heal and &quot;negative effect&quot; slots) on in the guild I am have no room for silly AGI, which frankly affects nothing, or other stat buffs, which are just as useless. Not to mention, they're at their caps anyway and even when the stat cap raised some, they'll still be at the cap, or very close to it.<br />
<br />
Not to mention that other &quot;you know what&quot; classes get also the same effects added to their buffs, however, their buffs offer more utility then ours anyway. And this so-called upgrade of our spells will be more of a joke anyway - they sure upgrade the mana cost and the cast time of our spells, alright, but the effects given will be pretty minimal raise and duration as well, or, good if even would have the same duration. I am sure you can look for yourself, how &quot;big&quot; our upgrade was from lvl 60 spells to level 65 spells. You know, when I saw the spells what many other classes got, I saw an upgrade and said &quot;Nice&quot; to myself. When I saw our spells, I asked myself &quot;Did they forget the meaning of the word upgrade?&quot;. So far, the OoW spells look exactly the same way, we're getting the short stick again, just like it was from 60 to 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">I agree with some of the sentiments here.  Don't make all these different buffs with various effects, put them all on the new Focus buff.  They aren't going to increase the number of buffs lots anyway.  People won't even have room for them.

And don't forget click buffs as well.<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous.  Even if they did increase the number of buff slots to 20 or more, I don't want to cast Focus, Agi, str/dex on the whole raid nor do I want my shaman guildmates to do it.

Well, I think the idea is that you have to make some choices. We allready do that with current buffs, so its not really any different from what we are doing now. When I'm MAing on Yella I routinely click off junk from BLs and rangers that I dont need in order to conserve buffs spots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Hmm its interesting someone says we need more hp on the buffs, it could get ridiculous if all 3 priest classes had hugely and stackable hp. I think one idea that could be good is if they upped focus to be a 1000 odd hp buff with perhaps combined regen or something, which would not stack with virtue, or pot9. Then give shamans a infusion of spirit upgrade, which could be a group version and basically would combine all the stat mods and perhaps include a +5% haste. <br />
So focus 1 could be 1000 hp ish with adjustments to str/dex as usual.(perhaps regen too or something else)<br />
And focus 2 could be an infusion of spirit combining the +10% dmg, +10% avoidance and +5% haste.<br />
This could help us be a main healer in some group situations, and provide an alternate raid castable buff when focus is upgraded to the increased hp.<br />
Dunno just an idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">If focus didn't stack with skin or virt in the version it is now, I can garuntee that it would become the most worthless buff we have, right behind agility.<br />
<br />
But I like the idea of combining the effects of these spells into one good spell.  Having to refresh: regen, haste, avatar, focus, agility, str/dex, in addition to everything else we repetively cast, would drive me mad now that I think about it.</div></div><hr />
