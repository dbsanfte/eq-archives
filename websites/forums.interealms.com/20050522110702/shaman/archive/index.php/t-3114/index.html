<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dont know if everyone here has an enduring breath item and i am the last one to get on the bandwagon, but there is a really easy quest for a eb item in luclin.<br />
<br />
You need to get 3 shissar organs (no drop) and give them to a guy in Katta (the same building as rallic aristos).<br />
<br />
The organs can be found on the Taskmaster something in echo caverns (with the 8 skele spawn) and on various shissar in the grey.<br />
<br />
The result is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Amulet of the Grey Wastes<br />
MAGIC LORE NO DROP<br />
NECK<br />
sta 10 sv cold 4 sv magic 4<br />
Effect: Enduring Breath<br />
wt 0.1<br />
ALL/ALL<br />
<br />
All in all it is a good little item for about 2 hours work, and most of that was running from the grey to katta :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I didn't know that it could be MQed. hmmmm. Cool. The organs are a rare drop off of the Taskmaster in Echo Caverns, so it may take a bit longer than 2 hours. I know people who've camped the Taskmaster for a few days before they could get three organs off of him. Still, this is the best camp for getting the organs if you're in the thirties/forties. The other zones where the mobs drop the organs are higher level zones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Spent a couple of weeks on and off hunting in the Grey, some days we go no organs, some days we got several. In the end we got enough for about 5 people to get the EB item, which was a nice result. And the xp in the Grey isn't bad for a low 50s group.<br />
<br />
The only downside to the zone (and this is a pet gripe of mine) is if you're camping the temple area when an uber guild decides to go to Ssra. Of course they are all way too important to either bother casting invisibility or (god forbid) learning the safe way to the temple without pulling a train of a dozen mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Don't hunt zone lines.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Alternatively people could learn a tiny amount of politeness and consideration for other people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Koraden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Fighting in the middle of a zone that happens to be a zone to a higher level zone doesn't really constitute &quot;camping a zone line&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">the quest guy is currently bugged ... if you talk to him and say a line of text .. you get a faction ++<br />
<br />
i think its &quot;what snake *something*&quot;<br />
<br />
i forget the actual line of text but you get a faction boost ... <br />
<br />
with in 2 mins of spaming him .. i was ally ... 5 mins later i still couldnt hit max ally<br />
<br />
no this doesnt work while invis .. it might work while in sneak.. sorry i cant try<br />
<br />
<br />
and ill keep training you people untill invis works on horses  &gt;;p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">The problem is there are both undead and non undead in the Grey. Everytime I've cast invis and ran to Ssra, an undead would spot me, break invis and of course result in a small train. Obviously if I use invis to undead, then non undead see me, and we get the same result. <br />
<br />
Now I don't bother invising cause I know something will see me. Like Juujuu said, don't camp zone lines. The temple area in the middle of the Grey IS a zone line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a couple beefs here.  Around Ssra temple, on each side,  you have potential nameds.  Telling us not to camp that area is like telling us &quot;you think grey flesh arms are ubor?  Lol@noob, my **** is 10 times better, you deserve to be trained if you're after such pos drops&quot;.  I got a little carried away, but nice stuff drops in the immediate proximity of Ssra Temple.  Why are you trying to deny us from camping it?<br />
<br />
Second of all, if you can never make your way to Ssra invis, then there's something tremendously wrong.  I never fought in Ssra, but out of the 20 times I camped temple area in the Grey, I got detected once no kidding.  I run from Mons zoneline, maybe it's different from Scarlet, but as far as I know, that route (from Mons) is pretty damned safe provided you pay a minimal amount of attention.  The distance you need to cross is very short, and even though I don't particularly like to flame on these boards, any invis-casting class who intentionally leaves invis off while running to temple is an (_o_)hole.  <br />
<br />
Have respect for others playing the game, running to temple invis without aggro is really not that hard.  You might be having a blast in ssra, but think of the potential deaths you caused that could have easily been avoided.  <br />
<br />
As a sidenote, when running from Mons, it's best to have lev up as well, and keep to the temple walls once you get there as to avoid skellie aggro from that brick building.  Of course, if you brush right by it, skellies gunna aggro, but all you have to do is hug the temple wall and you'll be perfectly fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rumar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">These snake organs drop mainly from the stationary shissars by Sssra temple. Very easy quest to do if you camp those snakes (and have Katta faction :p ).<br />
<br />
I've made then run to the temp invised with 100% success rate many times. If something happens and this fails, it happens. But if you just train yourself through where you know others will be camping mobs, with out effort to avoid this, there's no excuses for that display of grand selfishness and ignorance.</div></div><hr />

Jing, nothing (as far as I've seen, named could be an exception) sees invis in the Grey.  For some reason they all fall for invis.  Including the snakes, golems and slaves (hey, &quot;I&quot; didn't code it I just take advantage of it :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most stuff in the grey doesn't see invis.<br />
<br />
People are just too stupid to bother getting invis.  And even more stupid for not knowing where the entrance to the temple is.  I have seen more than one dumbass run around the outside of the temple wiping out a group that was camping around back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yes for some reason, the undead mobs in the Grey behave strangely. The Shissar, for example, CAN be hurt by paladins' anti-undead skills. But they don't see through invis, and they do run when they get low on health. Same goes for the skeletons (iksar slaves etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have to agree that I have yet to be spotted by anything while invis there. You can even trigger both worm and rock traps while invis without having it drop.<br />
<br />
People that dont bother to invis themselves and dont bother to let others know that they are training should not be allowed to play a game like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">an occasional shissar can see thru inviso on the run from the grey to the temple. just do a little /c and he is easy to avoid. I will usually run along the small hills to the right of the zone when heading out and never have any problems getting spotted. Camping the front side of the temple is a death wish.  People will train it. Back side I usually avoided trains except when  trained seemingly intentional because jerk#003 wannted the camp or they were just stupid.  There will always be inconsiderate ppl and you can let it get to you and have a brain aneurism or work around such people.  People who do this stuff regulary get noticed and someone will return the favor.  The shissar around the temple seemed to be a best source of organs around.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The stuff that sees through invis is pretty rare. On my server i see the same guild constantly training stuff in more than just the grey and telling me stuff sees through invis when i can get to the same spot 90% of the time without a train(going to ahkeva for example).<br />
<br />
   In the grey ive even set the traps off and while invised the wurm/bolderling whatever just stands there and doesnt attack me. But all in all i can handle the training if you take the path away from groups and zone in while calling it. Ive camped the golems out front without a problem from the trains if know they are coming. Its the raids that come in waves of people and somehow manage to make a train each and everytime that gets annoying and than dont call it. Sure if i happen to be hunting towards or close to a zone in/out i know it can be more dangerous and can live with the advance warning without a gripe from me.</div></div><hr />
