<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Having used the enchanter for CC in a previous life, I found that root worked just fine for the occasions that I just needed to get away from a mob while the MT gained agro, but now it's a way of life.  I was curious about what the shaman populous thought was the way to go with the root line of spells.  There is no MR counter on any of the three I have available at level 51, so is it just a matter of potential durations?  Root for 30m still seems like the way to go to me, till Greater Immobilize at least.<br />
<br />
I'm sure this was hashed out by people a long time ago, but I didn't find any threads on the search.  Sorry for old biz, but I was really curious.<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />

Instill sucks, never used it after the first fight I had it and died.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Haimon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">At 61 I still use good ol' original root. Only exception is when I'm in ghetto mez mode.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Think I have Paralyzing Earth memorized.  Really nice when it lasts the full 3 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still use plain ol root too.  The other 2 spells seem to be resisted more and break quicker.  Root seems to last long enough for me to land 2 dots, e-bolt and plague.  As well as get off about 5 blasts with JBB before breaking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tunzell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Okay, that pretty much gives me what I need I think.  For the .25 seconds speed, i'll use less then half the mana with Root vs Immobilize, and Instill I don't see a huge advantage for in any case.  Seeing that I'm NOT 56+, I won't be using Paralyzing Earth anytime soon.  Though for a 3 minute potential, I might use it when I have the option.<br />

Anyone else have a comment?<br />
<br />
Thanks :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Used to use Root when Dotting or needing to hold the mob in place for a short duration, and Immobilise when parking adds.  Now just use Greater Immobilise for all, saves worrying about which root is up, and it's not like mana is ever a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I prefer the longer lasting roots....I mean...it lasts longer...can't argue with that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">It's rare that I'm parking a mob for too long before someone else jumps on it, and its always nice to have the option to root when you're at &lt;10%h and little to no mana.  Basically when the **** hits the fan you can't go wrong with plain old root.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My main use for root is a quick &quot;get it off me&quot; so I can either run away or park it until a melee can get on it. I use the quickest casting root (in my case greater immobilize). If I ever find myself root/dotting a mob I will use the longer casting/lasting root but the quick cast root is the one I keep memmed by default.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Another thing to do is check Lucy's and look at the resist modifier.  The only thing greater Immob has over Immobilize is .05 secs iirc, AND a -30 to the resist.  So it'll land easier.<br />
<br />
The only thing I care about with root is how fast it casts.  When it's REALLY important to root, it's because the thing isn't slowed yet (otherwise, it's not really a problem).  Root fast so you can slow, the rest of it's trivial.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've used immobilize since i got it and never had any complaints.<br />
<br />
I hear that once you have your lvl64 and 65 dots that have no dmg components to break root it is worth to use the lvl64 root, petrifying earth.  even though it has a 180 mana cost i heard its very hard to resist and lasts a long time.. i havent used it much so i can't confirm because i dont actually have the 64 and 65 dots.. but until you get those i would go with normal immobalize.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well use to play wizzy so root was my life saver.  There are few things that are different about the roots and depending on what you are doing some are better then others.<br />

The bit I know of root spells are as follows this I have learned from both reading up and personal experience.  Roots type spells have a given duration they will last.  When root spells are first cast the target in question gets to check its resistance against the spell.  If the target fails its resist check it becomes rooted.  Now for every tick or so till the duration of the spell has completed the target gets to check its resistance against the spell again at a small penalty.  If at any time the target receives any type of Direct Damage from a Spell it immediately gets to check its resist verses the spell again at a bonus.  This is why most roots break while you are nuking them.  I believe that the resist check also has the casters level verses the targets level taken into account as well.  I believe this as most higher-level target to the caster tend to break root sooner then the lower level targets.  Spells that do not cause Direct Damage to a rooted target do not give the target any extra chances or bonuses to the target-breaking root.  So if your casting a mix of DD type spells and non-DD type spells cast the DD spells last.  <br />
<br />
One more bit interesting fact I have discovered is that the basic Root spell is the exact same length of time as our Poison Dot spells so if you wait a sec or two after you apply your Poison Dot on a creature and then reapply your root you will get a nice warning before you root is going to brake.<br />
<br />
Note to self: Make sure I change all the numbers when trying to maintain formating. hehehe Thanks for the catch on the mana cost. Added in the lvls of the roots as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>KaisonIcebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Chazic forgot <br />
<br />
Petrifying Earth(lvl 64)<br />
Mana: 180, Cast Time: 2.50 , Duration: 3 Min<br />
Has a build in Resistance modifier of 30<br />
<br />
its my prefrence  wile solo  for the  duration its cheaper the Greater Immobilize on mana  as it regularly last the entire duration reaplying Greater Immobilize cost ya 450m compared to the 180  <br />
<br />
grouping i perfer Greater Immobilize<br />
<br />
in the end  look at the info make your own  choice <br />
<br />
(good post Chazic )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just root rotted for the first time in a loong time tonight.  Hot damn, petrifying earth is nice.  neg 30 resist + malo = longass roots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">For groups, I use immobilize.<br />
<br />
Soloing, I use paralying earth.  After mal* I can usually layer on plague and ebolt; bane breaks it most of the time, but I've had good luck with PE lasting through all 3 lately.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The mana cost for Instill is 60, not 20, according to Lucy.</div></div><hr />
