<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>biran808</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have stopped playing eq for a bit due to the shaman situation that exists. I will monitor these boards to check for good news about our class until WoW comes out. After that I will go to the new game if nothing has been done prior to its release. <br />
<br />
This may be a silly question but is there a list you can be put on to be notified of a shaman change should there be one?    I would like to hear about it so I may come back into the game.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaeydee</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A list?  Seriously?  No, there is not a list to be notified.<br />
<br />
And I doubt we get a whole class change before WoW comes out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">EQ will do what it's done with every other MMORPG release.  It will implement everything about WoW that's popular, that can be easily coded.  Over time, they'll bring in all the more difficult, or less popular bits.  <br />
<br />
EQ hasn't seen any innovation in a good while, and I doubt it would EVER see anything new if it didn't scavenge from the ideas of the new games.  Every patch demonstrates the spaghetti code the game has become with the turnover in programming staff, and their inability to keep track of the most seemingly benign changes.<br />
<br />
Sorry if I sound bitter, I was overly hopeful about gettin into the ol WoW beta.  *grin*</div></div><hr />
