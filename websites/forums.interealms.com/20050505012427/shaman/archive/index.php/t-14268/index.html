<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">i went in with a necro a lil ways then came back and got a cleric and monk friend. the mobs there that i was hitting were dark blue with LoY style HP, they were all undead which the necro loved and the short time we were there before raid was called we made liek 3-4 % exp of REAL exp , not AA and we were not even there 1 hour, probably like 30 min just goofing off and exploring , never got to a camp and chain pulled or whatever. Did find a room that screams to be camped, i just know something pops there that drops something.<br />
<br />
Anyway , my feedback is its very kunark feeling, which as time goes on i realize kunark was the best expansion EQ ever put out and whoever designed it needs to be given medals.  im not talking drop rates of spells or whatever, but im talking about dungeons and the lay out and character of them. I stepped in and was instantly feeling like i was in chardok or CoM and i liked it ALOT. i hope more comes. Im really intrested in checking out droga and nurga as i liked these places alot and you can raise your chardok faction while making exp/loot. <br />
<br />
Anyway, i am  actualy excited about getting on tomarrow and exploring this zone more. Not about th emob i can kill or the loot, but just experiencing the zone and mobs and hopefuly lore. Thats definetly been a while and im happy to feel it again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My feelings exactly.<br />
<br />
<br />
I went to Veksar earlier today with a bunch of guildies and I loved it. There were some nice drops, the mobs resists seemed to be pretty low, and it looked very nice. We had more than one group so we just joined up in raid. The exp was slow but that was because of raid, I'll be going back later, probably when its not so packed. It wasnt bad today, only like 35 people but I get the feeling for the next month or so it'll be packed. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Besual</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Few thoughts from the shaman point of view about the zone:<br />
<br />
The zone istn't very (solo) shaman friendly (at least the undeads): Even the light blue (tolvel 65) undeads resisted ALL posion / disease DoT AFTER malosinia / malicious decay landed. WTH do all mobs with high PR  have high DR too? Well, they are not hard to tank but only using cold DDs and doggy to kill them isn't very efficent.<br />
<br />
No probems to dot the golems. Easy to slow too.<br />
<br />
I was only 30min in zone before raid started so I might missed some intressting points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I went in here with a few guildies and had a blast.  All i have to say is /cheer soe.  The first time in a long time i actually had a good time exploring a new zone.  The named mobs that i found wheren't ungodly tough and their resists where pretty weak.  Avg hit points for the lvl of the mobs and compared to pop mob damage output its anemic in there.  The drops that i say in /ooc and the ones we found where actually something that could be used by a mid 50's toon.... and use them as upgrades.  Ran into some nasty shaman mobs too hehe.  The sucker root parked the ranger tank the mage pet and mage and then preceeded to dot us all lol.  I felt like i was dueling for a bit.  Very fun gonna make this zone my new home i think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Didn't find any mobs that hit for more than 375.  Found a couple named spawns, we cleared through the underwater section and explored the deeper part for a good while.  Eventually found a &quot;spirit of garudon&quot; who had a really crappy quest message, that pretty much ended with &quot;bring me four samples...&quot; - but never mentioned what he wanted a sample of.  We eventually found a room that looked like what he described, and after a few kills found a dragonshard bone, that ID'd as &quot;bone of garudon&quot;.  Unfortunately there are only about 12 mobs around, and the respawn is 30 minutes (or more), and the drop rate is damn low.  We got 3 shards in 3 hours, so we'll have to go back tonight and get the 4th.  Anyone else have any luck working with this guy?  We're assuming handing in the pieces will spawn him, then we fight him.<br />
<br />
Found another named spawn in a temple nearby, Warlock something... dropped a 35 hp/mana summon companion belt.  Killed something that looked like a PH a few times, but a named never popped, so not sure.<br />
<br />
Also, the pathing can get REALLY bad.  At one point we pulled a mob from a room, he ran out the backdoor, through a pathway, through another room, out it's front door, agro'd 3 other undead mobs and 4 golems, then ran around the front of all the buildings to meet us with his party.  Had a couple other instances where mobs just went nutso and took off to find friends first.<br />
<br />
Got about 75% of an aa in a few hours, not super exp, but we were doing a lot of exploring and not in a huge hurry.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>bueis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">ok no one has mentioned this so I will ask, since this is technically a Kunark zone, do Kunark era spells drop, be nice to have another spot for the high level ones to be obtained.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Anything for a 65 shaman + friends to do in this zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Went through some of Veksar with a group, after servers came up.  It has a very good dungeon feel to it.  It has a purplish tint, which gives a relief from the rusty brown decor so many other dungeons have.   Drops are appropriate for the level range of the zone.<br />
<br />
My only issue with the zone is, the layout doesn't branch off early enough (like Sebilis for instance) to give groups seperate exploring/camping space.  For a good hour, my group group kept bumping heads with another, because there was only one way to.  Felt like we were corraled around for a while.  <br />
<br />
We finally ended up in an area we split off.   My group found this area with air/water pushing a large stone into the air.  Beyond it, was a ramp of broken columns that ran up high along a wall.  We went up that and fought our way further and stopped there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Didn't see any kunark spells drop in a few hours there.  Did get a few (3-4) of the newer research things, but I can never remember what spells they're for.</div></div><hr />

I think they did this on purpose.  Sony is trying to promote grouping once again.  Making zones that arent difficult for groups but are rough to solo is one method of doing this.  They get a much improved return on zones with 6 person groups than with soloists.  More groups=more players=more subscriptions=more money.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I went in with a enchanter guildmate of mine and explored for a couple hours. Zone looks nice, the gargoyle mobs look cool, and found a nice ring on a named ghost. It was AC 5, 7 wis, 35 hps, 55 mana and a couple other stats..all/all. Saw another named, but one of the other exploring groups snagged it before we could and it dropped a shoulder item that had 55 hps and mana, plus a bunch of other stats.<br />
<br />
I had the same thought as Ramhorn regarding the layout. There is only one way to go for quite a while, so there were 2 or 3 other groups of people exploring right alongside my guildie and I. We tried to find someplace where we could split off by ourselves but that never happened. Then one of those other groups caused a train that killed us and half of their own group.  :( They also tried to gank the named from us when they saw us fighting it. Thanks Spirit Call/Torrent of Poison.</div></div><hr />

I'd be careful with that. Garudon was a dragon (second in command to Trakannon) that led an assault on that place, and ended up getting trapped inside and fighting to the death. Soooo, expect a big undead dragon probably around Trakanon's difficulty when you spawn him :)<br />

Many undead MOBs are highly resistant/immune to psn/disease, at least the upper end undead; nothing unexpected here.</div></div><hr />

Turning in the bone shards does spawn Garudon, an undead skeletal dragon. Took a necro friend and I a couple days to gather the dragon bone shards. He did the turn in to spawn Garudon and with the help of one of the highend guilds on Fennin Ro they killed it. <br />
<br />
I went to bed early that night but here is what he told me of the encounter. Garudon cons red at level 65, quads for around 1k, has an AOE that does 650dd and a nasty DOTand has a couple hundred thousand hitpoints. Looks similar to Draco from Fear. Loot wasn't too bad, dropped a set of greaves and a mace.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Veksar is fantastic. It uses a fair few char models, and has a very cool kunark feel but at the same time a uniqueness with the lizard type things. Had a dungeon crawl yesterday, rogue, necro, me(shaman) and warrior. It was great to go exploring, the big hitters kinda deep in gave good exp. And we obtained about 4 loots, a 31% haste belt one of them. Also killed a lvl 65 mob called remains of sythriex or something hit for 800 ish fully slowable. Dropped a dmg 48 dly 43 sword. <br />
<br />
This would have been a fantastic expansion just before pop came out, even now it is good but I don't think it will obtain the numbers it could have got. I like the fact that most of it is undead too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Old Seb, with a dash of CoM.  Great, great zone.  Decent drops for the risks, great look, great layout, not terrible exp, and the mobs drop cash.  I plan on spending a nice bit of time here, at least till they nerf drop rates.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>kiztent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I've been living there.  The 58 SK/56 SHM 2 box is great for ripping through the warriors out front - decent loot and decent exp.<br />
<br />
Grab some more people at zone in and start crawling in.  SH is pretty low population, but there's always someone LFG at zone in.<br />
<br />
The linearity of the zone is a downside, but it's brilliant otherwise.<br />
<br />
Unlike the new Nurga revamp.  SSDD (just higher level).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Ive been to several camps here. One was the big room after the first set of golems.  Has about 10-15 spawns and 2 named that pop in room.  All spawns were drk blue to me at 65.  Mobs have low aggro radius so you can single pull the whole room.<br />
<br />
Another camp was pretty deep past the hand area.  We saw a lvl 65 named Skeleton &quot;remains of Sythrax&quot; which dropped a nice 1hs with an aggro proc. I sent the SS into Allakhazams.<br />
<br />
The great thing about this zone is even though it takes a little time to get  to the deeper camps, most a re very close the the actual zone out/in.  You can leave the camps via ramps that drop you down into the main courtyard.  You can target friends for CoH and even drag corpses through. So if you want to insert more replacements, have them die near the wall then target and drag them in and rez.  Guildies did this over the weekend.<br />
<br />
Most mobs can be slowed with Turgurs the first shot with no debuff.  The deeper camps require debuffing.<br />
<br />
The closer camp was easily head by 3 of us (65 War, Clr, Shm).<br />
<br />
Some decent loot drops here including the Kylong Gauntlets which I am know using since the were better then Wolf Callers and Hurricane.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Just went here for first time last night. Unfortunately, it was near the end of the night, so didn't get much time. Like others said, we were following another group around for a while before we could move ahead and find our own camp. XP was great for the group (sham (me), enc, 2 war's, mage, cleric - all 53-55). Went to a pretty open area, saw a lot of golems and stuff around. We were able to single pull, but the vessels kept gating and coming back and bringing golems with them, so we wound up having to evac. Made about half a yellow or so at 54 in about 30 minutes at that area, killing about 3-4 golems and a few of those vessels. After we evaced, it was 245 am, way past my bedtime, I wish I could have stayed, it was a lot of fun. By the way, at 54, I didn't have too much trouble slowing, out of about the 8 or 9 of the deeper mobs we pulled (golems and vessels were in the 52-55 range) I slowed 5 or 6 with no debuff, other time were resisted, I got summoned, and all of a sudden im down to 45% lol. Seemed they both were highly resistant to malosi though, as I received multiple resists on one or two, then said hell with it, just do the slow, which stuck. Nothing really cool dropped though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kbok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I was very impressed with the lack of lag!</div></div><hr />

Best droppable Shaman wearable gloves in the game (well, on par with Livestone but those are vaporwear). Do tell where in the zone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Anyone been to that room with the 4 mobs walking in a circle around a big pillar?   We killed them hoping a named would spawn or something...  nothing happened.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">They dropped off a common mob. I think they are one of the random drops. Ive heard them drop from different places but I got mine in the deep camp I was at that was near the lvl 65 spawn we killed. Kind of an open room up some steps. Has lots of Nobles and higher mobs.</div></div><hr />
