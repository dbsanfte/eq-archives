<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gettinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hahahahahahaha!  Another satisfied customer who has the smallest taste of what it's like to be an ubah shammy.  You have so much to look forward to yet.  Turgur's at 51 is our mainstay.  So many new buffs and then group buffs.  Acumen is nice.  Bane of Nife rocks!  OMG, Regrowth of Dar Khura is sweet!  And the best thing of all that I've acquired is Torpor.  I can kill stuff that I would not have dared try before.  Who would have thought that one spell could make so much difference.  OOM to FM in like 3 or 4 minutes (Canni spam included with each purchase).  :D  Gratz bro.  Stick with it.  It is well worth it to level a shammy to 60.  :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Do you guys remember that thread about &quot;JBB for Iksars&quot; in which everybody downplayed the power of the JBB vs. silly stuff like &quot;Iksars start with 100 swimming skill and 75 forage!&quot;?<br />
<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
Grats on the JBB though. It really is an awesome piece of equipment.<br />
<br />
(As for the dude who said he wanted to quit because he wouldn't see one on his server: Don't quit man. Just imagine yourself to be an iksar.)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;Just imagine yourself to be an iksar&quot; <br />
But without the extra wis, ac, regen, forage, and infravision of course.  Honestly if I had it to do again, i'd go iksar and JBB be damned.  <br />
<br />
Being a powerful shaman is fun tho, I recommend it highly.  <br />
<br />
Last night this guildie paladin was talkin bout how he wanted a talisman from a WW dragon.  SO i said let's go get one!  SO we ran over to WW and set up beside good old Yeldema.  She went down so easy . . . think I had to Torpor him only once.  Course I tanked about a quarter of that fight due to all the dots I was keeping on old Yeldema.  She dropped a talisman and some reinforced boots.  <br />
<br />
Then we set our sights on something a bit bigger.  Hecheva down the coast a bit.  We prepped with a bit of resist cold and some instaclicks and went to it.  It was a rough start.  I recommend that anyone who attempts this one keep Malosini memmed pre-fight, as it greatly facilitates slow getting in on old Hech.  Got her slowed finally, and went to work, had her at about half life when Von added and Gfluxed us both to death in seconds.  Bleh.  <br />
<br />
So we added a ranger and came back, killed Yeld again and then pulled Hech to Yeld's nest.  wiped the floor with her too.  Dropped a couple of spells . . . price check on the lvl 60 BST manaregen spell?  <br />
<br />
Anyway, thought I'd share in case anyone else was thinking of doing this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Duffe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have a JBB , and i personally don't think it is as great as everyone says it is, at least not till 60. Up until i hit lvl 60, i usually did the root rot method , i think i used pet once or twice. <br />
<br />
Now that i am 60 though , with torpor, i dot,tank and jbb all day long. It's much more useful now at 60 than it was before. I rarely used it to solo.<br />
<br />
I will admit though, it is nice, just not as nice as those that can't use it seem to think it is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Smasherr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i THINK (think being a relative term for an ogre)<br />
<br />
That the JBB benefits different styles of shamans in different ways.<br />
<br />
I play a AC shammy so i do not need to worry about root breaking.  I simple chain nuke da baddies till they die. Tanking while i nuke.  Since I setup my gear with high AC my wisdom and manapool is pitiful.  So manaless damage saves my bacon..:)<br />
<br />
A wisdom shammy can't stand infront of the mob and tank...they have to root...nuke..root..nuke...so they will not find the JBB as godlike as i do.  Basically like a druid with no snare..:)<br />
<br />
Tank shammy JBB= GOD<br />
Caster shammy JBB=danger to their life</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I play on tholluxe, otherwise known as the pit of despair.  Wish you could transfer servers with gear intact i'd move in a second to a server that you at least SAW a jbb for sale once every blue moon.  I've NEVER seen one for sale on tholluxe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'll agree somewhat with this, higher AC, less damage you take. But i can stand there and tank just as well as you can. My wis is now 222, Ac is 1003. Lvl 58 iksar shaman. When duo-ing with the other shammy in my guild a 60 barb w/ jbb.  He Malosini's, I slow, He epics, i bane and melee, he clicks and blasts. Works out well .. i keep Aggro most of the fight, until about a 1/5th health left on mob. Then i begin the cann4 dance. He torpors me, he canns, we full mana almost all the time.<br />
  Jbb does not make a shaman &quot; god- like&quot; the person behind the PC makes there shaman &quot;god-like&quot;. Im sure most of you will agree with me on this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Anos |phattie|</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">just have to know where to look Ogrym...they very very rarely ever make it out of a guild...as soon as someone wants to sell thiers...they are usually offered to guildies then to their alts...<br />
<br />
if a crypt grp gets one...u can bet its going to be sold very quickly as the word spreads that some cleric in OS just got a jbb drop....anyways...keep your chin up..it is possible...send me tell in game so i know ur game name and i will personally keep an eye out for one for ya...<br />
<br />
GL on ur search and you are right...i have only seen one for sale in EC on TP ever...extremely rare</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Shalara De'Tan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Soupy -- I still stand by my statements, the JBB isn't the Godly item that some people seem to think.  The JBB is good in some places (forget Velious) if you are gonna solo.  But I make a LOT more XP in a decent group than by soloing, so I don't solo.<br />
<br />
I also don't do pickup groups, ever.  Never, ever, ever.  So if I am playing a weird hour, at worst, I'll duo with my rogue (I admit, I'm so spoiled with the ability to dual box, but even before then, I would just grab a partner and go).  I still get XP faster in my duo then I ever got soloing pre-second machine days.  I'd much rather root the mob, stand close while it beats on Shalara, and let my rogue Backstab her hearts content.<br />
<br />
Hmm... 263 damage every 8 seconds, with chances to break root, or a speeded double backstabbing meat grinder pumping out WAY more DPS?<br />
<br />
No contest.  <br />
<br />
Bagged the JBB to wear a Bracelet of Sense.  <br />
<br />
I pulled out the JBB for IV in Ahkeva once recently.  I think I got off 3 or 4 casts in between removing curses, /assist healing, crippling, and canna/torporing.<br />
<br />
Whee.  What a Godly item. ;)<br />
<br />
Edit:  Let me point out that I have taken out Guardian Worms in SF, Cliff Golems in OT, the requisite Yeldema in WW in my duo -- all without pulling out the JBB once.  I'm WAY more efficient constantly dancing and healing someone that can do REAL damage than plinking away with my space ghost bracer. =p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ogrym</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thanks for the offer anos but considering I saw someone get laughed at for offering 25k and i heard the going rate on em is 50k, it'll be awhile before i have that kind of cash just laying around.  At 55 I still don't spend alot of time in item camps and am usually flat broke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Zenyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I would give my left arm for a JBB right now.  I have never seen one for sale before in all of my levels and all of my characters.  I haven't even met a shaman with one before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Chikarsis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Zenyn, I dunno where you've been looking or asking (or if you have...) but they're pretty common on Tarew. I've seen twinks wearing them that aren't even high enough to use them ;)<br />
<br />
Not a common sale item, but if you've spent time in EC/GFay/Bazaar you must have seen one for sale.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Actually, I am pretty happy beeing an iksar. Atleast I do not have to worry about ever getting a JBB. No bracer(tm) frustration for me baby! <br />
Only thing that enoys me abit are these kind of threads where people instantly start debating the value of the jbb when a shaman brother happily announces he just got one. Obviously Banana (how did that got through the name filter anyway?)  is pretty happy about it and felt like sharing this with us, without intending another JBB debate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Hey Shalara...my fiancee' and I are almost equal level now, and we were wanting to try the rogue/shaman duo.  Any advice or pointers I need to know beforehand?  <br />

<br />
 Drum roll please.....<br />
<br />
4pp 6gp!  It's vendor sold in Shadow Haven in the Merchants regular inventory. Probably isn't supposed to be there but it and three other dropping spells are there.</div></div><hr />

/sigh  closes eyes and goes back to dreaming</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Targuran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hey fellow TP shammies! <br />
All I can say is keep your chin up and your eyes and ears peeled.  I honestly gave up on my JBB search 2 times (and spent most of the money I had saved up for it). The third time I saved up enough to afford one I spent about 3 days in EC auctioning for one and on the third day I got a tell from someone who had just gotten one to drop.<br />
<br />
BTW is it true that the mob who drops it is now unslowable?  If so, that is probably why it has double (if not tripled) in price. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Lynnara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Just had to poke my head in and say WHASSUP to all my fellow Tholuxe Paells shaman... <br />
<br />
I too am finding it incredibly difficult to find a JBB... but I won't give up the search!!  Hey Anos, you wanna keep an eye out for me too?  <br />
<br />
:p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I think they nerfed the JBB drop rate personally so prices will be going up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I heard that JBBing mobs gives them the ability to death touch you. Watch out!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Fedayeen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sigh, loong way to go, bu I'll get there, if they dont close down EQ first</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>tinysun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">/yawn~<br />
<br />
there are definately something other than JBB that amaze you..why keep talking this one?<br />
<br />
say OT hammer?i love my OT hammer.i'd sell my soul to VS just for a OT hammer(and i must btw) =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">As a previous JBB shaman on my old server I have to vote with Shalara.  A good melee partner is worth way more than a jbb.  Solo it is a very nice tool indeed, but is limited to non-cold resistant monsters, and is best used by tanking shaman so some interrupts are in order as well (if not an ogre).<br />
<br />
I am building a new shaman on FV server, partnered with my girlfriends monk.  If there is even a jbb around it is definately not for sale.  I admit to feeling a certain freedom to spend my money on gear as  I approach 45, rather than farming and scrimping to save enough for a jbb.  I will likely get one about the time I can camp it  and I don't think i will really miss it in the mean time.</div></div><hr />
