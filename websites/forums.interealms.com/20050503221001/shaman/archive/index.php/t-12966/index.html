<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>GeddarRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Get 65 and farm BoT named with a small group daily, you'll make a grip of cash fast.  Sold silk pants for 100k 3 times now.  300k for 3 kills is'nt too shabby imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never farmed PoG, but I have heard that with all the gem drops it is a great source of money.  What is wrong with it, now?<br />
<br />
Anyways, I have never been much of a cash farmer.  I get most of my money just by hunting in PoV.  Get liquids and talons and sell them while getting great exp.  This isn't as good as it used to be, though.  Not as big a demand.<br />
<br />
Another method I did for a while was hunting WW dragons.  A 65 shaman can kill all of the nest dragons very easily, solo.  If you are on giant faction, farm the heads for barbed dragonscale boots and pauldrons, and sell for 5k each.  One day I teamed up with an AM3 ranger and we annhiliated all the dragons in the canyon where ToV is.  Pull a dragon to the back of the hallway and tank it, while the ranger stands where sont is and shoots away.  He is out of AE range, so he won't take any damage, but he will be dishing out a LOT.  In my experience, the canyon dragons seem to drop heads more often than the nest dragons, but it could be my imagination.  I can solo Karkona, Alyyish, and the two dragons whose names start with D, but they aren't really worth the trouble solo.  Avoid Entariz, because he has a 400pt unresistable AE.  Ionat silences, so don't screw with him, either.<br />
<br />
Cazic Thule used to be an amazing source of money, and it is still pretty good, though there is not as big a demand as there used to be.  A small group can farm most of the camps there.  There is stuff for everyone, so get some friends together and start farming.  Get yourselves all the items you want from CT (great stuff for all class and just about every slot, seriously...  They did such an awesome job itemizing CT I can barely believe it was VI's work), and sell the rest.<br />
<br />
Farming BoT named or tactics for runes / patterns is also very nice, although there is a lot of competition for spawns.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Level 56 here, no flags, no superguild, no platwhore alts (A single level 60 chanter can fill your pockets in no time).<br />
<br />
Plane of Growth used to be my place of choice. Even grouped with six men, the cash split is great. nearly 1k per hour, due to all the gems and crap. Now that the Protectors are back in, well, I'm not going to try to bother. Glad i ruined my faction in a zone I'll never waste time setting foot in again. Makes me feel like i accomplished something.<br />
<br />
Ahem.<br />
<br />
These days, most of my plat comes from Dulak. 3 - 7pp per kill, with weapons that sell like fine steel, and the occasional high-price gem. Also plenty of racial meats - It's not to uncommon to get enough off a single pirate to make an illusion potion and have plat left over.<br />
<br />
High Keep is also good, if irritating. Guards drop loot like Dulak without gems, but are half the level and a third the HP. They're also highly contested.<br />
<br />
When all else fails, wipe out dungeons. DogDog can take on most of Lower Guk, Permafrost, SolA / B, Nurga and Droga, Crystal Caverns, you name it. Any place is good plat if you can kill quickly there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I fought for a number of levels in HHK, which netted me a nice bank roll. I then concocted a plan which I termed the &quot;Lynuga Ruby Swindle&quot;, which involved feign death/snare pulling lynuga to the hand in innothule swamp with a few stacks of rubies and a few alts around on a friend's account. You hand the rubies in one by one, and sell the hammer or axe to the vendor until you got an ivyndyr's hoop. Then transfer the hoop to the alt stationed nearby, and repeat. Worked quite well back when those earrings sold for a good amount.<br />
<br />
Then I did fine plate smithing in its hey day. Then tinkbows on a gnome alt for a bit. Then I gm'd smithing, among the first ogre on my server to do so (so I ended up outfitting most of the fatty sk's). And I was able to get in on the nightmare bow gravy train.<br />
<br />
Lots of ways to make cash if you keep your eyes open.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I looked at my bank account and some guildies and I realized I'm rich ... and didn't even know it. Your post started me thinking about how I made all that money. <br />
<br />
Most of my career, I duoed with a monk.<br />
<br />
In our 30s and 40s we spent a lot of time killing giants in FM/DL. They drop a lot of items worth 10pp to vendors. We probably averaged a few hundred pp a day doing that. <br />
<br />
In our late 40s to early 50s we spent a lot of time in CoM. We accumulated a bunch of trance sticks, staff of the scorned, and the other stuff that drops randomly off any mob in that zone. Over christmas of 2001, when we had a lot of time off, we made 30k from items there. Of course, the prices have dropped, so you really can't do that now. <br />
<br />
In our late 50s we killed time in sebilis, ME and UP. Sebilis had good cash loot, while in ME we got lots of drops of stuff that we equipped, thereby letting us sell some of our gear for cash. In UP we got lots of items off the mini-named (Raldukan etc). <br />
<br />
My point is that we never really spent much time &quot;farming&quot; for cash, like going to PoG or HG in Rathe or anything like that. We just made sure that where we were hunting for exp also had a steady cash source. After enough dead mobs and saving your pennies, we wound up with a lot of cash in the bank.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Smithing.  Takes an insane amount of time and initial investment, but I was lucky enough to have friends fund it and help me gather materials, so that I could outfit one of them in cultural.  It doesn't make me nearly as much as it used to, but there isn't much left for sale that I could use.  But then, I'm also the only barb GM smith on the server, or at least the only one actively advertising.  It's a steady trickle now, enough to support my obsession with faction quests and the occasional spendy purchase.  But any competition from another barb smith and it'd probably dry up entirely.</div></div><hr />

for example on my server forest loops can go for as much as 400 and you can see them for as little as 300 buy it low and sell it high.<br />
<br />
while this is an example of an item that is relatively cheap, they also move quickly. and there are items that are more expensive that you can get and sell for better profit margins.<br />
<br />
you just have to pay attention to the prices.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>KryssAndTrip</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I just use my retired Paladin to solo MoBs for me, put the items he received on sale in bazaar and made money that way. He's been camped in PLA for over a month (and still no JBB...) and while it's slow money and pretty boring, it's fairly easy. Same with eBoots (2k each on my server) and Djarn's Amethyst Ring (4k on my server). At 63 with all his spells he can solo almost anything old world. With a 65 Cleric and 65 Shaman we trioed Talendor in SkyFire and got a copy of Torpor there. I also made a nice bit of cash trading in bazaar, buying low and selling high, and especially selling his 64/65 spells and their doubles that were banked. it nets me a decent amount of money when I either have time or get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I made my cash tailoring and other trade skills. I was nearing 250 tailoring skill and a high skill in most other tradeskills when the Earring of the Solstice quest came out. I made misty thicket baskets, lotus pies, robes (they sold for 4k and I could make them for less than 1k!) and the fishing poles etc and made tons.<br />
<br />
Of course skilling up in tailoring drove me crazy and when i finally did hit the 250 mark i ended up quiting eq for a few months.  :p <br />
<br />
Nowadays the items are not selling for much and for the time effort you can spend making them you are better off getting your cash some other way.<br />
<br />
How I make money now is LoY. There are some nice money items that drop there and even the yard trash drop decent plat and vendor loot. I look up what drops in some of those LoY zones that i think would sell well, see what drops it, see where it drops etc then go there and set up camp until i get the item. (I have sold 3 Soulstrippers and two of the cloaks the Enraged Soulstealer drops for a profit of about 32k doing this) This is easy for me to do though since I work from home.. I can set up camp.. set my spawn timer for mob then go afk in between PH spawns and work.  ;) <br />
<br />
Of course I am still broke since the 65 spells cost so darn much. Just spent 90k on Fo7.. only to have it drop in price to about 60k a week later.. /sigh</div></div><hr />

also, ive found that people auctioning in zones like pok sell things for cheaper, not wanting to deal with the bazaar and get the money quicker. i made out great a few times, not even trying to buy low/sell high, just looking for upgrades for myself. i got SCHW for 1.5k, and prob could have resold it right away for at least 2k, at 3k it would have sold eventually. also got arctic wyvern cloak for 200pp, which i could prob sell for 1k. a few others too, but you get the idea. these are relatively cheap items too, but if you think percentage wise, 33% profit for a 25k is a little more than 8k. personally, too boring for me playing the trader game, though my lower level does allow me to make plat and xp at same time, but in future if i have a problem, id stick to slaughtering greenies, or selling tradeskill items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It happened.  In addition to duping, people also used macros to make money.  If you do certain fletching items, the finished product sells for more than the components.  However, it is a small profit per combine, so it isn't worth doing manually.  There is a program and documentation on a site (which I won't link to) that lets you create a macro that will do the combines at a super high speed.  The most common fletching macro nets someone about 1k an hour, and can be done at any fletching vendor.  There was also talk of a macro that used combination fletching/tinkering to create 30k an hour, but it could only be done in one particular spot and once the GM's caught on, they started watching there.  Unfortunately, they were too late and millions and millions of plat entered the economy.<br />
<br />
Just for clarification, I don't condone this at all, but I think people should know it is out there.  Mods feel free to delete this post if I said too much.  And if you see any level 1 chars standing around at a fletching vendor for hours at a time, petition them to a GM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Umm does anyone believe this BS? If people did dube im sure Sony would just ban them from game.<br />
<br />
Its not BS. ALOT of stuff was duped and I doubt even 10% got caught. Also, With MacroQuest you were able to do silly stuff like macke cheese, write a macro for it, go to bed, wake up in teh morning with 10k+ plat. Seriously. Thats why all the NPC handins ect have been nefred and are totally un profitable. If they were, someone would jsut ise MQ to afk make money.<br />
<br />
I never did it for fear of being banned but from looking at the MQ site, seems a ton of them did.<br />
<br />
The REAL problem with this is SOE/VI just dont have the customer service/man power to catch the cheaters. Even for stuff like petitions it can take them 6+ hours (or never) for serious stuff like a stuck corpse, being caught below the world, ect. They jsut dont have the time to check for cheaters.<br />
<br />
I wish MQ never came out. I know people with fully decked (buyable) gear and 100's of K in plat... under level 60 with no alts higher. I can't even afford a good 2 hander :(</div></div><hr />

Not only did Sony ban the people who kept doing it after a system-wide warning was issued, but they destroyed all the duped items and gold, no matter where they were (even if they were bought by unsuspecting peeps).  There was something wrong with the procedure, that marked the items being duped, so it made it easy for them to connect the dots.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I wouldn't recommend tradeskills to make money. Most of them are a pain to raise, and only make minimal profit except on the big items, which often involve painful drops and foraged items.<br />
<br />
The exception being if you can get in at the start of a trend, while items are new and expensive. This usually involves already having the tradeskill at sufficient level, because before long people realise it's a money-spinner, skill up, and undercut the prices, which then drop to minimal profit like everything else.<br />
<br />
Having said that, I work on alchemy (for fun and because it's a shaman thing), and I now make a little cash on Kilva's potions and Illusion potions. The market for them is fairly slow though, and it doesn't go anywhere near covering what I spent on it over the levels, but it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">This is a futile thread.<br />
<br />
I've spent a long time here on crucible, and people are more likely to share their sisters than their money-making secrets.<br />
<br />
The problem with cash-making schemes (type-1) is that once they are published they are quickly undercut and ruined.   There ARE a few left around, one that involves using a druid and a 2nd box char in Luclin comes to mind, but if that one got out (and it mostly has) the spot would be perma-camped and even though it's a vendor-sold item it would be useless as a camp.  These are mostly a matter of luck in finding them and cleverness in how you exploit them.<br />
<br />
Most of the 'type-2' plans involve killing lots of mobs who drop enough cash/mob to make it worthwhile.  Guards in HHK are an example of this method, but with a little thinking you can probably dream up lots of places this method would work.   Use an alpha-pet and epic for these for major efficient killing with very little risk. (Frogs? Giants? Badgers? Goblins?)<br />
<br />
There are many threads on ways to make money.  Ignore the &quot;go farm BoT&quot; threads 'cause we know how useless those comments can be to a soloing Shaman...instead take a look at zones that are under-utilized and ignored now that everyone wants the PoP experience.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">The Duping thing for eq is NOT bs, and it IS why the economy is so screwed up.<br />
<br />
In diablo 2 the same thing happened. people figured out how to dupe, and they duplicated thousands of these rings called &quot;stone of Jordan&quot;. There were literally thousands of them circulating about... if I had to make an economic translation I'd say each was worth about 5-8K platinum. The uberest of uber items (Nodrop didn't exist in diablo 2) could be bought with about 30 stone of jordan. They were the currency, because they had been duplicated so much.<br />
<br />
But the frequency of them dropping was actually insanely low. In fact in the many years I played, I never saw a single one drop. All of the ones that circulated were dupes. The economy was inflated and fake, and for that reason, buying even the most &quot;cheap&quot; items that cost &quot;only&quot; one Stone of Jordan was impossible for a new character, because he had no way of gaining any of this 'currency'. This is how it is in everquest. considering the drops of platinum off of Mobs, and considering vendor sale pp returns, I esimate without the inflation of dupes everything would be priced at about 33% of what it is now. Everything.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Obviously none of us would condone duping, even if we knew anyone who had done it... But my curiousity has been aroused! How on earth did people swindle the game into duplicating an item? I imagine it can't happen anymore.<br />
<br />
As for the macros, believe it, it really did happen... I remember seeing level one toons standing in front of fletching vendors with an afk sign over them - they might as well have said &quot;ban me&quot; in /ooc every 5 minutes... But so many people did it, I guess they couldn't ban them all... Except, they couldn't ban people for using macros, as it turned out.. Apparently unfair to people with RSI or other disabilities who might have to rely on macros to do stuff other people take for granted...<br />
<br />
Anyhoo... The top money making methods are...<br />
<br />
1. Sell KEI (needs a 60 chanter toon and 20k for the spell)<br />
<br />
2. Run a guild and run off with the guild vault - this has been done more than once on my server by the more unscrupulous lewt-whore guilds...<br />
<br />
3. Be totally uber and farm *really* high end stuff. But then you wouldn't need to ask if this applied to you...<br />
<br />
4. Be at the cutting edge. As in real life, the money is to be made when you do it first... Whether it's EoTS stuff back in the day, or the nice-quest-item-du-jour, it's a license to print money.<br />
<br />
Me, I did number 4, though I in no way consider myself rich. Comfortably off, not rich.<br />
<br />
One day, i was in the bazaar, and saw a couple of gold-tipped boar horns for sale on a vendor (about 10pp each). Bought them on a whim (this was well before the Perny cloak was widespread). I ended up selling 4 cloaks at 25k each, and that bankrolled a bit of bazaar bargain hunting...</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, there are alot of people who obtained their wealth without bugs.  Farming chardok and CT named is alot of money. There are many 3 boxers out there who can solo named and sell for high prices. In chardok if you are ally you can pull any mob to zone in alone, including named mobs.  If you go there after a patch or clear PHs, you can easily get wealthy.<br />

I have a decent amount of wealth. Before PoP i used to farm PSC in DN.  Farm for several hours until you get one, sell for 10k overnight.   That was easy money and good exp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new place on my server (Veeshan) for high level cash farming is Old Sebelis... 4k per hour with pet... most I've seen in zone during non-raid hours is 11 people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Believe it or not I never spent any time doing the exp grind in Seb, just some raiding. So now that I would like to attempt to go do some soloing there for some cash I just don't know my way around and a little worried about just blundering around. Guess I need to talk someone into guiding me around until I learn the zone better.</div></div><hr />
