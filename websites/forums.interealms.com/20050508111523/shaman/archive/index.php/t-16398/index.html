<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
I used my Figurine Charm from Pop to load my Adventurers Stone,<br />
<br />
but I have seen that the charms from Ldon can give you some nice stats, I think Ldon is very cool, and I know I won't be spending alot of time in pop.<br />
<br />
So can I deaugment the adventurer stone from the figurine.<br />
<br />
Adventurer stone is destroyed<br />
<br />
And then get a charm from wayfarer camp with my Adventurer points and then get another adventurer stone?<br />
<br />
If I can<br />
<br />
How do I get another adventurer stone, redo the newbie ldon quest in my hometown?</div></div><hr />

Look in your journal. The NPC I got mine from gave instructions on what to do if you lost it.</div></div><hr />
