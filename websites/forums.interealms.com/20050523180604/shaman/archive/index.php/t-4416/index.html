<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ximix the Troll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Zaspacer asked me to explain Bard / Shaman synergey in another thread - so here it is. Seemed to deserve a new thread.<br />
<br />
These observations come from my regular hunting group:<br />
<br />
War War Brd Cle Wiz Shm (me). <br />
<br />
The bard that I group with is one of the very best EQ players I have ever met. She is our puller, and uses numerous bard tricks to pull as well as any Monk I have seen:<br />
<br />
Lull song pulling to get 1 mob alone from a tight group<br />
<br />
Bard Speed / Lazy Aggro splitting (outrun the additional mobs that you don't want such that they give up the chase and return to spawn points, while bringing your target to camp)<br />
<br />
Gate Song splitting (gate unwanted adds back to their spawn points - after having pulled them far enough away to be out of chase range).<br />
<br />
She also makes great use of Singing steel helm eyeball, tracking, and bind sight to completely scout an area and plan the pulls.<br />
<br />
She fanatically studies every zone to learn which mobs are bard mezzable (55-), and which mobs are not 56+.<br />
<br />
All of this lets us usually avoid having more than 2 56+ mobs in camp at one time. Since we have 2 good tanks, we can tank 2 big mobs easily.  In a pinch, I can Torpor tank one mob if we have 3 56+ in camp. When things go bad, we evac to zone and try again.<br />
<br />
In terms of synergy with a shaman -<br />
<br />
Shaman debuff resists (Malo), and Slow better than enchanters do. Bards debuff magic resists (OOS, Orb of Tishan) too. This allows us to take on mobs that have very high magic resists and are hard to slow without an enchanter to Tash.<br />
<br />
Bards have superior Mana Draining ability to enchanters. The level 60 Bard mana drain song is dramatically more effective at stopping Complete Heal and Gate than anything an enchanter can do (especially vs. 56+ mobs).<br />
<br />
With Bard/Shaman - all the crowd control in your group is being handled by people with good AC and hitpoints. Your group does not die when one paper-thin enchanter goes down too fast due to a resist or two.<br />
<br />
Heck - Our cleric does not even bother to keep remedy memorized. No need to use such a tiny, fast heal when everyone in the group can take a few licks (except the wizard - and she is smart enough to avoid aggro).<br />
<br />
Bard Epic Haste is practically the best haste a group can have. Add the new Luclin &quot;over the cap&quot; haste songs to that, and bard haste is much much better than enchanter haste. It pays to keep our bard melee-ing, so that Dance of the Blade is always up on our melees. If we get too many adds in camp, though, and our bard can't melee - I just buff Celerity when Dance drops.<br />
<br />
Cantata is a superior buff to C3. It regens health, mana,  and stamina. The mana Regen is faster than C3 (I believe), especially with all of the things a bard can get to improve song effectiveness.<br />
<br />
An enchanter grouped with a shaman frequently has full mana with almost nothing to do but buff occasionally (depends upon the camp and skill of the puller, but happens a lot).<br />
<br />
Grouping with a good bard is like having one person performing the functions of both an enchanter and an extra melee damage dealer/uber-puller. Consider it a group of 7 that fits into a 6 person group! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Carrieanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like bards:<br />
<br />
Hp regen component - heals melee, heals me from cana, stacks with regrowth and bear form.<br />
Mana regen componenet - gives pallies etc mana, gives me mana..<br />
<br />
I don't haste with bards, I do cha them.<br />
<br />
:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Interesting fact, the malo line doesnt break bard mez whereas tash, strangely, does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">aye i would takre a bard over  chanter anyday<br />
<br />
plus the boon chanters have over writes my SoB which really chaps my bottom &gt;:-E<br />
<br />
 its a nice spell but it should really stack with SoB</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Glencannon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bard &gt; all others, as far as duoing with a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Shaman with regen tunic, regrowth, bear form, natural regen= anywhere from 28-50 health per tick.   Bard regen stacks, increase depending on which song and what instrument is used.  Let's just be conservative, and say 40-62 regen per tick now.<br />
<br />
Shaman can Slow (duh).  70% dmg mitigation.<br />
<br />
Bard sings Rune Song (lvl 49 dmg absorption--20pts per tick singing, 40pts per tick with instrument).<br />
<br />
Slowed mob + shaman regen + rune song + bard regen (twisting) =  very small amount of damage taken while tanking. <br />
<br />
I've done this with a guildie one time, and it was amazing.  Of course, he switches from weapons to a Lute during downtime, and continues to twist Rune + Cantata while I cannabilize.   While he's doing this, I can't get my health bar to go down (still using Cann 3).<br />
<br />
Try it out some time.  We had basically zero downtime, and were able to clear all Sentient Suits before repop.   (I have yet to try it with a C3 added on top of all this...)<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, bards can mezz adds, snare runners, and are much more willing to charm a beastie with me there to bail him out (sow + heals).   <br />
<br />
I only have Epic and Ikky regen, btw.  Fungal + JBB going for 100K on my server, and both mobs are perma-camped because of it.  Probably will never see either.  <br />
<br />
I'm currently leveling a bard on a second account.  Gonna get him to 40, and have him group with me, just sit there and sing Cantata all day with a good Lute.  I figure he might get 5% of each kill (I'm lvl 57).  <br />
<br />
Just my 2cp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sangori</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My husband plays a bard.  My favorite exp groups are me, bard and a warrior or monk with us.  We can go most anywhere with just the three of us.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Heh, i usually could do without a bard. Don't get me wrong, a good bard can do some great things, but there are too many drawbacks to them for the way I like to group. <br />
<br />
I don't like being limited to level 56 or lower mobs for bard to be able to crowd control. I like it when we get 5 or 6 mobs in came because then it can be a little more challenging. I don't like it that when a bard has to focus on CC of multiple mobs that we lose out on beneficial songs. I don't like the way that bard songs can aggro mobs if puller gets in range of song and its a bad pull or something (bard trains are naaaasty). I don't like the fact that for them to give some specific good buffs to some group members that MY precious buff slots get wasted with their songs as well. I don't like having our speed be dependant on procs and songs being played (see the issue about losing songs when a bard has to concentrate on multipl mobs for CC). <br />
<br />
Give me a good enchanter any day. That is my personal preference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure I would be quite so absolute. Bards are awesome, AND so are Enchanters.   VI has nerfed much of an Enchanters ability to completely neutralize encounters (The no-mezz zones) <br />
<br />
Take away that VI imposed restriction and you might be singing a different toon. :)=<br />
<br />
What the original poster did illustrate is that a group that hunts together constantly can do quite a bit even if not the standard mix of characters.</div></div><hr />

Charm, snare/fear, DA, root, atone; Lots of ways to deal with higher level adds then just mez and a chanter.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough, my normal exp group of friends is the exact same as Ximix's except we have a rogue instead of warrior#2<br />
In most cases an enchanter just slows you down. A well played bard is a beautiful thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also posted it as a stand alone on another bard board here:<br />
<br />
&quot;Why I Love to Group with Bards as a Shaman&quot;<br />
http://pub118.ezboard.com/feqdivabardsofeverquestfrm1.showMessage?topicID=5724.topic<br />
<br />
Great stuff<br />
Thanks Ximix and everyone else!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Wow great thread Ximix.  I had no idea bards could make such excellent pullers!  And i'm going on the fourth year playing this game too . . . guess not too many bards are that talented?  <br />
<br />
Aktunka neatly summarized the weaknesses of a bard.  When it comes to controlling more than two or three 56+ mobs that are already in camp, it's really not helpful to have a bard over an enchanter.  Also the buffs you get from a bard are inconsistent due to their having many other jobs and only 10 fingers.<br />
<br />
Viscerator tried to refute Aktunka's claims that bards can't CC 56+ mobs with this quote: &quot;Charm, snare/fear, DA, root, atone; Lots of ways to deal with higher level adds then just mez and a chanter.&quot;  <br />
Charm won't work on 56+ mobs anymore, that has been nerfed, at least bard charm and lower level chanter charms.  Snare is more of an outdoor running around the hills with your druid thing, unless used as a pulling tool by the bard I can't see it being useful for CC on mobs in camp already.  Fear also will not work on 56+ mobs.  It lands but has no effect.  DA . . . well if it's gone that far chances are you aren't going to win, tho it might buy you time for a dash to the zone.  I have never met a bard that kept that song memmed anyway.  Root . . never knew bards had root, but hey maybe you are talking about shaman ghetto CC?  This i can go along with.  Atone?  And just how do you get the mob out of camp after you atone it?  That is if the cleric even bought the spell . . stupid clerics.  <br />
<br />
I've had great experiences and poor experiences with bards as I imagine we all have.  I'd dearly love to group with a bard of the caliber Ximix describes.  <br />
<br />
One last thing that is a plus to bards over enchanters.  Their songs act as a dispell shield buffer to help you keep your buffs on when NPCs decide to dispell them.  The song is dispelled instead . . . and then comes right back the next tic.  Really a neat feature and a definite plus to bards. <br />
<br />
Overall I think bards are the most underestimated class, simply because of the lack of truly imaginative and talented bards who play the game.   They have the most potential tho to do just about anything and their repertoire of spells/songs and abilities is unmatched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Ragnorokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">id lose the cleric before id lose the chanter, specially if they have dc</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fangfoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hmmm interesting.<br />
<br />
Lets starts with heals/CC.  It's all about mana.  Your average hybred healer can't keep up with a good exp pace.  So you need two minimum.  Taking away a tank which is bad, yes nukes are good but casters can't take the punishment their aggro can get them.  Which means rez time, which means down time which means no exp.  Same thing with hybred med time x 2.  Until Shammies get Torpr at 60 they still are generally mana inefficent for healing a group.  Uber for duos but not enough for a high octane group.<br />
<br />
Same thing goes for crowd control.  I have seen 60 chanter hold down 12 mobs without breaking a sweat.  I have never seen a Bard run more than 4.  <br />
<br />
Now Bard pullers are great outdoors.  Crap indoors.  Not enough space or time to do all those tricks.  Plus bard song has big radius, very nasty for chain aggro.  I hate in the Grey when bard has EB song on and we waiting on casters medding then boom bunch a pops over running us cuz they in the huge EB radius on their repop.  You might say don't be in range but camps in Grey now tight especially to avoid the traps.  So in the end no FD, the ultimate tool for dumping a mess, means party evac/wipeout/more downtime etc...<br />
<br />
Bards nice, I like them in group but that group make up top is a death trap post 40.<br />
<br />
Dump the 2nd warrior and add a monk with a sweet 2hb.  No aggro but obnoxious damage.  Get's you a FD puller.  That alone is worth the trade.  Leaves 4th spot for nice group balance.  Sure Nec and SK can fill the puller role too but generally the monk is  a better bet.  The N/SK pets are nice but not really that unbalancing.  The trade off in most groups I'm in  now a days is the 6th spot.  Druid or bard.  Evac or the extra party regen/song buffs.  Tough call.  Mostly depends on who is around since each is equally valuable and interchangeable.<br />
<br />
Bard &lt; Chanter<br />
Bard &lt; Cleric<br />
Bard best ghetto CC when ya gotta make it work sub 6.<br />
Bard best 2nd tier buffer w/ Druid or Shammy.<br />
Bard a nice group member but not a core replacement in any high end camp.<br />
<br />
Peace, just the two cents from someone outside.  Oh I'm here cuz I started playing my Shammy a lot and needed info but my long history as a monk makes me chime in every now and then.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Nektar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Actually, I had never thought of a bard pulling from a camp, getting a couple, and just simply gating one back to his spawn point far away from aggro range.  That's actually quite clever :D<br />
<br />
Anyways, I gotta agree, bards are awesome, well the style I play anyways.  I never group, and when I say never, I mean  never.  I either solo or partner.  I often partner up with this 60 bard with epic, full ss, something like 24aa's.  Even paid 100k for locket of escape for her to be bound in PoM (too bad she's been avoiding me last couple of weeks!) because duoing with a bard is very efficient.<br />
<br />
We've done forest (duh), maze, puppets (all of them, including rallos), and alice area.  Haven't tried Stomples with her, but I soloed him, and managed to do it with a 60 druid &lt;--- me tanking.  Anyways, if the bard knows his ****, he'll override your slow aggro pretty quick.  Once the bard is tanking, it's smooth sailing all the way.  <br />
<br />
I don't even ask her to play cantana, it's useless if she's playing it for me.  Once the mob is slowed, my job is done, I cast epic on mob, and I go to sleep.  Throw a torpor here and there, but she does have 1200'ish ac and ok hp I'd say (3k+ I'm guessing).  <br />
<br />
The only time I really need to watch her health is when fighting rallos/inny puppets, double for 450/350 ain't no walk in the park.  <br />
<br />
And I do all the pulling :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kaalisti_Painstorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">my normal group is 60 war, 60 enc, 60 clr, 60 shm (me) and we'll pick up two others. my absolute favorites to pick up are a bard, and another melee type. (note though that the 4-some has played together a lot for the last year... the group's very meshed)<br />
<br />
a 60 bard that is played well is something absolutlely AMAZING to behold.<br />
unfortunately bards seem to be more rare than torpor on my server =/<br />
<br />
Mixing a 60 bard and a 60 enchanter (dire charm) together ... oh man, WOW. You might have noticed that the group makeup has no evaccer... because we never need one. 3 CC'ers in one group &gt; any train we've encountered. We've even held 10 adds one time! (now that I've jinxed myself I may have to revise this =) C3 + aoe mana and all the other stuff they can twist = zero downtime. heck, even the cleric can nuke to her heart's desire.<br />
<br />
So to the question at hand - Gimme both!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Beowulfe Grendelbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">So a very, very skilled bard &gt; your average or slightly better enchanter. . . that seems to be the point of this thread.  The bottom line is, most bards that you're going to group aren't nearly this skilled . . . case in point, you have people on the thread saying, &quot;wow!  Even though I've grouped with bards, I never knew they could . . .&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact is, a skilled player &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an unskilled player, regardless of their class.  Before I started levelling my shaman again, I played a warrior to and well beyond 60, and did most of the pulling for my group, regardless of the zone . . . no monkie, bard or SK puller required.  I felt confident doing this, because I knew that when I got back to camp, regardless of how many I brought, they'd be controlled, because I had a skilled enchanter and a skilled shaman there.  Everything was quickly slowed, then rooted/mezzed and people seldom died, even when I pulled ridiculous numbers of mobs.  Remember, even an enchanter can tank a slowed mob, I saw my enchanter do it many a time when we had non mezzable mobs in camp.  Once they were slowed, he'd just root em and step into them, letting the tanks get down to the business of killing the others.<br />
<br />
I'd take a skilled player over an idiot any day, no matter what class he or she is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">If your having to CC 12 mobs at once, then your not doing the pulling correctly. Send out the bard to pull. ;) (or just bard/shaman AE them)<br />
<br />
As for the higher level mobs.. I didn't claim they were only bard skills, but rather tactics a group with a bard can employ aside from mez.<br />
<br />
Charm - charm add, stick it on the level 56, he's taken care of. <br />
snare/fear - this does work, you can AE fear then only deal with the higher level mob(s).<br />
DA - bards have group DA, you can DA grp, then warrior drops it and gets all aggro. Also can Torpor, then DA and heal up. Used well in AE grps too.<br />
root - many uses I'm sure most can figure out<br />
atone - one of the most underutilized powerful spells in the game<br />
<br />
You don't have to take every mob out of a fight, just time to get them all slowed. After that it's just a matter of how fast you can kill, bards help this in every way.<br />
<br />
The problem with most bards is that they either are lazy or suck and people don't really know what they are all capable of.<br />
As mentioned, a shaman and enchanter overlap too much to be optimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Saw a 60 Bard lock down 9 LDC's one time. <br />
<br />
Best my Enchanter did was 10+ Lizards in OLD CT. (Throne room).<br />
<br />
I'm sure people don't pull 12, but as in old CT you'd get respawn and END up with 12. <br />
<br />
The person who said<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll take a skilled X class over an unskilled Y class any day&quot; hit the nail on the head.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I group with a chanter and bard all the time. Sometime both are there sometimes its one or the other. My opinion isnt set though do to lvl difference. The bard is lvl 59 now and the chanter is 53. But one difference i like is when a mez is resisted on the add. If i happen to bounce a slow on the first mob i have time to reslow it and slow something a bard might be  getting some resists on while mezzing without having to heal the bard first. I can get the slowing done than heal. With the chanter soon as that mez gets resisted i have to choose quickly to slow the mob or heal the chanter before he gets hit. Point of my rambling is like the fact the bard can take some hits if i hadnt been able to slow the soon to be mezzed mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Well, I have to disagree with what Fangfoo said in a couple spots. Bards can CC more than 4, I have seen it done. However, you go back to the weaknesses of a bard doing CC on multiple mobs. And as for bards being bad pullers indoors? That could not be further from the truth. As i am sure anyone who has been on a chardok queen raid will remember, pulling the queen room is not as simple as one would like. Best puller for chardok queen room? A bard. We had our bard (Rinnie Notecracker the sexiest bard on Drinal /rar) pull it. She kept queen lulled and pulled out like 2 mobs at a time. We owned those, queen was solo, rushed the hooker and wham warrior epic piece. <br />
<br />
Bards can be excellent pullers indoors as well as out.</div></div><hr />
