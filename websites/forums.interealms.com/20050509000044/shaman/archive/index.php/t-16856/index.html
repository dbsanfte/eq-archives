<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, so what is up with that?  My LDoN group was not allowed to enter the dungeon after accepting the mission because it was &quot;too dangerous for us&quot;?  I know this is a known bug, does anyone know what causes it?  <br />
<br />
Thanks for the help, would like to avoid wasting 15-20 min on a repeat occurance of this.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Was talking to a GM about an unrelated issue when this happened to me.  Managed to slide this in, and asked if we should just cancel and get a new mission or if it would clear up.  The GM said something to the effect of &quot;Cancel and try again.  It's a known issue, and there's nothing to be done about it.&quot;<br />
<br />
*sigh*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>peleg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Got this bug as well.  I looked to see if any GMs were on and to my surprise there were 2!  I sent a tell to one (rather than petition since I was so irritated by this stupid bug) and his explanation was that our dungeon was given to multiple parties and we will not be able to enter until they exit (which of course wouldn't happen until the 30 min timer expired) so just go back to the camp and start over.  Shocking that Sony would release a buggy product that didn't live up to its &quot;a unique adventure for each party&quot; claim... just shocking.  :p <br />
<br />
P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Bruzza Bashalot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not really a bug.  There is a server (or set of servers) for LDoN instances.  This server(s) may be spread across multiple 'world' servers for all we know.  When the instance server has a maximum number of instances running, for whatever reason, it cannot create the instance when you create your mission.  You will not be able to enter your dungeon at any point in the 30 minutes because it was never created and is not waiting for you!!  Quit the mission (does not count as a loss as you never entered) and get another.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">This bug really sucks, especially when the group leader takes a half hour to get the mission he really wants.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scott answered this at fan fair, with an &quot;oops&quot;.<br />
<br />
If memory serves 1 outta every 100? or so missions fail to start.<br />
<br />
As for failing on leaving a mission, it was set so that if you zoned then leave a mission you fail.  You dont have to zone into the dungeon, you simply have to zone.  Unless this has been changed the past few days.  If you leave a mission without zoning it doesn't get marked as a loss.  That's the way it's been on test anyhow unless something is different on live.<br />
<br />
It's fixed on test (according to gallenite)...unless they rebroke it again =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Devs at the Fan Faire said it's a known issue, and they're working on it.  Basically, it just means your dungeon was unable to start up for some reason.  Sounded like they're finding it to be tricky to track down precisely, but hope to at least make the message clearer in the near future.<br />
<br />
They also mentioned the possibility of either being able to pick the adventure type you want, or balancing the adventures so the success rate is more even.  I guess the dungeon is actually made when the adventure is offered, so people trying over and over to get the one they like is somewhat hard on the ol' servers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Merrygrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I read about the quote from FF. Can't recall where I read it, but from memory it also said that it was fixed on test.<br />
<br />
The theory about too many dungeons on a server was probably just a theory that spread as the truth.<br />

Bug.  Fixed on test and will go live next update.<br />
<br />
Easy to fix.  Just have EVERYONE leave the adventure and go get a new one.<br />
<br />
The bug is, basically, just that the adventure fails to spawn properly.<br />

<br />
I'm glad to see it's going to be fixed, but in my direct experience, simply leaving the adventure and getting a new one did NOT fix the problem, unless we were insanely unlucky and it happened to us twice in a row.<br />
<br />
I also recall the first time this occured to me, we were seeing /oocs from other groups getting the same issue at roughly the same time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">LDoN bugs tend not to happen to just one person or group, an entire server tends to get hit by them all at once.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it's taking your group leader half an hour to pick the perfect adventure I think you have bigger problems.  :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I love how instead of making it deliver a useful message, it says the dungeon is &quot;too dangerous&quot; so sa to completely baffle and confuse anyone who is getting this bug.<br />
<br />
How about this Sony, make it say something that doesn't elude to your incompetence, but just states it flat out, something like, &quot;This dungeon was not created due to an error. Please go get another one. As retribution for this mistake, we are firing two dozen of our third-world sub-minimum wage child worker/programmers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Binter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The new bug which is almost as annoying is the inability to open chests.<br />
<br />
You get a &quot;you cannot open this with hostile creatures aware of your presence&quot; kind of message (not exact words).<br />
<br />
The only way to clear it that we've discovered so far is to camp in the zone and come back.</div></div><hr />
