I could get him decent stuff (Move my monk's fungi to him, get a Lammy and Lupine dagger, and a few other miscellanous items..), but I am conflicted as to which race to pic.  Halfling, or Wood elf?  I like the stats on halflings better, but I like the looks (heh) on wood elves better :p<br />
<br />
So perhaps could anyone post a picture of their Ranger?  Any are welcome, always like pictures ), but perferably those of Halflings or wood elves.<br />
<br />
Also, how would I allocate my skill points?  Stamina?  Stamina/Str?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance :)</div></div><hr />

Halflings are evil, resist the urge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You want the honest lowdown?  If you want to be an effective ranger, go Wood-elf.  All the other races have major downsides in comparison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And remember, stats wont mean a whole lot till your in the highlevels, <br />
(cept sta, but its kinda easy to raise above 100 nowadays)<br />
and its in the highlevels that you get the good stuff so, best choice imo is to go with whatever has the most eyecandy</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love playing her (she's on hiatus atm). I can't speak for the halfling side, but I'd vote wood elf. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, given the way Verant has set us up so far, go for a Tunare-worshipping Wood Elf (only god you can have).  Helm of the Tracker + CULTURAL fletching that blows the rest of us away.<br />
<br />
I'm holding my breath and hoping against hope for some payback when PoP comes out.</div></div><hr />

Best stats... and hey!  you can still worship Tunare, get your Helm of The Tracker and woodelf arrows, but don't have to be a panzy elf! ;)<br />
<br />
Everyone always forgets that humans can choose which Diety they have...  Not all humans worship Karana.</div></div><hr />
