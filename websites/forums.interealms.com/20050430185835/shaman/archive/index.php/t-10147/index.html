<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I put this in the bottom of Blargx's merged thread, but it's a lot of posts to wade through.  So here's my &quot;haven't had my morning glass of OJ&quot; idea:<br />
<br />
EQ should look at &quot;pay to play&quot; <br />
<br />
Your monthly fee is $6.95. This entitles your toons to move about freely in Antonica, Faydwer, and Odus.  You want Kunark - add a buck. You want Velious - add a buck. You want Luclin? Ok we'll refund a buck. <br />
<br />
You want PoP Tier-1? Add a buck. You want Tier-2? Ok once you pass the trials and start sending us another two bucks you get access. Tier-3? Same thing - more money. <br />
<br />
That way, folks that USE the content can PAY for the content.<br />
<br />
I can foresee two problems with this, one accounting, and one to use Zorlac's phrase - c0ckblocking.<br />
<br />
1) Accounting - Now this may be tough to set up, but once the system is in place, when your monthly fee rolls around, you decide which zones you think you'll be spending most of your time in. Check the boxes, your credit card is docked and you move on.<br />
<br />
2) C0ckblocking: This gets to the crux of the zero-sum mentality surrounding EQ. If I am PAYING for content, I damn sure want to EXPERIENCE that content. I don't expect loot to magically appear in my inventory, but if I'm paying for Tier-X and some guild is continually killing key MOBs then I as a paying customer have a right to complain.<br />
<br />
What I * think * would happen is VI would find out VERY fast (as their revenues drop) that end game content is experienced by a small minority and paid for by a large majority.<br />
<br />
Like I said - thought of this before my morning OJ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Every expansion throws a bone to those who are low or mid level.  They might not get the max content that Verant designs for the high end, but they do get something.  PoP added /raid to our lives and put dr00ds out of the porting business.  Look at what has happened when Verant has added low/mid content into the game.  What was the percentage of players who saw and enjoyed Jaggedpine Forest or The Warrens?<br />
<br />
And Personally, I DON'T want to pay for all the expansion levels on each account MONTH after MONTH after MONTH</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">From a player standpoint, great idea, especially if you're not using everything.  From a business standpoint ... why?  They see that most of their players are paying for end game stuff they aren't using - but no longer are receiving that revenue.  Then they either invent a billion other things you can add on (PoK portals, $1 a month!), or just reduce the difficulty of getting anywhere so they're getting that revenue back.<br />
<br />
It might make sense for a new game to try, but I dont think EQ could pull it off, they'd be throwing away money they are already receiving.  A number of people may be unhappy with the way the tier systems work, but those people are still paying for it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't really mind the way it is set up right now.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Though it is a nice idea, it lacks 1 thing....logic.<br />
<br />
Does the person who only plays original EQ use any less bandwidth when he is playing? Does he cause there to be any less maintenance by not using all expansions?<br />
<br />
If you wanted to go with a pay for play it would have to be done with an hourly rate...and maybe an extra fee if you /petition something...<br />
<br />
$13 is like going to 2 movies....seems like cheap entertainment to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey, great idea!  The same should apply to Cable TV, too - hey, you can't watch more than 1-3 channels at a time, so WHY PAY FOR ALL THAT CONTENT YOU DON'T SEE???<br />
<br />
And you should get a refund for any portions of a football game that occur while you're in line at the bathroom!<br />
<br />
And if you go to a fair or amusement park, by golly they'd better charge you a la carte for the rides you go on, because ain't no way you're going to ALL of them.<br />
<br />
And toll roads should charge you based on how many lanes you think you'll be using.<br />
<br />
Wow, there sure are a lot of applications for this idea, I wonder why nobody's thought of it yet!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Finaljustice:<br />
<br />
&quot;What was the percentage of players who saw and enjoyed Jaggedpine Forest or The Warrens?&quot;<br />
<br />
My guess would be the same or higher than the percentage that will get to and enjoy the elemental planes and beyond in PoP. But I bet those last zones get A LOT more focus from the developers to keep those poor ubbers happy. And maybe the reason why the mid level zones dont get a lot more happy visitors is that they suck contentwise because the developers are busy tweaking Ralloz Zek or Fennin Ro or something like that.<br />
<br />
So whats your point?<br />
<br />
The ubbers have access to ALL zones. The relatively normal players like me have access to far less zones. Yet we both pay the same. Again I can understand that SOE thinks this is great but I hope that in the long run it will hurt them bad...*crosses fingers that WoW will do the trick*<br />
<br />
If they really wanted to I am sure they could figure out a way to charge you extra per month for each new zone you gained a flag for. But just imagine the whining that cause - and just because people had to pay for what they use.<br />
<br />
Its funny how in EQ the ubbers think its ok having people pay for the content they are the only ones enjoying whereas if someone in RL said that they expected others to pay for them they would be considered leeches.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>atarak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm probably going to take some heat for my comments here, but oh well, not like I'm not used to it.<br />
<br />
Pay-for-play == dumb frickin idea<br />
<br />
Care to know why? No problem.. because it completely eliminates any challenge what so ever. Everquest is a social game, no doubt about it, but it is also a competitive game. Do you think the so called 'uber guilds' would be 'uber' if there weren't some kind of competitive drive pushing them to be where they are? <br />
<br />
How much revenue do you think SOE would lose if all the folks like myself and the majority of my guild members were to up and quit because we had to share zones like Plane of Fire who didn't earn their way in through putting forth the effort? Or had to share the zone with incompetent fools who spent their entire gameing career leveling in places like SolB/Karnor and couldn't pull a froglok tad without bringing down the entire zone.<br />
<br />
Sure, there's plenty of part time gamers who spend their days role playing and cybering eachother. Thats fine, the overwhelming majority of them are level 30 and bitch about there being a lack of zones for them to go to, but still haven't left Guk/SolB, and never will, even if you open 100 new zones.<br />
<br />
You whine and complain that SOE caters to the higher level players and the guilds with the drive and motivation to move foward. You're right, they do, because the game, is still - A GAME -, its not a social experiment, this isn't college. I enjoy the game, and I've mastered (250 skill) 3 different tradeskills with a 4th coming and have 200 Alchemy to boot, but I still also PLAY TO WIN.<br />
<br />
There's no 'end game', there's no 'You have beaten Everquest', but there is still the feeling of having accomplished a significant feat. Spending a week dying repeatedly to Rallos Zek and then finally beating him, there's a good feeling having done that. Am I personally willing to share what having accomplished that has opened up for me with some kid with $20 to spend? Hell no, and neither should you.<br />
<br />
You want to be goofing off in the elemental planes? Then get off your ass, get into gear, and do what it takes to EARN your way there. Don't expect it to be handed to you on a silver platter with an engraved invitation.<br />
<br />
You want to be a casual gamer who spends 10hrs a week max playing EQ? No problem, thats what you want to do, but don't rain on my parade because you feel left out. I'm not going to subsidize you in real life, and I'm damn sure not going to subsidize you in EQ. <br />
<br />
Long story short: You want in, EARN it, don't complain that you can't buy it, or can't get there because you only play 10 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

&quot;TOO HARD TO CODE&quot;<br />
<br />
We are dealing with chipmunks with typewriters here can't expect them to code somethign liek that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'm certain you're spending your spare time writing a whole new graphics engine and the server code and the client code and the millions of lines of other things required to make even a simple version like this work right? Have you ever worked on relatively minimal code like dikumud? Do you understand sockets and asynchronous updates? Or perhaps your special skill is in working with threads and developing fast and transparent DB manipulation?<br />
<br />
I think far too many of you haven't a clue as to what it takes to make even a small version of this work, let alone something that can handle over 100,000 players on a busy night. Honestly, its a friggin miracle it works as well as it does.<br />
<br />
Chipmunks indeed, here's some nuts, start nibbling friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kharzhoul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Good idea - but it doesnt work.<br />
<br />
It comes down to the real reason many people play EQ. Because of a sense of accomplishment. Why do you care you have item XXX  - and in a few months of raiding mob YYY you will have item ZZZ and you will be psyked!<br />
<br />
If you could simply call SOE and pay $5 for the item ZZZ, how much fun will you have with the new item. How much of a sense of accomplishment will it be? If you just want to pay cash to play the game - go and buy an account from an uber who is quitting. Its the same thing. But heres the catch, that just won't be fun.<br />
<br />
Its FUN to build your toon. Its FUN to get flagged for new zones. If it was all handed to you then who cares? We would all be the same toon and everyone would quit within a few months.<br />
<br />
EQ is successful because of the reward elements. Each person plays to get the next rewards (new level, item, spell, etc). If the rewards were taken out of the game - as everyone received them -  it would be boring. My guild is currently working to to get flagged on all of the tier 3 planes. Currently we are bot, halls of honor and torment flagged. Its a great sense of accomplishment to hunt those zones as I feel I have earned it. And I would be very said to see SOE take away my sense of accomplishment because someone wants something without putting the time and effort into it.<br />
<br />
And no, I am very very very far from uber.<br />

Um, how much revenue do you think SoE will lose when casual players move on?  Do you honestly think that the so-called 'ubers' pay more (except on Stormhammer, where everyone does) or that content is based on or designed FOR the casual player?<br />
<br />
Zorlac said it best, 95% of the of the playerbase pays for the content used by the other 5%.<br />
<br />
 Or had to share the zone with incompetent fools who spent their entire gameing career leveling in places like SolB/Karnor and couldn't pull a froglok tad without bringing down the entire zone. <br />
<br />
I have yet to see anything that shows that those in the end game are more 'skilled' at this game.  Please feel free to provide a link to a definitive study indicating where I am wrong.<br />
<br />
Oh and did they change Sol B and Karnors? Last time I was in there (and admittedly it's been awhile) there weren't any 'tads'<br />
<br />
Sure, there's plenty of part time gamers who spend their days role playing and cybering eachother. <br />

Not sure where I was 'whining', but I guess I'm an incompetent fool who can't pull tads in Karnors or Sol B. (Your words)<br />
<br />
And thank you for making my point by agreeing with me.<br />
<br />
Does drive and motivation = unemployed and 14 hours a day to play?<br />
<br />
Or does drive and motivation = we got lucky, got ahead of the power curve, and we're able to block content for the up and comers?<br />
<br />
Perhaps drive and motivation = we get hints from the developers, like our status as # 1, and any threat to said status must be met with ridicule and disdain?<br />
<br />
 I'm not going to subsidize you in real life, and I'm damn sure not going to subsidize you in EQ <br />
<br />
Actually, you've got it backwards, the people who play 10 hours a week are subsidizing YOU.<br />
<br />
Hey you don't like my idea - no worries. My ego isn't wrapped up in a collection of pixels and if they turned the servers off tomorrow, I would find other distractions.<br />

Is that possible on a message board? *grin* sorry.. bad humour, I'm beating my head against 6509 configs today and I'm starting to snap.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, how much revenue do you think SoE will lose when casual players move on?  Do you honestly think that the so-called 'ubers' pay more (except on Stormhammer, where everyone does) or that content is based on or designed FOR the casual player?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly? None, here it is 3 or so years later, and that casual player base is still there. The likelyhood of the casual playerbase picking up and moving on enmasse any time soon doesn't seem very high.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zorlac said it best, 95% of the of the playerbase pays for the content used by the other 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
You forget that most of the 'high end' players tend to have multiple (somtimes as many as 5 or more) accounts per person, thats a pretty substantial amount of money, but yes, you are correct, there's a significant portion of the userbase which pays for, but does not use, a few of the upper level zones.<br />
<br />
Of course, it could be argued, that I pay for, and do not use, significantly more low-mid level zones, than they pay for and don't use in high level zones. <br />
<br />
<br />
I have yet to see anything that shows that those in the end game are more 'skilled' at this game.  Please feel free to provide a link to a definitive study indicating where I am wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
One need only step into karnor and wait the requisite 10-15 seconds for the train to zone. No study is required. Or wander into SolB twice a day for 2-3 weeks and do a /who, and notice what level 50+ are there, constantly, never moving foward. <br />
<br />
I xp a lot in tactics, probably 5-6 hours a week, sometimes more, sometimes less, depending on work, kids, wife. I do however, find time to actually -leave- tactics and go do new stuff, die to new mobs, and generally have fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and did they change Sol B and Karnors? Last time I was in there (and admittedly it's been awhile) there weren't any 'tads'<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you are correct, however I think the saracasm spoke for itself, I wasn't able to think of a lower level, more innocuous, and still fitting, mob from either of those zones.<br />
<br />
The point is, there is a large contingent of players that inhabit both of those zones (as well as several others), consistently, and they never leave because their limited skill set precludes them from being accepted in zones where trains are not the norm and expected.<br />
<br />
I'd have a hard time believing you've never run into the utterly inept sort of folks. You know the type, the ones that, 3 years later, still don't understand the concept of /assist or why breaking mez is bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure where I was 'whining', but I guess I'm an incompetent fool who can't pull tads in Karnors or Sol B. (Your words)<br />
<br />
<br />
are you? Thats for you to determine, I merely stated that there were, in fact, people like that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Does drive and motivation = unemployed and 14 hours a day to play?<br />
<br />
<br />
I work ~50 hours a week, spend time with both my kids and my wife. It happens that EQ is by far, the cheapest version of long term entertainment I can afford regularly, so it gets the overwhelming majority of my 'off time'. <br />
<br />
Yes, there's a good number of unemployed folk who spend far too much time playing EQ, I won't argue that. But don't overgeneralize and presume that everyone is unemployed and completely slack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Or does drive and motivation = we got lucky, got ahead of the power curve, and we're able to block content for the up and comers?<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't know about 'lucky', if you mean we planned ahead and knew what our goals were, then yes, we got lucky. As for blocking content, that does (or so its said) happen on other servers. Its happened on Innoruuk too, I won't argue that, but I suspect you mean locking out the 'casual player' in which case, that simply isn't true. Honestly, there's no reason for an uber guild to lock out casual players, they lock themselves out quite well enough on their own.<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps drive and motivation = we get hints from the developers, like our status as # 1, and any threat to said status must be met with ridicule and disdain?<br />
<br />
<br />
Furor? Is that you?<br />
<br />
Oh.. sorry, must have mistaken you for a different halfwit who spews claims of developer intervention and other such horsesh*t.<br />
<br />
No, I'm sure that happens in a few cases, its hardly unavoidable given the design and nature of the game and how beta's are handled etc. I don't think, however, that the large majority of 'uber' guilds get any help from GMs or higher. In fact I'd go so far as to say a good portion of them are more hindered by GMs and the lot than not. Having some small guild roll in after you've done all the real work and being forced to /random for the boss because the GMs are utterly clueless, yeah, thats fun... really.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, you've got it backwards, the people who play 10 hours a week are subsidizing YOU.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are they? See my above statement about zone usage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey you don't like my idea - no worries. My ego isn't wrapped up in a collection of pixels and if they turned the servers off tomorrow, I would find other distractions.<br />
<br />
<br />
as would most of us, yeah, I play far too often for my own good, though I've taken several long breaks over the last few years. Eventually being bored with games I beat after 2 weeks, or plain ol' being broke far too often, I end up playing EQ some more.<br />
<br />
Is my ego 'wrapped up in a collection of pixels'? No, I'd say its more wrapped up in my 2 kids and my wife and my excellent garden (which, unfortunately, is currently frozen over). Do I have an EQ ego? oh defintely, I'm damned proud of the guild I'm in and our accomplishments.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do find it amusing that so many people say you have to &quot;work&quot; to get ahead. Man here I thought this was a game. <br />
<br />
Find me a competitive game, of any type, where you don't have to put forth real effort and thought. Try it, you know you want to.<br />
Even something as simple as Monopoly requires a basic knowledge of how the board works, how best to aqquire property and utilize it for your own gain. Whether or not this equates to 'work' is left to the reader to determine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just a side note, in Indiana, the toll road gives you a ticket when you get on with differnt rates when you get off. So its like 20c if you get on at one exit and 50c at another even though you both get off at the same exit.<br />
<br />
On topic. I dont like being charged at all. I payed for the games. I accept it becasue I assume I am only paying for maintence and bandwith. If I was playing to use zones I already purchased, i would prob get mad.</div></div><hr />
