<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I dinged 50 last night after three years of play (Bigguss was born May 1, 1999,) and the last few levels have been great!  I've got the JBB, fungi, and a horse (spent way too much time in the EC tunnel...) and I'm cutting through mobs like a hot knife through butter.  <br />
<br />
At the same time, though, I have a dilemma.  I'm looking at the remaining levels, and there really isn't much to look forward to- every level will mean tougher and tougher monsters without a tougher and tougher Bigguss to fight them.  Of course, 60 with a full spellbook is awesome- but given my playstyle I kind of doubt I'll ever get there (remember, three years to get to 50.)  I know I'll get to 51 - so Turgur's and the new heal will help a little in groups.  The epic would also be great- but I figure that will happen when it happens.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm not seeing much I like before 60: incremental updates and group versions of buffs (bleh), Cann 3/4 would be nice but no biggee, generally smallish upgrades... while the monsters I'll be fighting for experience get much much tougher.  I generally solo (hop on for an hour, kill some stuff, hop off), but am guilded and could group/raid if I chose- the problem is that raids generally bore me to tears.<br />
<br />
I guess I'm wondering whether it's worth it to begin the long road to 60.   To all of you who have done it, would you do it again if you suspected you would not make it to 60?  Is the journey something to be endured in order to reach 60, or did you find yourself still amply powered along the way?  Am I going to be able to hop in, kill a few things, and hop off like I have so far?<br />
<br />
I guess I'm wondering whether I should level, try AA, roll a twink, or maybe something else?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for your advice.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Depends really, if you're lookin to pop on for an hour and kill some time. Luclin has quite a bit to offer for the casual gamer. Dawnshroud Peeks is really good for just wantin to pop on and nix some baddies then pop off again. The loot here on the other hand.... well it's not much to be desired. The reason I mention DP though is because this has been the only place in awhile that I've consistently seen my xp bar move with every kill. <br />
<br />
So, there is a possibility to garner some sense of accomplishment at the higher levels. Expect it at a tenth of the dose you could once get though. Twinks are fun! I hate suggesting it, cause it seems like everybody and their dogs mother has one... but roll up a monk. They have high damage output (fun!) and can solo VERY effectively with some bandaids and a bit of Wu's for armor which you can make yourself (sense of accomplishment). <br />
<br />
Hope that helps ya a bit. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Paerlith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now, if you level until your brain rots, you'll hit 60 in 2007 :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Weab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Couple things: First, you can't do aa until 51 anyways... Second, as far as dawnshroud having no loots... The hoppers drop flawless and supurb hides, both of which can be sold to players for a fair price. Flawless are the more desireable and can sell for about 50pp each, sometimes more.<br />
<br />
I would go for 60. It's a whole new game for me at 60. I'm not quite sure however, about your style of play. You'll see very little progress just hopping on and off, although it can be done so long as you find the right place for your level.<br />
<br />
Oh. And I'm biased, but if you want a twink monks so rule :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Take a look at Allakhazam's info on Scarlet Desert. The plateau is a bit high for you at 50 but there are plenty of other areas that offer nice XP and some pretty decent drops. The XP there isn't bad and you and the dog should be able to get to 51 in short order just from the mobs around the zone in :)<br />
<br />
The only one who can decide if it is worth it is you. I play my Shaman knowing full well that I might never ding 60, getting my spells will be luck, getting an epic may never happen and being in better gear is a long shot. I've known that since I hit 48 and left my first guild. For me it has been worth it. I've had some fun, met some nice people and been entertained. <br />
<br />
If you have a good guild and enjoy playing with them then, by all means, continue to do so. You don't have to spend 10 hours in a zone with them if that isn't the type of thing you enjoy, there is a lot of content that you can sample for a few hours with a group or two (like Howling Stones) instead. There are also quite a few zones, Scarlet Desert especially, where you can get some XP alone in a few hours and make progress towards 60.<br />
<br />
I would wait on making any decision about the future of your Shaman until you hit 51. Getting Turgur's changes things in a big way. Sure the mobs are harder but the encounters are much easier because of that one little spell.<br />
<br />
That said, twinking is also great fun. Every few months I go and level a twink for a bit instead of grinding towards 60 (probably why I've been 50+ for almost a year) and I never regret it. <br />
<br />
Good luck and have fun :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I'm Level 56 and I've been pretty happy with each level since 50, though I'm still missing a number of spells:<br />
<br />
51 - Turgur's is a big upgrade over Togor's, in my opinion, due to the longer duration<br />
52 - Regrowth - +5 HP/tick over what you have now - melees and Necromancers will be happy<br />
53 - Cripple - something that a Shaman is expected to cast on tough MOBs<br />
54 - Cannibalize III is much better than I/II<br />
55 - I don't have Form of the Great Bear or Spirit of the Howler, but even just the Talisman upgrade and Chloroblast are great<br />
56 - I don't have BoN or group regrowth (what I really want) but even just getting Celerity was enough to make me happy<br />
<br />
It seems as though my Shaman keeps getting more and more powerful, though I find soloing to be very boring and slow (and not something I can just jump in and do, due to the need to summon a pet and buff myself and the pet). If you're not enjoying your Shaman, then maybe it's time to take a break, but in my experience (up through Level 56) it only gets better and better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Krytog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">getting to 60 is a huge time investment.  The benefit to would be questionable if you don't care about raiding. While you can no doubt solo quite well is that really what your after?  The biggest benefit for the shaman at 60 is Malo for raids, torpor for mana recovery. and focus.  60 brings with it better resists and better chance to land spells on the big mobs.  If you truly don't care about raiding, it is probably not going to be worth the effort other than the sense of accomplishment.  Getting malo, torpor, etc is a royal pain in the butt and a slim shot without some guild help in either killing the mob or outright purchasing the spell.  However, for those with the perseverance a lvl 60 shaman is a force worthy of the greatest of tales and legendary exploits.<br />
<br />
It really comes done to what you want to accomplish with your shaman. If you get caught up in the xp grind you will burn out most likely.  Sounds like you have a groove that works for you. If you are having a blast then keep on trucking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks for the feedback, guys... sounds like it's worth it at least for another few levels.  :)<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me if my relative power is going to decrease much as I move toward 60?  Is a shaman at 55 more or less able to easily solo dark blues than I an now at 50?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">a good place for you right now biggus is the seafurbies in OOT. camp by the water. easy to get to.ok loot. soloable at your level.ok XP. i did 48-51 here and my playtime is simillar to yours during the week. hope it helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's worth getting to 52 as primary goal, just for Regrowth. After that, it starts to slow down significantly, so if you decide to keep leveling take it nice and slow :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Berog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Personally played from 51 to 56 most of my time in dawnshroud soloing rockhoppers (getting hides for my enchanter for raising tailoring skill).<br />
<br />
No fungi or epic on me but a friend borrowed me a jbb.<br />
<br />
I think till 54 you should see still nice exp there (55 was slow there but still faster than being in crowded velk).<br />
<br />
<br />
So i think even as a casual player with your gear hitting 54 shouldn t take too long but from there on soloing without epic will get painful imo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Atm i am lvl 56 and i love it. Getting Celerity was it alone worth for me, another highlight was 54 with cann3 after that i had quite a bit more fun cause of less cannidancing.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you like your shammie continue, if you feel there is no fun left playing him do something else like playing a twink up is my advice.<br />
<br />
Greetings Berog</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Get to 52, try out the antonican dragons to get a taste of raiding.  52 is relatively easy to get to from 50.  60 is a long way off.<br />
<br />
As for &quot;power&quot; we are less capable soloers at 56 than we are at 52.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Honestly, at your current rate of levelling, you'll never see 60 before you quit the game.  Yeah, you've been through 35, 40, and 45, but you have no idea what a hell level is yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">&gt; Can anyone tell me if my relative power is going to decrease much as I move toward 60?<br />
<br />
Yes, it will decrease hugely. When I got 49 I felt like a god, mobs were dying to me left and right even though I had no JBB. At 55 with the JBB I had to pick my fights carefully. At 59 taking on blue mobs solo without a fungi or epic is a real effort, because around level 45 mobs suddenly get a MASSIVE increase in HP and my damage output has been static.<br />
<br />
That said, getting to 60 is still quite doable with the gear you have, since I'm pretty much there with less. My playing hours fall within 2am-7am PST so as you can imagine, I have little choice except to solo outside the weekends when I can hook up with U.S. players and actually do stuff. Despite that, I'm still gaining XP at a reasonable rate - log on, summon pet, buff pet, pull with slow, sic puppy, JBB until dead, rinse, repeat until log off.<br />
<br />
The power upgrades aren't much, but they are something. Getting Turgur's made me feel like I was really making a MAJOR contribution to a group for the first time. Same for Celerity and Regrowth. Group buffs for raiding (and especially group regrowth) are simply great now that their effects have been fixed to be as strong as the single-target ones. I didn't think they would be either, but when you have 2 or 3 full groups to buff they turn raiding from hard work trying to keep everything timed and staggered (in addition to being the slower) into something vastly more enjoyable.<br />
<br />
The upgrades are there, they are just mostly group-oriented ones which benefit other people. Your friends WILL appreciate the differences as you level, even if they don't give YOU more power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Toreden_Demonslayer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I leveled fast to 60, but now its just so boring, nothing realy fun to do at 60 except getting more and more AA points, ofcourse, raids now and then, but whats the fun in that when you got like 5-6 high end guilds that prolly will get what you want before you get there. <br />
Take your time as you want it to. Im 60 with like 40aa and sick of the game and shaman atm. <br />
But might come back sometime soon =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My play time is much like yours...a few hours here and there.<br />
<br />
Levels 45 to 51 I did roughly a level a week solo (thanks JBB). Levels 52 to 54 I did roughly a level every two weeks mixed group and solo. Levels 54 to 58 I did almost exclusively grouped. I spend all my free time scrounging for exp. I get almost no loot and spend almost zero time in town, questing or working on tradeskills. After three weeks in 58, I will ding 59 this week and I expect 59 to take me 1.5 months playing the same schedule as doing 45 in 1.5 weeks. 54 to 58 are very slow, but 59 is THE hell level. Its that copy of malo waiting for me in the guild bank that keeps me motivated. Like me, you will find 60 to be a long road.<br />
<br />
It was my experience that that in the low 50's my effectiveness decreased tremendously. This is mainly because I started going to raids more (which also slows down leveling alot), but also because I was grouping more and there always seemed to be a higher level shaman around negating the need for my services.<br />
<br />
It very slowly got better until around 57 when I got malosini and suddenly I felt useful again. At 58 I can go on raids and not get absolutely resisted by everything (once malo, tash, oos are in). And so I am begining to understand that there is really one goal for a raiding shaman. Malo. Getting 60 and malo is everything for a raid shaman. Its really sad but true. If you intend to do alot of high end raiding NOTHING matters as much as getting 60 and scribing malo. <br />
<br />
50-60 is a long hard road with a big payoff at the end and not much in between. And frankly I thought 51-55 sucked big time. But if your goals include high level raids then yes, grind it out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I asked the same question when my Monk hit 51. &quot;Do I REALLY want to grind to 60?&quot;<br />
<br />
A poster on a Monk board said heck yes. Here was his reasoning.<br />
<br />
At level 60 you will be able to massacre MOBs to help your friends. Between you, JBB and Jobarer (Epic is easy, tag along on a couple of raids or faction) you will be a much bigger asset.<br />
<br />
Or as he put it &quot;Nothing like punking out a MOB as a 60 Monk to help your friend with a quest.&quot;<br />
<br />
I would say, nothing like landing slows, nuking and having Jobarer to rip some blue MOB to pieces so your buddy can get Phat_L33wtz_01.<br />
<br />
Get to 51 on Bloodgills then go from there. (I recommend Epic, a nice change of pace for the casual player)</div></div><hr />
