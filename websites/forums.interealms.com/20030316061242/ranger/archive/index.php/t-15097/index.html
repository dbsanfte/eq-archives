<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ManaSink</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have a 61 cleric... I was thinking about just getting BoA and soloing the hole entrance.. with BoA I have slightly over 3k hp's and over 1k ac... wielding CBoL and Frostbringer with 22% haste... or is there a better xp spot to pl with the 61 cleric?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope, Hole ent ought be just fine, stay there until 53/54 then go Sebs or Velks (could do ethier one from 51 on though) until 55 then 55+ PoP zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Benemyjosh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Can a Ranger Solo in Sebs or Velks with Swiftwind and no earthcaller?<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Erlanthir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">dont think so, not until 60 for AA's anyways though I might be wrong</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Tathagata</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">May I ask how the hole is solo'd by you folk.<br />
I walked in there once, with a druid (we were both 49). <br />
I tried pulling the first mob and ended up with about 5 big hard nasty buggers on me. <br />
Tried a couple more times with no success. <br />
Was I too young or if not then how is it done?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tathagata, I dunno how you pulled.  Also, I do not know the level at which single pulling becoems feasable; at 53 I didn't have any trouble single pulling the warriors at the entrance.  The trick is not to run up, but to pull the first one you see, from as close to the ledge you left the water on as possible.  If you cannot get only that one that way, at least you should only have one add; the others are too far back for the first two to draw aggro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Besides the Hole and Velks, where else is there?  At the times I've gone there, they've both been way over camped.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Eowyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">and howling stones<br />
<br />
at 61 you can solopull either of these places.<br />
<br />
<br />
as to level pulling the hole you just need the levels and it's cake, if you don't have the levels you'll get chain agro.<br />
<br />
i seem to remeberthe level being 51 or 52 for solo pulling</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Eowyna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Lguk is a great place to pl though the low 50's the cleric proc hammers eat grean undead froggies for breakfast.</div></div><hr />
