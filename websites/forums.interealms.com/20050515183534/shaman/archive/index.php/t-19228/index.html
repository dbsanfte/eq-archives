<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">K, spent the 2AA in Crit Heals1 YAY!.  Then spent the next 4AA playing Hard LDoN dungeons as the Main healer.... wanna know how many times I crit healed in 4AA? 1 TIME!<br />
<br />
YAY 1 time I critted.  OH and it was when I was 30% of an AA from Crit Heals2.... After 3.7AA it will only land once?!  Anyone that has done LDoN knows it will take at LEAST 1 heal per mob, I'd say I generally throw out 3 per mob.  So let's just assume that with the xp in Hard dungeons each kill gives 1.5%  That is still 200 Mobs x 3 casts per mob=600 Heals and I got 1 friggin Crit.  YAY!<br />
<br />
/rant off<br />
<br />
Didnt really expect it to be firing off all the time but come on... a 0.16% chance of critting?  Also there is no way that we missed a Crit Heal in there either.  My guild has been giggling like school girls at my inability to heal better than a ranger :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, on the other side of it I have maxed crit heal aas and I crit A LOT. Often two three times in a row. Keep spending the aa points in that ability and you will see a definite improvement.<br />
<br />
Could still use a better quick heal but the aas will help once you max them out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Seems like all crits are very low at first level then start to really pick up<br />
<br />
Melee crits 1 goes off so infrequently I thought it was broken, but it picks up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I just want to ask, you sure you have crits on? If you have crits off, you only see a &quot;crit&quot; when you actually land a heal for over the normal tnarg heal.<br />
<br />
For example, I have maxxed AHG. I might crit a heal for 3300, but it might only take 1700 hitpoints to heal a tank to full. If I have crits off, I don't notice I did anything special, I just see a heal for 1700.<br />
<br />
I definitely love crit heals, they make me happy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I have crit heals maxed, I crit a LOT. I wouldn't be suprised if it was approaching 20%. Crit 1 you won't see many.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have it maxed and I crit like a madman.  It wasn't that great at lower levels, but its one of my favorite AA's now.  It definately works fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah I had the same experience. The Percentage of crits for each level of healing gift seems exponential.<br />
<br />
First level, I remember getting lucky if I had 1 crit per playing session, and I do quite a bit of healing. Now I have Avanced Healing Gift 2, and I crit like nuts, I would say one out of every 5 heals is typically a crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Does semm a little on the low side, but keep going with this AA as it will definitely even out.<br />
Your base chance to crit is only about 1/33 currently, but will increase to about 1/6 when maxxed. Wait till you hit your first hot streak and you will change your mind about this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I agree with the others. I have maxed crit healing, and I get crits fairly often. I don't always notice the crits but it's nice when someone's HP jumps up by more than you expect it to. It can save lives.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">If you max your Healing Gift(including AHG) AAs, you will crit 16% of the time like the description says, duh.</div></div><hr />
