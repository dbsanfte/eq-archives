<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Yedak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Now, obviously, you have your known a-holes, total nut jobs, and ks-ers, etc, but I am talking about more subtle situations.<br />
<br />
After two ugly LDON's, I feel like, despite wanting to get started xping asap, I am going to have to start being more selective of who I LDON with.<br />
<br />
Its a tough balancing act. I certainly dont ever want to group again with any of the people I was with last night, but what if I am in a group of 5 people that are ok, and the leader picks up one of them? Do I recuse myself, or live with it?<br />
<br />
Should one give awful players another chance?  I am just curious about  if you ever make the decision to not group with someone just because they are essentially a bad player, and how you decide and implement your personal &quot;ban&quot;.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any advice.<br />

The 65 paladin who sprung it on us that we were doing a hard.<br />

The poorly formed ex-guild group that had near zero melee DPS and wanted to pacify each and every single room then wondered why we ran out of time.<br />

Stupidity which can translate into inability to play ones class to the level one would expect from a person of their level.<br />

And no, I will not group with them again. Nor will I group with some people with whom I've won adventures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the 65 Enchanter who did not know what a Rune was for... the self-confessed ebayed 65 epic cleric (/sigh) who wanted us to teach him the finer points of healing during an LDoN...<br />
<br />
Thieves/Liars...<br />
<br />
There is one person on my home server with whom I will not group under any circumstances (no names) but I have now been invited into 2 PU groups for LDoNs which I joined, not knowing the person was in the group. A polite /tell to the GL and /lfg on... Also known ninja looters, people who go LD with full LDoN splits... <br />
<br />
They all go straight on /ignore, that way I don't even have to bother remembering them.<br />
<br />
Having said that, my ignore list is only about 10 people (in 2 years, not bad) - you have to be BAD to get on it!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've met various people who had different talents.... some were amazing at there class, but in my opinion didn't have a sense of humor, or didn't like to chat... not saying those are bad things... others weren't the pinnacle of class skill... but we'd joke around, etc...<br />
<br />
To be honest... there's no one on my &quot;never group with list&quot;.    There's a few people I would rather avoid...but I'll give em another chance to prove that one night was the exception rather than the rule.<br />
<br />
For example, on one Guk adv, we had this Beastlord.   He'd never assist... because his pet was powerful you see, and he could take another one.    Technically true... but he wouldn't even switch in the cases where we had healers to kill.<br />
<br />
Then we had a chest... which somehow he opened... and it was a +5 STR aug... none of us really care about it to be honest... but before we could even say that... he looted it.   And said simply &quot;ops&quot;.    Then not a few kills later... a +6 one drops on a mob, people roll, and he again loots... without winning.<br />
<br />
Add to that a few &quot;accidental loots&quot; even though I was MLing.<br />
<br />
This... basically blew my opinion of him.     I really don't like people that loot when they aren't supposed to... especially when you talk NODROP items... truly, in the grand scheme of things... a +5 STR aug is crap... but it's not the point.<br />
<br />
That was the only time I've grouped with that guy... now if it comes up again in a pickup group... I'll give him another chance... maybe... just maybe... those were accidental loots... **** does happen to people... I know... it doesn't LOOK like it... and maybe I'd be singing a different tune if he looted FT 1 augs instead of +5 STR ... but my point is... short of something horrible (which to date hasn't happened)... I'm down with giving people a second chance.   <br />
<br />
That's not to say I'll seek out these people... but I won't run if they're in the same group.<br />
<br />
- I realize that not everyone is a master at the game.   All I expect at a minimum, is that you play your class strengths.    If you're an enchanter, I expect you to mez... but I don't hold it against you if you're not a master charm user.       As a shaman... I expect you to get in the face and get the mobs slowed... but if you're not an expert at being the primary healer... I understand.<br />
<br />
- I like communication... some people do, some people don't... I prefer communication... but as long as you work with the group... it's not critical that you talk our ear off.<br />
<br />
- I like people who are funny... or don't take themself too seriously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I am forgiving of a tactical mistake in the heat of battle, at least as long as it is not an often-repeated error.<br />
<br />
The thing that quickly makes a player not worth grouping with is one that shows no interest in working with the group.<br />
<br />
I'm sure everybody has run into one or two folks like this (I know I have :( ).  Some people seem to want to do their own thing and not contributing to the current tactics of the group. <br />
<br />
 Maybe it’s someone who gets impatient with the puller and decides to pull one while we wait (usually just before the puller arrives with the BIG MOB we've been waiting for), and then does it again and again.  Or maybe it’s an argument where on player just flat out refuses to do something that would benefit the group, and instead wants to do their own thing (often people want to melee or cast dd, instead of performing a less exciting, but more important role).  I've been able to work with people that make mistakes (and have had new tactics taught to me from people who would say that I was doing something dumb I’m sure).  But when you get folks that do not seem to want to learn a new role, or fill a needed niche that the group needs, mobs that were flowing as smooth as silk can suddenly become agonizingly hard.</div></div><hr />

I've met far too many people who go into a situation with the attitude of &quot;I know all&quot; only to end up using their vast knowledge to screw up in every possible way. Everyone has a bad day but sometimes it goes to far. The Shadowknight that insisted Shaman could pacify springs to mind and that, since I didn't know this, I must be an ebay n00b. The same guy that proceeded to get mad at the Wizard for not hasting him. The same guy who kept saying how he had 4 level 65 characters and he knew exactly what he was doing so we should all just shut up and get our free XP. The same guy who, when asked to snare, said that Shadowknights didn't get a snare spell. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Quiinn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have 2 people on my do not group list...aka ignore...(actually there are 4 but the other 2 are there due to spamming ooc/shout with casino crap).<br />
<br />
The first was a rogue who bailed in the middle of an LDoN because we had a wipe and he 'didnt think' we could still finish so it wasnt worth his time.  In the end, we did better without him and finished with 7 or 8 minutes to spare.  Plus we didnt have to share the 3 drops with his ugly mug.<br />
<br />
The second was a rogue who in the middle of the dungeon just stopped.  He apparantly went afk without telling anyone.  We disbanded him from the group 25 minutes later and then failed the dungeon another 25 minutes after that(one item short in a collect 30).  10 minutes after failing he sent a tell to the group leader asking if we had won?  This guy was afk in the LDoN for an entire hour.  <br />
<br />
I can live with people who dont play their class well.  I can live with people who have average at best gear.  But I refuse to mess with people who simply WASTE my time, by making a commitment to the group then refusing to stick to it.  <br />
<br />
I've been fortunate to not experience any loot-thieves, so can't comment on how I would handle that situation.<br />

<br />
but there are people i will not group with again.  <br />
<br />
the person that after being told 3 times that we will be doing buffs outside before entering, and still runs right into the adven without any buffs.<br />
<br />
the person that has been told 3 times i want about 1min to cast a pet, equip and buff it and swap back my spells before the first pull.  then pulls one 2seconds after we enter.<br />
<br />
the cleric that lets the MT die, or forgets a few heals so he can melee.  <br />
<br />
the group that wants to assign the crucial role for that makeup to the one person that is exactly 7 lvls below the highest person.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like the guy who told the cleric she was a stupid ***** for asking what his HP was so she could gauge the CH %. The cleric who told me to MH because he wanted to bring his melee skills up, and then proceeded to call me every name in the book because I told him slowing was my primary duty. The two (in the SAME GROUP) Ebayers I've had the &quot;pleasure&quot; of grouping with. The druid who evacked us because the puller brought three mobs, and then cussed (I mean, REALLY cussed) at the group because we all immediately started running back to the spot we'd left off without waiting for the mobs to &quot;go away so we'd be safe.&quot; <br />
<br />
/ignore ...<br />
<br />
I will positively NOT group with AFK'ers, loot-mongers, people who have problems communicating and impatient people, to name a few. But you've REALLY got to do something for me to /ignore or refuse a group with you.<br />

Im sure you have met some yourself , especily if you start and run your own groups a lot .<br />
they are the person with &quot;LFG for LDoN&quot; or something simular as there LFG note . BUT when you send them a Tell asking if they want too join . They never give a simple YES or NO answer . They come off with &quot;How many people you got ?&quot; ... &quot;Got a Chanter ?&quot; .... &quot;There gonna be a bard too Pull ?&quot; .. or my personal favorite being a 65 200+aa shaman &quot;Send me a tell when you find a slower or something and if im still LFG ill join .&quot;<br />
<br />
I have even met people that expect me too type the NAMES of everyone in the group ! and agree too clear the names of any added people with them before invite . I mean if your that picky you should prob just make your own group .<br />
In short if you are in a PUBLIC LFG ... guess what ? your advritiseing your servers in a PUBLIC way . So be prepared too meet the public .<br />

Generaly i dont group with these guys .. becase listing the names of every group member and listing too there &quot;dont invute noob_01 or ill BAIL buddy .&quot; Crap wastes my time .</div></div><hr />

My rule for not grouping with folks is very simple and complex all at the same time.  Jerks are the only players I will not group with, but the defining qualities of a jerk varies.

<br />
            I was in a pickup group, me and a druid where sharing MH duties, I was mostly slowing though. Bout 1/2 way thru people starting going LD consistantly, which bugs the hell outa me, cause we had less than 1/2 the items we needed with less than 1/2 the time left. So, we shoved on without em. 1 of them came back, the other didnt. Of course the one that didnt come back was the ML... The monk/jerk_#02 of the group was constantly asking for a haste when i had 0 mana and 0 patience for his annoying request every 10 seconds. We had about 10 minutes left with 2 to go, and a monk with silver chitin hand wraps and a FBSS was asking for a 20% haste that prollly would bring his ATK speed down bout .1 seconds. I told him, I'm to busy healing the MT(MT was a rogue, the warrior was ML, he not coming back obviously) then the inevitable happened, group got wiped out, and the monk/jerk_#02 went LD( he was our new ML)  People like that annoy me...<br />
<br />
NEXT STORY.<br />
            Another pickup group, doing OK, then the cleric says this, and i quote. Retarded_Cleric_#01: Guess slow the pulls down, 50m...<br />
Now, I dont know how much this clerics heals cost, but in my book, 50m was ok... I as a shaman will be ok with pulls at 20m, cause all i was doing was slowing, occasional regen on some people. Then the cleric was geting all pissy about it, and decided he didnt want to group with us anymore. So, he leaves, we keep moving. Making good pace even without him, I get a tell bout 1/2 an hour later. <br />
Retarded_Cleric_#1: Hey, did you win that adv?<br />
Ggrugnuuk: No, still working on it.<br />
Retarded_Cleric_#1: Can I come back, I can't find another group<br />

we all give him hell for being e-bayed, and zone in and start killing.  first mob drops, second one is rooted, and third is queued up.  i drop a slow on two, and start to target the MT for a Q, and all five group members are suddenly gone.<br />
<br />
the wizard had accidentally fired off lessor succor (or whatever) and everyone but me got punted back to zone-in.  it was quite amusing, since i got to stand there and pretend to melee for a min or two while they all ran back.  luckily we were more or less at zone-in, so no harm done.<br />

Would I group with incompetent players again? Depends on how bad they were. If they played a key  role, MH, MT or a mezzer that would/clould not mez, you bet I would decline. I'm not real interested in dieing. If they didn't have a key role ( I'm talking peeps that are not willing to learn), might be fun to laugh at them. Yep, I'm not nice sometimes. /evil grin.

Being not fun is not necessarily inexperienced. It's more likely rude, impatient, bossy or incompetent behavior that will get someone added.<br />
And those who ask &quot;How many in the group?&quot; when I ask them to join don't get another response from me. That just screams impatience. And I really enjoy getting a tell from them asking if they can still join 1/2 hour after we started the adv.</div></div><hr />

i fell outta my chair lol.  then i realized he disbanded right after mission and didnt give us our split.  <br />

this inabilty to heal with clerics has happened to me before *curse Pickup groups* but no one answered soo bad.  atleast sometimes they went &quot;afk&quot; meleeing while team wiped.  but not this one case.  This guy was a pro at not healin and he knew what he was doin</div></div><hr />

Why wouldnt you cast pet immediately upon zoning then send pet in on mob, can buff it while its fighting.. /boggle</div></div><hr />

No doubt, I have done several LDoNs with just me and a ranger as CC and healers; sure its tough, but its TONS more fun that /yawn another single pull......now granted back before I had VP3 I hated CC, but now its trivial really.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Denn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Maybe it's just me... But I just could care less. <br />
I have NO ONE on my ignore list, or never group list<br />
<br />
1) People I have found to be a-holes one day are the nicest people the next. <br />
<br />
2) I make mistakes all the time, I certainly wouldn't hold some silly mistake against somebody, or never group with them again. I cant tell you how many times I've VP'ed the wrong mob when 2 are inc. I cant tell you how many times I've accidently zoned in because I had bard sow on and FLEW over that hill into the pitt.<br />
<br />
3) If someone says something really stupid, I just ignore it.<br />
<br />
4) If the puller insistes on pacify every pull, I'll just talk them into &quot;Lets just try pulling several mobs once and lets see how it goes&quot; 9 times out of ten they find it very fun and want to do it every time.<br />
<br />
5) I dont have to be the slower... I find I get more groups if people know I'll play healer... let the beastie slow... or.. lets not slow at all.<br />
<br />
6) if the cleric says I'm LOM, I'll take over healing. They may not have the best gear and need a little help... A simple tell to the cleric to let them know I'm there to help them, always keeps my groups moving forward<br />
<br />
7) people who dont talk or &quot;aren't fun&quot; are probably busy doing their job, or maybe they just aren't in a talkative mood today... or they just dont like to talk. No need to crucify these people.. You may find they are just a little shy... make them feel welcome and wanted.<br />
<br />
8) I used to question the groups I got in when LDON first came out... now.. I'll group with anyone... even if they are all level 58... It just adds some more excitment... if I lose.. big friggin deal... I just dont care. The win % doesn't do anything, except boost your ego.. and honestly... does it really matter?<br />
<br />
9) Real life happens, sometimes you may have to go AFK. I regular group with a guy who plays at work.. sometimes he has to go afk for 20 min or so.. we all just put more effort into and finish... sometimes without him.<br />
<br />
10) People in adventures are in a hurry... they shouldn't have to wait for pet classes to cast and buff pets. I try to never hold up the group.<br />
I set a spell mem with pets buffs/slow/heal in it and cast my pet while they fight down the first mob. I have more then enough time to start fighting as soon as we zone in.<br />
<br />
After reading all the comments I just felt a little defensive. I'd really hate to think all the dumb things I've said or did in the past were held against me. I try to adjust to other people, not force them to adjust to me.</div></div><hr />

-i am sure i am missing twice as many as i have stated, but lastly the person i have never meet before who insists they know me and then demands me to answer why they know me...<br />
<br />
<br />
There is also the idiot factor, perhpas you know one person isn't the brightest.  they may happen to be in your group, but you are willing to put up with it for whatever reason.  The problem is idiots attract idiots.  So with the odd chance that you only have 1 idiot in the group it is np, but when you relize they invited one or more of their friends......now you are grouped with a bunch of ebay morons, who are asking you for virtue/kei/sow (in the adventure), and wondering why you are pulling instead of popping a warder. (sure i am blowing this out of perportion, but just think about a bad raid day.  one guys &quot;Accidently&quot; trains the raid...next thing you know clerics are missing heals, people are breaking mez, you end up tanking 3k quader xxx, someone starts wandering around away from raid to see xxx, you see half the raid die to ramp, then have some idiot yelling xxx isn't dead when it was only a necro who woke the dead, and then you go LD right before you bid loot.  it is the snowball effect and it happens on small or large scales during bad days.)<br />
<br />
After doing over 100 ldon pickupgroups, i kind of get an idea of most people's gear/aa/skill because 80% of the time I see the same people in ldon.<br />
yeah, so i am really picky...i try to only group with folks from sol ro on up (we have over 8 guilds in the EPs on xeg., with 4 in time and 2 really close), i try to only group with DPS groups and i try to not do the pickup &quot;i think this group can take a hard&quot; groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
then again, more often than not, going against the grain can prove more fun than the sure win.  honestly i like ldons and raids that turn out to be a challange/skin of you teeth type win.  only people i flat out refuse to group with are the 8 names that have earned my ignore list since 2k.<br />
<br />
ps. it was fun/mentaly healing to rant about all the little things that piss me off with people in LDoN *snickers*</div></div><hr />

We had a cleric do this the other night, despite being told by us to stop and sit still.<br />

He HAD to be the main looter because he liked to loot (warning sign number 1).  He kept pulling when the shaman (main healer) said she was OOM (happened 2 times).  Kept wanting to go after the named before we got the win.  Wanted to roll on a BP drop off named that HE WAS ALREADY WEARING.  The to top it off when we got back to the camp to split he somehow forgot to split the plat part of the change.  We all got gold, silver, copper...  How do you split gold silver and copper without going /split 0 50 50 50 ??  Granted the 50pp or so each from the split is hardly meaningful for me on an alt, but...<br />

Allthe others are just going get me killed for no reason and I do that good enough myself.<br />
<br />
Why wouldnt you cast pet immediately upon zoning then send pet in on mob, can buff it while its fighting.. /boggle <br />
Well I dont know about any others but when I cast my pet I dont have my slow up as I have found swaping out buffs after casting pet takes alot longer.  And not only do I buff up my pet but any other pet classes that are with me.  The added Dex helps tons with the pets proc rates.  Having 2-3 pets procing 150 DD 1-2 Extra times each adds up fast.  And not only do I have to buff those pets I have to hand mage summoned gear to my pet.  It only takes me a little over a min to get my pet up online if I am ready and any other pets there only add about 30-40 more per pet.  I guess this just falls in the dont listen department.  I have had few groups that I asked for the 2 min set up and the MT pulled right away and then was peaved that I was not slowing right away as they got two on the pull.</div></div><hr />

- He kept spamming ooc here and there with ascii of boobs and other immature crap.<br />
- He looted every mobs we killed. Taking the high value gems if there was any and leaving the junk.<br />
- We killed a giant named at some point who dropped Ornate silk something pattern. He quickly looted them as we were congratulating our only pure caster in the group and LD'd...<br />

I've played this game for far too long to just jump into something sight unseen. Something as simple as &quot;we have a tank, healer, and some dps, just need a slower&quot; would work nicely. Whenever I'm doing the inviting I give that information up front, costs me very little effort. If you don't know the people there's no telling what they have going on. They could be a bunch of level 30's who don't realize you can't invite a 65 for an LDoN, or maybe someone who thinks its a cool idea to try to do it with just 3 (yes I got pulled into one of those once, it failed).<br />
Not to make this overly long, but here's an example of just tonight.<br />
<br />
After raiding all day, I come back from a couple hour break. It's midnight my time, nothing going on in guild so I put /lfg up. Get a tell from someone I don't know, the tell is &quot;oi&quot;. What the hell is that? I send him a tell back &quot;oi?&quot;. Meanwhile I do a /who of his name, he's anon and /lfg. I look under the /lfg listings and he's not there. I check the box-show all results- and he comes up as a 45 cleric. Hm, interesting. 5 minutes later he sends me a tell saying &quot;you up for a challenging adventure?&quot; No idea what this guys getting to so I answer as politely as I can that he is just too young to be grouping with a 65 but good luck whatever your doing. He sends me a tell back saying &quot;what your not up to it?&quot; He goes on ignore, no reason why to listen to any more. Now I get a tell from someone who wants to do an HoH group, I never do HoH or PoV anymore its just too slow. I politely tell him no thanks, I don't hunt in HoH anymore. He sends me 5 tells asking if I won't change my mind. At the same time someone sends me the &quot;hey wanna do LDoN&quot; tell. I say LDoN would be nice, what kind of group do you have? I always hate having to ask that question, never know when someone is going to be a smartass about it. No answer, HoH guys is still sending me tells, but too busy answering the other person to put him on ignore (had a long and difficult name to spell). Now the LDoN person tells me they have a paladin, rogue, mage, and hopefully me. I ask the LDoN person what level is the tank? &quot;Oh, he's 58. I tell them, well, I can slow or I can heal, but I don't think I can keep a 58 alive doing both. No answer for a while, HoH guys still at it, maybe the 45 cleric too (he's on ignore remember). I tell LDoN person-thanks for the offer but I'm going to pass. I'm annoyed now and decide to see if Lord Ghiosk is out of his castle so I can solo him (no epic yet). While I'm zoning the LDoN guys asks &quot;whats your eta?&quot; Gah. I try to tell them as politely as I can that I'm not joining them and already told them so. I get a long tell from him about how I should have been more specific and that he'd invited a cleric but that doesn't matter now cause he can get another slower. Then just go get another slower, lol.<br />
Anyway if I'd been in a more tolerant mood I may have given the LDoN group more of a chance, but all that crap compounded just made me lose my patience. I don't care if a group has a chanter, or a cleric, or whatever else, just so long as it has a chance to actually succeed. I'd rather group with a 65 tank but hey, I'd let the 58 give it a try, just let me know up front what it is you expect of me and maybe I'll be willing to do it.<br />
Lots of other reasons to not group with people, I just gave that one because it runs contrary to what some of you have been posting. Yes, there are people who look at it differently from you, try seeing it from their perspective sometime. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Shadrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">I have to relay a short story of my own embarassment here.  I was in a pickup adventure a while ago in (surprise surprise) Mistmoore.  We zoned in, and had a pull come right to the zone-in.  It was a little hectic right off the bat, because there wasn't much room to get organized and we were already fighting a mob.  I've had that happen a few times, where a mob agros right at the zone-in.<br />
<br />
Anyway, in the confusion of trying to slow the mob, summon my pet, shrink myself (twice), etc., I clicked on the stupid zone-out door.  *Poof* - back into Lesser Faydark.  Doh.  I zone back in, apologize to my groupmates, only one of which had I ever met before, and began summoning another pet.  In my embarassment over holding up the group, I clicked on the darn zone-out door again.  Back to Lesser Faydark.  Egad - this was embarassing.  I must have looked like the biggest dolt.<br />
<br />
After that, I got settled down and things went fine.  We didn't have any deaths and won the adventure.  But those first five minutes were horribly embarassing.  If my groupmates had been less forgiving, they might have booted me right there for &quot;being a noob&quot;.  Hopefully I didn't end up on anyone's &quot;do-not-group-with&quot; list over that.<br />

p.s.  Galelor, not grouping ever again with someone because, as you put it,<br />
<br />
&quot;the tanks that drop like rocks cuz of lack of gear/aa&quot; <br />
<br />
sounds a little elitist to me.  Not everyone is able to play this game for obscene amounts of time, acquire raid-quality gear, and accumulate hundreds of AAs.  You sound as though their inability to do so is a character flaw.  No offense, but I wouldn't group with you, after reading your comments in your last post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u67"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p67">&quot;Actually, that seems like a pretty decent group.<br />
<br />
As with all highly versatile classes, the impact of poor play and ignorance is more obvious with necros than with a warrior or something, but I have had great results with pet-heavy groups&quot;<br />
<br />
Trust me it was horrible.  Try pulling a Tak room of 6 mobs with no pax, and no CC.  It was ugly.<br />
<br />
No tank also btw.</div></div><hr />
