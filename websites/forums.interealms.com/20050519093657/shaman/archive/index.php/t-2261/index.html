<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd heard people say Reinforcement 1 worked in such a way as to give 1500 pt Torpors... so I got it, and it looked like I was getting 1500 pt Torpors... after the patch today, it looks like the Torpors are back to 1200 pts... anyone wanna check and confirm this?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>SisterLi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might want to check what other regen items and spells you have on at the time you cast Torpor.  <br />
<br />
Torpor + regrowth + cantata of replenishment means that I go up just under 1500 with one cast of Torpors.  About 300 of that is not from Torpors.<br />
<br />
At any rate, the most useful way to collect data on this is to list what other regen effects you had on while casting Torpor.<br />
<br />
I do not have Reinforcement 1, and get just under 1500, with Torpor, regrowth, Cantata of replen, and 3 points into regen.<br />
