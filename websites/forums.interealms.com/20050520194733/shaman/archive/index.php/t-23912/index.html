<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have to say (grudingly) that I am quite impressed with OoW thus far. <br />
<br />
I am a casual player - play maybe 15 - 20 hours per week, so I am only just starting to look around in OoW. And I am likeing what I am seeing. Ok, I haven't seen much yet, but so far it is good. <br />
<br />
I can solo - its slow and a little risky, but I can do it. And the mobs that I can solo seem to have a chance of dropping gear that is good enough to be upgrades for me. And yes, I am sure some of you more uber (i.e. EP+ geared) shaman could solo GoD, but unter_shaman such as I couldn't.<br />
<br />
Duoing is easy<br />
<br />
Named are single groupable and drop some nice stuff<br />
<br />
AA Exp is pretty darn good (although 66+ is hell slow).<br />
<br />
The zones look and feel good<br />
<br />
The mobs do mitigate slow, but most of them don't seem to mitigate it much and don't seem to have insane resists or insane hp.<br />
<br />
The new epics are sweet and don't require raid sized forces to achieve<br />
<br />
I cannot comment on the content for the real top end players, but for the Joe Shmo player such as I, it seems, so far, to be a damn good expansion. I am having fun anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I have to agree. I am not time flagged ... or heck even elementally flagged .. I'm only a lil ol 59 shaman who has been playing for 7 or so months. I can go into Draniks and solo. Duoing with a warrior is my preference, we take down named and have ventured on to nobles causeway and taken down a few 62ish mobs. It felt good. <br />
<br />
The drops have been nice. I got a back piece upgrade in the first 30 minutes of killing. We've gotten four of the new augs and a bunch of those shards which for the moment are selling for around 5k on povar.<br />
<br />
Although the slow mitigation is sort of a bitch. I didn't feel that it was a HUGE hinderance to our mini-group. My heal at 59 is sufficent to keep the warrior alive.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Having a blast in OOW for the most part, I really like the feel and design of virtually all the zones I've been in.<br />
<br />
My only real gripe is WoS is DL 2.0 on my server, but luckily the proving grounds are fairly quiet on my timezone (got a 125hp/mana ring tonight, no runes yet..)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">LOL about the WOS. I finally been able to explore and have like the looks of the zones myself. <br />
<br />
But i was in WOS all of 3 seconds when a pally thought invis was optional and trained the zone after he thought it wasnt and killed two people and sent a cleric into DA. Not 2 minutes later a beast lord walked up and got killed by two mobs and died close enough to train the line again. <br />
<br />
    NOT 5 minutes goes past and a massive train comes rumbling down. I'm not exaggarating either. AFter that i was in tells with a pally planning an expedition in another place and low and behold another big train happended. <br />
<br />
I got home early today too and was already 52 people in the zone. Was quite amusing since i wasnt grouped or trying to exp yet through the mess.<br />
<br />
  Dont mean to sidetrack the thread sorry for that but i was there maybe 20 minutes and saw what 5 trains and a decent amount of people get whipped out in seconds at the zone line. Made me think of the ME trains only alot meaner. <br />
<br />
But back on track. I thought the causeways was really cool zone. I liked running past the towers and castles in draks scar. Coming back i wish i had a sled with that big hill out of Nobles Causeway back into Draks. Gates was rather boring to look at but ive been enjoying the zones ive seen in OOW so far.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hmmm so far i dont like oow, this expansion is killing the game IMO by making 120HP/mana items available to all, dont get me wrong i think its cool people can get the upgrades, but hell from a single group named ?? thats just wrong.<br />
and on DRO the only two zones really used are WOS and PG and if you dont have a rezzer team ready you can spend the next 5 hours trying to recover all your now 10 lost corpses.<br />
what happend to make us work a bit for gear/levels/AAs/access ?<br />
its just to damn easy now, like having a nice resturant becomming a McDonalds. its good but you get sick of it really really fast,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Patzy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Yeah it's a bit weird to see drops that good from such easy encounters.... but don't you just have that feeling that it's too good to last? Sooner or later they are bound to nerf the drop rates on the cool stuff. I mean, it's SOE we're dealing with. lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Question i have for people is why is 120 off single group stuff so wierd? Raid stuff is hitting what 300hps? Have to look in context of what was available before. Had hard ldon stuff hitting 85ish hps. Ldon earned gear 65-100 depending on slot. Where do you go from regular zone drops?<br />
<br />
Look for example at shaman drops in ldon. Vampiric coif is 85hps. boots of aged mystic 90hps. Wrist drop from ldon is 75hps. That all ldon stuff couple expansions ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
  I mean whats a fair jump in power for more casual player? If stuff was to much lower id be upset since it wouldnt be worth working on getting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I think in terms of expansion progression of hp/mana, 120 hp/mana is right on for named mobs.<br />
<br />
The only thing thats irking people, is 120hp/mana is venturing into VT level gear.  Something which takes an organized guild, and tons of key part farming to get to.  The only thing the new oow items lack is good focus effects and other bell and whistle type right click effects, and they'd be VT quality. <br />
<br />
Had to happen sooner or later I suppose with how the game expansion progression has been going, but I guess, for some, we had wished that keyed zones like VT, EP's, etc.., would always drop better gear.  But from SOE's perspective, how do you sell an expansion and cater to the non-raider without having gear upgrades?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly, if there weren't reasonable boosts in the gear there wouldn't be any reason to hunt in the new zones for casual players.  If there is no reason to hunt there, there's probably not much reason to buy the expansion.  Raiders are probably going to jump leaps and bounds ahead of non-raiders once we start seeing the gear that drops from the one keyed zone in OOW, and once Gates equipment becomes even easier to acquire for the raiding players because of the increased power of characters at level 70.  <br />
<br />
I just hope that Sony doesn't nerf it too hard tomorrow, because it is looking like a good casual player expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Exmo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I agree, Im time/Qvic geared and very much digging exploring Riftseekers, awesome zone, should check it out when you get 69+.

<br />
On the contrary, I think it's people like you who have already killed the game, and it's only now starting to recover with expansions like LDoN and OoW.  Everquest is supposed to be a fantasy role-playing game, not a real-time strategy game.  But people are only half joking when they suggest that the next improvement to the raid interface will allow everyone but the group leader to go afk, while he plays a private RTS against the event.<br />
<br />
On my server, the top guild's leader regularly boxes his entire CH chain.  He actually forces the clerics to log off, then runs them all using macros and minimized EQW windows (since his comp can't handle having any of them actually visible).  Even though this makes it so that if the main tank dies the whole thing is screwed (since he can't change who the clerics heal quickly) he continues to do it because he feels he needs that level of control.  Meanwhile, the clerics only have to actually raid occaisionally, and get phawt lewtz for letting their leader use them the rest of the time.<br />
<br />
In contrast, I spent countless hours giving mself carpal tunnel so that I could have the tradekill levels needed for the shawl.  I then repeated prayers for hours, killed hundreds of greens in Crystal Caverns, and ran over every square inch of GD looking for glowing shardwurms.  All this so that I could get a single peice of equipment which is becoming more and more outdated.  Between me and the clerics in our server's top guild, who put more &quot;work&quot; in?<br />
<br />
Fantasy RPGs are based on fantasy novels and movies, and both of those are based on GROUPs.  When EQ first came out it was this way.  Raids were epic events, where you killed DRAGONs (this used to actually be a big deal).  But as more expansions came out, and SoE ran out of creative ways to make content for the end-game, so instead they simply made mobs with more and more hp and damage.  Eventually even that wasn't enough, and they had to actually create interesting raid events.  However, what's been lost is the idea that everquest is a game about groups.<br />
<br />
LDoN and OoW have helped bring that idea back.  With LDoN I can spend a lot more time than any raider just get the points to buy a single peice of inferior equipment.  Likewise with OoW, I can group in a zone for many hours before I win the roll on a single spell, let alone a peice of equipment with less than half the HP of the most uber equivilant.  If anything is wrong with this, it's that the rewards are too low, not too high.<br />
<br />
If you like spending your time with 71 other people being told what to do that's fine, I don't object.  But don't whine that the expansion is ruining everything just because someone who has a different playstyle than you can now get loot that still isn't anywhere close to as good as current raid gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I just hope that Sony doesn't nerf it too hard tomorrow, because it is looking like a good casual player expansion.<br />
<br />
Get what you can while you can now.  It's pretty much standard SOE practice with every expansion to raise the drop rates for the first month, so that people still on the fence can hear from their friends about all the phawt lewtz which drops there like the snow in Everfrost.  Then once everyone who's going to buy the expansion has, they nerf the drop rates so that everyone has something to evercamp until the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Now maybe (well not even maybe, definiately), I'm just a bitter old EQ player who's quit one to few times.  But I think if you objectively researched posts on forums, patch messages, etc. for a month and a half or so period after each expansion, you'd see a very clear pattern of what I described.  So seriously, if there is some OoW item on Allakhazam that you really want, find a grop to get it now, because in a few weeks I expect it's going to be a lot rarer.<br />
<br />
Of course, as I said this is the practice with every expansion.  Therefore, it's no reflection on OoW, which I agree is an excellent casual player expansion, regardless of what happens to drop rates.</div></div><hr />

Great post, that about sums it up for me too :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I spent the time to do VT keys for two characters and then only went once. I don't give a rats ass if everyone and their brother and the pet dog can get VT gear now, Luclin is 3 friggen years old. <br />
<br />
I personally think one group mobs should be dropping gear that was top of the line at most two expansions old so most people can keep up and people that raid will still have an expansions edge. I woulda had 120/120 stuff dropping in god (off mobs that didn't need a time level warrior to tank)  and 200/200 stuff droping in omens personally. <br />
<br />
I know they going to nerf the drop rates, They always do. It is really going to screw people on spells more then anything else. There are probably 5x the ammount of people that were 65 then those that were 60 when pop was released and they all need tons of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Tobyus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">It may not show in my level and gear, but I've been playing EQ since 99.  I was playing a level 51 Shaman just a month after Kunark came out.  I also got a Gem Encrusted Ring off of a giant in Firiona Vie, before they moved them to dropping in the bottom of Sebilis.  I quit playing the game about that time, gave my account to a friend, and didn't play again until Velious, when I started a new account and created a Cleric.  I leveled the cleric up to about 46, then started a rogue and played him to level 58 when Planes of Power came out.  I bought Planes of Power, and played it for a few nights....at first I liked it and then people started to settle in and I couldn't find a group for about a week straight, so I quit again.  <br />
<br />
Now, since I had so much frustration with not being able to solo with a rogue, and not being able to find a group, I decided that this time I was going to play a Shaman again (back to my roots).  So, I started my second Shaman about the time that LDON came out, so me and some friends could level up in adventures.  It was fun and we were able to get into the high 30's before my friends started to burn out on playing alt's.  I kept playing until I was 55 and was able to afford Anathema from the Butcherblock adventure merchant...and then I realized I had nobody to play with, and I was having to struggle for hours to create a single adventure group any time I wanted to play.  Then Gates of Discord came out...and I didn't even bother buying it.  <br />
<br />
Now, I have come back again and have seen a glimmer of hope with the Omens expansion pack being geared towards my style of gaming, and I am hoping that this patch doesn't take away any of that hope.  I guess I'll just cross my fingers tonight and pray that the patch will only correct problems and not turn the new content into an eternal camp of rare drops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The stuff that the raider can get is always going to be much better than the stuff that the casual player can get. If people are upset by the quality of gear that a casual group of level 66 players can get in OoW perhaps they need to re-evaluate where mudflation has actually put the top end gear at now.<br />
<br />
Frankly, for me, the whole thing that makes me want to play the game is seeing my 'toon advancing. It doesn't have to be advancing in leaps and bounds - feet and inches will do fine, but it does have to seem like progress is being made - that Weyalan is getting someplace. <br />
<br />
GoD didn't do that for me. I got nothing from GoD, nothing at all (please understand, I know GoD was great for the top end guys).<br />
<br />
LDoN was good, but the timesink to achieve appreciable reward is very largge. Don't get me wrong; I liked LDoN - Incorporeal Chain armor has been awesome for me, but it takes me 90 minutes to do a LDoN (including getting people together, getting to, buffing, getting from, splitting loot, etc) so with a 92% success average, it takes me almost 50 hours of play time to get a piece of Incorporeal Chain. Not that I'm complaining, far from it - LDoNs have been good to me, but once you get your 200th LDoN success, it starts to get dull.<br />
<br />
So OoW has kinda rekindled my enthusiasm. I haven't been this happy with an expansion since Velious. Sure the novelty might wear off, and maybe there are segments of the community who are less happy, but so far, so good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's quite cynical IMO.<br />
<br />
No one tells me what to do, I go because I want to go. I like the challenges of learning how to overcome new content and because I enjoy the experiences with the guild.<br />
<br />
I don't mind so much that they added this kind of equipment available to everyone. A lousy player of a class who has great gear will still be a lousy player.<br />

Lousy players don't last long in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course there is more to big-guild raiding than 71 people being told what to do. But there is more to EQ than just big guild raiding, and casual players have finally been thrown a bone.<br />
<br />
One of the nice things about OoW is that a solo player or a small group of players can just go and explore - experience seeing new stuff and new zones without either having to go through a keying / flagging process so long that by the time one got access to the zones one felt as though you had already been there for a year, or having to have such uber gear and many frioends that it was lost in the low fps.</div></div><hr />

To add to this, the casual player also doesn't NEED top end gear to do things that only one group can do /shrug. If anyone really has an issue with not getting uber gear i suggest they go play a single player game or go join a guild.</div></div><hr />

Cant say ive seen anyone in this thread complaining about not getting uber gear.<br />
One person has complained that uber gear is too easy to get.<br />

11 wis,sta,dex,str 95 hp 95 manna and some svs.<br />
How many of you raiders would have let this rot or sold it ?.<br />

However personally I wouldnt have given 5 more levels...those just make GOD raid encounters easier than they are. Challenge of raid encounters keeps me ticking for game :)<br />
<br />
I play in high-end raiding guild (&quot;Txevu-class&quot;) and we raided WoS nameds few days ago with 30-40 peeps (Velketorin, Cipheron, Hulchor and &quot;Fatboy&quot;). GoD level loot, some has very fast spawn (due relate to epics.) At least those bosses are quite a bit easier than the ones in Ugua, Inktuta etc. which indicates that OoW is sort of climpse to EQ2 raiding content. Tho I am sure there are much stronger bosses waiting on other zones - I hope there is :)  <br />

If our RL tried that we wouldn't have any clerics left in our guild on about the 2nd attempt - and I think most of the rest of the guild would quit also - I certainly would, and tell this moron to buy a bank of PC's so he could play an entire raid by himself.<br />

The 1 group progression path is squarely and surely aimed through the sewers of GoD and hard LDoN's. And trying to keep a low AA'd tank, geared with the 40-60hp stuff one group can hunt for (barring extreme LDoN abuse) in that gives me nightmares.<br />

Yes, it's sad that SOE has made it so that this is sort of gear needed to survive, number inflation has gone crazy.</div></div><hr />

Tho the rollout and improvements of OOW make is the best expansion and smothest to date. The beta testing of this expansion was far better than any others. GoD basically is a high end expansion to keep the high players from getting bored, but it should have been released after OOW. OOW from what you can see realy only gives a few raid trials and a couple of zones aimed at the very high end guilds, where GoD will continue to keep the High end guilds happy for quite some time. <br />
I personnaly don't envisage many guilds even at lvl 70 having an easy time in Uqua, Ink, texvu or tacvi for a while to come and now you caan add Riftseekers, raid trials in PG and Anguish to that list. I think the improvements in the game from the release of OOW will open up a lot of GoD and make the game far more enjoyable for those at 65+.<br />
<br />

Although I've can't say I've seen him do it in person or anything, it is well-known information in certain circles on our server.  And he's not the only one who does this kind of thing (although he is the only one who does it for a CH chain).  I also know of two other people (one is on Karana) who run six different characters at the same time so that they can have their own group, using log watchers, IT automation programs like AutoIT, and EQW.  ShowEQ is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to 3rd party programs and EQ.<br />
<br />
To answer you question kevagron, there are three ways to quote that I know of:<br />
<br />
1) When you hit the &quot;reply&quot; button that's in the lower right hand corner of every post, you will get the usual response form, except it will have the contents of the message you clicked on surrounded by the code to get nifty formating and &quot;Originally Posted by Loramin.&quot; <br />
<br />
2) If you want to quote multiple people, or make up quotes, click the &quot;post reply&quot; that's at the top and bottom of each thread page.  This will give you an empty response form.  There is a toolbar above the empty text box, and on this toolbar there is an icon like that of word ballon in a comic strip.  It's between a little earth icon and a number sign icon.  Click on it and a window will pop-up asking you to type in the your quote.  Copy paste whatever you are quoting here, click ok, and it will insert the quote with the appropriate code.<br />
<br />
3) You can also just do the quote thing manually.  Type in your quote, add quote, in brackets, in front of it, then add /quote, in brackets, after it.  If you want to attribute the quote to someone, add ='their name' inside the brackets after quote (but not /quote).  So, if you did: (quote='Bob')Bob is cool(/quote) with brackets instead of parentheses, you would get:<br />
Bob is cool</div></div><hr />

LOL this is a hilarious outlook. I am not even going to respond to this mindless drivel. You have obviously been to very very few raids, because almost NONE of todays raid fall into the &quot;stand there and hit 1 key over and over&quot; category anymore.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">GoD basically is a high end expansion to keep the high players from getting bored, but it should have been released after OOW. <br />
<br />
That's just it.  I still can't fathom how they could have screwed this up so much.  <br />
<br />
I mean, GoD is decent now, but it would be better if they retuned it back, and used it as a follow to Omens.  That just seems to make so much more sense.  <br />
<br />
Anyone who thinks 125 hp/mana bracers are too uber for folks to get in 1 group encounters nowadays in an expansion geared to level 70 growth is simply nuts.  It's barely appropriate gear, and as far from too much as possible.  <br />
<br />
I'm wearing a bracer from VT that STILL easily as good as that item and arguably better. <br />
<br />
Should gear never have gotten better than the Dwarven Ringmail Tunic?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">To add to this, the casual player also doesn't NEED top end gear to do things that only one group can do /shrug. If anyone really has an issue with not getting uber gear i suggest they go play a single player game or go join a guild.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a loaded statment unfortunately. Why? Because there are so many different levels of raids and people get upset when content from multiple expansions gets eclipsed. How long should it take before regular gear beats VT gear? Elementals gear?<br />
<br />
Would be a pretty hollow expansion if OOW was said to have alot of unkeyed zones but the casual to heavy casual/family guild people couldnt gear up enough to do it. <br />
<br />
So people in this thread are not complaing about what the raiders can get gear wise when you are talking 175hp-300hps gear. Roughly i might add i dont really know whats is average raid gear. I dont need highend but i do do enough as a heavy casual that 120 hps gear isnt making the game too easy for me. I can go to alot of places in OOW i want to be able to play in it also. If some gimp plays in One zone nightly and is getting 120hps gear on every slot who cares. He isnt imposing on me and he isnt imposing on raiders either because they arent going anywhere. I just wish sony was able to minirevamp all the semi older raid zones more often. Say give VT a bump in mob power and gear reward so it feels viable for people who want to pursue it. But cant hold the rest of the playerbase back if the old raid content is going to remain status quo.<br />
<br />
Btw i dont mean all OLD raid content given a bump. But something like VT with the amount of time spent having to key up to raid it might be plausable to do that too. I know sony wants people to play in the new stuff so i know bumping just single pop in and kill raid  content wouldnt be viable.</div></div><hr />

Tell me Monjay:<br />
<br />
1. What is my job on a raid<br />
2. What is the same thing on every raid?<br />
3. What is it I can't and won't choose to do?<br />
4. What is it I do that can be 'scripted' to be the same on every raid? <br />
5. Lastly, tell me what it is you do on every raid. Does your guild/raid leader always tell you what to do on every raid you go on? Do you ever do anything besides Malos/Slow/Spam heal without being told?<br />
<br />
What I do on raids changes constantly. I am always making decisions dynamically based on what is happening. I have the utmost doubt that anyone could script what I do on raids.<br />
<br />
I don't think Loramin's post is dead on in all respects at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">I spent four hours in Walls of Slaughter (a zone that is ugly on the order of Plane of Earth) and don't plan on going back. There were 109 people in that zone at 9 p.m. EST on a Tuesday night. Trains every three minutes, it seemed like, constant OOC and /shout arguments about KS'ing and ninja looting ... my god, if that's the kind of crap I want I'll go solo in BOT. The funny part is this behavior was coming from level 65+ folks who seem to have forgotten the virtues of invis and maturity. The experience was terrible, too ... it took 10-15 mobs to make up 1% regular experience. I'm perfectly happy to hole up in Yxtta where I'm one of seven or eight people in the zone and just grind away and have fun with my friends. Experience there seemed to be about 5-6 mobs per 1% experience.<br />
<br />
Honestly, I doubt I'll be going back through OOW anytime soon. Noble's Causeway is nothing but trains, as is WOS. I haven't felt a desire to go beyond those zones.<br />
<br />
That said, I do think OOW has put the enthusiasm back in the game for a lot of folks, myself included. It feels good to work TOWARD something, as opposed to just mindlessly making the little AA bar go up time and time again. GOD was great and still is great for me ... and I'm nowhere near &quot;end-game&quot; anything. After acquiring 4 pieces of LDON armor and augging them nearly completely, LDON got seriously old. I haven't done an LDON adventure in several weeks. OOW gives Tordail access to new levels and new AA's, and that's pretty exciting even if the zones and the people in them fall a bit flat.<br />
<br />
Also: our epic 1.5 script is rather well-written, IMO. That'll keep me busy for a good long while. Kudos to whoever wrote it.<br />
<br />
To quote Weyalan: &quot;The stuff that the raider can get is always going to be much better than the stuff that the casual player can get.&quot; Yep, that's true, and so is this statement I adapted from him: &quot;If people are upset by the quality of gear that a casual group of level 66 players can get in OOW perhaps they need to...&quot; IMO, they need to hush and mind their own business.<br />
<br />
There's some +100 HP gear that drops out of Vxed/Tipt trials, both of which are one-groupable, and neither of which requires &quot;uber&quot; people to go and get it. Nobody complained about that gear, for some reason.<br />
<br />

You didn't need uber gear to get to, but if you plan on actually killing any of the names without just sitting back and let a broken charmed pet do it for you you do. <br />
<br />
Even with full omens tradeable gear I doubt my friend will be able to tank 2k+ hitting mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Kanamori Hitatomi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">First all, I'm actually liking OoW, the settings are pretty nice and the mobs are challenging.  I do not care for the grind, but that will be over some day (I hope).<br />
<br />
I casually read through this thread and about halfway down, people started talking about that this was killing them to see 120hp/mana items drop to single groupable mobs.  I am a raid, but I do not mind this at all.  It would be nice for a change to do a PU group on some GoD content when we're not raiding and be able to actually find someone not in my guild (if none available for that particular spot) to put in there and be GTG.  I did a sewers group the other day to flag some people and I found out I had more HP than the MT, that's never a good thing.  With just a few drops from OoW, he'd be able to tank for that group much more efficently.<br />
<br />
My only concern with the items right now is the drop rate and named spawn rate.  I don't care that they drop nice items, but in a group there, my group got 10 runes and like 20 items in 2 hours.  That's kinda messed up (especially since most of the items went to alts since they are almost all attunable).  If the drop rates continue, the economy is going to go down the crapper even more than it is now (ever since the bazaar came out. maybe even before then).  When all casters on the servers have at least 4k hp, somethings just kinda wrong.  Now, I'm not saying stop the drops, just make them more rare to make the people appreciate the upgrades.  Thats part of the problem.  Groups are made now in WoS/PG to kill as many named as possible and sell the loot.  That's going to inflate the economy more than SoE can ever imagine.  There will be a day (real soon) that a rusty dagger will go for 10pp in the bazaar just becuase too many people have too much pp.  And I can already see that most people are going to buy pp to buy these items in the bazaar for all of their alts to be 'uber'.  This will trivialize just about all of the previous content and we will wind up with BoT 5.0 everywhere.<br />
<br />
About the 'uber' guilds (yes, I'm in one) versus the causal player or family guild person.  I have no problems with them getting some nice upgrades beyond BoT or LDoN gear.  But every person on the server does not need to be able to buy a 120hp/mana item or go to a zone and get that item in 10 minutes.  Even as a raider, I only have 2 items with more HP/Mana on them, and yes, one of them is from WoS o.0.  So, if the drop rates are nerfed down some, do not complain.  You should need to do something besides /afk in a group and win good stuff.  Some effort besides running to the zone needs to occur.  I bust my butt off being the main slower (and die more in a week than some of these people do in a year).  Raiders, for their efforts, should have decently better items, but so far OoW has made the gap between the 2 (not including Time and Qvic+ gear) is markedly less, if not even now.  I am friends with many non-raiders and family guild people (hell, I even group with them still, since I like them and it's a change of pace from raiding) that have gotten lvl 70 focuses that I don't even have yet.  Or more spells than I have.  Granted, this will probably change as the keyed zone is figured out and what I see comming in drop rates/spawn rates happens (personnaly, I think this was SoE's effort to drive sales of the new expansion, so enjoy it while it lasts).<br />
<br />
Just look at WoS now.  There's trains every 2.0 seconds to where ever due to people that are box'ing their group or people that don't know jack going to places they don't know and not care about the results.  I've seen more crap going on in WoS over the last week than I've seen since crushbone in 1999.  KS'ing everywhere.  Rude MF'er abounding.<br />
<br />
Sorry about going off like that.  I do like this expanison so far and hope that the keyed zone is even more fun.  And please, try to have some fun in the game for a change (the game is more than min/max, numbers and being the most 'uber' there is).  It's out there, I promise.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Personally I think I'm realling going to like omens of war but right now I can't stand the place. My biggest problems with has been not the expansion it's self but the way people behave.<br />
<br />
Walls of slaughter, 2 billion people in it, constant bikkering, babbling in open channels. Practically tripping of the next group yet someone somehow manages to train every 5 minutes. Guild did some of the named in walls the other day and the hardest thing about hulcror was getting trained by him and adds while we where stll preping and then getting trained again after he was dead. Managed to kill him and loot all the loot but wiped to the adds I beleive all the looters died while looting. Bot 2.0, karnors 10.0, what ever you want to call it. It's the hot spot where everyone wants to be right now and it's horrible.<br />
<br />
Murmite proving grounds. Interesting looking zone and I know i'm gonna like it. Has a nice number of named with interesting drops and will be good for spells. Problem is nothing is mezable, lulable etc with old spells due to level caps. So your basically left with out any form of crowd control or pulling tools in a zone with some pretty bad ass mobs. Can be good exp but 2 mobs is really hard and 3 mobs is almost a sure wipe. Once people get levels and spells to handle it it won't be bad but right now it's a mean place to be. Problem is everyone in my guild seems to want to be there. They just don't seem to understand the challenge the zone presents right now with out levels and the spells.<br />
<br />
Personally I've spent most of my leveling time since OoW came out in Old zones like Kod'taz, PoEarth, PoWater. Call me crazy but I with they had more keyed/level limited zones in OoW. Keeps people out of places they aren't prepared to handle.<br />
<br />
As far as the expansion goes I like it. The mobs seem to some what more reasonable and more consistant on thier dps, have more hps which makes slow and dots more viable and useful than in GoD. Seems to be good exp so far and seems like alot of interestingly designed zones and named. Haven't done too many raids yet but have done most of the raid mobs in walls of slaughter and it gives you some interesting encounters.<br />
<br />
Definitely some tuning on things still needed or specific issues to address but over all it's nicely done. Hopefully todays patch removed the always see invis kyv on the way to MPG and gave the warfiend a tad more reasonable spawn time.</div></div><hr />

No, you don't. Ranger WS and Monk Riposte (I think) disc did us just fine, and our paladin (who was then around 8300 HP) finished the mob (Chavoor was the one we killed the most) without too much trouble.<br />

This is where people are stupid, even with great gear you needed a chanter pet to kill the nameds in tipt/vxed when it first came out. Don't talk about stuff you don't know. And no one can call you stupid.</div></div><hr />

No you didn't.<br />
<br />
Granted, you needed top end gear, but you didn't need a Charmed Pooka.<br />

I can vouch for this as I did a Trial 6 run with Harmonium (Top guild on Xev) folks many months ago (I was on my Enchanter).  Group makeup was: ENC, CLR, SHMN, PAL, WAR, WIZ.<br />
<br />
I didn't charm.<br />
<br />

To reiterate, they were top-of-the-line equipped toons (I was in LDON), but we won.  Pally would stun until I could Mez, Shaman would slow, et al.</div></div><hr />

Raiders should get better gear. But SoE should look after all their customer base, and in OoW they have, in my opinion, done so. In GoD they didn't.<br />
