<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been spending a lot of time in Lineage II for the past week.  What I've learned is if you want to do anything in the game you have to have lots of the local in game coin called adena (only one denomination).  Folks have stuff that costs literally millions of adena.<br />
<br />
So guess who's hanging around:<br />

Can Yantis be far behind?</div></div><hr />

AHAHAHAHAHAHA  all this time I thought it was a joke that people talk like that.  That's too funny, but here's my favorite part:<br />
<br />
<br />
hahahahhahaha<br />
EDIT: For the topic at hand:  I find companies like IGE and Yantis and this company L2Money or whatever, deplorable.  How low can you go when you turn profit off someone else's enjoyment that they are already paying for? Not to mention the grief it causes to players (not entrepreneurs) that need this camp or that.  I hope the Lineage folks jump all over this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>ziull</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">K next time warn me about posts like this im now cleaning my monitor cause i spit my tropicana all over it lol... the tech guy at work isint happy with me at the moment rofl.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, please warn me before you go quoting stupid, pointless remarks from folks on other boards who can't get their point across without cussing every other word. In fact, I would ask if that quote could be removed from your post, Fumeden. It lends nothing to this, or any other, discussion.<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Fumeden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I suppose you pointing out that it lends nothing to this or any other discussion somehow lends something to this or any other discussion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I suppose you pointing out that it lends nothing to this or any other discussion somehow lends something to this or any other discussion.<br />
<br />
Ahem, pointing out that pointing out that it lends nothing to this or any other discussion doesn't lend something to this or any other discussion either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I like how Z has become the new S!  It is just more hip and trendy to use Z in place of S; all the cool kids are doing it!!  Oh, and let's not forget how any piece of animal anatomy becomes a grievous insult to someone you dislike strongly.  Also, try to make sentences as long as possible; this lends credit to your argument.  Finally, try to repeat yourself using various spellings for each iteration.<br />
<br />
I only wish that everyone that took time to write such silly &quot;rants&quot; had to publicly read them aloud to a group of 20 of their peers.  Wouldn't it be funny to think that some 12 year old wrote that, but then find out tomorrow at work that it was your coworker &quot;Bob&quot; when he read it to the office?<br />

On topic: this will ALWAYS be a problem of any online game that has droppable equipment that can be equipped by anyone.  Similarly, people are always willing to buy accounts with higher leveled characters as well.  Where there is blood, there is a leech ready and waiting :)</div></div><hr />
