Hey, and Oficiator Keviazh mitigates lifetap now. I mujaki her for 425 now. Faaaaaaaaaaaaantastic.<br />

Now other classes are getting some of their less-than-defining abilities mitigated out.<br />

Then again, it could have just been a partial resist to it :P<br />

<br />
Like cleric goes to CH a tank.... bam, 1.3k heal hehe.  And while we're at it, we can mitigate melee dmg on random mobs, mitigate nukes, make all mobs summon, etc..<br />
<br />
Ok, some of those are extreme, but really, why not mitigate more than one classes primary ability?  It would be interesting to fight in a zone that had 4 mob types, one mitigate melee, one mitigates nukes/dots, one mitigates slow, and the other AE's an uncurable heal mitgation curse or something.  <br />
<br />
At least then every class would be in the same boat..  Although, with the heal one, shm would be double damaged.  Least clerics would feel some pain too though hehe.</div></div><hr />

Some mobs mitigate arrow damage but other amplify it.  Have her watch the actual damage compared to the non-melee damage message.</div></div><hr />

Not really, when i'm playing Yella I barely notice those sorts of things. The mitigation is what it is, and I do my job. But then that is the same attitude I have when playing Mokara  :D</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>bcarshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">The difference that I see in any other classes mitigation, be it arrows, or nukes, or even heals, etc.  is that they ALL get the chance to cast it again.  IE, if the nuke is mitigated, nuke another time, or fire another arrow.  Yes, there is a mana use component, and in the case of heals, the tank might not survive another cast.<br />
<br />
However, with our slows, when they are mitigated it is forever.  We can't &quot;try again&quot; to get a better slow.  Wizzys just send in another nuke to do the same damage.<br />

Nobody, of any class, has ever said, &quot;Hurray, a slow mitigating mob!&quot;  Slow mitigation is the single biggest nerf to the shaman class.  Just having one or two slow immune/mitigating mobs in your path means your group or raid has to be able to roll along without slow -- which means they don't need a slower with lame buffs, heals, and dps.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, do I want to see most mobs mitigating defining class abilities - no.  I am also a bit concerned about the implementation...but conceptually I'm fine with the approach.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Actually, I think mitigating class defining abilities in select encounters is a great way to go because it makes it easier to balance classes.  (and my main is a warrior).<br />
<br />
I agree really.<br />
<br />
Phrased this way it sounds both reasonable and beneficial.  I would love to see encounters were individual classes could shine.  Unfortunately, all we've really done is retreated back to the Holy Trio (tm) while watching other options of play get destroyed.  I miss creative niches like the old monk-shaman duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>junaper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The problem is that the Dev team doesn't look at Slow like it does it other spells.  When you use a Nuke spell you can get a resist, partial damage or full damage.  <br />
<br />
Why can't slow work the same??  When you cast slow on all mobs they have a chance or resisting, mitigating (different levels), or full slow for the amount of the spell.  This could be put in place for all mobs not just some.  This way if you cast slow and get a mitigated message you can decide if it is good enough for your group to deal with or if you need to recast slow to attempt to get a better percentage slow.  I could see making fully slowing some mobs (Named, Boss mobs) harder to help tune encounters.  Why does mitigation on mobs have to capped or predetermined (this mob can only be partially slowed)?  It should always be possible to do fully slow a mob even if the odds are against you.<br />
<br />
Recasting slow on a mob that does mitigate is not exactly feasible in today’s EQ with the fights getting shorter, but its a start and could sometime mean the difference between life and death.<br />
<br />
I've also read ideas from others about giving us and AA or innate ability to reduce the mitigation of some mob.  I think that this could also be a good idea (and possibly easier to implement) if done correctly.  These numbers are probably no where near being correct but here is how I see things could work to make shaman more desirable for the role of slowing.  I’m not sure how many stages of mitigation are currently in place but I am going to assume 3 for my example (Slightly, Partially, Mostly)<br />
<br />
Innate Ability – Shaman get 50% chance to lower mitigation level by 1 (Eg.  Shaman cast slow mob would normally be partially slowable, but shaman mostly slows the mob.<br />
<br />
AA Ability – Increase chance to lower mobs mitigation level.  Level 1 – 15% chance, Level 2 – 30% chance, and Level 3 – 50% chance.<br />
<br />
Again these numbers are probably not very accurate, but give an idea of how it could be implemented.  This would help Shaman regain a role as the primary Shaman.  It also wouldn’t make it so that content couldn’t be done without a shaman.  It would only provide the group a chance to better slow the mobs if a shaman were available.  This also would not affect immune to slow mobs.<br />
<br />
I would love to see this done, but I'm not going to hold my breath.  <br />
<br />
The current implementation of mitigation is too narrow minded.  SoE really needs to look outside the box and come up with a better implementation for the mitigation.</div></div><hr />

This is a nice idea for group encounters/xp stuff etc.<br />
<br />
I can see this being a problem on raids, where my guild (for example) has like 7 shaman slowing/debuffing willy-nilly.  I would be pissed if I fully slowed something, and someone cast over it with their spell landing for partial, or got a &quot;did not take hold&quot; message.</div></div><hr />

You right it would have to be turned in some way for raid scenerio's where multiple people are try to slow a mob at the same time.  I was think more along the xp group line when I came up with the idea, and didn't really consider the raid aspect.  I'm still sure something could be worked out for that as well.</div></div><hr />
