<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Beranor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I really like to solo, and I can do it rather effectively and yield some good exp, i haven't tried katta but maybe I will one of these days.  However, the exp you can gain in a group first teir plans PoN, PoD, PoI etc. (at my level 57, seems to be unmatched.) Yesterday I got 31% of level 56 in 5 hours in PoD.  Thats pretty damn good if you ask me, I dont see how it can be matched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ougabouga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I hear ya!  I feel the exact same way.  I've tried some of the suggested solo'ing spots, but they just don't compare with the experience gained in a group in PoP (PoN, PoD, PoI).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I hadn't seen any exp groups in the planes that matched my solo exp capability in katta until 58. In 56 + 57 I could get two yellows per KEI without epic.<br />
<br />
Now though I'm starting to solo in the planes to get through 59. I want 60 so bad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If you like to solo and don't like to group much then just solo and if the experiance is not quite as good....  you are still doing what you like to do.<br />
<br />
I try very hard not to ever do anthing I do not like to do when playing...  this is entertainment. I will do lots of things I normaly find horid when it comes time to help a friend because helping friends is fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jarren Icewulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I soloed in Katta from 56 to 59 more or less. <br />
Im still 59 and only 1 gold/orange/yellow bubble (20%) from 60.<br />
<br />
While in Katta at 59, I was gaining 10% (Half a gold) per KEI (C3) duration. Basically I would go get C3 casted on me then hit Katta and solo Nathyn's Mansion guards and would get half a gold when C3 would finally fade...which varies depending on who casted on me...but around 3 hours. So 6 hours would be 20% of exp.<br />
<br />
However, lately I been soloing in Plane of Disease, killing the Flies on that first island straight out from zone in. Im getting much faster exp there. Im getting 1% every 2 kills or so. <br />
<br />
When I group in Plane of Disease, Innovation, or Nightmare I'm usually getting exp equivalent to soloing in Katta. <br />
<br />
If I had to level from 55 to 60 again I would suggest soloing in Katta lvls 55 to 58/59. Then once 58/59, solo in Plane of Disease or group in Plane of Innovation/Nightmare.<br />
<br />
I tried soloing in Chardok zoneout, exp not fast enough..though loot wasn't too bad. I tried soloing in The Grey at the temple...and I would end up using too much mana as the Shissar's are highly poision resistant.<br />
<br />
I tried soloing in Plane of Growth, and experience was kinda slow because of the longer downtimes. But the loot is great, gems drop all the time. However, I had to gate quite often, cause once I would get an add or a even just a tough mob, I would have to bail. Getting summoned constantly didnt help either...I tank in the face, but would still get summoned and disorient me quite often. Playing in 3rd person view helped with this though.<br />
<br />
btw, I dont have epic, and dont have Pox or Malo just JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 55 I grouped in PoN for about 2 hours, I wouldnt go out of my way to lfg myself there, Katta owns PoN at 55.  I did PoD at 56 (rcy) and it owned Katta.  I think that it depends all on the group, but PoD &gt; PoN i think we already all know this.  I still prefer soloing, because after playing a warrior and a cleric I hate groups =p.  I do the Bank area at katta and I can pull all 6 + 1 upstairs with Kei.  Have yet to do Nathyn's guards because I dont know where the hell to pull them =p<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Csin Csity</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Pull Naythns Guards around the back of the mansion..no adds, very relaxing.<br />
<br />
DO NOT pull them across the street..you will waste far too much time with green and light-blue adds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Seconds</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Thanks I was wondering where to go with those, I thought maybe to clear out the light blue and greenie yard trash then start pulling but that sounds like far too much work.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When you are standing at the back of Naythyn's mansion looking towards the back of it go along the right side, stand at max distance and pull the wolf guard with Turgurs. He always comes single at 55. If you pull the other wolf, you will get the guard with him.<br />
<br />
Next, pull the door guard on the same side as the wolf you just pulled - you can usually get him single too. Then the other guard, then the wolf. Easy and no wasted mana on root parking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I just dinged 56 and was thinking of doing the Katta guards in the bank area and had a few questions. I'm KOS in Katta because I leveled through 53 &amp; 54 killing Twilight Sea dock people.  Hey it was exp :) So possibly I'm KOS to everything in Katta, not just guards.<br />
<br />
Here goes:<br />
<br />
1) How many guards (dark blue to 56) are in the &quot;bank area&quot;?<br />
<br />
2) Where is the best place to setup?  <br />
<br />
3) Will horse/JBB/alpha dog work well here?<br />
<br />
Chow Chow for now,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tanamil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I can do it with dogdog and epic at 58/59.  I usually just pull them across the street because I am not KoS.  After you kill quite a few of them you should become unkos and then you can move across the street which I like to pull to because it is much easier.  I am currently up to amiable with the good guards and completely kos to the evil guards after doing level 58 on them.  The experience is quite good here I don't have PoP yet so I can't hunt up there.  Mostly just pull with slow root on inc and send pet in then epic and sit back.  Epic will usually wear off when there at about half health or a little less.  Theres two guards out front beside the door, 2 dogs to each side of them(you don't have to root the dogs because for some reason dogdog will take instance agro even if you have slowed them).  There are 2 inside that if you are kos you can usually pull both by just stepping in to the door and not having to open it.  Once you kill those two go inside and turn to the right, there is a fake wall that has 2 girls inside it that are on the same faction, they are a little bit harder then the others.  There is also 1 guard in each of the doors to the back.</div></div><hr />
