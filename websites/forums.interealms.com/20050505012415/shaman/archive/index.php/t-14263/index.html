That is exactly what they did.<br />
<br />
The NPC is in the left building as you are coming from the tranq stone, facing inwards.  He's in the back room, and you say &quot;what craft&quot; to get your charm and &quot;I will tell stories&quot; to get your AA.  Say the second line once for each flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i have all but RZ and 4 sol rol minis and sol ro  . . . 56 hps for my charm and 7 aa's.</div></div><hr />

Yay, thank you!!! I would have tried myself, but I am still at work for 45 more minutes:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Your AAXP / XP split doesn't seem to matter now.  My level 53 druid got 2 AA points even tho I had full XP going into regular XP.<br />
<br />
Charm for 2 flags (I have Grummus and Behemoth on my druid) for druids:<br />
<br />
AC 2, STA 2, CHA 2, WIS 3, AGI 3, HP 16, MANA 20, RESISTS 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
For shaman with full flags its:<br />
<br />
17 AC,  10 STR, 10 STA, 15 WIS, 15 AGI, 80 HP, 100 Mana, 10 Resists.<br />
<br />
Got 7 AA points, regardless of my aa split, and I'm flagged for Time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Question I have... is my level 47 wizard froggie going to get AA points (AA doesn't start till 51) for his flags?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The charm has a required level of 51 also; maybe the NPC wont even talk to people under 51?<br />
<br />
Keys (quested access) count toward your number of flags for the charm and AA rewards :)<br />
<br />
For those with all (10) flags, which ones give you AA points and which ones count for the charm?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I don't know about the rest of you, but me personally am very pleased with the reward that I got.  I was able to get some of the experience back that I lost with all of those extra deaths reflagging people in the other zones.  I also got an item that gave me over 80 more hps and filled a slot where there wasn't a decent item that could be used there.  <br />
<br />
7AAs is a lot.  That is more than a whole day of exp for someone like me who get's bored with exping alot these days.  I'm all about the raiding now.  7AAs let me finish up LR4 and 5 and have a few extra left over.  Very Very pleased about that.  And the +9 to all resists and 72hps plus 9 stamina own all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have every flag/key available and I only got 7 AA (as did all of my guild).  I can't say 100% which give you the AA other than my 53 druid only has Grummus and Behemoth and he got 2 AA.<br />
<br />
I would guess you would get an AA and stat raise on charm for each of the following:<br />
<br />
1) Grummus* (or quest to get in CoD)<br />
2) Bertoxxulous* (or quest to get in Torment)<br />
3) Terris Thule <br />
4) Aerin`Dar (or HoH quest)<br />
5) Justice Trials<br />
6) BoT quest.<br />
7) All of Rallos Zek/Tallon Zek/Vallon Zek/Mith Marr/Agnarr/Sol Ro/Saryrn<br />
8) All of Fennin Ro/Coirnav/Xegony/Rathe*<br />
<br />
Those that have full elemental access but are missing Time access are still getting 7 AA, but are not getting full stats so #8 is definately one of the qualifications for the stat change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>zagal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">so you can only get AA points, no one out there able to get normal xp?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Has anyone gotten more flags after getting their initial AA's and charm?  Can you go back for more, or is this simply a one time reward, for people who already had the flags?<br />
<br />
Or to put it simply, is there any reason for me to work on flags besides progressing past what is open now(which for me, isn't gonna happen anytime soon)?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I dunno about everyone else.. but I am actually pretty pleased with the rewards.<br />
<br />
for me with pos/pov/hoh/tactics/cod/bot  I got :<br />
<br />
5 aa points and my charm which is <br />
<br />
8ac 5str/sta 7wis/agi 40hps 50mana 5all saves<br />
<br />
which is damn nice for a free item in a slot I had nothing in, and that everything else for is craptacular.<br />
<br />
and the aas let me finish nd3 without havnt to xp for it =p cant beat that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Farenheit_Eci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You can get normal xp.. just make sure you choose how you want your xp distributed the message said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The charm in particular is way better than I thought it would be, and making it scale up with Planes access all the way to time is a great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I was pleased with 7 aa, and a 64 hp 8 svall charm.  And love the whole changes, it restored my enthusasm back into the game.</div></div><hr />

It takes nothing away from the flags.  Heck as nice as the charm is I a itching to add flags just to pump up its stats.  An extra AA is also nothing to be disappointed about.  <br />
<br />
My only complaint out of all this is that the regular charms from LoY should have been a bit nicer.<br />
<br />
Good Job SoE<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Skeeter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">There were some problems with making the reward consistent between low 50's through 65... so it looks like the solution was to just give you an AA per flag, rather than a chunk of experience you could put to regular exp or AA's.  This way everyone regardless of level gets 1 AA per story.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">i was very happy with this reward put me over 7k hp buffed with all flags $</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I'm psyched about this, it takes me forever to earn an AA these days since I have to spend most of my time on stupid VT shard grinds and Emperor key piece grinds.  I got 4 AA and it came at just the right time psychologically, lol.<br />
<br />
I bought RC1 (for use on raids) and am banking the other 2 AA's toward MC2.  Already had one banked and I'm 90% done with the last one, so I should have MC2 in short order.  Much better than working on the 2nd AA in MC2.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">It feels alot like christmas !<br />
<br />
I spent my 7 aa's finishing up SCRM .. I hate saving for the big ones and i figured now is a good a time as any to get it out of the way.<br />
<br />
and the charm is a huge upgrade over the 0 hp 0 stat 0 to all saves item i had in there before.  :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yeah, considered using the points for something like SCM3 or CS3...but hell, LR4 and 5 in one shot were just a bit too hard to resist.</div></div><hr />

decent stats. <br />
<br />
Good job Sony!</div></div><hr />

Well that makes sense.  I'd really hate to see the first tier flag mobs farmed for AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">No, you get 7 AA for having every flag under elementals.  Perhaps not even sol ro is needed to get that 7th AA, tho i have no way to test that since i have access to that zone.  <br />
Having flags to elementals didn't need to be rewarded with AA points, it was its own reward.  However it only made sense to upgrade the charm slightly for those in elementals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Daishan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Did you actually zone into BoT first before you checked the NPC again to see if you get further AA?<br />

yup same. <br />
I wasn't expecting breaking 7k before next month. Nice surprise</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sinjuneq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Altho I am happy for everyone and am glad to see Sony giving us something we can actually benefit from. I have to say this. <br />
<br />
From the patch:<br />
<br />
We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment. We will be giving a reward to those that have done so, in the form of a nice Charm slot item and Alternate Advancement points based on the number of planes you've gained access to.<br />
<br />
Well it seems the reward  that was to go to those that already busted butt to get flags (based on the patch message) basically get only what everyone else gets. So, I have to ask, how is that a reward to you who have busted your buns to get the flags needed, if my alt, who is not flagged at all, can receive flags months from now and receive the same charm and same AAs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I had to do the trials/quests to gain access to the zones, but now<br />
your alt doesn't need to. Access is free to all (of a min. level). That's <br />
the inequity, and that's what's been addressed. If you choose to send <br />
your alt through the same trials I've been through, then your alt <br />
deservers the same rewards I've received.</div></div><hr />

I could not care less about this going to people who will flag weeks/months/years from now.<br />
SoE solved this in a very nice way and I don't think that any complains are needed.</div></div><hr />

Well, the complaints from those who exp in Valor have already started.  They are calling it the new KC.  Glad I don't go there very often any more.<br />
<br />
BUT, I'm VERY happy with the charm and the 5 free AA's.  Combat Agility 2 for free was very nice.  :cool: <br />
<br />
Well implemented patch, and the micropatch for PoK was seamless for me, since I was busy raiding.<br />

The poll question kicked a few people out btw.<br />

2) And 2 AA points, one for PoS and one for PoV. <br />
3) By doing more flagging quests I can upgrade the charm, but NOT earn any more AA's.<br />

PoV/PoS Flags only count as ONE flag not two so you will only get one aa point for those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">ok from what I gathered the flags to charm ratio is broken down into 8 parts.<br />
PoV/PoS = 1aaxp and level 1 charm<br />
<br />
and <br />
<br />
PoTime = 8aaxp (total) and the level 8 charm.<br />

Anyone have a working thoery on what planes breaks what level wise for the power of this thing. I know its 1 day old, im just curious.</div></div><hr />

hey, better than the empty slot I had there, by a long shot.<br />

I'd have preferred regular XP... after I got cannibalization I turned XP on and I'm currently slugging through 62, but 2 AAs isn't too bad, I just bought Spell Casting Reinforcement I with it and counted it a little bonus.</div></div><hr />

All 5 gave me a point AA each, and my new charm is at 5/10ths power. Which other two flags give you AA points? When you speak to the dwarf he tells you which stories he likes, so someone should know.<br />

<br />
From everything I've been reading on the web, the max is 7 AA's and you get them for:<br />
<br />
1. Justice trials<br />
2. Thunder<br />
3. Decay<br />
4. Torment<br />
5. Honor<br />
6. Tactics<br />
7. Sol Ro Tower<br />

Not necessarily in that order. Not sure why you get AA for Sol tower and Tactics when those werent opened, but I'm not complaining since I had Tactics flag.</div></div><hr />

This would be the correct list for the AA's. Most people in my guild got 5 (not many bothered with the quest for Torment) and none got 7 (None of us have sol ro flag).<br />
