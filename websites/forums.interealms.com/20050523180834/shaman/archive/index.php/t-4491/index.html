<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Exodus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a level 34 Shaman on Mith Mar. I was soloing kodiaks in the GD with my pet(It is kick ass, soloing is now easy and faster then it was before), and after about an hour, I got a bit bored. My guild was talking about hill giants, and a level 36 Warrior said he almost got his arse kicked from an even con in West Commons. So I said &quot;Hey, I bet you I can solo that&quot;. He replies with &quot;I doubt it, if both of us grouped, we would get our arses handed back on a platter.&quot; So I get a TL over to WC, and as soon as I spawn in, there's a hill giant, even con. I take my pet out, cast SOW on him, then park him. I cast Scourge on the Hill giant, but before I could get a slow or a root on him, he bashes me. I run back past my pet, and start pet kiting. After a while, he agroes my pet (DOH, I forgot to turn off taunt), and is just about to kill him when I get an e-breath off him. I continue kiting, re-casting scourge and envenomed breath on him. About 3 minutes into the fight, my pet's dead, and the hill giant is in flee stage. I nuke him with Shock of the tainted, and the fight is over. I end up with 50% of my mana, and a loss of only half a bub of health. Now I'm wondering: is it normal for shamans do be able to solo these mobs, that other classes would dare not touch? Or did I just get lucky? Now if this is just a feet shamans can do, I wanna test my limits. Would I be able to solo the hill giants in Rathe Mountains, or the sand giants or spectres in Oasis? Maybe the frost giants in the GD? It seems to me, that no matter what, shamans come out on top. I've tried almost every class except for a cleric, bard, and enchanter, but shaman's seem to be the best.<br />
<br />
Oh, I have one more question to ask. I've been soloing since I hit 34, but I haven't soloed WITHOUT KEI since I dinged. With Kei, I have 151 Wisdom. I took the advice of a majority of you and now I have about 1k HP unbuffed. My wisdom without KEI is 129. I'm missing the extra wisdom I have with KEI, and now I'm wondering if I can get to 150 or more wisdom without having to lose the HP. Is there any gear you can advise me to purchase or trade for? I only have about 2k worth of stuff I'm trying to sell (Not my current gear. An enchanter that KEI'd me gave me 500pp and over 2k worth of items that I'm now trying to sell in the Bazaar (Heh, no, I'm not a backstabber; She knew I couldn't wear it so she told me to sell it), so I won't be able to get anything fancy, such as a Iksar BP or anything. Any advice would help, so thanks again in advance. - Exodus<br />
<br />
P.S. - I have created a magelo profile, but I have yet to list my equipment. I will do so ASAP and post a link as an edit on this post. Sorry if you have little to work with. Thanks again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">That is about right.<br />
<br />
I was 39 before I killed my first one, with my 34 spells, I was running from Freeport to Halas and spoted one , after about 20 minutes of root and rot, and me at full mana, I decided, this sucked and just slowed/melled hil ass to death.<br />
<br />
34 is nice. Ive heard it being done around high 20's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Spritabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Heh, when I hit 34, the first thing I did was head for WC to kill me a HG. Well, thanks to high level druids hanging out in the zone, I never even got close to one. So I went to oasis and picked a fight with a Sand Giant (yellow con). Used the same methods as the original poster (was a WIS shaman at the time) and killed his butt. <br />
When he was at below 2 bubs of health, a 54 ranger came along, saw me running and promptly rooted the SG. Pet got killed in under 10 seconds and I had to nuke it into running. Then I stacked on all the dots I had mana for and poked him to death with my slime coated harpoon (which I'm still usingat 59, btw). <br />
<br />
Never been prouder than when I went to loot a FS Scimitar and 25pp :)</div></div><hr />

Actually, my druid is level 9. I was asking is there was any gear that could track, not for some comment not asked of you. The next time I wan't someone to tell me what class to play, I'll ask. I came to the forums for help, not for some smart ass comments. If you don't wan't to help me, don't post any replies to my topics. - Exodus</div></div><hr />

I'd have to agree. I'm only 34, and I'd prefer a level 34 Shaman over a level 60 druid any day. Druids seem fun, but they don't seem as fun as a shaman. In the end, shamans have more to offer to a group and to himself then a druid, imho. I must admit after playing my druid, I got tired of waiting for mana to regen and missed my cannibalize, so I retired him early. I'd also have to agree on your kiting statement, because around level 24 on, Shaman's have to change their tactics and just admit they can't melee anymore, or at least not as helpfull as regular root rotting and rot running.</div></div><hr />

Why do you view this as insulting or smartass?  <br />
<br />
You kite.  Thats associated more with druids than shamans.  I was trying to help: if this is how you want to play then I suggest you play a druid.<br />
<br />
I didn't realise your druid was only level 9.  In your second post you said that as your shaman couldn't track you sometimes found yourself wanting to play your druid.  As I had thought that druids don't get tracking until level 20  I had assumed you were a higher level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Hail,<br />
<br />
This isn't a flame directed at you (post author).<br />
<br />
Your description of your HG fight (congratulations) DOES seem more like that of a druid battle than a shaman, from my perspective.  This is not bashing druids, just a description of tactics employed by two different classes.<br />
<br />
We can &quot;burn&quot; a mob down chain casting cold/poison DD nukes after rooting as if we were a wizard, but you don't see it often when soloing.  It isn't efficient.  That doesn't mean wizards fighting in this manner are bad, just different.<br />
<br />
In group settings, all classes are useful in my opinion, some more than others.  But I usually LIKE having a druid in my group for taking care of regen/sow/other minor stuff that I don't want to waste my mana on in a fast hunting group.  <br />
<br />
You say that you are a pet kiter.  The word kiting is inherently linked to druids and wizards.  You will most likely learn to dislike certain members of these two classes.  They often compete with our targets in a dangerous manner, frequently causing death from quad training, or even just dismay at taking mobs that we've just slowed and were on their way to us.  Other solo classes (mage/necro) don't threaten our safety when they hunt nearby us.  The fact that druids can level so quickly quadding generally means that there is a minority that are rather clueless when it comes to endangering others, and gives the class a bad rep.  I've DEFINITELY been trained by more druids than any other class.<br />
<br />
This is one reason your choice of the word &quot;kiting&quot; may have set off some shaman who frequent here and cause you to be a target of jokes/ridicule.  Throwing in a question about tracking in the same post, kind of made you an open target for a smart-ass comment about being a druid. <br />
<br />
I rarely, if ever, pet kite in the manner you described, unless I misunderstood your description.  Here's what I generally do solo (pre-epic/JBB):<br />
<br />
Self buff HP/AC/AGI/STA &amp; hp regen.  Strength not needed, Dex only if you have a proccing weapon.  If you are on horseback, (which I'd doubt at your level due to cost) you won't be poking, so skip dex regardless.<br />
<br />
Haste and hp regen dogdog, and sic'em on the mob after pulling with slow.  Dogdog taunts (I leave it ON unless raiding) twice or thrice, and I back up a few steps, but there is no frantic running involved (that's a druid tactic).  Dogdog takes aggro, I land second (&amp; third, depending) dot.  This will give me the aggro usually.  Tank the mob until dead.  If YOU are taking too many hits, root the mob and let dogdog take the heat again.  If dogdog is taking too many hits, wade in to take the heat off him.  Dogdog is your partner.  He is weak, but he's our best friend.<br />
<br />
When you hit 45 and can employ a JBB (racial restrictions not withstanding), you will be chain-casting it after the mob is slowed and dotted once, whether you or your pet is tanking.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">This meleeing vs rooting debate always makes me laugh, why not simply do both according to whatever your fighting?<br />
<br />
Most mobs I just go toe to toe with now (and frequently I don't have the choice, ta summoning), but on some mobs with high hps/ac but no summoning ability (Enthralled in SG are the best example), its simply not worth meleeing it.  Root and rot is far more efficient in that case.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Uhhh...I never kite unless it's a last ditch effort thing. Going head to head is fine for efficiency and usually fairly safe. I have soloed that way in every level up to 60. Tanking the MOB always seemed more fun to me than kiting. About the only thing I stopped tanking was phase spiders because the phasing is just too damn annoying and spells get interrupted too much. I just root/rot those now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The game for a lvl 34 shaman is drastically different from the game a lvl 60 shaman plays, seems obvious, but many shaman seem to forget this.  At 34 if our hero (soloing shaman) goes toe to toe with the even con HG he'll get eaten.  Pet kiting, especially in that level range and with the changes in dot kiting, is a viable tactic.  Most shaman here have suggested it, or used to, for young shamans in tough fights.  Granted, our hero didn't prep properly for this fight and didn't try hard enough to slow AND allowed cujo to get eaten, but despite the errors won the fight.  Grats to them on employing tactics, no matter how much the rest of us older shaman cringe.  Until I get Torpor and malo scribed, I certainly will not be going toe to toe with Yldelma (sp) and only wish I could kite it.<br />

Tanking isn't a feasible choice at the level on those mobs.  sure at 51 with new slow or even at like upper 40's when you have more HP and AC from just pure levels.  At 34 the damage output isn't anything near 51,  that Hill giant fight last 4 mins or so.  inless you are pet kiting/root dotting you don't stand much of a chance aganist a HG</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I have only pet kited one mob and it was by accident. I had just turned 34 and had my pet in everfrost, playing with him to see what he could do when I saw Martar Icebear. I figured I'd pay him back for a few deaths when I was younger so I tried to root him. He resisted and came at me. He was interrupting a lot of my spells and started to do some considerable damage to me. I tried to heal, but interrupt, interrupt, interrupt. So I tried to run away until I could get room to heal myself. First attempt, I tried to cast before I completely stopped running so I interrupted my own spell. *grrr* He started pounding on me some more. I tried to run again. This time I didn't run far enough so he caught me before I could try to heal again. Then I run one last time (after this I was gonna head to Bandl -- getting low on hp) and finally get the distance/timing right. The funny thing was, as I got the heal off, Martar began his death walk. I had done nothing to him, but off he went. Being the n00b I was, I had totally forgotten my pet was on him the entire time. LOL To this day, that is still the funniest kill I've had in EQ. If there is a moral to this story, which I doubt, it is that, while for certain situations pet kiting is appropriate, you don't have to kite as a rule as a shaman. Root/rotting is efficient for some situations (never relied heavily on this as root was never that reliable for me) and yes, melee/tanking for your pet while slowing/dotting is also good. I have tanked for my pet ever since I got highlevel enough to have a pet. With slowing and dotting and/or crippling (listless power or whatever spell of that line you have) you can stand in and take the hits for your pet and not lose too many hp for the most part and should be able to maintain your mana well also, unless you get a lot of resists, which happens to us all. While it's awesome that you could take the HG at your level, killing HGs for exp will not be efficient until somewhat later unless you group. Still, I admire your willingness to take risks and challenge yourself in this fashion. After all, there are different kinds of experience and not just the kind that shows up on the exp bar. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was level 34. I just got mutt. I was so proud. In my totemic armour with my 111 wisdom and my gatorsmash maul I went a giant hunting. My Ac/HP rings glistened in the twilight as I crossed into rathe mountains. Due to the danger there the only people there were a few necromancers doing thier dark arts to kill many creatures.<br />
<br />
I set off to find me a giant. I was ready to prove to a friend that what I was saying about my abilities were true. That I would fight the giant without fear. Without using the cowardly tactics of the druids. <br />
<br />
I would not run.<br />
<br />
I called down the spirits to aid me in all the vast ways a shaman can do. I created a talismin for myself and mutt. Quiknessed myself and the faithful hound by my side and went a ranging.<br />
<br />
A Giant brute was over a hill. I cast a root upon it, then distracted it with the insects of a man called togor. Then I cast a mighty disease upon it, and poisened it with the breath of a snake. Then myself and the hound charged forward. A howl upon both of our lips echoed into the twilight sky. <br />
<br />
The battle was joined. A necromancer stood behind me laughing at my foolish ways. I cared not. Secure in the knowledge that the tribunal would not find me wanting. <br />
<br />
I hammered at the brutes ankles for a long while and even had to root the monster to have the mutt take a hit or two while I cast a heal. but in the end it was dead and myself and the mutt were bloody but unbowed. <br />
<br />
The necromancer was aghast. He saw that times were changing. That soon once other learned the power of a shaman his dominion over the giant would fall. <br />
<br />
That was a good day over two and a half years ago. I killed 15 more giants before moving on to other things. Some fights were closer than others. I even lost a few and had to flee. But I had proved my point. <br />
<br />
The tribunal has never found me wanting. <br />
<br />
<br />
/ooc In case you are wondering this was several months before Kunark, the shaman gear in vouge were Gator legs and wisdom gear. I was laughed at when I said I had a 111 wisdom but 802 AC (self buffed) at 34. I was snickered at when I told a necromancer I could solo a giant toe to toe. So he came over for some pizza and I proved him wrong. Multiple times. That was a GOOD day. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">pet kiting is a perfectly valid tactic for the lower level shaman.  With the changes to DOT dmg that make them do full dmg now even when a mob is moving, that method just got a LOT easier to implement.  Keep aggro with dots, puppy nips at its heels, and you can take down something much larger.  <br />
<br />
I will say to Exodus tho, he should try it without KEI if he wants a true test.  KEI is vastly overpowering to any caster under 50.  Also Exodus, please mind the sensitivities of some of the shamans on this board.  Their asses hurt from the last quad kite that got shoved up them and they're rather sore about it and hate druids in general at the moment.  <br />
<br />
Myself I consider druid to be a trainer class and a plague upon Norrath.  That aside, some people who play druid are talented enuf to group with me for exp.  I value those few.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Michael J. Kaspar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">HG's at 34 shouldn't be tanked unless twinked.  They are a tremendously underconned mob, they have over 1k HP, double attack, and due to their level range (33-37) you are likely to get resisted on several spells, exhausting your mana pool.<br />
<br />
I see nothing wrong with the pet kiting tactic used by the original poster.  However, some friendly advice... don't allow that to be your main weapon of choice soloing.  Otherwise you will end up like a shaman in another thread on this board (702 AC?).  Defense is one of our more important skills, and to get it up you need to take some heat from mobs... just not HG's :).<br />
<br />
For some flexibility, try moving to South Karana and hunting Centaurs.  They can be hunted multiple ways, and it will allow you to work on Defense, root parking (very easy to get adds at 34), pet agro, etc.<br />
<br />
For the record, my first HG was at 39 (back when lady Snoww was doing them at 34), and it was a nip and tuck affair involving several resists in NK.  I ended up kiting him for about 30 sec. because I was OOM and at 20% health (which removed the cannadance option), but the dog saved me.  To this day its the only mob I ever kited intentionally.<br />
<br />
Good luck and good hunting, and congrats on your kill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Athame</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Kiting is a skill. Some shamans may look down on it because they're proud that they can stand toe to toe to mobs. Well, even if you have the ac to stand up to them, knowing how to kite properly may give you the advantage to kill a rare named solo when your luck has run out. I dare to say that if you play long ennough, you'll learn how to stand toe to toe and channel, you'll get your ac and hp (all highend gear has nice ac and hp) but you don't necesarily learn how to kite properly. Twinked shamans will probably just stand there and beat em down while they cast, but they don't learn how to use and play other camera views, have no clue how big the melee range of mobs is and just run to the zone or gate when they think it's over because they're out of mana and hp. Even at some highend situations proper kiting can make life a lot easier. At these (albeit rare) situations you'll learn to appreciate a ranger or druid that can kite so tight you think he's getting hit every time. For instance, do you know that mob in the Deep with crazy regen that procs Divine Aura? :) For soloing, every tactic counts, if you know how to kite, it's a bonus. You won't use it much at 60, but at least you'll trust your ability when you *do* need it.<br />
<br />
So whatever these shamans tell you, it's good practice. A good way to level? I doubt it, root-dotting the right mobs is faster at that level. But to presume a non-twinked shaman at that level can just slow &amp; tank, that's insane. Good job. <br />

At 34 hill giants are crummy xp.  They are a target of status. <br />
<br />
The centaurs are much better for xp purposes. (Plus if you do it right you can con en into getting into a scrum and killing each other and freak people out.<br />
<br />
And yes Kiting is a skill. A valued one to have. Using all your skills is a good thing. Doing it to the exclusion of everything else is a poor choice though. Shaman have alot of options. Use them all.<br />
<br />
(and yes I have Kited before. Sometimes when the fit hits the shan you have to. I would rather win a fight (Especially if it was a hard fight and my ire is up) than run away.<br />
<br />
Giants are okay for xp at 39 and better at 44. And at 60 having 5-6 on you at once is great for giggles. (Only if you are insane, but I am)<br />
<br />
Have fun<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">You can see here how upset some shammy's have gotten with quad kiting.  The technique pisses them off so much that they don't want to be associated at all with any soloing techniques that are even close to that.  But we were kiting and pet kiting mobns long before quad kiting came to be.  root rot isn't as mana-efficient (unless you got the can V/Torpor combo going) and a standup fight is oftentimes problematic because of how hard the mob hits.<br />
<br />
Kiting doesn't mean training!  Just because every shammy above level 50 has had a barbershop quartet drug over him by some wizzie or druid doesn't make kiting an evil practice.  I rarely solo now, but recognize this tactic as central to a soloing career.  Besides, I kinda like using a technique every once in a while that Brad describes as &quot;kinda chimpy&quot; (if there's a better recommendation for a tactic than that, I've never heard one!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>moosha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Why do people get so offensive (or defensive) when it comes to killing methods?  Who cares if I kite something like a powder puff girl.  If I kill it, it is dead.  No matter how superior you think your method is, or how silly you think my method is... the end result is exactly the same.  I killed a mob and you killed a mob.  <br />
<br />
I personally am a hp/ac shaman and have never pet kited much because I dont enjoy it... that does not mean I have something against someone else that does it.  Who gives a crap how that guy kills his mob.  You get the same amount of exp for that kill as he does, no matter how you did it.  Get off your high horse people.  Just because YOU desperately want to establish something as a standard, does not mean it is the only legit way it can be done.   If no exploits are used then any method is &quot;legit&quot;.  I realize that humans are mentally weak in general and strive for acceptance of their peers, but I happen to be one of those people that just doesn't give a crap what you think.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Smert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">hmm most folks seem involved in a discussion of the validity of pet kiting and the definition of Dr00d and what not. <br />
<br />
However, to address the apparent intent of the post. It sounds like at 34 you solo'd a white HG.  Congrats. :)<br />
<br />
You indicated that you ended after 3 minutes with 50% mana. 3 minutes of KEI is about 420 regained mana I believe- which would be most of that 50%.  I can't tell if you had a bunch of resists, but I would suppose so.  I don't see you mentioning malaise. I came to like that spell to pull even high blues with. The savings in blowout fights and the additional safety margin I percieved were valued. <br />
<br />
As for can you reasonably expect to do this on a regular basis. Well, I know back at 36th I solo'd a white Drolvang Rager. I did root &amp; rot, then Tanked it to death. This was quite sometime ago and my gear was poor... consisted of a mix of banded and totemic with either an ogre war maul or a drakkel Icegrinder, DOTs were still effected by movement, Pets were'nt auto max level, and my wisdom was probably a touch over 100. If I could do it then, then ya I'd say its a reasonable assumption you can count on it with current spells, changes, and 2k in gear and KEI.  <br />
<br />
Personally I find it more fun and efficient to solo larger quantities of low and mid blues in the same time frame. <br />
In addition you gain the $$ from the multiple mobs, and multiple faction hits  if you're working on that. Furthermore your chance of a series of resists putting you in trouble is lower.<br />
<br />
As for the Flames you're running into..sorri. But this board has been around a bit and there are some prickly patches and a long irritation with druids and thier methods.  And yes, I've been run over by druid kites and had them greedily suck up all the available mobs. I know some very nice druids. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Guggles</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">I don't think there is anyway you could tank a HG at level 34 without being twinked.<br />
<br />
When I hit 34 and got my pet I tried taking on an even con HG in RM.  When they are hitting you for double attacks of 90-100 pts you don't stand much of a chance.  My defense is maxed out and fully buffed my ac is 680.  The only twink item I have on me is a centi warhammer that was given to me.<br />
<br />
It must be nice to have KEI on all the time I had an enchanter cast it on me once and I thought I was a god.<br />
<br />
Im still level 34 and am going back to SK to hunt the gnolls at the spires.  They con dark blue and I can handle them one after another and get exp and pp.  <br />
<br />
I guess I may never be a highend super shaman with alot of neat gear, I still have gnome skin boots and gloves, but I think I am doing alright.  Things still drop to my FS spear and Im happy with that.</div></div><hr />

The Powerpuff definately do NOT kite!  They're definately the standup tank-type fighters.  If Bubbles heard you say that, she'd kick your butt like Mojo Jojo<br />
