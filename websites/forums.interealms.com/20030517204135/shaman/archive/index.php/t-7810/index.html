<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well, it's been months since I hit ya guys up for some upgrade ideas..and some of you actually enjoy helping...sooo.... Magelo is in the sig. Only change is.. I look to have an earring of solstice in the next week or so... otherwise.. any ideas that are campable by one or 2 exp groups, or solo'd... or affordable with a limited budget of about 2k at most... I stay broke:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Very balanced gear you have.<br />
<br />
I suggest: Thurg shawl quest up to 4/5... would be good upgrade.<br />
Gloves: Coldain Skin (2k if you are lucky)<br />
<br />
Hmm thats it from me :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Ok, thanks:) Got lucky with a month in HoT.. I'll look into the coldain skin gloves.. maybe can be camped as well. <br />
<br />
I got 4th shawl in the bank..I've held onto the silver dragin tatto mainly for the mana pres 2. At least 1/2 my spells use it...and saving 10% a cast added up when I had 167 wis..with 221 now..I might not get as much return on it and look for an ac upgrade there...or use the shawl again. I got stuck on tailoring skill at 60..so 5th shawl must still wait:)<br />
<br />
Also have an alt primary: Rod of Virtue, but been trying to work pierce up in expectation of one day getting SoF. <br />
<br />
And still slowly working Shield of Banewarding when I get bored of exping. I assume the shield is still a worthwhile upgrade to quest for?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
not sure what the prices of these are now adays .. i have been seeing a huge increase in blue diamond drops .. maybe they are cheaper now</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yeah..I been thinking about it, Ceno. Especially with BD dropping like candy in PoN and PoD. I just haven't had time to check eqtraders.com and work out how many are needed per piece, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ear, Earring of the Solistice<br />
Chest, Fungi Tunic<br />
Back, Lodi Shield/Hierophants Cloak<br />
Shoulders, Obulus Death Shroud<br />
Face, Death Mask of the Elysians / Crystal Spider Eyes<br />
Range, Talisman of Benevolence<br />
Replace Diamond Wedding band with Shadel Bandit Ring</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ok, Henora... Fungi and ODS are both WAY out of my price range, sadly. I got an iksar bp, but my alt warrior is currently using it to solo. <br />
<br />
Elysian mask I can get... <br />
Is shadel bandits fairly uncamped since PoP hit?<br />
Not sure on Lodi SHield or Cloak of Heirphant..will have to look those up.. but guessing fairly high priced as well, and likely raid dropped?<br />
<br />
Talisman of Benevolence, I have looked into... It does look good, hopefully with CT bare these days it will be a possibility to camp.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the ideas</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You asked for items that you could camp with one or 2 groups.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can camp a Fungi with one group, you could solo frogs in seb for a random ODS drop.  <br />
<br />
You can camp Lodizal and kill him with one group.  <br />
<br />
You can camp for the heirophant's cloak as well as your level 60 spells in the crypt in seb with 1 group.  <br />
<br />
Talisman of benevolence is a quest from from Skyshrine, you can do it with 1 group.  <br />
<br />
Shadel Bandits have never been very camped. <br />
<br />
If you think the ODS is too hard to get, you can get a death watchers shroud from the Elyasians at the same time you get an mask.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Okay, thanks:) This is very helpful and nice list to work on.  I always thought Lodizal was like much tougher than one group..but then I never seen him...just remember from when SoV came out. <br />
<br />
What faction does Talisman quest require? down to warm with CoV now after some killin in WToV last night...<br />
<br />
And I think I'll try for shadel bandits tonight for the ring. Sounds like a good start.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">lodi is a pushover. 1 decent group can do him easy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">hmm benevolence need amiable to COV I think?<br />
<br />
pretty much need warrior and cleric for fighting captain, he is hard to slow and remember he is only slowable with the disease based slow.<br />
<br />
Lodizal is a pushover, you may have a small amt of trouble slowing him without malo but he is easy enough that skilled, well equipped/spellbook'd level 60+ shaman on servers without competition can solo him if they are lucky.  I feel confident saying I could duo him with about any melee class.  Pre malo/torpor bring a cleric and a tank with you.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>ryoz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">look good but i would look into a mask of war, nice little piece o gear i love mine<br />
<br />
if you go after lodi and have hard time slowing, try using PoI only 40% slow but its desease based i landed it the 1st time then waited a bub of health and landed turgurs with no maloxx anything maybe lucky maybe im just that good lol seriously though if you having hard time slowing anymob, try PoI first soometimes that works wonders</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Kilorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">OKay.. Mask of War, huh? I am gonna miss my Improved Damage, but gotta do it sometime.<br />
<br />
And I think I may have to go for that turtle soon. I got a ranger levelling in IC now anyway..so might as well put him to some use tracking for it:) Any chance of Lodi dropping spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Lodi can drop the high level Velious spells, like Focus of the Spirit, Cann4 and Bearform.<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elyasians &gt; Mask of War, imo.  :)<br />
<br />
Death Mask of the Elysians: +12 AC, +2 Wis, +2 Int, +5 Cha, +6 vsPos, +6 vsDis, +35 HP, +35 Mana<br />
<br />
Mask of War: +9 AC, +2 Str, +5 Sta, +9 Wis</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I have been doing Lodizial a lot recently (like maybe 15 times in the last 3 weeks). The spawn time is approx 11.5 hours. He spawns near the snowfang gnoll camp near ToFS in Iceclad Ocean.<br />
<br />
At level 55 I have not had a problem with slowing Lodi - slow doesn't always stick first or even second cast, but if you just chain alternate cast Turgurs and Malosi, you will get him slowed pretty fast (you will have less trouble than me because of your higher level). Note: You will get summoned unless you have a huge aggro-generator for a tank and lans slow first cast - last time it took me 3malosi and 3 turgurs to slow Lodi, and I then had to tank for half the fight because the MT couldn't get aggro back LoL - Lodi is a puss!<br />
<br />
Have done with 60monk 60SK 59drood 55drood 55 shaman with no trouble</div></div><hr />
