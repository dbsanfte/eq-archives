<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kraegar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hail fellow Shamen -<br />
<br />
What is considered the best droppable Shaman BP available?  I have looked at many profiles - and few if any wear a Fungi tunic.<br />
<br />
Why is this?  It seems to me that massive HP regen is a HUGE advantage - esp with cannibalizing.<br />
<br />
Is the extra wis / mana or AC that comes from other BPs considered that much more advantageous?<br />
<br />
I am confused - and am eager to hear what others have to think on the topic.  Honestly - the way I see it, I would be hard pressed replacing the fungi with ANY BP, droppable or otherwise.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your thoughts.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jagara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">basically you have to think of how can you regen mana the fastest - so theres basically 2 views -<br />
<br />
1. youre under 60 or dont have torpor - fungi probably the best for you since its a constant source of hp regen that can be used to can 4, and also helps you tank and solo mobs at lower levels<br />
<br />
2. you have torpor and especially if you have can 5 - you can regen hp so fast anyway that it makes more sense to go with a high hp bp since you can take more hits, and makes canni 5 safer.<br />
<br />
<br />
of course, i have can 5 and torpor but still prefer a fungi... go figure.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The fungi is the best droppable tunic a shaman can wear period - until they get Torpor at level 60.   The extra hit points (and through cannibalization, mana) the fungi brings outweigh any other stat, until you get torpor.<br />
<br />
Once you get torpor, even the regeneration from the fungi pales in comparison- so you can concentrate on other stats.  As more and more shamans are 60+ with torpor, you see less and less that wear the fungi. <br />
<br />
Of course, before 60 with torpor... it's often difficult to find the means for a fungi- they're quite pricey.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cateye</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As stated above as long as you have no Torpor Fungi is best.<br />
At 60+ I'd suggest a BP of Vindication, but as you explicitely asked for a dropable BP my suggestion is a Peerless Dragonhide BP or even better a Matchless Dragonhide BP.<br />
(You can check stats of peerless at my profile below, matchless has same stats but 10% more of each, JFYI)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Aye once you have torpor fungi isn't that big a deal anymore. It allows you to heal yourself very efficiently and quickly compaired to regen. The 100hps and sta I get from my vindi bp combined with the resists mean alot more to me than the regen from fungi does now. I still have my fungi even tho i don't use it. Haven't seen any reason to sell it yet either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Check the inventories on a number of 60+'s with Torpor, a lot of us still carry around a Fungi for times when you aren't fighting tough mobs, the regen is still helpful as long as you aren't getting smacked around for 550 in PoP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I use to live in my fungi.. Now it situational gear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Trix</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AC and HP are the king ) .....no seriously after 60 i went for the Vindi, i compared how my regen/mana bro did compared to me whos hp/ac, and lets just say we both RT vindi, and he died and i lived. I get summoned now and again, and find i can tank adds fine in most places as long as slowed......but thats totally a post 60 point of view<br />
