<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The gods that play with Laughing Sam's dice have not been kind to this Shaman. I have dinged 60 and have neither malo nor torpor (although I have held both in my hands)...Aah the caprices of fate. But I digress<br />
<br />
Given that I have not got Torpor, is it still worth concentrating on the conventional AA path of MC1, 2, 3, Canni V? I have MC1 but I have the feeling that putting 10AA into the remeining MC and however many for C3 is kinda wasted without the Torpor thing?<br />
<br />
If I am correct in this assumption, I am thinking ND and Spirit Call, and then doing the CanniV thing when The Tribunal sees fit to throw a copy of torpor into my lap...<br />
<br />
Your wisdom is appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">NOooooo my preciouusssss CANn5....errrrr<br />
<br />
 You suddenly get Torp  or Q and you'll be sad with no cann5 than. Besides cann5 and kraggs still better than cann4 allllllll the time. You can just use it between kills if you dont feel like you have enough hps. I did nd first and by the time i finished it i had upgraded hps with gear and wish i had done cann5 first. It really is just that sweet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Beargor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Hmm. if you got Tnarg's Mending ( Lvl 62)  you may cast it after CanniV...  effectivly giving you ~550 mana for a loss of ~620 HP. I mysself would be in doubt, as I prefer to cast Torpor on meself before Canni V, just for the safety in combat.<br />
<br />
MC3 will give you 30 mana each minute. Probably worth it, even without CanniV.. and you're closer to get CanniV if you should aquire Torpor =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Definately worth it, Canni 5 + Kraggs is almost as good as Canni 5 + Torpor.  And you never know when you'll get Torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">i can back that up , i had no torpor when i had can5, torpor just made it safer if anything. get it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Once again, I bow to the wisdom of this community. I guess even stoicism cast before CanniV will work to an extent. So, CanniV, here I come. But ommfg, the next 15AA  are going to be a drag!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Nirtox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hiho,<br />
<br />
go get Canni5, zou can heal yourself with Kraggs till you get Torpor/Quiescence.<br />
<br />
Just stick to Canni5 when you have no mobs near, might get low HP aggro.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Oddloots</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No Torpor here ... just got canni5 and it is definitely worth it. Kragg's Mending does just fine as a filler for torpor after casting canni5. Just have to be aware of your surroundings when you do it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Juff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With usual exp group buffage, I assume you'll be at ~4300 HP or so, perhaps more.  Should cause no real problems using canni V then KM as long as you're full health before Canni.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The only thing I don't like about Can V is needing to have over 3khp to use it efficiently.  If you play a shaman with gimp gear, you could find yourself a Aego fiend.  Barring that, get the Can V then maybe pursue the ND.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">no matter what your status as far as spells is, canni V should be your first and only target when you start working on AA's. Kraggs, Stoicism, even Tnargs, all work at repairing the damage canni V does to your shaman, and they all do it well. The mana it gives you is invaluable in almost and situation, raiding, exping, or otherwise. get canni V, use Kraggs to heal yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Got ND3 first, now working on the cann5 stuff, got bout 2100hps unbuffed now, I think it was a good way to go.<br />
<br />
Still no torpor, even though at one point it was within grabbing distance......damn me for not taking advantage of it =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mystipul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hmm.. we're suppose to heal ourselves? thought that was the cleric/druid's job???  grin.. since 90% of my online time is on during raids.. I almost Never heal myself.  There's always at least 2 clerics watching this suicidal shaman's health.. So I hit Canny 5 when ever I get a chance to and never worry about healing myself :) .. Someone else does it for me.<br />
<br />
But seriously.. Canny 5 is 100% better than sitting there hitting canny4 a few thousand times a day.  Smack a Regen on yourself, a fungi tunic, dain belt, and you got a healthy start on the regen... or you can heal yourself.  HEck.. if your really bored... chug a potion or two that does healing per ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">God...please don't let me come across another shaman that does not get canni5 out of the gate before getting anything......I don't want to have to hurt him<br />
<br />
Seriously, cannibalization is the best, most game altering thing that you can get...with or without Torpor.  With it makes it that much better, but it's still better than not having it.  Come on, you can use it every three min, and when you have 5 mobs in camp and you have to malo and slow everything, by the time that you get the last one slowed, you hit the canni5 button and hey, you are back up to full mana again.  It helps alot when you are doing things like casting group buffs on people, especially Fo7th (that spell is a mana guzzling whore). <br />
<br />
GET CANNI5 FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I still don't have Torpor/Quiescence but I've found that Stoicism + SCRM makes a decent substitute. I suppose our conventional heals would work well too, as would just sitting there until the Cleric or Paladin feels sorry for you and drops a heal-over-time.<br />
<br />
In any event, believe the hype and get Cannibalize 5 first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I was kind of dragging on AAs after I got 60, but since I've been actively trying to group in PoV and soloing there since I got flagged, it's really sped up.  I've picked up 4 AAs in the last 4 days without playing much at all, and got MC3 last night, so I should be able to rope in Cann 5 by the time the flag requirement drops next week or whenever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">DEFINITELY get Canni V whether or not you have Torpor!!  I think it was 2 months after I got Canni V when I got my copy of Torpor.  But definitely make sure of your current hit points before you hit it.  I only had 1917 unbuffed hps when I got it.  Talk about making clerics and paladins go into heart failure!  They made me make a warning button to hit before I pass out on them! hehe<br />
<br />
Sunbur tells group/raid: Hitting the button for massive hp loss... don't panic, I'm a professional! :)<br />
Paladin_01 tells group/raid: Cleansing the cannibalistic shaman before she passed out at my feet!<br />
<br />
Now it just makes for a great tension breaker while setting up for raids or rebuffing after a wipe :D</div></div><hr />

Someone refresh my memory.  Its been 76 days since I played.</div></div><hr />
