<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tefanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For some reason I had a really hard time with JP when I tried to fear kite there at 45.  The panthers had a crapload of hp and everything was friendly so it would all aggro me.  Same thing with the griffawns.  Is there some special area that is great for pulling?  I've heard a lot about how great this place is and I really want to try it out again, otherwise I'm stuck in EW for another 5 lvls...Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Magrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beg, borrow, or steal a lupine dagger, and get yourself into wolf form as soon as you zone in.  Or bum a wolf form from a friendly druid.  All of the griffs are indifferent to you when you're a wolf.<br />
<br />
Also, my experience at that level was that it was best to stick to the griffawns.  Timber griffons, panthers, and anacondas have too many HP, and still resist panic annoyingly often.  You can take them, but it's just not worth the trouble.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep stick to the griffawns. Or, for something slightly easier camp the Griffons in NK. You will get an occasional HG as well for added coinage.  <br />
<br />
I consider this recreational hunting though - not xp grinding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tefanus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Actually I have a loopy dagger, I guess I'll start using it more.  Should I wait till 46 maybe.  It just seemed like the griffawns weren't all that common and the great thing about EW is that you don't have to go searching for mammoths.  Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm in a similar situation, but have an advantage since I'm hydra w/ a 58 shaman (which does slow/haste/heal/buffs/etc).  I just hit 45 in EW and need to go somwhere new.  I have a lupin, but the mobs in JP will aggro the shaman so that may be a problem.  EW is good, but is starting to taper off as far as XP goes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aries33</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have been fear kiting in JP since Level 44 or so with few problems. I pull to the far northeast corner of the zone near Waldo; there are no adds or wanderers there. Also, the Griff do not come directly at you, they veer off, turn and then come to you. It allows a bit more time if Fear is resisted. Try it and you will see what I mean. I never have used wolf form (I just dinged 49).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The wolves in DSP are good at your level also.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">No please no more DSP.  I spent about 8-10 levels there, i cant go back.<br />
<br />
Actually, I was doing ry'gorr orcs last night for decent xp.  I know it wont last, but I actually made decent plate there last night. (about 300 + the spine chill spear (cheif drop) and the orcish lute).<br />
<br />
Once I hit 46, I have a few friends who will take me to the tier 1 planes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ever tried wolf form in DSP? Everything bar the wolves wants to beat the crap out of you.  You can start some really impressive Zelniak trains - especially since they changed the anti-train code.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Nemid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">North Karana beleave it or not is great xp with Griffons, I did most of level 50 mostly there beleave it or not. I was Helping a friend who just started playing. Just power leveling him a bit and Grimfeather agroed me. Well I Feared him killed him and got like 1 to 2% xp off him. Sometimes Grimmy will pop as soon as you kill him I had lik 6 in row once. Nice xp when you are trying to get highland lion fur for Fleeting. Just make sure to stay away from the Silvery or Silver Griffon...Not an animal and casts I made it to the zone on him with 10 hps a pally friend told me he is responds to undead spells. So at 45 Grimfeather would be awesome xp and the other griffons should still be blue and HG's to boot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tiluvas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I would stay away from Jaggedpine at your level, until you get to level 49.  Life is just so much easier with a reliable mode of wolf form.<br />
<br />
You should head back to Lake of Ill Omen.  Head down to the lake area, and take a swim into one of the pillars.  You should see two  bloodgill goblins.  These mobs are easily solo'd by a ranger, I killed them with worse gear than you until level 51 or so.  Just harmony the furthest goblin, and then TW the first one and swim back to shore(unless you have an EB item) and smack em down.  They have around 1000 hp and hit for a max of 70 something, if I remember correctly.<br />
<br />
Great exp, and a great way to increase your swimming skill.  I killed these mobs from level 45 to level 52, and it only took me a day or two /played</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Stay away from JPF until 49??????<br />
<br />
I went there at 44 and wish I had left DSP a lvl or 2 earlier!<br />
<br />
Just do the Dark Blue Griffawns until they start to thin out then move on to the Griffins.<br />
<br />
Adds are MINIMAL and can be evaded........if you see something is going to cross your path just move a bit, the aggro range is absolutly tiny.<br />
<br />
Saying that, I dinged 53 there on Friday and will be very happy if I never see the back-end of a Griff ever again......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ahh you say that now. Wait till you hit the Level 54 hell level and your realise JP is still the best place to solo <br />
<br />
*sob* <br />
<br />
I really hate Griffons now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hoppers were nice 51-54 but around 53 you have to fight through the light blues to get to the ones that give actual XP. :( JP allows you to pick and choose what when and where you want to fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thats why I am trying to get in groups and not solo........JPis fine as long as there are &lt; 6 ppl in the zone (and preferably less)....but that just doesn't happen very often :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did a good portion of 54 in Jaggedpine; mostly hunting the panthers (I HATE the griffons, with having to look up and all, gives me a crick in my neck) when I couldn't get anyone in my guild to come and do the gnolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I tired the panthers a few times but didn't like the faction nor the AMAZING amount of adds you can sometimes get.<br />
<br />
Currently doing the Hole with 1 or 2 other ppl clearing from the enterance up to the Golem. Nice, easy, decent xp and someone to talk to :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">KEI+JP+swiftwind=1.5-2 blues per hour at 54.  Just kill the nearest DB animal that pops.  Better xp than anywhere I've grouped except the planes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Eorlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I don't understand how the faction works in JPF. When you kill animals, do you lose faction with people that are in the same zone only, or can you loose Surefall Glade faction as well?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ralv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I believe that killing any animal besides a griff or anaconda resuts in a negative faction hit with Jaggedpine residents.  I don't think it affects Surefall at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Daareon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Thats right. The two factions are critters of jaggedpine and JP residents.  <br />
<br />
Critters (i believe) are the gnolls and griffons (or at least they are the only ones KOS from the day you enter the zone) - I havent seen a way to raise this faction.<br />
<br />
Killing named poachers gives you good faction vs residents. The named poacher head quest gives you huge faction increases. <br />
<br />
Killing panthers reduces JP residents, but only by 1 point per kill. You litterally have to kill 300-400 to worry your faction with residents - and you can always recover it with the named poachers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Trueshotz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">IM currently 42 almost 43 and plannin got go to JP at 45.....cause im savin for a blessed faydark bow and a tolans  bracer........i hear Lupine dagger is good does it proc at a certain lv???? and how high does skill have to be for it to proc .....ty</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>RedChief</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lupine prcos once you hit 45.  I think for hunt JPF, its a very good investment.  As to bows, I've been using a Light Velium for a long time and havn't found a need to upgrade yet.  I would invest the 20k that the blessed fatdark and tolans cost and buy better armor, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Oneiros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">JP is good for even low 40s, fearing basilisks is the easiest XP I've ever had. When they thin out, you should be ready to take griffawns, I've never had too many problems with adds.<br />
<br />
Soloing for 17 levels really starts taking its toll, maybe thats whay I haven't played for a few weeks...</div></div><hr />
