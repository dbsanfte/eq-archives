<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Galkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi everyone this is my first post on this board :D<br />
<br />
I am a little confused about what has happened with the regen in the last patch i have recently made a troll shammy and he is almost lvl 12 right now. He regens at 2/tick standing and 4 / tick sitting. I understand this will naturally go up as i gain more levels. The part that confuses me is what the patch just did to our regeneration. Does this mean that we get no regeneration option in aa anymore? Does it mean we just don't get the last lvl of it? (what i mean is we can put points for extra 1/tick or 2/tick but NOT 3/tick) can somebody clear this up for me? Many thanks .<br />
<br />
<br />
My last question is when do i get my first regen upgrade i am lvl 11 and i wanan know is at what lvl i wil start to regen more than 2 standing and 4 sitting.<br />
Thanks again guys i look forward to your replies.<br />

<br />
For each AA point you spend you get 1 x-tra hp, so with 3 you regen 3hp more per tick than you previously did. However those classes that have natually higher regen were getting 2 points hp regen per 1 point spent in AA exp. <br />
<br />
They changed it (fixed it) so that it would only be one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
then<br />
----------------<br />
3 points of AA earned you 6hp a tick.<br />
<br />
<br />
now<br />
----------------<br />
3 points of AA earns you 3hp a tick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only affects level 51+ folks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I do believe Absor said somewhere they weren't going to change the extra regen.  Can't find a link right now, but a few people I talked to remembered it as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Galkak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thank you all for shedding some light on this matter.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brocht</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">While I would have much rather seen everyone get 2 per tick from AA (1 seems not enough)  It was truly unfair for Trolls/Iksar to get 2 for the same AA.  Innate regen is a bonus, AA is supposed to be equal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">It's a nerf.... NOT a fix. <br />
- So complete heal &quot;fix&quot; is actually a nerf right?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Seems like a pretty dumb move on their part.  SoL has been out for a while now.  If the extra regen was so game breaking, they could have fixed it in the first week after release.  Now that most everyone who wants it has already spent the points on extra regen, the only thing they accomplish by taking it away is to upset people.  It never bothered me that Trolls and Iksars got 2 hp/tick/point, because it was a nice racial bonus for them.  Just like it doesn't bother me that some races can wear plate, and some can wear the Fungi while others can't.  For those of you cheering about this nerf, I'll be sure to remind you of it when the next round of homogenization takes away something of yours.  Maybe EQ2 can just have the tank-mage as the only option so they can avoid having to pander to all the class envy whiners.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Alright, for the dillholes (you know who you are) who insist that this is a bug fix: <br />
<br />
I'm committing a personal sin. I’m posting to a thread that I haven’t finished reading all the way through. I’m sorry about that. I’ll try to finish it later, right now I’m hunting for patch repercussions. <br />
<br />
The change to the regeneration thing was not really a bug fix, it was a change of opinion. As should be obvious from this long-as-hell thread, neither leaving it as it was nor fixing it would end up being the ‘right’ thing to do when it comes down to public opinion. Folks on one side or the other of the discussion are going to end up displeased. <br />
<br />
We made the change because we thought it was the right change. If anything, I’d rather you all be angry with us than ripping each other apart over this. We basically came to the conclusion that there really isn’t any reason for two races to get more from the same ability than all the other races. <br />
<br />
I’m sorry for those that are unhappy about the change. And I’m not real happy about anyone that’s here gloating about it either. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cayen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The only reason all of this is happening is because the general populace won't really hit Verant where it hurts (the wallet), when something happens in the game that really really upsets them (ie: my fungi staff rage).<br />
<br />
If people want the tedium removed from the game, fight back.<br />
<br />
If they dont, keep on keepin on.<br />
