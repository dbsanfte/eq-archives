<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Isn't there a giant who drops Totemic armor? If so then what giant and what zone please?<br />
<br />
Also is it worth the effort to do it this way? I just want the helm only. Does this giant drop the helm?<br />
<br />
(I did a search with no results to my question).<br />
<br />
Remember I just want the HELM.<br />
<br />
Thx.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You CAN force his spawn by killing all the other roaming critters in that area of Rathe, but remember that he is rare and can drop any of the 8 bits of Totemic.  You are soooooo much better off going after the bear.<br />
<br />
Once you get the time on the PH's camping the bear is really not hard.  If you can throw a ranger mule in the cave you are doing even better :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Riokhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Ok thx,<br />
<br />
I have sat in the bear cave before. I just really didn't have the 8hrs to wait.<br />
<br />
I just heard rumors of the totemic dropping off a mob. I wanted to see how true it was and how hard it was.<br />
<br />
I can actually get the pp faster than doing the quest so I guess I'll just buy it. Even though it is over priced on my server.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>ssizzor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, I just got my totemic helm yesterday, after about 2 hours of work...<br />
<br />
Make a human ranger, get him to level 5 (takes an hour or so), dump all his points in tracking, get him to the cave in Everfrost (drop an enduring breath potion for him if you need), park him in the middle of the cave (in an alcove away from the wanderers), and camp.<br />
<br />
Then just come back occasionally to check the spawns...<br />
<br />
I got lucky and got him five hours later or so, but even so... shouldn't waste much of your time..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Glacier Bear- drops a component for the Totemic Helm quest.  He's on an 8 hour spawn under the Everfrost river (in the tunnels).  He shares the tunnels with a 50'ish Lich, so be careful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ya, what ssizzor said and what the hunting guide recommends is to get a rng toon in there.  Waiting 8 hours is ludicrous on a spawn that is not contested anymore. <br />
<br />
Actually, since the Kylong line got opened up I would even consider getting a Kylong helm.  They are really cheap (being the booby prize of HS) and can go for 250pp or less on Xeg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I camped the bear 9 days straight for my helm.  This was well before Kunark.  Once you get the ph's down, it's an easy camp.  My problem was the level 50 wizards who wanted to twink their shaman.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Don't make a ranger you are simply stealing someones timed spawn that they didn't wake up for, I know had it done to me twice.<br />
Took me 4 days to get that damn pelt.<br />
The timer is NOT 8 hours either. It's 6 hours 45 minutes exactly, the guides are wrong.</div></div><hr />
