<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chamelius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Lvl 43 iksar that is thinking about the possibility of hitting the Plane of Hate when I hit 45 or 46 whichever you have to be. My question is what kind of force would you need to have a successful Hate raid? Would be nice to pick up some SH armor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Wolfborn01</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">6 Groups + 2 - 3 chanters 1 cleric per group and a couple of shamans. <br />
<br />
Use a monk to pull to start room!<br />
Oh and don't forget the wizards to port you up there and nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You really need an experienced hate puller for these raids due to the buggy pathing, especially if you're going to do the 2nd floor.  Monks and SKs make for great PoH pullers.<br />
<br />
You'll need a rogue scout to tell the puller where the mobs are and a CoH mage is helpful to CoH the rogue back when he gets in trouble and clear aggro.  An SK and or Necro can be usefull to recover corpses lost in scouting missions, although likely a monk can FD pull the corpse back for a res, it just takes longer.</div></div><hr />

Been on a few pickup raids Wolfborn? :)<br />
<br />
The force needed depends on what you want to do and who is involved.  The typical planar pickup raid is pretty close to what wolf described, but if you havent been before I wouldnt try to organize one yourself.  Just find a pickup raid to go on and feel lucky if you get in on it at all until level 51 or so.<br />
<br />
For the record, PoH can be cleared almost up to Inny with one group of 60's.</div></div><hr />
