<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I recently paid a visit to Droga but had quite some diffeculty with killing even the first mob I encounterd. It was a casting gob, think a wizard type, he was nuking like mad. <br />
<br />
Normally I don't have any problem soloing mobs. But this was a pretty tough fight, for a blue con. The thing is, the zone does have a 12% xp modifier and it is indoors, so a lot more xp then say DL. That and I love dungeons and KC is still a bit too high at lvl 40.<br />
<br />
Any tips on how to solo these guys? I have a froglok crown for the resists and the rest of my armor has some resist as well. <br />
Maybe slow and haste me and pet and rush in with melee, or root it slap on dots and sit around the corner so he cant cast on me? (not much room to move around though, lotsa gobs).<br />
<br />
Anyway, I never posted in the guide section but I figured more shaman before  me probably found some answers for the questions I lay before you know :).<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zakisse</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Unfortunately for most of the dungeons I have seen on Kunark its not very easy to solo at all.  Take Kaesora for instance... great dungeon, awesome xp but it's bring your own group.  Droga is very much the same as there are lots of groups with very little solo camps.  Nurga is one I try to get in often and you might be able to solo the 2 spawn point upstairs from entrance but it would be tough less than 42nd level I'd say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I just spend the last 2 levels in Nurga, but I went at lv. 44.<br />
<br />
The Spiders in Nurga remain an EXCELLENT shaman soloing spot for lv. 44-47.  Head into Nurga, shrink yourself, and run up waterfall to the right.  Cast invis on yourself and run to 1st spider cave, right by the Sleeping Orge (Spiders caves marked with a #1 on EqAtals.com map).   Pull up a pet, buff up.  I kill the ogre to get him out of the way (he is for monk epic, 2-3 hour respawn, lv. 30).<br />
<br />
Now, take out the spiders.   Cast resist poison on yourself, maybe resist magic (Strathmore spiders occassionally spawn here and they are necros) , haste, and usual other buffs.  There is a 2-spawn right past the sleeping ogre.  Sometimes you are lucky and casting on one will not pull both.  If you pull both, root park one and kill the other fast.  Once you have broken this 2-spawn, go around the corner and break the 2-spawn there.  I found it fairly easy to keep the 4 spawns broken, no JBB or uber equipment.  I FLEW thru levels 44 and 45 here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm going to have to respectfully disagree with Shabby here.  Nurga spiders most certainly are not &quot;EXCELLENT&quot; exp at lvl 44.  I killed the two spawn right behind the sleeping ogre, the two spawn around the corner to the right, and the two spawn down the hall a bit.  <br />
<br />
These mobs DO have quite a bit of exp on them - but they are mostly light blue to me at level 44.  To be specific, I found a ratio of 1 dark blue out of every four mobs spawned.  75% of the mobs are light blue and only give half exp.  <br />
<br />
I did notice however that the room down the hall from the sleeping ogre had like 10 spiders in it.  All of these mobs were dark blue except one.  I tried to break the spawn though and I had to gate out - just too many mobs there for soloing.  I would reccomend coming into this dungeon at lvl 39 - invising up and running to the ogre.  Kill him and then work on the 2 spawn behind him and to the right of him around the corner.  Stay here until lvl 44 then seek other places to hunt.  <br />
<br />
Great zone - completely underutilized.  I wish I had come here sooner, and i'll miss not having the opportunity to bring twinks here in the future since i believe these dungeons will be revamped???<br />
<br />
Anyways, just wanted to pass that info on.  Any other good spots with juicy exp lvl 44 to 49?  :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">How long did you stay at the spawns by the Sleeping Ogre?  I spent about 10-12 hours of playtime, 2 levels worth (lv. 44-45) or so.  Trust me, I got about 10-15% of them as light blue at that time, not the 75% you indicate.  There was PLENTY of exp. here, I leveled very quickly.  When I dinged 46, I did move on because there seemed more like 25-35% light blues.<br />
<br />
I did notice that occassionally, I would get 3 light blues in a row, then see all dark blues for the next 12-15 spawns.   Maybe this is what you ran into.<br />
<br />
I think someone at lv. 39 without some super equipment might have a hard time breaking the spawns, a double pull would be very tough.  <br />
<br />
Nurga Spiders have been celebrated as a great Shaman hunting spot for lv. 44-47 for a long time, I found it to be so and would encourage other Shaman to check it out for themselves.<br />

P.S. Spirocs in Timorous Deep are nice solo exp. from 46-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wow, that's wierd then.<br />
<br />
I've read multiple threads about how great a spot Nurga is for shamans at lvl 44.  But when I went there last night, I encounted MANY light blues.<br />
<br />
Specifically, I killed both two spawns near the sleping ogre, and the thrid two spawn down the hall 4 times each - totalling 24 mobs.  I know how the random number generator in EQ isn't exactly random.....so I made sure to pull for a while.   I figured 24 spiders was enough to get accurate numbers - maybe I should go back and give it another try.  I ended up killing 7 dark blues and 17 light blues - so I lied a little bit, I got 29% dark blue spawns - not the 25% as previously stated.<br />
<br />
But still, I'm baffled ass to why so few dark blues?  Could my luck really be that bad???<br />
<br />
But yes, the exp on the dark blue mobs that I killed was AWESOME - I really wanted more of them :)  lol<br />
<br />
I guess I'll go try it out again and let you guys know what I find...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shabby</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Kongar, that does seem very odd! I would think 24 mobs was enough of a sample.  Don't blame ya for ditching the place.   My estimates of lt. blue-dk. blue spiders may be a tad off, but not much at all.  Like you, I cannot stand to hunt in an area that has too many lt. blues.  Truly odd.  Good luck if you go back and try again!<br />
<br />
If you get bored of Nurga spiders, try the Spirocs in TD, they very tasty too! I went there are 46 after Nurga.  The Spiroc Lightfoots are doable.  The watchers and the Proven can be a little tougher.  Just make sure you have doggy up and slow them :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Faction hits on Spiders?  I have heard you get positive Di'Zok faction on these, could either of you confirm that?<br />
<br />
Also, do you think a monk/shaman duo at 40 would do well with the spiders?<br />
<br />
Thanks!! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Kongar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Well,<br />
I decided to give nurga another try since it seems i may have had abnormally bad luck pulling light blue spiders at lvl 44.  It was funny because when I went back, I pulled 8 - count them, 8 light blue spiders in a row at lvl 44.  I thought that something most certainly must have changed because there was no way this spot was good at 44.<br />
<br />
But I stuck to it, and then all of a sudden dark blue spiders started spawning.  I killed 31 dark blue spiders with only the occasional (two or three) light blue spiders thrown in the mix.<br />
<br />
But then, after killing for a while, I ended up spawning 5 light blue spiders in a row, then a dark blue, then two more light blues. (I was 45 by this time).<br />
<br />
So, it seems that you have to be patient with this dungeon as it's not uncommon to get lots of light blue spawns in a row, but if you kill them off it seems that dark blues will eventually spawn in large numbers.  I just slowed and dotted the light blues just once, and then tanked for my pet.  I used little mana doing this and just kept pulling more - decent spot altogether, I think I had some abnormally bad luck the first night there.<br />
<br />
As far as faction goes, I can confirm that you take a negative hit with the goblin clan, and you get positive faction hits with DiZok when killing spiders.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Orakul Fatmystic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">yeah the spiders give the dizok faction. slaves (EXCEPT goblin slaves) don't.<br />
<br />
duoing with a 40 monk sounds great, although there are only about 10 or so spider spawns in all of nurga, so i'd recommend simply killing everything in sight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, we figure once we finish off the spiders we'll work on goblins, then back to spiders.  Thanks for all the info tho, very helpful. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Aye, very good info. <br />
You do need to drop down a no-return drop though? Or am I confused with Droga (which defenatly has those).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Bexar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Aye Karnn, in Nurga you have to drop down the waterfalls to get to the spiders, and and to return to surface you come back up through a series of adjacent tunnels.<br />

You don't have to drop down the big waterfall in nurga - if you shrink yourself twice you can swim up the one on the right, bypassing a large portion of the dungeon...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well we hit Nurga today, unfortunately on Test there is something different going on in the zone.  Down the spider area we found ONE spider.  Past that is the ramp down to where the burynai are supposed to be.  My partner scouted ahead and only found a spider or two interspersed between many goblins.<br />
<br />
This may just be that the zone is messed up, or a future change that is coming.  Thought I'd warn ya all in advance incase of the latter.<br />
<br />
Instead we hit kaesora which will probably push us to 41ish.  Library area is a good spot for a monk/shaman duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">As of yesterday, Nurga has been upgraded.  It is all goblins now and about half con dark blue, half light blue at 48.  There is no loot now, however, except for stone keys which dropped off about half the goblins.  The blues were worth around 1/2 a blue per solo kill, so I'll be spending some time here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Spraggon-Test</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You'll find some spiders mixed in as well then I bet, deeper in.  Too bad the area that was just spiders is gone...<br />
<br />
Ah well, things change.</div></div><hr />
