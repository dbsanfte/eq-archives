<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Rodahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A very kind guild (any Sanctus Arcanum members that may read this, thanks again!) allowed me to loot this item from Umbral Plains:<br />
<br />
Ensorcelled Spear<br />
9/20<br />
Magic Damage 3<br />
All Stats +5, except for WIS which was +15<br />
HP 50<br />
MANA 100<br />
SVFIRE/COLD/MAGIC 10<br />
<br />
Wasn't sure of the name of the mob that dropped it, but it was a huge, blue, named Netherbian Drone.<br />
<br />
Here's a pic:<br />

<br />
Very nice item and very kind of them to let you loot it</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Drops of the netherbian swarmlord in the cave with Tawro.  There is a large room in the cave that spawns a mini-ring type event.  Swarmlord spawns after half a dozen cycles.  It can be done by two or three groups (maybe one crack group of 60's with uber equipment).<br />
<br />
I got the spear, and stat-wise its almost as good as the epic.  Gives me a few more ac and hp over the epic, but fewer resists and of course, no DoT.  For meleee, its like a 12/20 spear that only works part of the time (it checks vs magic on each hit).  So you'll be hitting for 1, 2, 5, then it will go up to 20, 50, 75, then back down to 10, 2, 7, etc.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah the swarmlord is one of the tougher lesser named in UP.  Because he is not slowable(client immune message).  <br />
<br />
I think the smallest force we took him with was 9 people.  Was 57 cleric, 60 shaman, 57 warrior, 60 bard, 60 monk, 60 rogue, 59 rogue, 53 rogue, 59 ranger.  IIRC.  <br />
<br />
Spear went to the 53 rogue who doesn't have epic.  We have none of us anything special equipment wise.<br />
<br />
I think he spawns after the 4th wave after swarm caller dies.<br />
