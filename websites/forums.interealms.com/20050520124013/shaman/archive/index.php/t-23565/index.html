<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was thinking today about how culture changes come about in the businesses that I've worked for, and trying to view my desires for changes to the Shaman class through that lense.<br />
<br />
And I guess all these thoughts bubbled forth after stopping by the planetside forums.  I played that game from beta through live, and then about 6 long months, before I finally gave up in disgust.  I checked back at about the 8 month mark, and the same problems remained.  Big ones too. For instance:<br />
<br />
1.  Doors wouldn't open, causing your entire team to get wiped out cause you couldn't take cover in a base.<br />
2.  Lag.  Big battles, its major selling point, were unfeasible due to server performance.  I mean, you'd run forward 30 feet and then warp back 10 feet.  Really bad.<br />
And of course 3.  Balance issues:  X is overpowered, Y is underpowered... a change would happen, now Y is overpowered, X is underpowerd, etc.. standard cycles of power shifts.<br />
<br />
So anyways, what I noted when I checked the planetside forums a week ago was this:  A) The major problems were fixed, B) the 'class' that I played that used to be underpowered was now considered overpowered.<br />
<br />
The whole overall feeling on the forum was more one of gameplay tactics, thoughts about this or that, etc.. What was now missing was &quot;I hate this game I'm cancelling&quot; or &quot;If the vanu are not buffed up I'm leaving&quot;, etc.. <br />
<br />
So basically, a massive amount of change, for the better, occured just past the one year mark.  My dates might be off, but thereabouts. <br />
<br />
I guess what I realized from this, was that it takes way more time to fix something major, from a business standpoint, than someone immersed in the product is willing to wait.<br />
<br />
When I was playing planetside, and the reason I quit, was because the changes didn't occur in 6months.  <br />
<br />
I'm a programmer.  I often work on year long projects. I then oversee those projects in production, and modify them over time.  Typically, it takes me over a year to make major changes to system rules and 'balance' within the system.  Meeting the needs of marketing without hosing the needs of billing, for instance.<br />
<br />
I guess I came to realize that its not that it takes me a year to make the actual coding changes to better my systems.  Its that it takes a year for the business cultural to A) Identify the problem B) Come to terms with the real problem (A and B are always different from the customer and programmer standpoint) C) design a plan to address the problem D) work towards consensus on the plan to address the problem E) go about implementing the solution F) deal with new problems that crop up when you implement the first solution.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this thread is that it feels so intensely WRONG what the system is doing when you are using it.  In my case, it was planetside for 6months.  It felt like an eternity.  I couldn't fathom why they couldn't fix things.  So I quit.<br />
<br />
But, I give myself that same time in the real world.  <br />
<br />
So I guess my point is this:  I'm sure SOE has heard us, I'm sure a shift is brewing for shaman, but I'm sure its going to take at least 6 more months, maybe 8 months for it to occur.  Thats assuming that the content in Oow is similar to GoD and our problems will remain.<br />
<br />
So the bottom line is this:  Shaman will get better, but are you prepared to wait 6-8 months for a major shift to occur?  I am, now that I started thinking about what SOE is probably doing internally, and seeing that through the eyes of one of my projects.<br />
<br />
Now, on the other hand, if I'm completely mistaken, and SOE thinks we're fine then I'd be dumbfounded.  I mean... they can't truly think we are ok compared to the other priests, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Logic would state that Sony wants happy paying customers.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of solid based unhappyness surrounding the shaman class.<br />
<br />
So logically they would want us to be happy - to keep paying for our accounts.<br />
<br />
The reason I begin to doubt logic in this case is simply: Bringing the shaman back on track in the current high-end is NOT difficult. There is a plethora of  solutions for our uselessness in high ended grouping situatons.<br />
<br />
Could it be that a bump in the shaman desireability would cause other classes to start screaming for improvement threatening to quit?<br />
<br />
Right now i am at a loss of what to think or believe really. One thing is sure though. My trust in SoE is really low right now. My co-worker who has played in the top end game on my sever for 4 years (recently retired) is going crazy waiting for EQ2. Personally im not sure if i really want to give Sony a second chance. In the end Norrath has become synonymous with a sense of futility wich is becoming more and more focused each day i think about it.<br />
<br />
For each passing day, the need for the future improvements quantify. The longer this issue goes unresolved, the demands on the &quot;fix&quot; grows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know, I might have believed this drivel if I hadn't seen the spells and AA SoE slated for us.  Look at the reality of what they're doing.  It's black and white.<br />
<br />
If they had planned a shift for our class, it would have been represented in this expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I agree, Ungkor.  6 months, 12 months... I could live with that.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we're fast approaching 24 months since the rampant mitigation and class-blurring hit us full force.  Planes of Power was released in late September, 2002, and we soon started populating the Crucible with concerns about unusable buffs, poor heals, laughable spells, etc.<br />
<br />
To their credit, they did fix some of the PoP spells. Our concerns about slow mitigation, being seen as &quot;useless buff bots&quot; and our comparatively poor healing are even more drastically valid now than they were at the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I still only put lfg up for a few minutes to get a group.<br />
<br />
Not like friends of mine that have less desirable classes that lfg for hours.<br />
<br />
I usually find if im tooo lazy to put a gropu together i just go solo some **** while i put my tag up and usually get a group fast enough to curse the waste of time traveling somewhere.<br />
<br />
All we really need is a boost in our healing ability so we can keep a tank alive whilst we get around to slowing it.<br />
<br />
I can accept that our healing is tuned around mobs being slowed, but i need an ability to keep a tank alive whilst I get around to slowing the nasty beech.<br />
<br />
Im sure thats what they have in mind with thier mitigate partial dmg spells. The problem is that if they stack with warr defensive then they will then they will need to tune mobs to make it a challenge etc.<br />
<br />
They should just bite the bullet and give knights a repost disc, or a block disc with a shield so they can stay alive for the 30 secs it takes me to malo and slow.<br />
<br />
Either that or lower the resists on slows so i can slow and immediately heal.<br />
<br />
Whilst i like the idea of the GoD slow, i have trouble putting together a group to farm the sewers so i dont have them yet. Ballancing a class by creating spells that are only available in certain content is a bit rough.<br />
<br />
But then again you only really need it in upper pop and god so i spose its not that bad.<br />
<br />
Be well all!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I still only put lfg up for a few minutes to get a group.<br />
<br />
When you experience in elemental zones and bot you shouldn't have any problems when you put up your lfg tag.  However, what most shaman on this board are upset about is the life beyond that in GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We asked for this and offered a possible solution. Actually, there were two(similar ones):<br />
<br />
-Spirit Shifting <br />
<br />
The ability to transfer HPs via this AA with a ultra fast cast time (3 levels, up to 40% of the Shaman's HPs), was peoposed by veeshanMurtak about 6 months ago. We actually proposed this with a 10 minute recast, even though, I and even some of the Clerics over at the Priest Covenant felt 3 minutes was more appropriate and didn't have a problem with this ability<br />
<br />
-Shaman like Divine Arbitration. <br />
<br />
Ultrafast casting AA that allowed to balance HPs only between the Shaman and their target in the same way Clerics are able to balance a complete group's HPs with Divine Arbitration. 3 levels, up to ~+30% HPs(since it only affects 2 people). 2-3 minutes reuse.<br />
<br />
Have you seen anything remotely close to this popping up since they were proposed? This and a stonestance like AA would have fixed 2 very serious issues for the Shaman.<br />
<br />
For one, they would have reinstated the Shaman as THE superior Slower by giving them the same emergency survivability of a Beastlord and thus actually allowing them to perform their role again adequately, since our roles force us to generate huge amounts of aggro, and second, to adress the Shaman's impotence in regards to keeping the tank alive in case of a delayed Slow(multipull, etc.) or the oh so familiar Slow resist.<br />
<br />
These two AAs should have been part of the Omens expansion and they would have helped fixing the Shaman issues big time. A resist modifier to our DoTs(and upgrading them proportionally to Necro's instead of widening the gap for some reason) and a 1600-1700 DD and voilà you fixed a class.<br />
<br />
Rytan, do you read this? It ain't hard, dude, you just gotta listen to the right people  ;).<br />
<br />
Edit: Look, I even put the fixes in bold, spell guy</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Rowf, question,<br />
<br />
What do your undesirable friends play? Shadow Knights and Berserkers?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>rowf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Necro, mage, ranger and wizzy friends.<br />
I used to dual bott a monk, they have troubles tooo, but the new lull spell/disc they have has made them very good pullers again, so its better for them.<br />
<br />
The main thing is the number of &quot;must have&quot; slots in a group.<br />
<br />
tank, heal, slow, crowd control/puller, dps.<br />
<br />
three tank classes (one if you read the knight boards), three slowers (bards are just a little low but ok on yard trash), two crowd controls, and everyone else clammoring for the dps slot.<br />
<br />
Many classes have &quot;hybrid&quot; rolls, like monks, dps and crowd control (bringing only one mob is a form of crowd control), shamans Slow and heal (mind you our heals need a tweak).<br />
<br />
It leaves a lot of people clammoring for the dps roles. Hence its very hard to find groups till people have thier dps AA's given the significant power gap these represent. Whereas a shaman with our slow is only level dependent, and a cleric is the ultimate group char once about 49 (95% rezz). Some will even say 39 with cheal.<br />
<br />
Heck in an easy ldon my bot sk doesnt even need healing unless i bring in more than three mobs, which is a rarety unless im boored.<br />
<br />
Yes i've played in GoD. Yes i tend not to like it much cause most of my friends arent up to GoD EP+ standard, so i choose to group with my friends rather than follow all out uberness, its also good for the ego to out tank the main tank, but once you start talking raid, the game for all intents and purposes changes quite significantly.<br />
<br />
My sk bot and me can handle the sewers quite ok untill we get to the end mobs, but i dont play the game to solo, i like talking to other people.<br />
<br />
Raids, dunno. Thats where shamans are a little left out. There are a suprising number of shamans out there. Considdering you only need a couple on a raid to buff and slow, since we dont have any real dps to speak of or a secondary ability like the AE heals druids and pallies get that can counteract AE's via MGB for a raid, i tend to ignore my sham once the boss mob is slowed.<br />
<br />
If i concentrate i can land a few dots, but the dot agro means im summoned and squished pretty quick if im not carefull, then the entire raid gets pissed at you for stealing agro.<br />
<br />
I prefer to hang back and see if i can keep some juice in the tank so if its a close call i can chain heal the MT towards the end and perhaps help contribute that way. Its been my most effective contribution I can make to raids so far after slow.<br />
<br />
Perhaps we need to look at the concept of raid only abilities?<br />
<br />
I understand people could abuse them by raiding a group, but the xp nerf should stop that.<br />
<br />
Maybe we could make a raid have a minimum no of people or it disbands after engaging a mob?<br />
<br />
Dont know, but i have played a number of chars over time, and the only thing i have ever played that gets groups faster than a shaman is a cleric.<br />
<br />
But I dont play in GoD. Im sewers flagged but not done the mountain pass trials yet.<br />
<br />
Besides, the most fun ive had in EQ is with a good group of friends that you group with regularly. Everyone has goals, and works to help one an other. Mind you one guild i was in got sooooo ****ty that we had a regular group happening that people started flaming us on the guild boards for the fact we grouped, had fun, and had a full group, cause they thought it was our job to provide entertainment for them.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the point im making is that sure we are currently undesirable on raids beyond one or two to slow, but we are highly desirable in groups. Although GOD mobs need fast healing to cope.<br />
<br />
I reckon some upgrades to heals and reducing the cast time of our spells so we can heal and slow at the same time would go a long way to addressing this.<br />
<br />
Im sure there are a few who would dissagree, but one thing i find is even if i get a crappy LDON pickup group, i can pull, heal, slow, tank, crank out dps (if i can risk canni fatigue) and even crowd control. I can make up for the deficiencies of almost anyone in a group. This is something that I dont think any other class can do. Mind you, GoD mobs i cant, but i think we are not as badly off as other classes like SK's for example, who cant mitigate dmg until slow kicks in so cant tank as well as other plate classes, but dont have a dps boost to compensate. Even a ranger can out tank a sk on some mobs due to weapon shield.<br />
<br />
Anyway i'm sure i will attract a few flames with this, which is booring. Give me some insightful revalations that may help stimulate my intellect for a change instead of redirected anger and hate.<br />
<br />
Anyone can hate, its the easiest emotion in the world. Whats hard? what makes a leader? The ability to effect people around you in a possitive way.<br />
<br />
Suprise me, add to my knowledge, tickle my intrigue, help me have and fun.<br />
<br />
Thats what I want from my EQ community of friends and like minded individuals.<br />
<br />
PS I am spellingually challenged and proud of it.</div></div><hr />

Planes of Power was released in late September, 2002, and we soon started populating the Crucible with concerns about unusable buffs, poor heals, laughable spells, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />
See, I guess I'm starting the counter now.  I felt a little nerfed in PoP, but not bad.  I still contributed, I still main healed most content.  Even when I couldn't main heal it, I was a very viable backup healer in the toughest EP zones.  My cures were useful on many encounters... encounters were longer and I could stack lots of dots, etc.. PoP was fine imo.  Not ideal, but ok.<br />
<br />
I guess for me, after experiencing GoD now, and seeing the drops, getting some of the spells, getting some of the AA's... thats when I realized that even taking all GoD has to offer, I'm still far, far too weak to contribute like I did in PoP.  <br />
<br />
I see us as close to reaching a critical mass, where more and more shaman are venturing into GoD (be it raids or tipt/vxed sewers, etc..) and realizing how broke the shaman is in such content.  Its only now that our cumulative voices are loud enough that the point is really being driven home.  <br />
<br />
At first, I think the developers could chalk up our complaints along with the rest of the classes as just culture shock. Old world EQ mentality meets new expansion.  The developers all the while thinking, its ok, they'll get the AA's and spells, and learn to tackle the new content... and all will quiet down.  Only... they were wrong.  I really believe that one class is starting to stand out and has serious problems: Shaman.<br />
<br />
Thats why I'm thinking the clock is starting now.  The 6-8 months is probably just starting.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Kunark - shaman were overpowered<br />
<br />
Velious - nothing new for us, everyone else caught up<br />
<br />
Luclin - Underpowered, but we handled it ok, figured it wasn't our turn<br />
<br />
POP - Early POP was no harder than Luclin, but later zones started to REALLY hurt as slow became less important.  Disorganized complaining starts for real.<br />
<br />
GoD - The excrement really hits the air circulating device.  Fights are high-damage, low-HP mobs that die before we can fully debuff them, for the most part, but they won't upgrade us because we are so powerful on the long fights... that they are no longer putting into the game.  Organized protesting starts to emerge here.<br />
<br />
OoW - nothing to address the serious problems is even on the horizon, and it ships on Monday.<br />
<br />
That's more than a six-month timeframe.  The problem has been around since Luclin, been complained about loudly since POP, been complained about in an organized fashion for at least six months.<br />
<br />
If it was JUST a programming issue, i.e. if they knew what changes to make to balance us and just needed to implement them, then 6-9 months would be a gracious plenty.  Hell, they do a whole expansion in that time.  But they have no freakin' idea what to do to fix the class; Beastlords and Druids have split the territory we used to own and there's no room left for us.<br />
<br />
As a programmer, how long does it take you to fix the code when you don't know the fix?  How long does it take to fix something where there IS no acceptable fix?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I guess I came to realize that its not that it takes me a year to make the actual coding changes to better my systems.  Its that it takes a year for the business cultural to<br />

<br />

<br />
Ungkor, I agree with your analysis. Fundamentally it applies to lots more than just programming/coding. That said, consider this:<br />
<br />
 A) SOE has not admitted that there is a problem. Having not admitted, we have to presume they do not have a (any) shaman problem(s) identified. So, I would add a pre-A condition to your process: recognizing there is a problem which leads to A (identifying.)<br />
<br />
From the shaman player side of the fence, I can't believe they are not aware there is (are) a problem(s). But lets be practical here. Either SOE (1) doesn't recognize there are serious problems with shaman class development paralleling game development, or (2) they realize there is a growing gap between game design and shaman functionality and are dealing with a priority list that shaman are not on, or (3) the fantastical is true and SOE is phasing shaman out of the game.<br />
<br />
IMO, I think it is (2): SOE knows shaman functionality has been trivialized. Prior game changes caused this - none of it forseen. Had game development continued along the lines of Velious and even PoP shaman would still sit on the top of the slowing food chain. Shaman would still be the weak link in the healing chain. Shaman would still be minimized in their buffs. I say top slowers, marginal healers and minimal buffers.<br />
<br />
But, where was the next expansion going to go? What were other options for GoD (and soon to be OoW) that expanded the game difficulty? Shaman arguments would be longer fights - which SOE has already 'decided&quot; was not what the player base wanted. (Frankly, I disagree. Players will do what ever it takes to progress. Longer fights would not matter - if it was the progression path.)<br />
<br />
SOE blew it long ago when shaman were given Turgur's. It overpowered the game so the game had to be balanced around it. Clerics were upgraded to compensate for the additional mob power needed to compensate for slow. Druids were upgraded simply to provide them with viability for groups. This template can only go so far though. Eventually you either have to have encounters where clerics can instantaneously CH in a chain to compensate for massive melee damage or you have to re-think the template. SOE's re-thinking was to minimize (mitigation) and remove slow while still increasing encounter difficulty to the point that clerics need to spam heal to compensate.<br />
<br />
Of course this tossed shaman to the side. Tied in with the balancing of melee classes in the last few expansions to provide them with gear that stat maxxes them (marginalizing shaman buffs) and the minimal level of shaman healing abilities and ... well, here we are.<br />
<br />
So, when you say &quot;Identify the problem&quot; you have to consider that in SOE it is apparent that shaman were the problem. Other classes have gone through the same situation. Late in Kunark rangers were all but cast aside as a class. Rogues were gimps. In PoP warriors were extremely minimized - as the hey-day of the paly/sk shined on.<br />
<br />
Changes came to these classes. Slowly. In some cases, marginally. In some cases at the cost of other class viability (warrior changes and game changes in GoD also slammed paly/sk.)<br />
<br />
To wrap this up without further detail, I think, using your process analysis, shaman were the problem. That problem has been fixed. What to do with shaman - what new role to provide shaman - is in the review process. That review process involves letting the game development play out and see how players find the ways to play the game the designers can not anticipate. To let players find the brick walls designers are not aware of. To then find solutions that require specific class abilities and provide them predominantly to shaman, secondarily to others.<br />
<br />
While I see the events yet to unfold differently than you, I think we are looking at the same process. In my view the process is stopped at  C: design a plan to address the problem (as we are discussing shaman.) The identified problem being: where do shaman fit into the game (without slow.)<br />
<br />
For those who will say SOE doesn't think there is a problem, I point out, from a PR standpoint SOE can't officially recognize a problem as extensive as the one shaman are facing. When they say, &quot;shaman are working as intended&quot; they are being honest. That they don't say, &quot;shaman are working as intended, but their abilities are not contributory to the current game direction and we are reviewing how to make them viable again&quot; is simply because they can't say this ... officially.<br />
<br />
SOE changed the game which has excluded shaman power from contributing. In time SOE will change shaman to fit back into the game. It will not be as slowers. It will not be as buffers - as we know that role today. It will not be as healers because the game has enough of them already. In the meantime, welcome to being the red-headed stepchild of EQ.</div></div><hr />

I think you are very right.  SOE can't officially tells us &quot;Oh crap, we really painted ourselves into a corner on this one&quot;.  Thats why my guess is they are probably well aware of the problem now, and are formulating a role change.  Brenlo, Rytan, etc.. will never tell us &quot;yeah, we are aware that you guys are worthless now, sorry, working on it&quot;. It just won't happen.  <br />
<br />
But I still think that as a business that wants to retain customers, they are working on it, but it may be much longer before the changes occur.  People that are screaming about quitting need to face reality; that being, this is a HUGE game design problem, and its going to take a long time to fix. <br />
<br />
You either stay on board for 6-8 months and do your best, or decide to not give SOE another chance, or quit, or play another character.  I'm just at a point where I see that yelling at SOE isn't going to solve anything I guess.   But, but, I do realize that the yelling will never stop, and in fact, I'm counting on it to continue to occur.<br />
<br />
I'm counting on it, because it is a necessary part of the push that changes a corporate culture.  It just never appears to occur in a timely manner for the customers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">So, when you say &quot;Identify the problem&quot; you have to consider that in SOE it is apparent that shaman were the problem. Other classes have gone through the same situation. Late in Kunark rangers were all but cast aside as a class. Rogues were gimps. In PoP warriors were extremely minimized - as the hey-day of the paly/sk shined on.<br />
<br />
Changes came to these classes. Slowly. In some cases, marginally. In some cases at the cost of other class viability (warrior changes and game changes in GoD also slammed paly/sk.)<br />
<br />
<br />
It wasnt changes to paladins or warriors per se that affected desirability, it was the specific changes to the nature of the game when PoP and GoD were released. When PoP was released, the gameplay naturally favored the strengths of knights, so they became the dominant tanks. In GoD it favored the strengths of warriors, so they assumed that role in that content. The changes to both classes both prior to PoP and after the melee rebalancing were fairly minor, but when the respective new game paradigms came into play, one or the other group assumed dominance through the intrinsic strengths they allways had.<br />
<br />
This waxing and waning of relative power is fairly normal as the game evolves.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I think you are very right. SOE can't officially tells us &quot;Oh crap, we really painted ourselves into a corner on this one&quot;. Thats why my guess is they are probably well aware of the problem now, and are formulating a role change.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is it that we see them saying?<br />
-&quot;All things working as intended.&quot;<br />
-&quot;What is a shaman?&quot; (very poor joke)<br />
<br />
<br />
What is it that we see them doing?<br />
-Healing:<br />
...maintaining 47/63/100 healing ratios.<br />
-AA:<br />
...taking up AA spots in OoW with pet abilities, even though we're not a pet class.<br />
...rabid bear still worthless.<br />
...critical affliction still not comparable to fury of magic.<br />
-Dots:<br />
...hosing us on the curse upgrade.<br />
...unbearable agro from dots still has not been fixed.<br />
...dots still don't resist on a per/tick basis.<br />
...poor/nonexistant focus itemization.<br />
-Nukes:<br />
...ridiculously long cast times on our ice nukes.<br />
...stupidly low damage output and/or mana efficiency on our poison nukes.<br />
-Buffs:<br />
...6.5 minutes of mediocrity.<br />
...our hybrid has a better buff line than us, even though they don't have the mana to make the most of it.<br />
...paladins buff more hp.<br />
...rangers buff nearly as much as atk.<br />
-Raiding:<br />
...any more than 2-3 shaman gimp a raid.  lack of stackability.<br />
<br />
<br />
What is going on in San Diego seems pretty black and white to me...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Howler, yeah, you're right. The are basically maintaining the status quo across the boards.  Doesn't mean they aren't planning major changes in the future.  Thats the point of my thread.  <br />
<br />
The bottom line is, we'll never know till it hits us.  And if it is indeed being worked on, its going to take WAY longer than you think it should.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I created a betabuff Beastlord at level 65 and a betabuff shaman at level 65 and the beastlord had about 500 more mana unbuffed, just an fyi.<br />
<br />
...dots still don't resist on a per/tick basis.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see the reasoning and the point behind this, but I don't know if I would like its implementation.  If it works out to the same percentage of damage being resisted/mana being wasted, then I would say leave it alone.<br />
<br />
6.5 minutes of mediocrity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Amen!  All of our buffs are seriously hurting on duration, and that line of spells is the the worst.  At least if they made it like our Haste and Regen lines of spells we could have a chance at it lasting through a raid mob (well, probably not because of debuffs, but you get the idea).  But at least it might last until the fight actually starts!</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
it would allow you to cast the dot and have it land, then each tic would check for a resist allowing for partial resists instead of all or nothing as it is now. if you played a chanter back in the day you would understand how frustrating it is to have you big nuke be all or nothing. <br />
<br />
in short we could dot WITHOUT having to malo first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the point is, it's ALREADY taken 3x as long as I thought it should.  The need for change was obvious during Luclin.  And if they hadn't started working on it during PoP, that was inexcusable.  To have released GoD and not begun changes is inconceivable.  But to now release OoW without doing anything?  I think you are the most tolerant, permissive person I've ever met (in the messageboard sense of 'met' *grin*) to take the stance that patience is still justified in this case.<br />
<br />
I couldn't disagree with you more, I do NOT think a positive change for shaman is going to happen.  I believe there are months of evidence to back me up.  However, I'll continue to hope that you're right, with the small smidgeon of optimism for EQ that will never quite die.</div></div><hr />
