<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Currently, the new slow seems kinda nifty, but would you guys ever use it?  I mean, I'm already having trouble with spell slots.  I have seven unreplaceable slots (canni, tnarg, quiesc, petrifying, malos, turgur, ferine/other) and my eighth slot is reserved for damage, tigir's, gate (replace ferine with something else if I have gate up or if not many melees are around), or rebuffing... replacing my eighth slot with this spell would be severely limiting.  So when would you use this?  Is the resist adjust enough that you would rather use this over cloud of grummus?  (it is quite fast, which is nice).  I sort of see this spell as an emergency slow in case turgur's doesn't land.  But I can't think of any situations where I would have this spell memorized.. can you?<br />
<br />
(I'd personally prefer it if they made it nigh unresistable, or -90 resist adjust, and make it even shorter, like 3-4 ticks.  Then at least it would have a clear use and be worth memorizing sometimes.<br />
<br />
The absolute best change for this is to make an AA with 3 minute refresh ... if that happened, then I'd love it the way it stands right now, without any changes.)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I would use it the same as my other Disease slows. About once every 6 months.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I would never use it.  I don't see a single situation where it could be useful with the recast time being so long.  12 seconds over the previous 30 is better, but still WAY too long.  Instant recast on it?  Might consider using it and turgurs over torgors/turgurs in LDON groups.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">As it is, I don't think I'd use it.  If they dropped the recast time, I'd give it a shot as my main slow for LDoN groups.<br />
<br />
I would use it the same as my other Disease slows.<br />
...but it's a magic slow. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I doubt I would ever use it myself. Having a TA changes game play substantially so I don't see any reason for me to use that spell. However, it may be useful in general to quite a few Shaman. That extra -30 might make a big difference.<br />
<br />
Of course, there may be some raid based content in GoD that might require it's use.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">**** no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">currently keep turgurs and tirgirs up on dungeon runs.  get add and tirgirs covers em all and usualy dont even have to bother with turgurs, singles turgurs generaly does the trick.  the new slow would be nice in a fast paced enviroment like dungeons where the occasional resist of turgurs means the mobs down to 60% before you can recast.  however with the recast time there is no way it will keep up and even with -30 there is still a chance of occasional resists (get em on greater imobilize occasionaly and its also -30).  <br />
<br />
On raid mobs the -30 will be a small dent and unless we have 6 or 7 shaman available to chain slows at the mob i dont see this being used at all either.  even on the chance that it lands 7 ticks is nothing on a 100k+ hp mob.<br />
<br />
only solutions to make it a usable spell are drop the reuse time or make it unresistable (not over powered because of unslowable and mitigated tags on mobs).  the casting time and mana are nice but im more than willing to sacrifice those for either of these options.<br />
<br />
finaly if they give beastlords the same spell at the same lvl i think ill be leave eq and find something else to do...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would use it, it has a great use as a preliminary slow, and as a quick slow in ldon. Only thing is I want the -30 resiadj removed from Beastlords. A shaman should be able to slow before a beastlord on a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Never?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Icklymuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">7 tick duration?<br />
I was using this today on beta, didn't think to pay attention to its duration... I just never thought I would see a slow that was less than a minute... needless to say it ywas removed from the line up quick like, followed by a feedback and a bug.<br />
I also sent a bug abut our bew dot, currently its 145pts oer tick... Still needs to be more if its to be used...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I'd never mem it, recast is too long, duration is too short.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">what is the point of a new disease dot when the environment does not allow it?

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">never.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">No, it's garbage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I'd use it on LDoN runs as a quick tag to slow the incs, but only if they gave me at least one extra spell gem to mem it in. No way am I losing Turgs out of my line-up for a spell with that kind of re-cast on a bounce.<br />
<br />
And given their frequently stated views on extra spell gems....<br />
<br />
Not once ever not even in a blue moon no way no how gratzdestroy it.<br />
<br />
Edit: Still amuses me that the fizzle time is 50% longer than the cast time. Be a bummer if it landed and then deleted itself half a second later on account of a post-cast fizzle.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>larns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">There's a 70% one with -30 modifier also.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On a raid when I'm the only shaman and we have no bard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I'd use it on tunare, Velk, and Kunark Dragons, then afk to cry in my closet when it still didn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>mmshah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Lol ya Griz exactly.  - 30 isnt enuff to make it land on those slowable but super high mr (but not magic immune) mobs like Mith Marr, Earthb Minis, etc so its useless.  -100 and itd be decent, thats the only way I think it could overcome the 55% slow, 7 tick duration and 12 sec recast limitations.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">No-  Sad thing is as I said in another post and as Grammar stated with the opening post for this thread if it was an AA it would be okay.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I think it really is a good idea and reinforces both the idea of a preliminary slow and by varying our specialist ability of slowing. The only real disadvantage is that you really need to have turgurs up at the same time. To this I was really hoping Divine Avatar would be the solution we were looking for, one of our most used abilities going to an aa. Sadly though this has been farmed out to clerics instead of us.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Spells with a real long refresh time = useless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">The only way this spell would be useful if it was like the mez rapture. Its a 7 tic mez with a 24 second recast, but -1000 to resist. <br />
<br />
If this slow was similar then it would have its uses.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I can see this spell being used as a preliminary slow on very MR raid targets, just to take the edge off the mob while you try and land a real slow.<br />
<br />
For group use? Never. Too many drawbacks, no real benefits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We use the disease slows for that.<br />
<br />
And **** no, I'd never waste a spell slot on this excreble excuse for an enhancement.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I have to disagree there. I am not happy with the spell in it's current form(Make it a 1 second cast and up the resist adjust to -75+), but i do see uses for it in a groupsetting.<br />
<br />
There's a few times when casting speed matters more than aynthing. <br />
<br />
Pet breaks - I have a TA, yet I still keep Turgur's memmed because it casts in 2 seconds instead of 3. This means i can Slow the loose pet(charm) faster(when your pet does 900 dps, this is crucial).<br />
<br />
Interrupts - Sometimes you catch aggro. The faster your CC spell, the better. Root, VP, Slow is all I have to buy me time. And neither Root nor VP nor Slow casts in 1.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Then there is the preliminary aspect of course.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless this spell needs to improve and most importantly, the Beastlord version of it must ****ing disappear in the trash can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope to god that the devs aren't expecting us to use this with multiple shaman in a &quot;slow chain&quot; similar to a CH chain.<br />
<br />
Would it work? Yes.<br />
<br />
Would it be the most goddamn retarded thing to happen to the shaman class since slow mitigation? YES!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>sownow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">in it's current form no<br />

as a matter of fact at this time i will refuse to buy GoD at all <br />

to me the new spells and AAs are adding insult to injury</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I would use this quite rarely.  I only use the disease slows as it is on mobs that turgurs does't stick, and the 7 tick duration makes it paticularly useless IMHO.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">Utterly useless in current form.<br />
<br />
Hell, they don't even have the resists right on it, looks like its suppose to be a deseise based spell but it currently magic resist even.  Its not even out in a manner in which they intend to put it out.  Um, right?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Diabalein</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">guys its MAGIC BASED, it adds disease counters but is still a magic based slow...just like all of our slows but 2.<br />
<br />
the disease counters are there because they were to stupid to put in magic counters...or so you can cure it with cure disease. <br />
<br />
either way it still blows ass, GoD looks to be the lamest expansion ever, rogues got the shaft as well, they give BL the same spell as they give it to shaman AT THE SAME LVL? please sony pull your head(s) out of your ass(s) and get a clue. I mean really What do the people you have coming up with these ideas do? play eq on their own private server with about 12 other people? if this is the best you can do for new expansion ideas then eq truly is dead. Grats this expansion is at least 6 months from release (that is before I think they could make it an even halfway decent expansion) but you plan on releaseing this piece of crap in a couple weeks? <br />
<br />
nope not buying this one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I sense a consensus building!!!<br />
<br />
the original question was - When would you use it?<br />
<br />
Two people have come up with scenarios, everyone else said not at all.  The two scenarios are tributes to the creativity of the shaman who contributed them, rather than to the devs.<br />
<br />
1.   Pet break.  seems like a real important issue, judging from the number of complaints I have read on the boards and heard in game (/sarcasm off).  only advantage here is cast time, not the -30 to MR.<br />
<br />
2.  a shaman slow chain.  lol - I do not look forward to this!  Not addressing any current needs, obviously.<br />
<br />
<br />
A few peeps mentioned using this as the second slow memmed for LDoN runs.  Again, the only advantage is cast time.  I would still expect to use torgor's or tirgir's rather than this, given the 7 tick duration.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a tragic waste of one of the few items offered for this class in the expansion.  And that is without addressing whether Beastlords get the same slow at the same level - at the moment Idon't see a reason to care.<br />
<br />
(no, I couldn't think of a situation when I would use it, either)</div></div><hr />

Give that many AA% per kill and I am totally out of EQ. They almost ( if not already ) killed the game like that with PoP.</div></div><hr />
