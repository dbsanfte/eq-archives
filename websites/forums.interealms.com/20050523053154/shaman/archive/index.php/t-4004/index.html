<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Alrighty here, I'm looking for some advice from the shaman community concerning an unusual problem.<br />
<br />
I'm level 60. I have 24 AA points at the moment. I don't have torpor.<br />
<br />
Thats right, I don't have torpor. My guild is quite capable of acquiring it, but we're busy raiding larger stuff (mainly NToV, Tormax, Dain, Yelinak, Statue, AoW (well, attempting AoW hehe), Tunare and Luclin boss mobs like Creator, Rhag 1 and 2, THO, etc). I sure as hell am not going to ask 15+ of my guildmates / friends to come with me to kill juggs en masse or kill Kunark dragons time after time just for a chance to get a rare drop spell when we could be doing stuff that would better suit our time.<br />
<br />
The problem is on Drinal, torpor is like never ever sold, and I've only got about 30k of the 100+k asking price for when it is sold (I've seen 2 copies sold in 7 months). That said, I don't feel sorry for myself nor ask for any pity from any of you fellow Crucible folks, since as I have never experienced firsthand what torpor is like, I can't say I really miss it. From what I gather from what I've read on these boards and the Drinal shaman community, having Torpor is sort of like driving a car. It wasn't a big deal when you couldn't do it when you were 15, but now that you can drive a car you can't imagine how you ever did without.<br />
<br />
Now onto my request for advice:<br />
<br />
I currently have:<br />
<br />
Run 3<br />
Regen 3<br />
Mental Clarity 3<br />
Spell Casting Fury 2<br />
<br />
I took spell casting fury for the fun of it, mainly because as of late I have no idea what to put my points into now since I don't have torpor. Massive cannibalization is 5 points away for me, but should I bother pursuing it at this point when I don't have torpor?<br />
I've been thinking either putting points into spell casting reinforcement to make my buffs last longer, or healing adept to increase the efficiency of chloroblast. Quick buff is also an option I'm considering pursuing.<br />
<br />
So, what would you do if you were in my situation? I'm a long way off from ever affording torpor, and don't have any tradable items that are worth a lot of plat, so I won't be getting it in the near future. What would you put your AA's into?<br />
<br />
edit: PS, I don't care if they're class / archetype skills, Venerable / Elder titles don't mean squat to me :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Quick buff is always a nice one. Currently at QB 1 + Shissar ring and the 40% off cast time on buffs is very noticable and very nice.<br />
<br />
Another one I would seriously look at if i where you is spell casting mastery. With your handycap on mana regen with not torpor spending less mana on every spell cast would be very useful.<br />
<br />
Spell casting reinforcement is another descent option altho one of the main reason most shaman go for it is torpor and you don't have it. Think about it how often do most people actually have Group focus or group sta wear off naturally? Not that often really. They end up getting dispelled, dying what ever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xertt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I say get Canni5, and MGB.<br />
<br />
Try to get Torpor, it will help your guild ALOT, and make soloing so much easier for you.<br />
<br />
It will make your guild buffing faster, cause you can can down/torpor, and your set(or just get the ranga's to heal you i gues).  <br />
<br />
w/ can5, cast group focus, can5, repeat.<br />
<br />
w/ MGB, you can get a whooole lotta people w/ your buffs, making everything go much faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Xertt, please re-read my first post. I AM trying to get torpor, and I know all about what I should do when I get it. My problem is what do I do in the meantime :D<br />
<br />
As a side note, with the number of shamans that we actively raid with being 5-8 (all level 60, 2 or 3 of whom have MGB already), MGB is one of my absolute last priorities at this moment in time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd say a better anolgy for torpor is this:  Everyone is already driving around in a car, and you're used to the time it takes you to get around to places.  When you scribe torpor, you've got your own personal jet to drop you off wherever you want in a fraction of the time (downtime is eliminated).<br />
<br />
That said, if you're in a raiding guild, I'd say go w/ MGB.  It'll be more useful than anything else (sans can5 + torpor) that you can get right now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Being that my guild raids with Jukax's guild a lot, I say don't get MGB! <br />
<br />
Since you don't have Torpor, I would not get Cann 5 yet. Go for quick buff to make doing Khura's less of a hassle. I would not go past level 2 in quick buff, as you can get a spell haste item eventually that will almost make the last level of quick buff completely useless.<br />
<br />
I've found Casting Reinforcement to be a complete waste on every spell except Torpor. It's nice if you're PLing someone though (celerity, regen, primal avatar). On raids however, people will almost always die before the normal duration of Brute/Focus is up anyway, so adding more duration has no effect.<br />
<br />
I've found healing gift to be very nice. I have it maxed and crit for something like 856 since the healing change. It goes off pretty often and is a big help on mobs that require a lot of fast heals where you can't just rely on CH rotation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Thanks Jing, that's exactly the type of post I was looking for =) I guess I've got to think outside the box a bit more, I was thinking that healing gift would be less useful to me than healing adept, but I just noticed that crit heals have a higher % of going off then crit nukes. <br />
<br />
Also thinking it over, healing adept / healing gift wouldn't be a waste of points at all in the long run, since even when I eventually do get torpor, it's limited to group only. I forgot about that, and the chance to crit heal / increased healing power would be good for cross-group healing in raid situations.<br />
<br />
Still looking for more opinions though, if there's one thing we shamans are good at it's giving opinions! :D<br />
<br />
PS - As Jing said, I'm looking to stay away from MGB - our two guilds raid together all the time and we've got 5-8 shamans in attendance on a regular basis. Jing, Jondal, Jukax, Karv, Heterotic, Nugga, Moarog, Kalle, Kildorn....anyone I'm missing?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jukax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">A question, not sure if anyone knows the answer: do healing adept and healing gift stack?<br />
<br />
IE:<br />
<br />
Healing adept at level 3 improves heals by 10%<br />
<br />
so Chloroblast heals 428 + 43 (rounding up) = 471<br />
<br />
Healing gift at level 3 gives 10% chance to double healing value<br />
<br />
so Chloroblast heals 428 x 2 = 856<br />
<br />
If you have them both maxxed would you get crit heals for 471 x 2 = 942?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Darjeeling</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With focus items combined with AA, you can get some nice rewards from superior heal.<br />
<br />
Since the removal of the healing penalty, superior healing does 583 hps. If you have Adept at 3, that's a 10% boost for ~641 hps. If you have a Healing 3 focus item (0%-20% bonus), that can boost it up to 20% for ~770 hps. If you have AA healing gift, 10% of the time you will get a double heal, so anywhere between 1282 hps, and 1540 hps.<br />
<br />
Also, with focus casting haste (15% reduction), superior heal's cast time drops to ~3.8 secs. So it's 0.8 secs slower than chlorblast but for a bigger bang. Chloroblast isn't affected by focus items, because it's at 3 secs already.<br />
<br />
Add in a manasaver focus item and your sup heals cost only 225 mana. Factoring in mana savings from specialization which will give you a saving of 11% so mana cost is 200. Deduct another 10% if you have spell casting mastery at 3, making it 180 mana.<br />
<br />
So 10% of the time you are getting an instant torpor, and all the time, you are getting half a torpor.<br />
<br />
Not bad all up. But, get torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Aktunka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I say you should still get canni 5, even though you dont have torpor. You can always tell the cleric you are canniing and they can toss a heal on you. Canni 5 is that good, its better than good, its great. Just keep in mind that you WILL get torpor eventually, and when you do, you will seriously be wishing you had that canni 5 ready to roll right from the start. From the limited number of AA points you have now, it looks as though exp grinding isn't your thing, so I would highly recommend that you do the 5 points now, that way when you get torpor you wont feel the pressure to grind out those next 5 points for canni 5 then. <br />
<br />
On a side note, if i were you I would grab a couple people every time guardian wurms are up in skyfire and wipe them out. Also, during non raid time go down and farm chottal and protector and tolapumj. At least those places are doable with a single group if you dont feel right asking for a VP capable force to go farm spells in VP. <br />
<br />
As a third thing, MGB is much better than I ever anticipated. I disagree with Jing on that one hehe. It is very nice to have the raid buffed and ready to go in like 18 seconds after a wipeout. Everyone ressed, hit canni 5, hit MGB, cast khuras, and the raid is ready to start moving again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">if I was in your shoes I would look at healing gift and spell casting mastery.<br />
<br />
Without Torpor you are healing a lot with chloroblast, I can only assume.  I have torpor but I use chloroblast the majority of the time for healing my group anyway.  Healing gift saves mana, makes pretty crits and saves my ass and the asses of others from times to time hehe.  Like last night when I went to meet some people in HS to do Drusella, I trained in to them.  Busted out tirgirs, then took 2 HTs and an icecomet for full damage with only my selfbuffs.  With them all beating on me, I got down to 94hp when a channeled a chloroblast on myself for 856.  yay!<br />
<br />
Spell casting mastery.   I don't have it personally, but since you lack the massive mana regen ability of not only torpor, but the canni5/torpor combo.. well it seems mana savings would be a sensible way to go.<br />
<br />
Best of luck with your choice and getting your torpor.<br />

And to Jukax, I hope you soon get torpor, have seen you soloing in fungus grove. Try join some of the Veeshan Peak raids that some MB wizards use to set up. I know that for like a month ago, torpor dropped and a Warrior won it. Torpor dropped for me from a Guardian Wurm in skyfire after we had taken out Ixiblat feer.<br />

I do agree with Jing about everyone dying and not getting the full benefit of the spells duration but those folks really don't count.  It's about you and what you have to work with.  With SCRM your REGROWTH will be lasting longer which I always had up with my fungi equipped till I got Torpor which I'm sure you do as well.  My 2 cents is all.  Also, with that mana pts, get Can V as well before you spend the pts on something else and find yourself short when Torpor falls into your lap.<br />

According to tests posted on Graffe'shere (http://pub23.ezboard.com/fgraffeswizardcompilationfrm28.showMessage?topicID=23.topic), Spell Casting Mastery is a flat reduction of 2%, 5%, 10% per level.<br />
<br />
Where's this 30% number pulled from?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'm so glad I took you off my ignore list Targar, you're so funny!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Mudcrush Durtfeet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">You NEEEED torpor.   Go to os and camp emperor chottal or prot/jumpy until you get it.   Camp it with friends who will let you use it.   That's VASTLY more important than any aa skill.<br />
<br />
   After you get torpor...<br />
<br />
   Get Can V first, then get qb3, scm3, scr3, scrm in no particular order.<br />
<br />
   At least get healing adept and gift level 1.<br />
<br />
   Afterwards, you might as well max spell casting fury 3 as you get more damage per aa at level 3 than level 2 or 1 (in for a penny, in for a pound).<br />
<br />
   If your raids usually have a shaman with AE buff then you don't need it yourself (yet).  If not, then you do.<br />
<br />
   Finish maxxing out HA and HG.<br />
<br />
   Get other skills after these.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">If I didnt have torpor I'd go for AAs that improve healing. Once I could get a nice fat heal off I'd go for cann5. <br />
<br />
If MGB isnt needed because others you raid with have it then I'd go for mana reduction skills (probably more sensible for this one next, make healing yourself up after cann5 more efficient) and then channeling focus. I really wanted channeling focus by now but skills to get longer/faster torpor seemed to make more sense to get first as a torpor caster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Buy Can V.  Torpor will make things better, but you'll still want it now.  MGB is a waste of time.  What're you gonna do, hit the entire raid with Focus?  That would be entertaining, to hear all the level 60 clerics and chanters cursing your name, but hardly useful.  It also takes a long time to reset, so you have to wait for them all to curse your name again.  <br />
<br />
Too bad Verant didn't make a group Avatar, 'cause THAT would make MGB worth it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">&gt;What're you gonna do, hit the entire raid with Focus?<br />
<br />
Yes, thats kinda the whole point of it. There are plenty of times when HP &gt; mana regen/MR. <br />
<br />
I've been on plently raids that have lasted over an hour and plenty where theres been wipe outs or we've needed to get ready quickly. It also counts down in real time, not game time.<br />
<br />
Sure, dont get MGB if its not useful to you and your situation, don't dismiss it because someones said it's pointless - it is not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Like I said, the Clerics and Chanters would  NOT like being in the Focus Bombing zone.  It also seems kinda pointless, spending those kind of points on a spell that you cast only during raids, once every couple of hours and only if the other Shammy's on the raid haven't cast it first.<br />
<br />
BTW, if you piss off all the clerics by focusing them, try to NOT die afterwards :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Jing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">I agree that clerics generally are not keen on me Focusing their groups, but they live with it and just cast Blessed Armor after I do it. They don't curse at me :). Casters on the other hand even sometimes ask for Focus if the coming fight requires HP and not MR or AC. It all depends on the fight. I would say that most raids do not require MR, and even if they do, MR is easy to raise with gear alone, so not having Shielding up is no big loss.<br />
<br />
While I do think that MGB is a waste, I don't think it's because casters and clerics dislike focus cancelling their self buffs. I just think I can buff a raid plenty fast except in the rare situation where the mob will despawn soon (we've never fought Cursed, so Avatar is the only mob we have this problem with).<br />
<br />
It all depends on your raid style. If you have a few shamans all with Khura's, then you can almost definetely buff the raid and med to full before your MGB cleric is FM. That's the situation I'm in, and is why I won't get MGB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">MGB is a raid tool. Most chanters on high level raids are not mezzing because everything is unmezzable, the reason chanters have high MR growing up is to resist their own AE mezs, if they're not mezzing theres no need to self buff MR with arch shielding. They are recanting, tashing and they're getting hit by AEs. They want HP to survive, arch shielding is +150 HP +20MR and a little ac, compare that to +430 HP of khuras.<br />
<br />
Some clerics want HPs because they too are getting hit by AEs or getting smacked on by mobs that don't appreciate CHs landing or they're using mod rods to regain mana. BAoTR is +225 HP, compare again to +430 of Khuras. Costs a cleric less mana than a Divine Light to recast BAoTR if they dont want focus. The biggest complaint about focus stacking I saw was not noticing focus had overwritten due to the icons. That should only effect people not using the new UI now.<br />
<br />
Even the most reticent clerics and chanters I know now actively look to be focused these days. Chanters start to worry less about MR and CHA at level 60 and go for HPs. Clerics more and more follow the shaman thinking, they get their mana and AC to a comfortable level and then go for HPs, their defensive abilities are limited, its more about durability than avoidance. <br />
<br />
MGBs usefulness to an shaman in terms of point spend is entirely personal and situational but saying don't get it because clerics and chanters don't like it is rather misleading.</div></div><hr />

Why not? The stuff your doing (vellious and low in luclin) isnt that much of a step above kunark dragons.  Mid day 20 person kunark dragon raids could net your some spells, and somone in your guild might want the items.</div></div><hr />

Getting big mobs in EQ is all about fast mobilization and MGB gets the job done like nothing else. Its so much easier and faster to MGB a raid than having to wait for groups to form up. <br />
<br />
And if you get a wipe the next shaman uses MGB to get the raid going again.<br />
<br />
But I guess if you have 5 MGB shaman ready to go every raid you probably dont need it.<br />

<br />
I actually decided to branch out and go against all the advice I received from the shaman community while I was XP'ing waiting for torpor however, and raised spell casting mastery to level 2. This was before Natural Durability and Combat Stability were implemented for shamans however, or else I would have spent my points on them. Since I have acquired torpor though, I'm well on my way to massive cannibalization - 3 and a half more points to go!<br />
<br />
As a side note; I've noticed a small difference in fizzle rate by having spell casting mastery 2. I haven't parsed it, but I do believe that there is a difference. So for any of you shamans with tons of AA points looking for something worthwhile to spend them on next, SCM is worthwhile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Beemine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">um... so why do ND and CS matter? ND1 gave me a whopping 31 hp or so! yay! not... and really SCM seems far more important to me since I cast LOTS and tank... not much. CA might be useful. and ND if I don't get anymore hp/sta gear. but if you usually group with any hp buffing classes you don't need the ND.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you have 24axp and don't have torpor then you have no idea how to get it.  *hint* you don't need a raid.<br />
<br />
Spend your axp time in sebilis crypt and trak lair.  Emp, prot, and jumpy can drop it.<br />
<br />
Spend your axp time in skyfire.  Any 60's in that zone; AW, guardian wurm, etc can drop it.<br />
<br />
Honest truth a 60 shaman without Malo and Torpor is a cripple.  And having 24axp on top of that is a crime.<br />

This is true. And that is the true crime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">There is a shaman in my guild who never finished his epic until he had 9 AAxp points.  THAT is a crime.  He had so many excuses too it was amazingly funny!  Fact was, he didnt' even know what was involved with finishing his epic and was too lazy to find out.  <br />
<br />
Methinks we might have someone in similar clown shoes here.  I can understand some bad luck, but good god . . 24 AA points and you still aren't trying for it?  <br />
<br />
I'd be perma camped in the crypt camping the emp's happy ass until he coughed it up!  <br />
<br />
Or I'd do my VP key quest and put a group of people with their keys together for a farming expedition or two!  Torpor drops like mad in that zone.  <br />
<br />
Or I'd petition for my guild to kill Sontalak on a regular basis so we could see some Torpor drops!  Or I'd be getting friends from the guild to come help me with a kunark dragon or two.  Talendor is often left up since he can be difficult for mid-50's to kill, and is an EXCELLENT source of shaman spells!  I got Malo off him, and in the same kill he also dropped Torpor!  The other shaman on the raid decided he wanted Torpor and I took Malo.  I got Torpor later off a lvl 58 jugg in sebilis.  Yes they exist and yes they drop it.  With the new exp increase in such mobs, you should be able to convince a group of your uber guildies to come do juggs with you.  Trak's Lair is a damn fine camp!  And if you have a decent FD puller, not hard at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">Five to eight shamans at a time? Damn, that's a lotta shamans! <br />
<br />
Lol and looks about guilty-like.<br />
<br />
MGB is situational.  Anything situational means it's often not useful.  Only reason to do it is when it IS useful.<br />
<br />
Your guild has plenty of shamans on all the time, so MGB isn't that good.  But when there are only a couple online, it suddenly can become good.  But mostly after a wipe-out.  It's a wipe-out spell more than anything.<br />
<br />
Since wipe-outs happen, it's worth getting whether you want to get it or are proud of having it or not.  <br />
<br />
Jing is godly, but a little self-justifying in putting MGB down.  As he was before he got it in the first place.  In for a penny, in for a pound, as someone else said above regarding something else.<br />
<br />
I found MGB handy here and there.  I may have been the first guy to get it on his server.  And I found it truly sucked having to put in the points to get it,  considering how limited its use was.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, that doesn't mean it has no use.  Just that it sucks spending the huge amount of time necessary to get that shot at putting it to use one day.<br />
<br />
If you're serious about getting ready fast after a wipe-out, though, it sure as heck couldn't hurt.</div></div><hr />
