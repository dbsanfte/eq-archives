<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>celebel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">does the 'extended affliction III' of the coldain military wrisguard affects the shaman epic?<br />
<br />
I didn't see any 'sparkle' message...?<br />
<br />
Can someone confirm/infirm it does not work or explain why?<br />
Not sure, but I think the condition was that the dot had to stay on more than 36 sec and I thought our epic does.<br />
<br />
Was that intended or a bug?<br />
<br />
Are items with casting capability affected by focus? (I think so)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No, it doesn't.  It's my experience that the focus items don't effect any right click item (Although some people have stated that the extended range focus effect works on right click items (JBB, epic), I dont have an extended range item so I can't confirm).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>MojoTroll</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Nope - none of the Focus items will work with Clicky items - been shown through repeated testing - at one point shortly after they were introduced they did work on SOME click-items - most noteably one of the Wizard nuke robes I think it was - but Verant changed that REAL fast.<br />
<br />
So no - it will not work with our Epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">focus effects will however work with procs, such as the 7th cudgel effect, and the REIF.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gormadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">AoI works on our epic clicky boots.. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Zephyr of Brell (8th shawl) works just fine on my BP (Riotous Health).<br />
<br />
The CMW can't work on the epic because it's an increasing DoT, and a 20% extension to the DoT would theoretically add more than 20% damage -- more like 30%.</div></div><hr />
