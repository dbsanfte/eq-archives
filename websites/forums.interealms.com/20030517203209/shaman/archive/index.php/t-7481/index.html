<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slowbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been reading the posts in these threads and see a common theme for a lot of gear selection posts.  I am seeing folks happy to give up 7wis rings for the 6 65 rings and giving up 5wis earrings for HP earrings.   <br />
<br />
I think I understand that when you have Canni and a very efficient heal you use it as a mana pool but why else would you do it?  I am ready to give up my rings but I am nervous about losing 14WIS when I am right around 190 right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Quanit Icebear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well there in lies the problem/solution.<br />
<br />
Lots of folks here preach the AC/HP route, and some preach the Wis/Mana route.<br />
<br />
Pick what you do best, and go with it.  Everyone plays their shaman different, so figure out how you play yours, and equip him accordingly.<br />
<br />
I for one don't really buy the AC/HP thinking, but I 2 box most the time with my warrior, so I rarely get hit.<br />
<br />
Shaman are so versitle that they can be played 3-4 different ways, so don't worry much about what shaman_01 is doing, just decide if YOU are willing to give up wis/mana for HP/AC.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Podunk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">HP's vs Wisdom seems to be a common thing faced by shaman that is true.  I got upto 200 and starting looking specifically for HP gear because with KEI i was capping out at 255 and i figured i was GTG from their, plus i have canny 5 and the HPs are really nice to have so you dont commit suicide.  But its totally preference because shaman are very veritile as stated above and its totally upto you what you wish to do.  Hp's are nice to have but if you are soloing wisdom is far greater for you because you can Dot more but it depends totally on how you play and what you are doing as to what gear you wish to use.  Plus you can always swap it depending on the situation aswell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask yourself this...<br />
<br />
Do you tend to Die before you Run oom in groups/raids as Slower or do you run oom before you Die.<br />
<br />
If your dying with mana to spare then you need some more AC/HP.  If you are running oom faster than you can canni it back then get more wis/mana items.<br />
<br />
In raids i used to go to, I would go from secondary slower to main slower because while main slower had 100 wis more than I did, they got raped by mobs.  My wis was a piddly 160 but I survuived long enough to use the mana.<br />
<br />
Mana is of little use if your dead before you can use it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slowbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thanks for the responses.  I am often the main slower as our 60-something main slower has not had much play time of late.  Due to having such a low level versus most of the mobs we are going up against I am sure I get more resists.  The more resists I get the more agro I get as I have to cast it a second time to get it to stick.<br />
<br />
I am not having any problems running out of mana or getting smacked down on raids (thank you KEI) but I often question if I am as efficient as I can be.  I have been slowly working on AC at the cost of WIS.  Got my AC up to mid-900s with raid buffs but when soloing I feel like I am a gimp with only 190ish WIS.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your responses.  I will submit a magelo profile eventually for your amusement =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Wisdom and mana items do not let you cast more spells over the long run. I know your gonna have to stop and think about that abit but it is true. If bob has 3k mana and john has 4k mana john can cast 1k worth of spells more and then they are both oom and have to med up.<br />
<br />
The thing that becomes important is not how big your mana pool is but how fast you regen it.<br />
<br />
Think of it this way. You mana is water and the amount of mana you have max is a bucket. Sure a 10 gallon drum is better than a 8 gallon container but I'd much rather have the one filled up with a fire hose than the one filled up with a garden hose when i'm putting out a fire.<br />
<br />
For a shaman we can convert hps into mana. We can regen hps back naturally and we can augment that with spells and items too. This essentially alows use to increase our mana regen by using hps regen.<br />
<br />
Hps and ac protect that ability to convert hps into mana. The less dmg you take when you get aggro and more hps you have the more you can convert into mana.<br />
<br />
Now there are some times when mana pool can be important but if you regularly go from fm to oom with out a chance to med then your probably fighting something too tough.<br />
<br />
Hps become especially important when you get to 59+ and can get the cann aa skill that converts 1924hps into mana in one big hunk. Thats alot easier and safer if you have more hps.<br />
<br />
Everyone has to find thier own balance point for where they are comfortable. One thing you might consider is a shadel bandit ring instead of a velium fire opal. Adds almost as much hps and a descent amount of mana along with some resists too.<br />
<br />
There are other common peices that provide good hps and wis/mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I found out that at level 58 manapool becomes pretty much a non-issue.  You get Can4 and kragg's mending to regen about 600 mana a minute.  As long as you have about 180 - 200 wis you will in all likelyhood never run out of mana but in the most extreme situations (the trials in PoJ come to mind). And for those moments you can keep your wisdom outfit around, and go in with 255 wis buffed, if you can afford to drop the AC/HP.  I usually only run out of mana if I get lots of resisted slows, and then I definitely want all the AC/HP anyway, since some rather angry mobs are pummeling me into the ground.<br />
My goal right now is to get to 2000 HP/1000 AC /200 wis unbuffed, so far I can only make 2 of the three at the time at 58, should work at 60 with identical equipment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cazec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I' agree with Taraddar... i think he means that the more HP you have, the more mana you have actually, because the more hp=more mana because you can canni more  : )<br />
Think Taraddar really nailed it<br />
