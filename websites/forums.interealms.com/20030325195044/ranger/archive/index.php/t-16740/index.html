<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jatran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to try to make a run from WL to WW thru Skyshrine, Cobalt Scar and Sirens Grotto.  I have a couple questions.<br />
<br />
1) Is the key still needed to get into CS?  I have seen a lot of conflicting info on this.<br />
<br />
2) I have done zero regarding factioning. I'm a  half-elf, Tunare ranger.  Can I just camo up and make a run for thru these zones?  Anything in particular to lookout for?<br />
<br />
To get out, I'll use a Thurg gate potion.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">While I cannot answer all of those questions (having never made the run through SG myself) I can tell you that while Camo will get you to the portal from SS to CS, if it goes down you're probably screwed.<br />
<br />
I got lucky one day and a group that was killing in SS let me loot the key.  I do not know if its still needed; but I do know its soulbound.<br />
<br />
Inside CS itself, the othmir will probably not be KoS to you.  The wyverns, and then the sirens will be (sirens KoS to everyone).  Camo is your friend there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kalvarian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You still need the shine key to zone out of SS into CS.  You don't however need the CS tooth trinket to be ported to CS anymore.  So don't bother running just grab a druid and camo up before he ports you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klegore</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I don't think you need the shrine key anymore since I did a quest turn in the other day for some skyshrine armor and was able to port from SS to CS just by clicking on the fountain.  So I think they may have removed the need for the key with the skyshrine patch this past year.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jannelle Silverthorne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Shrine key goes on your Keyring first time you zone out from Skyshrine to Cobalt Scar. Probably just need to have it instead of clicking it on the statue now.<br />
<br />
Sirens Grotto run is easy once you've learned the path. If the seahorses do spot you, just keep going since they can't follow you over the waterfall.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grimmy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You don't need the key.  I don't have the key and can zone to CS just fine.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>entilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">question about keys.<br />
<br />
is the keyring function operational and do all idols/keys work on it?  i was on my way to seb last night when i noticed i took the wrong idol and so had to inconvenience the group and head back to the bank.  would rather remove it from inventory and keep it on a keyring but i remember warnings saying not to do this as there were bugs with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Karloss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">/key works but not for all keys.<br />
<br />
Seb key can be used once and disgarded, same for ToFs keys but hole key (for example) you always need to keep - bah</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sirul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Latest patch now has fixed the bug that was allowing passage from SS to CS without the key.  The key is now required once again.  Just find Sentry Enots for quest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>LatemYvaeh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The Skyshrine key will add to your key ring but you do need the Key to leave SS but not to get into it.<br />
You do not need the tooth to port into CS any more as stated<br />
Easiest to get a port or TL to CS and then run to WW from there</div></div><hr />
