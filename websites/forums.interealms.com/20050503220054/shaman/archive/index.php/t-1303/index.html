<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am a L22 shaman.  Some of you have kindly told me that I can hunt with my level 31 friend, who is a monk. Mainly, he would fight, and I would likely buff/heal as I doubt I can hit the mobs, although I might try to get a disempower or walking sleep on them. <br />
<br />
Mainly, my question is what buffs should I keep active on the monk at all times? <br />
<br />
Obviously, SOW. I assume spirit of cat.  <br />
Other ones I think might be helpful are:<br />
spirit strength? (Increase damage)<br />
turtle skin? (Increase AC)<br />
Feet like cat? (stacks with spirit of cat)<br />
Dexterous Aura? (increase AC)<br />
<br />
Are all of these useful and needed, or should I just focus on the two spirit spells?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep up:<br />
<br />
SoW (escape, pulling)<br />
<br />
Spirit Strength- will increase max damage a bit<br />
<br />
Spirit of Cat (will not stack with Feet like cat) - will increase AC a smidgen<br />
<br />
Spirit of Bear - will increase HP a smidgen<br />
<br />
Turtle skin (increase AC)<br />
<br />
Inner fire (increase AC)<br />
-------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Keep root up for runners or adds (you can root-park them, then maybe drop an Affliction if they are going to be parked awhile.)<br />
<br />
I'd also keep a nuke up in case things go bad.<br />
<br />
Mostly, though, you'll be slowing and healing (and disempowering if you have the mana.)  Don't cast Affliction on any mob he's on (as it is not likely to live log enough for it to do much damage), ubt feel free to toss in a tainted breath if you have the mana (only takes 42 seconds to work.)<br />
<br />
Good luck!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Scurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep all buffs on the monkey, every little bit help and it makes him feel good. :)<br />
<br />
Slow the mobs as incoming and cast the occasional dot if you have mana to spare, just make sure you keep the monkey healed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your most important buff is actually a debuff (slow).  But yes, <br />
<br />
1) Spirit of Wolf<br />
2) AC (especially if it gets them over a magical -00 threshold<br />
2a) Hitpoints<br />
4) Dex if they have a procing weapon<br />
<br />
When you get Regen that should probably move ahead of Dex imo.<br />
<br />
Have fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grotte</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If it does not get them over a x50 or x00 AC boundry I do not bother with any of the AC buffs on my tanks. Not worth the mana. I always keep str, sta, talisman, sow and quickness on them tho.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Your case is special, though, as for right now (with the level discrepancy between the two of you) it's unlikely you'll be able to land many offensive spells. With this in mind, I would drop just about every buff you have on the Monk: SoW, Spirit Strength, Spirit of the Cat (does not stack with Feet Like Cat), Turtle Skin, Spirit of the Bear, Inner Fire, and Dexterous Aura. You can also cast resist buffs on the Monk if it's relevant to the MOBs you're fighting, plus Serpent Sight if the Monk is a Human. During the fight, keep your Healing spell memmed in case things get ugly, but as much as possible try to heal the Monk by casting Inner Fire between med ticks, as Inner Fire has a better mana/HP ratio.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gwaihir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yeah, part of my question was that I figured I would not do much offensively, since there is such a discrepency in the creature levels.  I doubt I can land very many spells on the red mobs we would fight. So, my job is going to be mainly buffs/heals.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the replies!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Monks most of all make the most use of stats, moreso than any other class that I've seen so far. <br />
<br />
Keep em loaded with everything and you'll be amazed at the difference it can make.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Give them every buff you have.  My regular partner is a 51 monk, and I notice a huge difference in the amount of damage he takes between him having only HoS, and him having every buff I can lay down on him.  Lots of monks may not know exactly how much butt they whoop when they have full shammy buffs, and only ask for haste and harness.  Don't listen to them.  Give them everything :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">22 and 31 are very far apart.  You probably will get lousy experience.<br />
<br />
Your slows are not too good at that level.  <br />
<br />
Best thing is to just heal and melee, I would think, and keep buffs up.<br />
<br />
Luckily, you get cannibalize in two more levels, and that will help a lot.</div></div><hr />
