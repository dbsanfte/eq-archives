<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I killed 8 spwns at the nathlyns mansion yesterday, and i am guessing that katta ZEM is much lower than in HHK.  The exp per kill was hardly visible (<br />
<br />
HHK has really spoiled me for fast exp, and now at 55 i can see a decent zone to touch the exp i been seeing from 51 to 54.<br />
<br />
Soloing in POJ is a pain....guess i can hope that the new expansion has sone nice stuff....<br />
<br />
I have not tried the bank guards yet,  are they better exp ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
