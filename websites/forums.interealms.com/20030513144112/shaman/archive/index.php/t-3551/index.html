<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>pokeyjack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi I have 2 questions not totally addressed in the Previous MQ topic.<br />
<br />
1)  I just need someone to clarify exactly when I'm GTG when it come to True Spirit Faction.   So far, the message after I hand in Woe, Envy and Marrs is &quot;cannot possibly get any better&quot; , (thats after 11 turn ins) however, as I con wandering spirit I only con ally and I know that my epic buddies are conning MAX ALLY.  Do i need to keep going until Spirit cons max ally or am I were I need to be now?<br />
<br />
2)  After 5 failed attempts I finally got the Tear last night from fear.  Thus I no longer need to MQ the tear.  Can I skip to the tear turnin portion of the epic (in a sense MQ myself) now that I have met the criteria in (1), and thus avoid everything between killing Black Dire and Tear turn in. <br />
<br />
Am i making sense?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kamidari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's no con message for 'max ally' - it just says ally.   You just know you're maxxed because it says you can't get any better when you do a turn-in.  <br />
<br />
You should be fine to skip to the rak turn-in - I know someone who did just that recently, so I guess it still works.  I'll let someone else do the preaching about how easy it is, sense of accomplishment, and all that. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">why skip killing black dire<br />
<br />
u would be an idiot to not get the boots!!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well ok only thing I can say is if your to LAZY to do the whole quest, when so meny of us have done the whole thing. Then dont cry whine and petition when he eats your tear / scale. After all it will be your fualt for not doing the whole quest. Personly I would love to see VI rig it so that if you tried to turn in the scale with out haveing compleated each part (Maybe not in order I understand chanceing across part B befor getting part A) that everything you have done be erased and you have to start back at step one. If you want to try and cheat thats up to you.. But if you do and it dosent work you have NO right to be mad about it or bitch becuse after all it will be YOUR fualt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Frankly, for the levels these things can be done (by you and a group), the rewards are very good.  <br />
<br />
Falsehood's a nice shield at mid-upper 20s.  Boots are nice mid-upper 30s.<br />
<br />
Spear's nice at 50.<br />
<br />
If the quest's done as intended, you'll be getting xp the entire time, too.  I didn't find the quest boring at all.  Aside from the fact that it's too blasted easy to cheat through, this quest is perhaps the best designed of them all.   I just wish everything was triggered by a nodrop piece from the step before.<br />
<br />
It's epic:  you start it early and continue doing pieces as you progress in your power.  Too many of the epic quests require a huge number of 50+ people to do some steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Shandy - I agree. The shaman quest feels truly epic, I did mine over about 20 levels :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Silvergun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All ethics of the turnins aside,<br />
<br />
I agree about the boots, as a minimum.  You can't skip the boots, they're far too useful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well if you've maxed your true spirit faction already, you can go kill Black Dire to get your boots whenever you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>pokeyjack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">For you morons out there, read to message.. I killed Black Dire... thus the &quot;between black dire and tear turnin&quot; statement.  Secondly, I did not ask an ethical question I asked it it was possible.  Stick to the questions asked and some of you won't look like morions.<br />
Pokeyjack</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">You said you were avoiding everything between killing Black Dire and the tear turn in.  As turning in Black Dire's pelt is between killing him and turning in the tear, I can see where they got confused.<br />
<br />
Anybody that asks a question like yours is gonna get the same reaction from folks.  Hell, Pokeyjack, they were really mild on you.<br />
<br />
Since you decided to make your very second post a flame, rather than thank Kamidari for his help, however, I'm afraid you may have just fallen into the &quot;morion&quot; category yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Heelah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">WTB manners and a spellchecker....sent tells to pokeyjack<br />
;D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Lets see here......<br />
<br />
Can I skip to the tear turnin portion of the epic (in a sense MQ myself) now that I have met the criteria in (1), and thus avoid everything between killing Black Dire and Tear turn in. <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone eals see the words &quot;Can I skip&quot; here?<br />
Or how about &quot;And thus avoid everything between&quot; ?<br />
<br />
Has I reread this there is no doubt to me anyway that your intent was to &quot;Skip&quot; parts of the quest when you posted. There is an old saying &quot;Say what you mean and mean what you say&quot;. My personal probllem with people that try to skip parts, or cheat on epic. Is that if what ever they try fails they run back to the MB's and bitch about it. And in the end they post a lot of crap about how the quest and VI are screewed up.<br />
<br />
On a side note another good idea to stop all of this would be to have to turn in the Scale, Boot's, and sheild to get the Spear. You would get the boot's, and shelid back along with the Spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I agree, but to make this complete, there should be some sort of a reward given out after completing Neh'Ashiir's diary.  A helm or bracer or some such.  One more incentive for doing the Hole, and one final piece (this would make 4: scale, boots, shield, new thing) for the Spear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought they added a stealth faction change to the epic quest so that it could no longer be skipped by just doing envy &amp; woe over and over to max ally.  My guess is that you are going to have to /petition and ask the GM to reset your faction to zero and start all over.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jowjo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I did Woe/Envy on Tues. July 30th for the 2nd time, and got NO faction hit.<br />
<br />
That is :<br />
<br />
I did the while quest up to the Hole (have the icon, have not done the hole icon turn in yet), had an extra woe and envy in the bank ... hand to the wandering spirit ... no faction hit.<br />
<br />
Sounds like faction skipping, at least with Woe and Envy has been nerfed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>nomanaz_VZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I jus did turned woe, envy and marr's promise to the wandering spirit in wkarana and....<br />
<br />
the trumpets sounded! I got some more true spirit faction hit.;)</div></div><hr />
