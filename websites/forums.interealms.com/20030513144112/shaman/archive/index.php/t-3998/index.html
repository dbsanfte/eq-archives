<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ralon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello, oh wise Shamans.  I just recently created a Vah SHir shaman without first researching on these boards...stupid stupid stupid!!!  Needless to say, I'd end up one of the dreaded 600AC 200+ WIS shamans that apparently works out very poorly.  As such, I'd like to convert my WIS gear over to AC/HP gear, but I have no idea what pieces to convert, how much of my WIS to sacrifice and how much to keep, etc.  Here's a link to my Magelo...berate, batter, and even suggest away!<br />

My Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=325323) <br />

Thanks very much for any help that can be provided in shaping my poor kitty into a functioning member of society!<br />

Sentry Bracer and Chipped Bone bracelet(CBB is mostly for its focus effect :))  Long term goal would be a JBB instead of CBB, cause once you have a JBB, the need to cut down mana costs on dots and the like is gone, cause JBB takes care of the damage part.<br />
<br />
JB Arms, JB Helm..<br />
<br />
Unless i missed something that should do it...<br />
<br />
Quite frankly, your gear is quite good...wis is not the devil, quite the opposite really.  Its not as important as HP, or AC, but its nice to have.  Just remember to max your Defense, and you'll have an extra 500 something AC onto that quickly.  <br />
<br />
Oh yeah...SBS is also a great sheild.<br />
<br />
These suggestions should add some good AC quickly, and inexpensively.  Hp is more important the AC too...so get that when possible.  I would also suggest investing in a 2hb, and get that skill up too.  You'll be happy you did when you hit 19-24, and thats the only thing that will get you through solo(or just go to paludal and group, thats easierreally...people have done 25-26 in an hour there)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">try and replace anything that has more Wis than AC with a different item.  so consider new items for:<br />
<br />
Head<br />
Ring<br />
both wrists<br />
shoulders<br />
<br />
Honestly, you've got better gear at 5 than I had at 40<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I prefer to keep my Wis right around 150, some prefer more, some prefer less.</div></div><hr />
