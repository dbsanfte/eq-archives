<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How come no one mentions this place? A Ton of mobs, no loot. I'm a 41 Shammy, midly twinked. Got a fungi and about 850 ac at 41. No other major twinkage. No horsie, no jbb. I make sure I have Kei.<br />
<br />
I make 1% per kill, sometimes 2% solo. Bring your own group if you intend to group. I'm killing the stuff on the Twilight side, Grey side is tougher, and the platue is tougher yet.<br />
<br />
I pull with slow, sic pet, disease dot, poison dot, go in and melee, cani while im meleeing (stuff swings really slow when slowed) to 50% mana, mob dies, pull again.<br />
<br />
Have fun :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>narcolypt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No one has mentioned it probably because it is a pain in the butt to get too. Its is just like verant they add a bunch of new zones for people of the 35-50 levels and then make half of those a real pain to get to for that level person. Maybe I am wrong about this? anyone know a good way to get there quickly?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>oomba</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you have a friendly druid there is now a port to Twilight Sea, next zone over...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Flargly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You must be joking. Its faster to get from the bazaar to Sd than to Maidens Eye.<br />
<br />
You need to run through 3 extremely short zones, all zones less than a minute run.<br />
<br />
You go bazaar-&gt;SH-&gt;echo caverns-&gt;Fungus Grove-&gt;TS-&gt;SD<br />
<br />
The long part of the run is the TS to SD and even that is only a minute. Echo caverns is a 30 second run, and Fungus Grove is under a minute. Just because its a bunch of zones away doesnt mean its not a fast run :P<br />
<br />
Oh, and btw, nothing see through invs in FG so its perfectly safe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Eriadoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Random shrooms see through invis in FG, but shrooms are pretty easily avoided.  Just FYI</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Miserable</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Scarlet desert is indeed a hidden gem. I was bored out of my mind the other night, so I went a-wandering. Tried a few mobs in Mons Letalis, but for some reason I lag like crazy there so I moved on. After an enormous train through the Grey, I reached SD and set up shop near the Twilight Zone.<br />
<br />
At 42 I was making at least 1-2% per kill, and the kills were faaast. The cheetahs have very few HP, and all the mobs there are pussies after they've been slowed.<br />
<br />
Best part about it - the zone is usually empty save a few people camping shards or running through to the Grey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>xoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I'm 41 also, Just went here the other night. Why does no one go here? It's excellent! The mobs stand far apart from each other so single pulls are relativley easy. They don't resist. I get 1%-2% per kill.<br />
<br />
It's not hard to get to at all. I throw on invis and walk through fungus grove. I've done it no less than 20 times. I used to hunt in Twillight Sea for awhile. But Scarlet Desert is so close, I'd rather hunt there.<br />
<br />
I will say this:<br />
An the little aliens, my Scourge drops them about 1% HP per tick.<br />
My Posion drops them about 8% per tick.<br />
I usually have to re-apply my poison at least once.<br />
And root tends to break at least once. But...<br />
I can stand on one side of a ravine and still have enough range to dot and re-root safely. (FYI)<br />
<br />
PS: Stay away from the Sun Revenants. They have some DOT curse that blows through my 800+ HP fast. Keep 'em rooted and you'll be fine. But if they touch you, you've got problems. (Unless you don't mind using up your mana healing yourself).<br />
<br />
But the zone is nice. Under-used and plenty to hunt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Tried this and wasn't impressed, although I don't have a fungi tunic.  Mobs hit for about 90 max and seem to have around 3k hp, fairly tough for 1% per kill imo.  Also is a pain to get here, although I do zone slowly, especially on the moon.  Magelo in sig if you're curious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I tried a comparison of Scarlet Desert and Echo Caverns last night. I am level 42, fairly nice gear, and had KEI.<br />
<br />
Echo Caverns - spawns either too slow (corridor), too many (back room, and Fireclaw is a pain) or too camped (TM). Mobs are generally very soft, and worth a little over 1% per kill at 42.<br />
<br />
Scarlet Desert - spawns are plentiful, you can single pull a variety of creatures. But they are MUCH tougher, take longer to kill (more mana), and do more damage by far. And they are still only worth a little over 1% per kill at 42. However, I imagine that this stays as good xp all the way up to 50 and maybe beyond. No loot though!<br />
<br />
Very annoying that two recommended zones both have such flaws...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Huth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I found that about SD, the mobs are way to hard for the XP gained and as you say the loot stinks. I have started grouping in DL and with a full group i can make 50% of a level in 2.5hrs @ 41 ...not too bad and it's safer :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Lovadia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">SD may be a bit hard at 41, can remembe exactly when I started there.  I did most of the 40's in SD.  I am level 50 and am still hunting there since I get about 2% for 3-4 mobs...and easy mobs at that.  I will start moving up the plateau to hit the sun revenant camp.  To date this is my favourite soloing zone.<br />
<br />
Cheers,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sorell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">From up on the plateou, can they be single pulled? I have done a lot of hunting in SD but have not been up there yet check it out. I guess I am afraid of running up the edge, cresting the top and WHAM getting jumped. I remember getting hit like that with sceptors on their island in OOT heh.<br />
<br />
I am 50, can I single pull from the Plateou? I can 2-box a 52 DRU but that is getting old and I want a break from it...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I wonder why you guys say the loot sucks?  When I hunted there the loot was excellent, you just have to know what to look for.  And that is basically any mob that has a funny name.  If you have a druid or ranger friend take them with you and you'll see what I mean.  Great loot for levels 44-50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just the post I was looking for. I was wondering if SD was a good place to go. I'm not to concerned about loot at this time. as long as I can make enough to keep Kei and Aego going then i'm happy. I just want to grind till 46-47 so I can start hitting the plains and go on raids with guildies..</div></div><hr />
