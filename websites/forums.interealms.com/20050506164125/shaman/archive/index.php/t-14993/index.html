<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yesterday I quit EverQuest.<br />
<br />
Gave all my items to guildbank, and sacrificed myself from 62 to 45, so my guild could have the essence emeralds (200).<br />
<br />
/delete character, /end billing, /uninstall<br />
<br />
You will not control me anymore!<br />
<br />
Now I don't have to worry or give a crap about:<br />
-Game bugs<br />
-Clerics whining<br />
-Clerics outmeleeing me, the supposed Battle Priest<br />
-Beastlords boasting<br />
-Necros gloating about DOTs<br />
-Rangers outnuking me (both lvl 63, rangers nuke better than us)<br />
-Unobtainable spells<br />
-Raiding<br />
-Slow mitigation<br />
-Lowered durations on 61-65 spells<br />
-Depending on gear<br />
-Farming<br />
-Anything broken<br />
-My $12.95 a month<br />
<br />
I had a good time, got epic, malo, torpor, group acumen, pox, all those rare spells. Unfortunately it just wasn't fun anymore. And believe me, I'm not coming back.<br />
<br />
Now, the wait for WoW *grin*..anyone know any good online games I could play till then?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">In before you come back :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You'll be back. I said the same thing and I'm back again for the 3rd time sigh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You'll be back. I said the same thing and I'm back again for the 3rd time sigh.<br />
<br />
<br />
I left months ago and haven't been back at all. Hell I even quit posting here so often. Once you are tired of EQ, you are DONE with it. You can take a break, or you can quit. I quit. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No regrets!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I quit for 4 months once. Two years another time. Been playing on and off since day 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">if i deleted my shaman that would be it. i hae a 47 SK i could play, but no other class could pull me into EQ like a shaman can. Sitting LFG is something i have about 10 min tolerance for and shaman is really the only fully self reliant class worth playing. Necros are self reliant but it all replies on life taps from what i seen, its manilpulation of you ability with a necro, ou cant just cast a heal, you need to kill something to get like back.<br />
<br />
naa, nothing beats a shaman IMHO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Buy a tinkered stalking probe and a necro can tap. But I agree shaman/necro only two classes I've ever been able to play. I might be able to play a enchanter also but thats about it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Like racing sims?  Live for speed (www.liveforspeed.net) is fantastically good despite the horridly cheesy name.  Think Grand Prix Legends or Viper racing online and you have the idea.<br />
<br />
And for necro healing, can't beat Holgresh beads, unfortunately chances are you probably can't get them either, they fetch an amazing premium these days =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Keltsett</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Holgresh Beeds are a waste of money. 150k. If i go through 50k of stalking probes in my carrer I'll be shocked. After you sel lthem back to a vendor you only lose about 15pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Matey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Gave all my items to guildbank, and sacrificed myself from 62 to 45, so my guild could have the essence emeralds (200).Last time I checked, sacrificing doesn't work post 59.  What did you do, de-level yourself to 59 and then sacrifice?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fenora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">If I had a dollar for everytime I &quot;quit for good&quot; and then ended up coming back I would have um...er, $6.<br />
<br />
Dunno how good they still are but some oldies ya might wanna try are Anarchy Online, Dark Age of Camelot (ok, no so old but yanno) and Asheron's Call if yer looking for the same flavor of game as EQish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enjoy the break and see ya when ya get back  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Radag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">He sound certain that he will quite but consider<br />
<br />
a) he deleted his character.<br />
c) sacrificed his character.<br />
b) he un-installed the game.<br />
e) posted on this board.<br />
<br />
Such actions are those of a person that needs to burn the bridges in order to exercise self discipline.  I would think if you have the will power to quite, then it is of no import if you delete your character or un-installed the game.<br />
<br />
Safe Travels</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Bah I don't feel the need to second-guess him.<br />
<br />
Enjoy RL, Kialan, see you in some game someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>em2johns</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Nice ordering on your a,b,c,d there Radag!  <br />
Congrats on your deleting your char, moving on from the game.  Star Wars Galaxies is out, and pretty stable.  It reminds me of DragonRealms quite a bit with the hospitals, and teaching other folks your skills.  Lots of professions to choose though, huge game.  Still Sony though.</div></div><hr />
