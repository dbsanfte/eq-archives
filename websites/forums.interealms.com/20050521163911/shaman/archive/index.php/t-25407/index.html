<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i bought last sunday the last lvl of healing boon<br />
<br />
it seemed to me that it didn't work<br />
so i made a first test: a 3 minutes fight against a named in lair of trapped ones, i fired 4 Q in this fight + ancestral aid. At the end i parsed and saw no differences in the total hp healed by Q.<br />
<br />
<br />
So i made a real test this morning and parsed<br />
My rogues tanked a rat in Forgotten Halls for 13mins32 wich represents 135 tics.<br />
<br />
* regen:<br />
She has a regen of 33/tic wich healed her for a total of 4455hp (33*135)<br />
* direct heals:<br />
I made 2 direct heals for 2284 and 2516hp<br />
* Q heals!<br />
15 Q and each cast separated by at last 6 seconds after the last one faded<br />
* total defensive damage(parsed by YALP v2.4):<br />
58929hp<br />
* HPs at begening: 7038hp<br />
* HPs at the end of the 13mins32: 6684hp and the last Q was faded<br />
wich means 7038-6684=354hp left to heal to be full hp<br />
<br />
So Q healed: 58929-354-2284-2516-4455=49320hps in 15 casts<br />
<br />
49320/15=3288hps / Q<br />
<br />
With 70% extended duration my Q usualy goes between 7 and 8 tics of heal, so without HB3 the total hp healed would be between :<br />
2940hps &lt; Q &lt; 3360hps<br />
<br />
<br />
This AA is NOT working at all, it does NOTHING</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A better way to test this would be to remove your buff extension, so you always get 6 ticks on your heal over time.<br />
<br />
Edit: You have Eterninostrum, I never got 8 ticks on Quiescence until I got my Ring from Bertoxx in time (Chrononostrum). YMMV though. Like I said, it's best to remove any potential variables before conducting tests like this and swearing that something is broken.<br />
<br />
Also, 15 casts is nowhere near a large enough sample size to judge anything by. That's only around 100 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">without AA or focus u have 5 tics of heal<br />
with 50%EE AA and no focus u have between 6 and 7 tics(almost everytime 7 tics)<br />
with 70% total EE like me you have between 7 and 8 tics(but mostly 8 tics, i almost never saw 7 tics with Q)<br />
<br />
so what you propose wouldn't be more precise :(<br />
<br />
if the AA was working it would add something like +30% healing and the total healed would be around 4.5k-5k hp <br />
we are faaaar from it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There's a problem with your math, kinda<br />
my Q usualy goes between 7 and 8 tics of heal<br />
Healing boon gives you a chance to crit a heal tick.<br />
A crit is double the healing from a tick.<br />
If Q goes 7 ticks, and one of those ticks is a crit heal tick, then it will heal the same amount of damage as a Q that goes 8 ticks.<br />
You have shown no indication of whether Q went for 7 or 8 ticks for each cast.<br />
<br />
You have 2 unknown variables in your equation:<br />
It's impossible to solve for 2 unknowns with only 1 equation.<br />
x=number of heal crits<br />
y=the probability that Q went 8 ticks instead of 7<br />
Q heals 420 a tick, 840 on a crit<br />
Amount healed = 49320 = y 7 tick heals + (1-y) 8 tick heals + x crit heals<br />
49320 = 7 ticks * 420 hp/tick * 15 casts * y <br />
         + 8 ticks * 420 hp/tick * 15 casts * (1-y)<br />
         +  840 hp/tick * x ticks<br />
49320 = 44100y + 50400 * (1 - y) + 840x<br />
49320 = 44100y + 50400 - 50400y + 840x <br />
-1080 = -6300y + 840x<br />
630y = 108 + 84x<br />
<br />
<br />
Bottom line is, your parse is useless until you tell us how many of those Q went 8 ticks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ok guys...<br />
<br />
Q heals 8 tics 90% of the time ok? (see by yourself)<br />
<br />
so Q usualy heals 8*420 (and RARELY 7*420, but forget it)<br />
<br />
<br />
see by yourself, lose hp, cancel all regen buffs, cast Q and count<br />
with remaining time on buffs it's easy as hell, let the mouse on the buff icon and watch the jumps in your HPs, you will see :<br />
1 heal at 42s left<br />
1 heal at 36s left<br />
1 heal at 30s left<br />
1 heal at 24s left<br />
1 heal at 18s left<br />
1 heal at 12s left<br />
1 heal at 6s left<br />
1 heal at 0s left<br />
total : 8 tics, end of story<br />
<br />
test by yourself if u are are not curious enough to have sawn it already ;)<br />
<br />
i have Q at 70%EE for almost 6 months now and i almost always saw 8 tics oO</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">-a 70% extended Q doesn't last 42 seconds.<br />
-it should last 40.8 seconds, which means either 40 or 41 depending on how the rounding happens.<br />
if you cast your spell at time index 5 (seconds), the spell will get heal ticks at time index 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42<br />
if you cast your spell at time index 0, the spell will get heal ticks at time index 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36 (spell wears off at 40.8)<br />
that's a difference of a heal tick.<br />
but if your spell goes x ticks, and you get 1 heal crit, you'll think it went x + 1, because your calculations are ignorant of this vital piece of information, and thus your calculations are flawed.<br />
if you assume all of your casts goes x + 1 duration, and if the percentage of times you get x ticks is roughly the same percentage of the time you get heal crits, then you'd think that roughly every cast is going x + 1 ticks and that you aren't ever getting a heal crit, which is wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>SPangaloid</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i see my HP bar or the HP bars of others jump farther than normal many times with HB3, while using BoTrushar.<br />
<br />
no scientific data to show ya but HB3 works, in my experiance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">-a 70% extended Q doesn't last 42 seconds.<br />
i didn't say that, don't call me newb plz...<br />
<br />
-it should last 40.8 seconds, which means either 40 or 41 depending on how the rounding happens.<br />
yes but who cares?!<br />
we are talking about heal tics, i don't care about that<br />
<br />
<br />
just make the test by yourself<br />
i have Q at 70%EE for 6 months, do you read? 6 months!(it was way before HB even exists) and i always plays with my mouse over the Q spell buff icon(and i se the remaining time indicated: 42s, 36s...)<br />
the fact IS that i almost always have 8 jumps in my heals(see the hp bar)<br />
<br />
<br />
that's the FACT, test by yourself if you also have 70%EE(to convince everyone i will made a parse with only 50%EE tomorrow)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
even if Q was 7 tics, that's only 12% crit rate, that's a real small amount for 18AA(critic affliction is 27%crit rate for 18AA...), so we could consider it broken also<br />
<br />
but in fact HB3 adds 0% crits :(<br />
that's sooo sad</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">To add to the confusion err. discussion :).<br />
<br />
I made a rather small test with full Extension AAs, extended Blessing IV and Healing Boon 1 and *believe* i saw it working.<br />
<br />
I simply CANNI 5-ed and nuked myself down to like 2k health and then let Q with Healing Boon run, checking for high enough jumps in HP-numbers.<br />
<br />
That is what i saw as an example (no log sorry):<br />
<br />
start: 2.000 HP<br />
tick 1: 2.000 HP + 1 x 420<br />
tick 2: 2.000 HP + 2 x 420<br />
tick 3: 2.000 HP + 4 x 420(!!)<br />
tick 4: 2.000 HP + 5 x 420<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
(tick 1 = first tick after cast, when Q hits and HP number is increased with HoT-heal).<br />
<br />
All ticks were ticking at the expected 6 second mark with no major breaks or delays - no significant server lag or other issues, that could have influenced the result.<br />
<br />
Note that it is rather impossible, that tick 3 was a phantom tick or had something to do with server lag. The next tick is adding up on the expected number like there has been a crit in tick 3. If it would have been lag or something, the next tick wouldn't increase the HP-number imo (or increase it and immediately reduce to correct value again).<br />
<br />
From looking at the HP-number, it seemed like the number is updated twice - first with the 'normal' heal over time tick, immediately afterwards (a sec later, NOT 6 seconds) the number is refreshed again and crit heal over time is added to the value.<br />
<br />
The HP-number changed like that:<br />
<br />
start: 2.000 HP<br />
+6 secs: 2.000 HP + 1 x 420<br />
+12 secs: 2.000 HP + 2 x 420<br />
+18 secs: 2.000 HP + 3 x 420<br />
+19 secs: 2.000 HP + 4 x 420 (!!)<br />
+24 secs: 2.000 HP + 5 x 420<br />
and so on.<br />
<br />
I repeated that test a few times (6-7) and saw that behaviour several times (2-3) - that is hardly scientific proof i know. No variance in duration can explain, how i was able to get 5 ticks worth of heals during only 4 ticks of time. On top of that i had a variance from 7 up to 9(!) heals (not ticks, but raw amount of HPs healed with the Q), if that is any evidence.<br />
<br />
Let's do some more testing during the next LFG-pause to get some more data, i guess.<br />
<br />
if the AA was working it would add something like +30%<br />
<br />
I must admit, i have not the slightest idea how you come to that number. Was it published somewhere and i missed it or how do you calculate it? Afaik the direct heal crits -atleast the basic ones- are nowhere near that percentage and i always assumed SOE would design the HoT AA with a similar percentage - or even less, as they hate shaman ;).<br />
<br />
A last thought: if that AA is working correctly it should be possible to get 10 or even 11 or more heals from one HoT alone (when you get lucky and more than 1 tick is critting). Statistically less likely, but it should happen. Theoretically every single tick may crit, though the chances for that to happen are minimal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">even if Q was 7 tics, that's only 12% crit rate, that's a real small amount for 18AA(critic affliction is 27%crit rate for 18AA...), so we could consider it broken also<br />
BZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZT! WRONG!<br />
<br />
18 AAs into healing Gift 3 =  10% chance to crit<br />
Another 18 AAs towards Advanced Healing Gift 3 = 16% chance to crit.<br />
Yet a further 18 AAs into Healing Gift Mastery 3 = 22% Chance to crit heal.<br />
<br />
18 AAs into Critical Affliction 3 = 9% Chance to Crit<br />
A further 18 AAs into Improved Critical Affliction = 18% Chance to crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">yes but who cares?!<br />
we are talking about heal tics, i don't care about that<br />
I'll try to type in small words because you just do not get it.<br />
<br />
You admit that *not all* casts go 8 ticks.<br />
You admit that some go 7 ticks.<br />
You do not have any hard numbers to say how often this happens.<br />
You say in nondescript (that means not very exact) terms it happens sometimes/rarely/not very often/etc but you never say how often.<br />
<br />
Now, let's compare a 7 tick Q with 1 heal crit, and an 8 tick Q with no heal crit.<br />
Every crit is an extra 420 heal.<br />
Every tick is 420 heal.<br />
You cannot tell the difference between a 7 tick Q with 1 heal crit, and an 8 tick Q *solely* by the amount healed.<br />
<br />
Now here's the junior high math that seems to be escaping your grasp.<br />
You don't know how often you get 7 tick Qs.<br />
You don't know how often you get heal crits.<br />
You can't tell the difference between them.<br />
You *cannot* try to figure out how many heal crits you are getting when you leave the number of 7 ticks as an unknown.<br />
Very very basic algebra says you cannot solve for an unknown variable with only 1 algebraic expression when you have a second unknown variable in the exact same expression.<br />
Want an example?  Here:<br />
x + y = 1<br />
How much is x?<br />
You can't answer that.<br />
Want another example?  here:<br />
(healing by 7ticks) + (healing by 8ticks) + (healing by crits) = amount healed<br />
<br />
When, and *only* when you say how many 7 tick heals you got will your numbers be useful in any way at all.</div></div><hr />

only one out of 15 cast that is not &gt;42s<br />
<br />
<br />
and ... again... if it's not a proof to you, log on EQ and test by yourself, loose hp, cancel regens, Q yourself and watch the hp bar jumps<br />
do it 10 or 20 times and you almost everytime see 8 jumps</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">http://eqcleric.gameglow.com/forums/showthread.php?t=19714&amp;highlight=Boon<br />
<br />
here is a link to the cleric board with a very short discussion about healing boon.<br />
<br />
1. one poster assumes HB1 to be somewhere around 8-9 percent (careful, that was a very raw estimate based on a very short 'impression' of the AA)<br />
<br />
2. i couldn't find Bedalin's 30 percent-value somewhere  :( , i searched quite extensively. ( even if the first level is 9 percent, no guarantee the next steps will double and triple the effect)<br />
<br />
3. i am not halluzinating  :D - two other posters observed the crit being 2 separate increases one immediately after the other, not one big increase at tick time.<br />
<br />
Bedalin, i am not sure your direct linking between duration of spell (assuming the messages appear exactly at the same second, when the effect starts or stops) and number of ticks is accurate. A lot depends if you are able to hit the most server ticks during the spell duration, as HPs are only updated with ticks (the only reason, why Q has a variance in number of ticks to begin with, otherwise it would have a 'fix' duration tick-wise).<br />
<br />
So it is very well possible from my understanding, that you can heal more HPs with a 45 secs HoT than a 44 secs HoT (or other durations), when the former isn't always hitting the optimal number of server ticks.<br />
<br />
...and watch the hp bar jumps  do it 10 or 20 times <br />
<br />
Sucks, but it seems like the best way to test at the moment - just have to do it in a mostly lag-free zone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">It would be so much easier if they just had an emote or something like they do with all other crit heals.  Every time you get a crit tic, put up a &quot;Soandso executes a critical heal (820)&quot; or something simmilar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Balkamp</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">My first thought is &quot;what Juujuu said&quot;. I won't go there atm. Logging on now to see if there's any combination of filters I can turn OFF in order to get Physical, Actual, Numbers in a dialog box..... brb <br />
<br />
Test will be at 50% ext for clarity.<br />
<br />
*edit*<br />
<br />
That was intresting. No combination of filters could net me any quantifiable numbers. Will have to find some third party app. that detects them client-side before this can even be called a test. In lag-free Halas, it was even difficult to detect discernable tics of Q from my standing regen of 21.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">http://samanna.net/general/healing.shtml numbers accurate for Q, but not for SS due to focus degradation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Are we even sure that 42 seconds gets 8 ticks? people always talk about the &quot;Zero tick,&quot; but even if the spell lasts 42 seconds, it would have to sync up perfectly to get this so called &quot;Zero tick.&quot;<br />
<br />
42 divided by 6 = 7. That's 7 chunks of time into which ticks can fall into. If you think you're getting 8 ticks worth of healing per cast, chances are you're only getting 7 but one of 'em's a crit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">chances are you're only getting 7 but one of 'em's a crit.<br />
no because when u have the mouse on the Q spell icon buff u see the EXACT moment of the healing tic(see by yourself)<br />
and at this EXACT moment, precisely, you see an hp jump<br />
<br />
so you can't miss it<br />
<br />
and that way you can count them, i watched them during my 13mins test and never saw a single &quot;crit&quot; :( (neither a double jump nor a double heal)<br />
i count some of them and obtained 8 jumps, as usual(before HB)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Bedalin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">A better way to test this would be to remove your buff extension, so you always get 6 ticks on your heal over time.<br />
<br />
on the page Samanna linked us we can see:<br />
+ SCRM        6       Jaruden<br />
             6 or 7   Thurdar, Samanna, Iynna, Roxxanne<br />
              7       Macnair, Agrik <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
so even without buff extension focus the number of ticks is not fixed, it varies between 6 and 7(mostly 7 imo)</div></div><hr />

There's no regular parser that could do this. There's no hps number written into the log file and no heal msg for HoT ticks. Only way to capture that info would be by hand or with some 3rd party program that scanned eq's memory to read hps number.</div></div><hr />

I don't know as though I can say Healing Boon works. I have level 1 of the ability, and I haven't noticed the crit heal amounts. To me, it seems like the AA has not doubled a single tick's worth of healing. Instead, it seems like it inserts another healing boost at a half-tick. So you cast Breath of Trushar ... one tick ... 3 seconds later, another tick ... and 3 seconds later, the next regular tick.<br />
<br />
I have no idea if that makes sense to anyone, or if anyone's noticed it, or even if it's a bit of server lag making me see things. But like I said, I have yet to see a double single-tick's worth of healing out of the AA. One way or the other, I don't suppose I'm going to purchase the other levels for awhile.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Retron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Here's another parse for consideration. My method was to go to Halas and nuke myself, then use Stoicism to heal back up (smaller jumps than Q, but the same principle applies). My standing regen was 24 points/tick and the result for 15 sessions of Stoicism were as follows:<br />
<br />
http://www.medvale.fsnet.co.uk/stoi.gif[/IMG] <br />
<br />
I have SCRM and the 8th Shawl, giving a 70% extension. FWIW every single cast gave &quot;0:42&quot; when hovering over the spell icon although the number of ticks of healing was split between 7 and 8 as you can see.<br />
<br />
Yellow backgrounds to cells means that the UI updated with the value shown before falling back to a lower value on the next tick - ie a &quot;phantom tick&quot; of healing. Green cells show confirmed critical heals (from the first rank of Healing Boon) - as others have noticed the value updated [i]between ticks. A few times I had two updates one right after the other and these gave standing regen as well. I suspect that's the client and server going out of synch in some way and didn't include them as criticals.<br />
<br />
So, after all that - out of 15 casts of Stoicism there were 111 ticks healed, of which 6 were crits. 6 casts lasted 8 ticks whereas 9 lasted 7.  <br />
<br />
I'd say that's pretty much 60/40 for 7 or 8 ticks and a 5% chance for Healing Boon 1 to fire.<br />
<br />
(Edited - 7 times 7 ticks changed to 9 times 7 ticks in the summary, I had 7 on the brain it seems!)</div></div><hr />

those goofy double heal ticks (the ticks that show 368 points healed,) are really kind of intresting.  if you look at lines 34 and 35, that cast of stoicism really did 9 ticks worth of healing for you if infact the double heal tick is not a crit!  i am going to do some parcing of my own...it wont be layed out in a spread sheet, but i am intrested to see if those double heal ticks turn up in torpor+.  anyone without healing boon seeing those double healing ticks?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">i just did 20 casts worth of tests with torpor.<br />
at the time i had 70% buff exstention and healing boon 3 with a standing regen of 22.<br />
42 seconds was what the curser showed when torpor hit every single time.<br />
i was in halas so i had no lag or lag spikeing.<br />
got some..intresting results...<br />
<br />
http://www.civin.org/gale/healing%20boon%20torpor%20parces.xls<br />
<br />
i'll crunch the numbers here for those to lazy to look at the excel stuff.<br />
139 ticks parced<br />
13 crit ticks<br />
3 crit ticks + double heal ticks (1 tick = double heal + crit heal)<br />
3 large HP discrepancie ticks (not sure if it was a crit, lag, or double heal)<br />
14 of the funky double heal ticks (1 tick= 2x torpor heal + 2 times standing regen heal)<br />
<br />
some self expanitory easy math-<br />
(13+3)/139 = 11.51%<br />
(13+3+3)/139 = 13.67% (this is close to 4%-5% addition with each boon AA...)<br />
(13+14+3+3)/139 = 23.74%<br />
<br />
some intresting findings when i was doing this... even though i was in almost zero lag while torpor was on, my HP, almost every tick, would unstably jump up to at least crit level or more and then finally after a second settle to either normal tick heal hp or crit+ heal hp... if that makes sense...  needless to say it was a pain the ass to get the write HP writen down while watching... no joke...<br />
<br />
also, seems i got a few casts with only 6 ticks worth of healing...most with 7 ticks and 1 with 8 ticks....the 6 tick ones bother me as i have 70% buff exstension and torpor was showing 42 seconds every single cast...<br />
<br />
also, the large HP discrepancy ticks... i couldn't figure out what the hell they are... if they are crit ticks or double heal ticks...or the ui making up for regen that was added/lost somewhere else...  my actual regen numbers we not as steady as retron's were.  even though i wasn't showing any lag i wouldn't rule that out. i did it about the time when the after work crowd got off so i could have been seeing some server lag...  we really need more parces though. it took me longer to get it into excel than it did to actually do the testing fyi.<br />
<br />
of i jacked anything let me know i am kind of tired atm. otherwise all the data should have been copied from my notebook to the excel file properly.<br />
<br />
edit- btw, during the crits a lot of them didn't have the HP added in after the actual tick..some did but not all... just thought i would add my findings in.</div></div><hr />

Umm, actually I wouldn't put credability into this scenario either.  Allow me to explain why:  I'm a 65 shammy, with normal buffs (mine + virt) I have ~ 5500 hps.  I have 27 AAs but no canni 5 yet (forgot MC3 was prerequisite and bought EE2 -- DOH!!), and an unbuffed HP regen of 23/26.  <br />
<br />
Canni 4 =148 dmg or ~2.6% of health bar<br />
Q = 420 heal/tick or ~7.6% of health bar<br />
unbuffed HP regen = ~.5% of health bar<br />
<br />
TRUST ME, if I canni to 75% life and slap Q on, my health bar does some FUNKY jumping around!!!  Granted I haven't tried with the default UI, but I HAVE tried with several!!!  There is just too much SERVER (not ZONE) dependant lagg to run an accurate test WITHOUT a crit or otherwise filterable message.  Eyeballing is not going to work, regardless of steps taken to control.<br />
<br />
Parsing is nice, but there has to be a message to parse.<br />

i think dotting yourself to make standing regen zero would add more potentials for miscalculatoin actually.  it is a nice idea, but if you ever watch the UI update while dotted we see similar things with dots as we do with hots (sometimes the UI updates slow so dots seem to miss ticks ect.)  besides if you are putting points into healing boon most likely you have dot crits so that would throw off the results.  <br />
it is easy enough to caculate standing regen and note it in the notations after the parces are done...besides in the 2 usefull parces that have been posted here we see a funky thing i called a double heal tick.  the only way to see if this is happening is due to actually getting double the standing regen in one tick (so we would have no clue this is going on if we had zero standing regen.)<br />
<br />
I'm still waiting for Bedalin to show up and once again say that we're wrong, but it appears that they lost interest in this thread after it was won by Retron.<br />

i wouldn't so much say won, as say the first one to post and accurate data.  it proved Bedalin's hypothosis and testing methods were flawed, but we have a lot more parcing to do before we can come close to seeing what the actual crit %s per level are.</div></div><hr />

Note that for my method you would only ever check your health at least one tick after the HoT has actually run through, thus minimizing the effect of lag.<br />
<br />
It's a moot point though as we already confirmed that HoT crits actually do occur.<br />
<br />
Would performing these tests in an instanced dungeon help any?  Like kick everyone out of an expedition so your the only one there.  Or would &quot;server lag&quot; still affect the outcome?<br />
Testing in a zone on a less taxed server would help but as one server handles several zones it is hard to tell which one would be best. I imagine multiple LDoN zones are handled by one server so that would probably not work all that well. Plane of time with no raid there might help, or just testing at odd times.</div></div><hr />

Lol....too true.  So I solved the DoT problem myself.  With Burning affliction 4, Bane can heal up to 504 a tic... it averages out to doing 2400 DMG total instead of 2100 DMG.  So my hotkey #4, which is my perma-memmed Bane hotkey, reads like so:<br />
<br />
/cast 4<br />
/gsay CURSEd %t<br />
/pause 21, /emote hits %t for 2400 points of non-melee damage.<br />

Now others can witness shammy DPS, because they will see, just as the mob winces with the accompanying &quot;curse visual effect&quot;--<br />
<br />
Jaraman hits a Jord Tyv for 2400 points of non-melee damage.<br />
<br />
Then somewhere in the middle of battle, 3 waves of 650 Tears of Saryrn and the mob screams in torment.  Not too shabby, up to 6k+ damage EVERY fight (2400 + 650 + 650 + 650 + puppy's 1800).<br />
<br />
All while pulling, debuffing, slowing and main healing every battle non-stop.  And if things did get hairy and I'm LOM, another 45 secs and I'm gtg.  Beats a druid's 1 to 2.5k nuke anyday.  Shoot, a wizzy's rain is only 750 x 3.  And they're thanking you for casting Malos anyway....lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I did ten casts myself, only using scrm, no item extension. I used Q for tests. I cast Q as soon as standing regen was given. 8 casts got me 7 ticks, 2 casts got me 6 ticks. In that time, I saw 5 crits. Two out of the 5 times, the amount healed doubled for that particular tick (like it should when it crits). The odd thing was with the other 3 times. The amount jumped up one tick's worth, then another tick's worth in the same tick, like a phantom tick, only i was counting the seconds each time, it was definitely not a phantom tick. For example, one tick I was at 2432, next tick bumped it up to 2863, a second later it went to 3714, then 4 seconds later or so (the next tick) I was at 4145. I counted as a crit, and attributed it to lag. Don't know if it's a coincidence, but the 2 ticks I only had 6 ticks total, this happened. So, there's my small test, take from it what you will :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">I remember sony said crits on heal over times would be really hard for them to code due to the way the system is set up... sounds like their solution was to not make a true crit, but to make a critical tick consist of two heals on one tick...<br />
<br />
so with server lag it looks like two pulses one after the other on or immediately after a tick for crits. This was probably the only way they could code it to make it work within the existing system. <br />
<br />
IE <br />
tick 1: 630<br />
tick 2: 630<br />
tick 3: 2 separate 630's<br />
tick 4: 630<br />
<br />
if the serve lags a little on the crit tick, number three, it could look like one pulse followed shortly thereafter by another even if they are almost simultaneously submitted on the server.<br />
<br />
either way it looks like it works but it looks like a crit tick isn;t one tick for 2x the healing, but rather getting two very rapid pulses on the same tick when a 'crit' goes off. It may not be pretty but at least they found a way to make it work :)</div></div><hr />

Just watch what happens when an SK burst heals the group for 400 mana/HP or the beastlord casts Paragon or when a necro mind wracks a mob or even when you're cannidancing...  Granted, some of these are bursts that happen in between tics, but others are increases over time and will exhibit these &quot;phantom tics&quot;.<br />

Bottomline is, we all agree Healing Boon does indeed work.</div></div><hr />
