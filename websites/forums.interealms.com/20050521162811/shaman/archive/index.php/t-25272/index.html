<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jindaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">friend recently quit EQ and gave me her shaman account,  Had a general idea of what to do with AA's, but now its getting more unclear, looking to see A) if there are any AA's that I do not have that I obviously should get and B) how I should map out my next few AA purchases<br />
<br />
Magelo (http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1154725)  has all my AA's up to date in it</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Finish up your defensive AA's, evasive aa's only go so far, your always going to get hit sometime and then you need to be able to mitigate the hit.<br />
Also finishing up radiant cure and virulent paralysis is always a good thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">SCM 3 - Get it NOW! Then do what Jeng said. =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Your friend clearly valued her role as a healer, and put lots of aa into that ahead of other things.<br />
<br />
If that's your chosen route as well, you should get Radiant Cure 3 and Ancestral Aid 3 pretty soon.  Both of these will help you keep your group alive.<br />
<br />
In any case, I'd suggest Natural Durability before long, that will be worth about 500 more hitpoints to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ND is not worth nearly 500 hit points.<br />
<br />
Naked level 65 with no AA's:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1154922<br />
<br />
Same level 65 with ND3/PP5:<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=1154924<br />
<br />
There's 139 HP difference between the two.  Now, adding more STA will increase the benefit of your ND3, but not to the tune of 361 points.<br />
<br />
SCM3 would be of much more benefit, IMO.  Very surprising that that one was left out with all the others that this char has.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Depending on playstile:<br />
if you often run out of mana, get SCM3, SCMM,<br />
if you get aggro a lot, finish SCS3<br />
if you use the shaman on raids with AOEs, finish RC3<br />
if you have to do a lot of crowd control, finish VP3</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may be fuddled due to having a fever, but doesn't ND work with hp/sta on gear?  if so, then your comparison of Naked characters with and without it is pretty flawed and it CAN be worth 500pts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yes. Natural Durability at level 3 will give you an extra 10% boos in HP that you have from Level, base Stamina, +HP gear, +Sta gear, and +Sta buffs, just not +HP buffs.<br />
<br />
So if you're at 5k dressed with PE and Fortitude without any ND, you'd have been at 5500 with ND3.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Please get remove curse, and remove greater curse Jindaru.<br />
<br />
A raiding shaman should NOT be without those.<br />
<br />
Ya its not an AA, but I remember when ptolemy was playing jindaru and didn't have either of those for Rathe Council.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Ah, I had forgotten that ND applied to +HP gear (I got it so long ago).<br />
<br />
As Rosanne Rosanna-Danna would say, &quot;Never Mind&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jindaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">at the moment I am not a raiding shaman, for a little more background info; I was in a time/ikkinz guild and the original owner of Jindaru was in guild with me, we are very close friends, played eachother's chars on raids etc. After OoW was released guild took a massive hit eventually disbanded, Jind left EQ for EQ2, I stayed with EQ, simply couldn't let over 5 years of work into a char go down the drain.  Jind originally gave myself and her brother join acess to the account.  Her brother proceded to try to use her superiour character to get into the higher end guilds on the server, he was either kicked for doing stupid **** or quit, he rarely plays now, and Jind has given me full account rights.  At the moment I have not joined another guild, I'm working on it, but I want to keep my SK as my main, and to join the guild I want to join I need another 30ish AA's so currently Jindaru's primary purpose is a two box for a Sk/shaman duo, or a two box in exp groups.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much everyone who gave advice, now that I know the more critical AA's I don't have, I can set my current goals and map out my next few purchases<br />
<br />
(wow this board is a hell of a lot nicer then the SK board, I wasn't flamed at all...)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">ND 3 would be one of my first choices as well.<br />
<br />
I did the little test with and without ND3 on my toon and it was 5814 hps unbuffed with ND3 and 5287 hps without ND3...for a grand total of.... 527 hps boost.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kevagron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">We gave up flaming a long time ago with shaman bots.<br />
<br />
Shaman are just too useful as a bot character that it became pointless flaming everyone that came along with their new bot :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Plus, many of the people that level up Shaman bots switch to Shaman mains. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jindaru</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">more then ounce, I've been offered to join the top guild on the 7th Hammer with Jindaru as my main, but guild doesn't allow any 2 boxing on raids, and personally, I love my SK I really would really prefer to keep him as main.</div></div><hr />
