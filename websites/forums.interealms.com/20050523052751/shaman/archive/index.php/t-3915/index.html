<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was having a lousy day in Maiden's Eye, so I decide to just skip it and head to the Bazaar, set up as a merchant and do something else for a while. <br />
<br />
I zone into the Bazaar and I hear someone shouting that there was a free-for-all in the Bazaar Arena and for everyone to jump in. Well, I haven't done much PvP, but it sounded fun. Actually, I'm lvl 60 and I've NEVER done PvP, so I figured I'd jump in, do some damage, then get whacked. <br />
<br />
You can make a guess what happened next. I jumped in and used standard shaman tactics of root and rot, pet kiting, etc. Eventually, I'm killed. I then receive an exceedingly nasty tell from some guy who was killed by my dot after I died and lost real exp from it. He was understandably pissed and didn't care that I was very sorry and that I was a completely newb in PvP. <br />
<br />
On one hand, I'm just an idiot. I should have remembered about that problem with DoTs. If I didn't know what I was doing, I shouldn't have done it. If the person I killed is reading this, I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, EQ is just flat out STUPID to permit this to happen. This is dumb for a couple of reasons:<br />
<br />
1) It ruins &quot;fun&quot; PvP among people you do not know. Would you jump into an arena for a free-for-all melee in the Bazaar if you knew that you could take real exp loss? <br />
<br />
2) It's a loophole for griefers. I dotted some poor sucker to death from ignorance, but what if I were a griefer? I could go around and DoT everyone in the arena with Bane of Nife then permit myself to be killed. Repeat until everyone keels over and takes exp loss. A DoTing griefer could cause large amounts of exp loss in the Arena, until everyone bails out to prevent that from happening - thereby ruining the fun for everyone. I'm not sure, but is this even a petionable offence? If not, then the griefers get free rein. If it is, then what happens to goobs (see me) who logically use their best tactics and cause exp loss unintentionally?<br />
<br />
3) DoTs are the main/major weapons of shamans, necros, druids, bards, and SK. Making them basically unusable in a PvP setting puts those classes at a substantial disadvantage. How am I supposed to win a PvP encounter without a dot? Burst of Flame? I guess I could win with tanking and torpor... or talk whoever I'm fighting to fight with one hand behind their back.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I realize this is a complex issue when it comes to all of the different types of PvP: PvP servers, PvP players on normal servers (the few), and duels on normal servers and Arena combat. Having not had a tremendous experience in this area, I don't know how I would change it in the general case without creating lots of exploits. But that doesn't stop me from having some suggestions to propose:<br />
<br />
1) Why can't a DoT's &quot;source&quot; be marked when it is cast? Something as simple as &quot;from player&quot; and &quot;from mob&quot; should be enough to fix this problem. I'm sure this has been discussed previously, but why has it not been implemented?<br />
<br />
2) I think there should be &quot;safe&quot; places to duel - places where you do not take exp loss. For example, in The Arena, there are no mobs at all. There is nothing there that can possibly kill you other than other players. Why not make it a &quot;no exp loss&quot; zone? Basically, if you are in The Arena and you die, it was probably from a player. Granted, one could do some exploit where they gate there after fighting a DoT-ing mob, but that would really be going out of one's way to exploit. Of course, if they implemented item #1 this would not be an issue.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>korinna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I had the same thing happen, but if I didn't realize it till the next day when I got killed and lost my level. A necro had dotted me in the arena I left the arena and died.<br />
<br />
If you get killed in the arena my understanding is you don't lose exp, but if you leave the areana with a dot and die then you do. I won't do PvP anymore, to much risk on losing exp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">you aren't supposed to lose exp from deaths in an arena.<br />
<br />
either he did something stupid and ran out of the arena and died to the dot, or he was the victim of a stupid bug, either way it's not your fault.<br />
<br />
If people are participating in a free for all in the arena, use all your tools.  It's not fair to handicap yourself because a stranger may possibly lose exp.<br />
<br />
Last time I was in the bazaar I asked some people in the arena to kill me so I could save a corpse for my focus items.  I stripped my buffs and let a SK melee me to death.   At the end of the fight a pally jumped in to help him and I died to the DD proc on her lance.   I lost exp in the arena.  Oh well, it's not her fault her lance proc'd right as I was knocked unconscious.  Should she never use weapons in the arena?  :P<br />
<br />
anyway, don't feel bad.  you didn't do anything wrong.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sadly I can relate Vorpatril, only in my case the way I learned about it was by causing my own brother to have exp loss. =/<br />
I have no clue why Verrant hasn't done anything about the DoT issue in PvP situations, fortunately I don't do a lot of PvP so it's not too much of an issue for me but I know there are TONS of people that this does hurt in a major way.<br />
I doubt we'd ever see a fix like &quot;no exp loss zones&quot; but it SHOULD be very easy for them to tag the dot as either from a player or from a mob.  The ONLY exploit I could see with that would be if a person is dying from a MOB dot they could /duel a necro / shammy and have that person slap a HUGE dot on them to kill them before the smaller mob dot did and thereby escape exp loss but that's an extreme circumstance I think.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">ACK!  I just realized a very realistic exploit... of course actually it would work now and not just with no-exp loss from dots, there is a HUGE exploit that exists now because of no-exp loss in duels.  The exploit is not that dissimilar from the casters that were getting roaring drunk then /q to med to full in a few seconds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Wildaar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">first off, I don't know anyone that would do the /duel while dying frmo a mob to avoid an exp loss.  Its too much of a pain in the ass actually.  Secondly, anyone who steps into an arena is fair game.  In Arena, anything counts if you don't want an exp loss then you just don't go into arenas.  Its a risk, and with risk comes rewards and punishments.  That fella needs to get a grip and get off your back because he took that chance.  Ain't your fault at all, only his.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Karelan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">DoT code is far too integrated in their codebase for their to be any simple fix.. sadly. On RZ/TZ/VZ to fix it to make dots in anyway usable for pvp without being a griefing tool they had to totally remove XP loss from ANY DoT death(pain and suffering tries to strike YOU but misses!). You can drown, fall to your death, be dotted by a mob and die and never lose xp. When I first heard that you lost xp dying from falling on a blue I was blown away =p<br />
<br />
Anyway.. back to my point.. DoT code is way too integrated.. will never be fixed in any real manner, and has always been this way. Its only a sometimes issue on a non PvP server.. so most likely xp deaths due to dots wont go away.<br />
<br />
Hundreds or thousands of xp deaths in pvp a day on the otherhand, led them to disabling xp death due to dots in pvp just to avoid the massive daily headache of hundreds of people a day petitioning about lost xp due to dots in pvp heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bodabag</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hello.  32 barb Shammy here.  Been trolling the board for a couple weeks, but was just kinda curious....<br />
<br />
Could anyone state what the DoT problem actually is?  Is it because you weren't in the zone when he died?  Will any Dot's cause this to happen?  This is the first I've heard of this problem and was hoping to get the skinny before I accidentally do this to someone.  I've been asked to kill people in FV so they can get a quick ride home.  Would this same problem happen if I DoT'd him and let him rot instead of fighting him with Melee?  Will DD's cause the same problem?   Does this only happen in the Arena environment?<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>DanninSZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">on sullon zek you lose xp if you die in the arena to anything at all :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Bodabag,<br />
<br />
My understanding is that there are a few different scenarios where dots will cause exp death.<br />
<br />
1) In a duel. I dot someone in a duel. He kills me, so the duel is over. A short while later, he dies from the dot. The game doesn't see that he was dueling any  more, so assumes that he was killed by a mob and gives him a real exp death.<br />
<br />
2) In the arena. I dot someone in the arena. He runs out of the arena with the dot still on him. He keels over and dies. The game doesn't know why he died, since he was not in the arena, so it assumes that it was from a mob, so it gives him an exp death. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if dying in the arena from a dot of a person who is no longer around (like #1) will cause exp loss too. I think so, but Henora says no. I'm don't know. <br />
<br />
I think there are other variations on this theme, but in general the idea is that the person on the receiving end of the dot is no longer fighting the guy doing the dot, so the code doesn't know that it was a duel. If I dotted someone and killed him while I we were both still &quot;fighting&quot;, I think he does not take an exp loss. <br />
<br />
Or at least that's how I understand it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Coraz2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I dotted a warrior to death cause he wouldn't slow.. and he jumped out of arena at 1% hp, I flooded /ooc with his name GET BACK IN THE ARENA FAST but noo.. he sat down.. i ran out and barely healed him while he   sat there unknowingly..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nalyeni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I used to believe verant's statement that one cant lose exp in the arena, but then i found out the hard way you can.  I personally have lost exp while in the arena a few times; most recently, I was dotted by a druid.  Neither I nor the druid left the arena, and on the 2nd or 3rd tic, the dot itself killed me *poof* exp.<br />
<br />
I generally LOVE arena brawls, but because of this, I dont participate anymore unless I'm guaranteed a 56 rez... just takes the fun out of it when you know the second you're hit with a bane/pox combo, you're gonna lose exp.  <br />
<br />
I know this from both sides; it sucks to think that ppl would want me to hamper myself by not using dots, but c'mon.  If you're in the arena with friends, would you dot them, knowing you can cause exp loss?  Not everyone has a rez waiting for em.  Really irks me that ppl can say 'blame verant, not me' after causing exp loss, and then dotting me again when i step foot inside the arena (whether griefing/camping or not).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've killed hundreds of people in the arena with my DoTs. . . . I never hold back on using them.  I use them as often as I like.  The only people who have ever lost exp to them in the arena were people who ran out and then died.  I felt no pity for those fewls.  They should have died like men, instead of choosing the coward's way out.  <br />
<br />
I don't know what this person above me is talking about.  I think he is vastly misconstruing the facts, or is just plain confused and forgetful. <br />
<br />
There are a few arcane ways you can lose exp from dots both in and out of the arena, but you really kinda of have to be in the wrong place at the right time.  <br />
<br />
I dueled a necro once a long time ago and he lost exp when he died.  Course it was because my last nuke knocked him unconcious and his own lichform killed him from there.  Silly necros.  <br />
<br />
I've killed more people in duels and in the arena with dots than with nukes . . by FAR.  None of them have complained about exp losses.  <br />
<br />
The original poster has a point however.  It is still possible to lose exp in the arena, especially in a FFA type battle.  If that happens it's not the end of the world tho.  Seriously folks, get a grip.  If you're so scared of losing exp you won't set foot in the arena, then why the hell do you play this game?  Your toon is just a toon.  He feels no pain.  Exp deaths can be rezzed.  Eating exp deaths isn't THAT painful.  Heck, I can make up an exp death in about 45 minutes of solo play.  That's shorter time frame than finding a rez in some out of the way location.  Sucks to lose the time, but whatever.  If you don't play for fun, you'll quit in a huff and ebay to recoup your &quot;investment&quot; in your character.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If it bugs you that much /petition it and get a 100% rez. It's not like it's some random weird unknown bug that Verant has never heard of before.<br />
<br />
Don't want to wait for a GM to rez you? Then you don't want it bad enough and should shut up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Colal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">This is an issue that pisses me off to no end.  Reading the responses to this thread has made my blood preasure rise.  A few weeks ago, I was in an arugment with a guild member that almost came to blows over this issue.<br />
<br />
The fact is, DoT's are bugged when it comes to casting them on players.  I don't care if its duels, guildwars, Arena battles, battles in the Arena ZONE etc.<br />
<br />
Verant once said they fixed this issue, well they haven't.  DoT's sometimes cause exp death, and sometimes they don't.  You can have 2 people sit in the arena all day long and cast dots on each other, 34 times they wont loose exp and 13 of them they will.  It doesn't seem predictable to me, and I will never again believe a player, guide, senior guide, or GM regarding anything they say about this.<br />
<br />
Beeg, thanks for your opinion, but it sucks.  Last time I checked we paid money for this game every month.  We shouldn't have to wait on a GM to get an exp death back from this.  Verant should fix the problem.  Then also what about those donkey holes that tell you they can't verify that it was a bug, so they won't do anything about it?  I've had this happen to me, and I have had this happen to friends, and by this time the corpse is expired and can't be ressed. <br />
<br />
How ridicilous would it be if you bought a new car, and the speedometer was always stuck on 40, and the manufacture couldn't/wouldn't fix it?  Now lets say you get a ticket for going 50 in a 45, would you be happy if the cop told you to just drive 30 or stop complaing?<br />
<br />
Veran't can either fix this problem, or they can issue a very public statement in game, on message boards, and on their web page warning against using dot's in PVP, because they are to incompetent to fix the problem, and then also state that a guide/gm will never ever give you a CS resurection from dieing in a PVP battle.  I think that would be almost acceptable, and at least customers would know what they were facing.  It's one thing to buy a new car with a speedometer stuck on 40, and another thing to  buy a used car that you know has a non functional speedometer, before you purchase it.</div></div><hr />
