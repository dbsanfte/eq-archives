<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MGP4ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Im having trouble deciding between the two.  I have read this board and the beastlord board and still cant come to a decision.  I cant make both since I play on Firiona Vie and have already test buffed both to 25 on Test Server.  I'm kinda leaning towards beast for DPS and I like to melee some but I also like to be able to solo and would like to say I have soloed such things like Kunark Dragons, ect.  Can someone help me I have been going back and forth between the two for over a month now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Beastlords solo very well, though yes they cannot solo as big things as we can normally. Unfortunately it isn't all too big a deal anymore. <br />
<br />
We can't really solo Kunark dragons, unless you count Guardian Wurms in SF as dragons. We can solo the WW dragons in Velious but a lot of classes can do that now anyway. <br />
<br />
My beastlord is only 55 so I really can't give you a first hand opinion of what they're like at high levels. But I do know they are much more balanced (or over balanced, depending how you look at it) than most any other class out there.<br />
<br />
Still I prefer my Shaman. Even if I got my beastlord to 65 with 150 AA's I'd still prefer my Shaman. Even with their similarities there's a completely different play style between both.<br />
<br />
Yet I look at your post and if you like DPS and Melee and the only reason you're thinking of a Shaman is to solo bigger things, I'd recommend you go with a Beastlord. <br />
<br />
On top of that, compare posts on both boards, You'll see a lot more complaints with Shamans than Beastlords and there's a good reason for that. <br />
<br />
Good luck with whatever you choose. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Shamans on the board who have played both will tell you beastlord.<br />
<br />
In the fast fight, high dps world of today's eq, go beastlord, and leave healing to the real healing classes, like clerics, druids, and paladins.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">If I was thinking short term... I would go BL.<br />
<br />
Not trying to sound like a whiner, but Shaman are the red-headed step children ATM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">It's not a hard decision. Most people have a general preference towards the caster gameplay style or the melee game play style.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends primarily on your goal. If you are dead set on being a raider then shaman has perfectly reasonable value. If you doubt you'll be raiding, and will be grouping and earning your own gear, then I'd go beastlord. The melee / caster divide is valid too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ungkor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">&quot;If you doubt you'll be raiding, and will be grouping and earning your own gear, then I'd go beastlord&quot;<br />
<br />
Beastlords' have a mgb'able health and mana heal called paragon of spirit.  Most guilds would rather have extra beasts around for that raid heal over shaman any day.  Plus, bst stack on raids.  More dps is never a bad thing.  <br />
<br />
Take any guild that has 3 shaman and 3 beasts, and they'll tell you they'd rather have 1 more bst.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yep, but I always thought being a raid beastlord looked incredibly boring. As gear goes up the monks and rogues start to outstrip you in DPS, since much of your damage is in the form of a non-scaling pet (which pushes too much, needs positioning, eats ripostes and AoE's), and being a buff dispenser isn't much fun.<br />
<br />
... Then again, I guess that's true for shaman too. On second thoughts forget playing either if you want to be a raider :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">but as a shaman, EVERYONE can out DPS you hehe. Kidding.. sort of</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Beastlord.  Ogre, btw.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just wanted to say &quot;Thanks&quot; for the grey rep bump that said &quot;bst suck&quot;<br />
<br />
Whoever that was, just delete your shaman please...your attitude probably does more harm than good to the rest of us who enjoy our shamans.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">No way, Troll - GATOR!  Gawd that thing is cute (and it's low to the ground, doesn't piss people off by getting in the way so much).  Don't forget the bst can practically solo their epic, or if you don't feel like waiting that long, a couple of 65's can duo it easily.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zodiax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I play both. I can tell you right now that both have strengths and weaknesses. Dont believe the hype. Beastlords arent the super human megatron class people will lead you to believe they are. My shaman solos much more effectively in the same level of gear and aas as my beastlord. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Play the one you feel more comftorable with if you have to roll one of each. If you prefer more of a support role then play the shaman if you prefer more melee and a stronger pet play the beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Love my shaman, but no one in their right mind would choose a shaman over a beastlord at this point in time, if you're looking for pure satisfaction and quick power.  It's amazing the things I can pull off with my 52 bst...  I play him in my spare time.  I have 5 toons that are 50+ (3 that are 60+) and not one of them in their respective progression is as powerful as the beastlord is at 52, good gear or not.  I parsed him at 65 DPS (him and his warder) at level 51... NOT including his pet procs, which don't display a numerical number... that's just sick.  At 50 and 51, I've taken on entire trains of 3-4 mobs in KC and WON...   slow + warder proc + pet heals + proc'ing weapons (the 625 DD proc weapons) completely own everything in sight.  My ranger, shaman, monk, or wizard could NOT have done that at level 50... (unless the wizard had room to quad-kite).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I like my shaman, but there's just some visceral thrill about being able to run up to mob, slow it and pound it to snot.  <br />
If you have enjoyed 'twitch' games now or in the past, beastlord all the way.  If long strategy games are your thing, shaman might be best.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you think about all the pros and cons, choosing a beastlord would be comparable to owning a nice fuel efficient sports car. This car would take you to work while pack enough power to have a fun ride.<br />
<br />
Choosing shaman would be like owning some veteran ride that drinks gallons of gas. You would ride it only because its cool and because youre fond of old cars.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My old car was just found on the side of the road dead.  Now I need a tow but the tow-truck driver told me I don't need one and to just get out and push.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I also have both with good gear, and I would def choose the shaman.  But, I created the beastlord mainly cause I wanted something that could melee with at the time and I had no other RL friends playing a beastlord.  Given same equipment/AAs/flags.. I would still chose shaman no doubt.  If I didn't, then why keep the shaman as my main.<br />
<br />
Oh, I would do what the rest have said and take a look at what you want.  If you want to melee than choose a beastlord.  if you want to play caster, choose shaman.<br />
<br />
BTW.. Shaman can solo kunark dragons.  not all of them mind you, but some of them np.  And right now I can kill something 3x quicker with Val than I can with the beastlord.</div></div><hr />
