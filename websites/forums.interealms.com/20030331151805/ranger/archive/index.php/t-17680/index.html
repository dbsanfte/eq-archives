<br />
I just dinged lvl 60 and was wondering what spell combinations you use.  I like to solo a lot, but realize that warder's protection doesn't stack with much.  Please let me know the optimal combination for ac, hp, and attack for soloing<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eqzuluu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pretty sure there are a few threads on this but this is what I use.<br />
<br />
Outdoor<br />
<br />
Greater Wolf Form<br />
Warder's Protection<br />
Thorncoat<br />
Storm strength<br />
Feel like cat<br />
Natures Precision<br />
Skin like Nature<br />
Call of Fire<br />
Chloroplast<br />
(Eagle eye) if needed<br />
<br />
Indoor<br />
Same as above except no GWF no WP.  Switch NP for SoN and add CotP also add FoN.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I thought Strength of Nature was an upgraded form of Nature's Precision - why are you using it over SoN? Stacking issues or something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Taewedar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Str of Nature does not stack with Warders Protection, however NP does even though yes in the past SoN would be an upgrade from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ah I see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Kishin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">odd combo spells and what lines they use:<br />
Warder's Protection (rng/60)<br />
Atk - CotP line<br />
AC - CoE line<br />
HP - SoN line (which is also brell's and BL's spiritual vigor)<br />
DS - druid single target DS line<br />
<br />
Force of Nature (rng/49)<br />
Atk - Wolf Form line<br />
DS - CoE line<br />
Regen - unique line<br />
<br />
Frostreaver's Blessing (ring 10 effect)<br />
Atk - almost unique line<br />
DS - CoE line<br />
Regen - shm/dru regen line.<br />
<br />
Chromatic Chaos (http://lucy.fnord.net/item.html?id=30387 effect)<br />
exactly the same as frostreaver's blessing, but 5 atk/ds/regen instead of 10.<br />
<br />
so basically you can have NP up with WP, and anything that gives the ds but not ac of the CoE line(ring 10/FoN).  fortunately, WP's buffs are all on lines that rangers use, so it's a buff you almost never have to forgo:  we don't usually MT for a group, so druid or mage DSes are unneeded; WP will always be better than a brell's or SV; and we've grown accustomed to Augment not stacking with CoE, so when it fails to stack with WP, it's no surprise.  no big loss, either - it stacks with pure haste and VoG/SoV.<br />
<br />
now, do SoN and CotP stack? lucy makes it seem like it.  but i dunno, it seems like they shouldn't.  and do both of these stack with wolf form?  does WP stack with wolf form?<br />
<br />
-K out</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kaulwen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">To answer your question: SoN and CoP do stack. Just like SoN and MoP stack. They both also stack with wolf form. WP also stacks with wolf form, but will not stack with SoN or any of the Predator line of spells. The only buff that I can think of off hand we get that won't stack with wolf form is Force.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Aneia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Here's what I use. For reference, my usual group is me, 60 monk, 60 cleric, and 59 shaman.<br />
<br />
1- Calefaction<br />
2- Flame lick<br />
3- Ensnare<br />
4- Greater Wolf Form<br />
5- Storm Strength<br />
6- Greater Heal<br />
7- Call of the Preditor<br />
9- Thorncoat? ( Whatever the lvl 60 ac/ds buff is)<br />
<br />
I usually have load up Skin Like Nature in #7 unless grouped with a cleric or 60+ druid. Flamelick and Calefaction get replaced with Call of Earth and Strength of Nature at the appropriate intervals. If I am grouped and not tanking, Flame Lick is replaced with a Root of some sort. Greater Heal and Chloro interchange a lot.</div></div><hr />
