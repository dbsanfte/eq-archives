<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taggletoe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I just wanted to know if anyone else 40 or below is having trouble can-dancing with the new UI?<br />
<br />
I am having a terrible time catching ticks for some reason with the new UI.  Now there may be some reasons for it.  I have recently increased my wisdom to 160 and just hit 41 so it might be my mana pool is getting bigger that I don't notice the tick anymore.<br />
<br />
I know alot of shaman hot key it with the /pause 11 but I have always found it just as easy to manually do it.  Lately I'm regreting that decision.  Even if I catch one or two ticks I can't seem to catch the second or third.<br />
<br />
Damn that Cann II quest.  I have the CoM part and the Yun Shaman in TT left and hopefully that will resolve my problems.  Lately it just feels like I'd get mana faster medding than trying to catch the tick for Canni.  I'm just curious if some of the younger shaman out there have experienced similar problems.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Oldshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I guess a solution would be to try a bigger hp/mana bar mod and one with numbers on it too.<br />
<br />
I don't know if I'd mess around with the new UI now anyway, there have been reports of items poofing, maybe that's what this shutdown is about.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kinring</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think it depends on lag, although i'm not sure. I use an advanced skin that shows percentages next to the health and mana bars so I use that to watch for the tick. Sometimes when there is a lot of lag, the update i see is actually after the real tick and that throws me off.<br />
<br />
today was the first time I tried the dance so my technique may just need improvement. I was using flash of light instead of cannibalize because i needed to increase my divination skill and for about 20 minutes I stayed at 100% mana. Then i got a phone call and when i started to do the dance again I couldn't time it right, I did have more lag but I'm not sure that was the cause of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Fattn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">bah, watch your health.<br />
when it settles out stand up cast sit down.<br />
There done you're dancing like a pro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I agree, watching the HP bar seems better than watching the mana bar. I always canni dance manually as well, although I'm out of practice these days due to being spoilt with a horse!<br />
<br />
Must visit more dungeons :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Falyin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">When my bars have trouble...lag, too many hp's, too much mana (I am just kidding!) I open my inventory and watch the numbers tick from my HP's. Can't miss that ;-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Get a skin with your HP numbers on it and watch them.<br />
<br />
You'll see it go something like this as a non-regen race with chloro:<br />
<br />
1017/1428<br />
1027/1428<br />
1017/1428<br />
1029/1428<br />
<br />
That's the fun of playing with a 400-ish ping.<br />
<br />
After it does that it sort of settles down and seems to catch up to itself and start ticking normally (ie. 1017 -&gt; 1029).<br />
<br />
The client gets really confused with jumps in HP at times. Binding is good for it too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've found it easier to cannidance since the new UI.<br />
Find a player window xml file that has a percentage listed of your mana, and same for your health.<br />
Watching to see your health change percentage is much much much easier than watching for a change in your mana bar.<br />
<br />
The other thing you might want to do is set up your hotkey for your cannibalize spell like this:<br />
Hotkey name:  Wince<br />
Line 1:  /sit off<br />
Line 2:  /cast X<br />
(X is the number of the cannibalize spell).<br />
<br />
That way, regardless if you are standing or sitting, you can hit your wince key to cannibalize.  It will work if you have your spellbook open too.  That combined with a simple sit hotkey is all you need to cannidance.  Don't rely on macros to get all the sits and stands done properly, especially with lag happening.  The only macro I have is my multi wince semi-afk hotkey. It looks like this:<br />
Hotkey name:  Winces<br />
Line 1:  /pause 65, /cast X<br />
Line 2:  /pause 65, /cast X<br />
Line 3:  /pause 65, /cast X<br />
Line 4:  /pause 65, /cast X<br />
Line 5:  /cast X<br />
It chain casts 5 cannibalizes for me when I'm trying to regain mana, but have to do a quick afk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I don't rely on the health bar to cann because there are too many other things that can affect that.  Like my wife binding my wounds.<br />
<br />
However, I do have a cann hotkey that includes sitting, and once you identify the tick the first time, the key itself tells me when the tick is coming.  I know exactly how long after I sit down to hit the key again.  Usually I can see the mana bar moving once I get into the groove, but if I miss the movement for a tick it's ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>stormrazor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I open the inventory window and watch my HP's from there. And when it &quot;ticks&quot; I hit my canni hotkey, lag screws up my dance sometimes but most of the time is effective. <br />
<br />
my hotkey looks like this:<br />
<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 8 (or where ever canni is mem'd for you)<br />
/pause 14<br />
/sit on</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I used to watch the little shaman symbol on the old interface.  Not the old windowed interface.  I mean the OLD, greyish default screen.  With the new UI you can now do it again.  Open your inventory and watch the symbol. After it animates, stand, cast Canni and then sit.  That was how I was told to Canni Dance when I first started my shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MagnoMightyMidget</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I NEVER use the /pause command for spell casting, it's too unreliable in any kind of lag.  I just have 1 hotkey for /sit off then /cast 3.  My sit hotkey is right next to my cann hotkey so I just push it when spell casting has finished, it's not that much extra effort and you're garunteed to have it work.</div></div><hr />
