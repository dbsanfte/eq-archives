Its a little south of EW zone, below the giant fort.   I farmed heads there.  took little time to get ally turning in heads to the guy in kael.  Forget his name now though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Hadina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">you can get a lot of faction pretty quickly by starting at the entrance to thurgadin and working your way in. I've done exp there at 49 and it was fairly easy, so at 65 you should be able to plow through. They give bigger faction hits than tracking wolves and such so it might work better.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's some mines in GD.  Same ones that you have to go for for the coldain military wristguard.  They're on the opposite end of the one from thurg, on the same side of the river as the zone to EW and the pok book.  These miners tend to drop heads a LOT, and they're fairly weak, I did this at 56 or so.  I went from scowls to ally with about 6 hours of camping and turning in heads.  Bring lots of bags.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bethiana_MM</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I would be interested to know why Ceno has a hotkey that says DONKEY and just what it does ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Redhenna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Gratz on getting Yeli's head, GoDS are awesome(my warrior main has them and loves them).  The mines in the SE area of GD are the best place to farm dorf heads for turning into Cpt. Bevlos(sp?).  Be warned that some of the guards are DB to 65...I simply skipped them untill I was KoS, doing just the minors.  Resist the temptation to turn heads into The Kromrif Recruiter, as you get no KT faction hit from him.  <br />
<br />
In addition to saving dorf heads, there is a simple quest you can run in Kael for KT faction, delivering packages to mercenaries(1 in KD itself, 3 just outside KD in WL, follow the zone wall to the right).  I did the quest each time I went and turned in heads, it is a small faction hit, but takes almost no time(tho the mercenaries despawn when you turn in package to them).  <br />
<br />
Also, you can get nice sizable KT faction bumps from killing royals in Icewell Keep.  These are the dorfs around Dain himself.  Best to take a group along to do them if you can.  Lastly, get in on Dain and Yeli kills, as they both provide nice, sizable faction hits(and if you can get Dains head to go along with yelli's, it makes the eventual reward even better...Belt of Dwarf Slaying is awesome as well).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's similar to the &quot;Teabag&quot; hotkey I have.   :D   I was looking at this thread again just now, and was gonna ask about the Donkey thing too.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thks Red,<br />
<br />
Although my biggest problem is even though I killed for 2 hours last night and got about 20 dwarve heads, I'm still scowling with Kromzek and so can't do a turn in for Bevelos.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere that the best way to raise faction is to go kill in Skyshrine, wait for a faction change on Bevelos and then turn in the heads.<br />
<br />
Anyone with any thoughts?<br />
<br />
thks all.</div></div><hr />

Good day sir.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Oh.  I had max ally kromzek(?  it's one of the three, can't remember which) from ToV raids.  I assumed anyone who's trying to get on giant faction would.   :p  It takes um...103, I think, is how many I turned in to go from max scowls (I was on thurg before switching to giant, and then I switched to dragon!  Whee!) to ally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Skyshrine is a great place for Rif and Zek faction.  You need KT faction for your quest, but you also need Zek faction to turn in heads for KT hits.  You can get Zek faction by killing dorfs, by turning in heads to A Kromrif Recruiter, by killing in SS and I beleive WW.  <br />
<br />
I strongly recomend first just killing dorfs and collecting heads.  If I remember correctly, once I had dubious Zek faction so I could turn in heads to Cpt. Bevelos, it took 70ish heads to get my KY faction(this after 2 Dain kills and 1 Yelli kill).  So untill you have that many heads, you still need to kill dorfs anyway, so keep killing for the Zek faction hit.<br />
<br />
From there you can kill more dorfs, and turn those heads into the Recruiter for Riz and Zek hits, or kill in SS and WW.  I chose dorfs.  Note that as mentioned by someone else, it is posible to AE dorfs for mass faction hits, and then pick thru the corpses for heads.  I actually did this with a cleric who needed faction as well.  I would run around just outside Thurg, agroing all the dorfs and wolves, then when I had a crapload, would run over to the cleric...Dorfs all hit me, ensuring my faction hit, and 2 or 3 cleric AE's and it was over.  Loot up, take a small break, and do it again.  A better AE class(or a chanter and better AE class would be ideal) and it will be even better.</div></div><hr />
