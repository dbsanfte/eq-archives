<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If you mean, do people break reservations on my server, then no, because Xev doesn't have a reservation system.<br />
<br />
If you mean, do people start rants about something that they feel aggrieved about, then I guess that happens on all servers. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yub xev is a FIF server and im damn glad it is. We all get along with each other for the most part as well, lil flare ups of drama from time to time but its pretty peaceful.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">but posting a reservation to kill naggy / vox 2 days after he / she respawns kinda makes no sense  imo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Reservations in general make no sense to me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Heh, that is the first I have heard of &quot;reservations&quot; since RoK released.<br />
<br />
Do you get free food or drinks with each reservation?? :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Apparently they just get a hunk of cheese and some *whine*.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Which part, reservation part or the rant? If the rant then Torv is nothing compared to AB, the NAG sections has usuaually double the amount of posts as the general section and the rants aren't soft, www.antonius-bayle.org</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aeshere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Quellious moved away from reservation system a couple of years ago, and while at the time I wasn't sure about it...now I am damn glad we did. Yeesh, what a pain in the butt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Tunare has a very good system. One raiding force takes down Naggy/Vox everytime they pop. They call themselves OWD, though don't ask me what it stands for, I can't remember, lol.<br />
<br />
Anyway, everyone and anyone is invited to participate. The system is very very well run and every raid you go to is counted and each person specifies what item they are after. When your item drops it goes to the person who has the most raids tallied up.<br />
<br />
Everyone is guaranteed their item. So long as you attend enough raids you will eventually get it. For some people it may take months but most have fun doing them anyway and make a lots of friends/connections. What's really good is that somone in a small guild or in no guild at all still have the opportunity to get thier epic piece(s).<br />
<br />
And if a guild wanted to take down Naggy or Vox OWD will not stand in their way. Your guild is welcome to take down Naggy or Vox at any time it's just appreciated if you give warning first. Though this almost never happens. Everyone seems to respect the system very well. (which is rare on the server lol)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Karana has rotations for certain zones and bosses.  It's mainly things like Kunark dragons, Hate/Fear, Vox/Naggy, Venril...stuff that smaller raiding guilds can successfully take out but that they'd never see if they were directly competing with the resident uberguilds.  There are scandals every now and then but it usually works.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Ladera</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Wow, the reservation system is still in effect on Torvo?  I started on Torvo 3 1/2 years ago and the reservation system actually worked pretty well, with the way things have changed I would have thought that system to be gone by now.  When I moved to Terris Thule though, it was a completely different story.  Everything is first come first server.  For example, when Gore pops it's a race to see which guild gets there the fastest and gets mobilized.  Despite all the competition things remain friendly and you'll often find one guild helping out another.  It sure makes things exciting when you log on and the guild leader is screaming for everyone to get to DL asap.</div></div><hr />

wow i was bored at work and read about half of that forum...  i sure am glad we dont have to deal with crap like that on sullon zek!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">yeah heh there is alota drama in  torv</div></div><hr />

Really.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Wargbearjumper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I play on Torv with Gangaskhan (Hell, we run in the same Guild even).   Torv has a very odd system.<br />
<br />
Long ago, the top 4-5 guilds basically &quot;agreed&quot; that Older content (Old World/Kunark) was on a reservation system of sorts, and that New Content (Velious and forward was First come, First Serve)    The old world reservations were basically allowed to stay in place so Midlevel guilds could agree on who among them got Fear/Hate/Trak/Gore/Venril and to enforce a small measure of control on how Ragefire was handled.    <br />
<br />
Once Ragefire was taken out of Sol B, and BP and Pants Superior to Kunark became 1 grp Farmable the Reservation system fell into Disuse and Disarray, but now and again, some 35-55 Guild invokes it and starts a Rant-War.<br />
<br />
Warg</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Mrens</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">BB used to have a pretty good reservation system that most seemed to respect...<br />
<br />
Then one of the uber guilds decided one day &quot;Uhhh..no&quot; they started taking mobs as they came. The entire reservation system colapsed. I think hate still runs on that system.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I'd like to make a reservation Friday 9PM to 3AM EST for Orc 1, please........</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">The Rathe uses a reservation system that is extremely detailed.  We have reservations of planes (hate/fear/sky) and we *also* have rotations on certain targets (klandicar, zlandicar, trakannon, severilous, and others).<br />
<br />
In addition to that, we also have race-mobs (talendor, gorenaire, others).<br />
<br />
While there have been one or two instances where this arrangement was not respected, in general those incidents have been few and far between.  We actually hve quite a harmonius little system going.<br />
<br />
I was originally not entirely sold on the idea, because it seemed like it was a system fairly open to abuse, but the people on The Rathe are all very conscientous about it and take it seriously so it has worked out rather well for everyone involved.</div></div><hr />
