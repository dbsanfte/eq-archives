<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I haven't put the aa into Suspend Minion or Pet Hold yet, but I was thinking...<br />
<br />
couldn't you just suspend minion go pull your mob<br />
<br />
root it<br />
<br />
slow it<br />
<br />
and then let your pet out?<br />
<br />
essentially using suspend minion as a hold?<br />
<br />
anyone do this? or am I missing something?<br />
<br />
thks all</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Suspend minion has a cast time where as you can tell a pet to attack at any time with pet hold.<br />
<br />
You can use pet hold at any time even after they've engaged the mob. Like when a mob enrages and you don't want the pet to kill themselves. Suspend minion can only be used when the pet isn't aggro on anything just like summon pet spell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes you could. But there would be a few handicaps to it. SM has a cast time it's like 2 seconds. Next SM1 will strip any and all buffs your pet has and it will lost its wepon if you gave it one. Sm2 will allow your pet's to keep buffs and wepons. The timer on the buffs also stops while the pet is suspened. If you zone with a pet suspened you lose it. <br />
<br />
I have pet hold and got it befor SM. I like it in that you dont have to spam your pet with back off commands. One thing with pet hold is if you use it with muti mobs. Say your pet is on a rooted mob and you want it on a diffrent one. If you use pet hold then tell the pet to attack a diffrent one it will return to the rooted mob. Pet hold dose not clear the pets aggro list like pet back off dose. To put your pet onto a diffrent target you would have to pet hold, pet back off, pet attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dunno since I've not gotten any levels of SM, but from my knowledge it takes like 12 points to get the pet suspended with all buffs and effects, and only 6 points to buy pet hold.  I'd buy SM if I thought I'd ever use it, but the number of situations where that would be needed . . . hardly exist.  <br />
Pet hold works just dandy for me, it makes the doggy MUCH more usable for grouping or soloing.  He becomes quite the asset when he's completely controllable.  I use him for CC purposes mostly . . . Malos, sic pet, cast Turgurs, don't get whacked and interrupted on Turgurs cast.  Mobs always bash you on their first attack round, so if the puppy takes that for me it just goes so much smoother.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's 3 reasons I use Suspend Minion II. <br />
<br />
One, is when I'm soloing in a dungeon. I can fully arm and buff a pet, suspend him, and invis to another safe area for more pulls. <br />
<br />
Two, the buffs on a pet will NOT count down while suspended. You can Avatar a pet, suspend him, and med up without it counting down while you cannibilize.<br />
<br />
Three, Suspending a pet to keep it from chasing after an AA rooted UNSLOWED mob during the initial crowd control of a bad pull. But naturally this could be done ALOT more easily with pet hold.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">My primary use for pet hold is when I am doing LDoN and am the puller.  I do not want my pet to run in and attack a bunch of unslowed mobs, so I tell him to hold.  I also have SM2, and before I had pet hold I used that.  I would suspend my pet, pull, then bring it back out once the mobs were under control.  This works, but it is not convenient and gets old pretty quick (primarily due to a 4-5 secondish cast time on SM2).  Another thing that annoys me about SM is that the pet sends you a tell whenever you suspend or release it, thus quickly filling your tell box with annoying spam.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">SM1 is 5 points and SM2 is 3 points for 8 points total. I love SM because it lets me hop from camp to camp invis without having to remake a pet and rebuff. This really increases my farming ability to make myself money. SM cannot be used like pet hold because if you have aggro (and that means your pet will too) you cannot suspend him until all things are dead. So you CANNOT /pet back, /pet hold and suspend.<br />
<br />
I use SM all the time in raids when we are moving around, or when the mob (like Grummus) you don't want pets around for initial pull, but while fight is going on pets are cheap dps. My BL friend uses SM on LDoNs as a back up pet. Buffs one up, suspend it, then bring up another. Works well when the poo hits the fan and he loses his pet.<br />
<br />
Pet Hold is wonderful, as someone said earlier, for pulling. Although when pet runs into a pack to die, it saves my butt from time to time. These are really great AAs if you want to spend the points on them. It all depends on play style. I wanted to be able to farm junk for money and now I can do much easier with SM.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hail,<br />
<br />
Pet hold is very nice to have when you are raiding &amp; convenient in many other situations.<br />
Suspend Minion2 is very nice to have when you are soloing or making nice long pulls.  It can be handy in Adventures if you know you stand a good chance of killing at least one dog per 90 minute session.  I generally don't have TIME to suspend minion in an Adventure though anymore, because we're moving so fast.<br />
<br />
Still, Suspend Minion2 lets me fully buff dogdog, then go invis and pull the named from the Tactics pit safely.  Then I can unsuspend him for added dps or even just as a safety buffer against that unforseen add.  Very handy to get the pet up w/o mana expenditure AND not having to buff a new pet.  Pretty neat.  Not the best AA since Canni5 by a long shot, but still it has its uses.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Bamce ConstaCani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">i thought someone said you couldn't suspend your pet if it was on a mob hate list, i don't have hold or suspent so i can't comment either way</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is correct, even if you've root parked a mob that hit you a while ago and you've dragged pet back to yourself, he will refuse to suspend. Basically it's better to suspend your pet, pull, crowd control, and then pull pet back out and aim him at whatever target you want.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I've got pet hold and suspend.  I'm not sure which is more useful.  It depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
You can invis with pet suspended.<br />
You can have a spare pet ready if your current pet dies.<br />
If your pet enrages, and manages to live through the fight, you can suspend him, and recall him and his enrage disc is ready to be used once again instead of waiting about 30 minutes.<br />
You can't suspend your pet if he's aggro.<br />
There's a small casting time on suspend which makes it very annoying to use if you are treating it like pet hold.<br />
Saving the pet buffs duration is nice.<br />
<br />
With pet hold, you can play puller and not worry about pet running out to intercept a pull.<br />
You can keep your pet from freaking out on mobs when AEs go off.<br />
You can yank your pet off a mob even if the mob is actively hitting your pet.  This is important for positioning at times or if you forget to pet hold before you go pulling.<br />
<br />
I'd probably go with suspend minion more than pet hold.<br />
It has it's own uses which are more numerous than pet hold.<br />
It also doubles in use as pet hold if you use it right and don't mind suspending/releasing the pet often.<br />
But, if it's time for you to spend points on AAs concerning your pet, you might as well just buy both abilities.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>enarcheos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">If your pet enrages, and manages to live through the fight, you can suspend him, and recall him and his enrage disc is ready to be used once again instead of waiting about 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, I didn't know that, thanks for the info on enrage. Another interesting fact about SM2 is this: You can suspend a fully buffed pet in the same zone before accepting a resurrection. After you're resurrected, you can pull the fully buffed pet back out while still 0m and you've saved about 1200 post-resurrection mana... if you FOS your pet that is =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Something that no one has mentioned yet is the PvP applications of these AA's (by PvP I primarily mean dueling in the arena on a bluebie server).<br />
<br />
Suspended Minion is nice, because you have a pet in your pocket.  You can either pull it out when someone kills your first pet (a very unpleasant surprise), or keep your pet suspended and make it look like you have no pet it all, then pull it out at a time when it would be useful (also an unpleasant surprise).<br />
<br />
Pet hold, on the other hand, isn't very good for pvp.  Its only use, really, is if you are kiting a melee and they decide to stop chasing you and kill your pet.  You can back it off and it will start running towards you (and thus away from your opponent).  This isn't really that great of an advantage, because if you're at the stage of the game where you have AA to spend on pet hold (I didn't buy it until past 300 AA), chances are that any opponent who requires kiting is going to have no trouble at all killing your pet, regardless of whether or not you /back it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">suspend minion and woodelf illusion are a great combination in a duel when you're on /roleplay<br />

Jeez, after 275 aa, NOW you tell me!  I had written suspend minion off as useless, but now I guess I will have to get it &gt;&lt;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your pet is an NPC<br />

/Pet hold clears its aggro list completely<br />

Think hard about why this is good.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">no it doesn't clear his hate list Giac.  But perhaps you are referring to another sort of list? Interesting if true.  I must test.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Tragik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">To put it simply:<br />
<br />
Pet Hold - <br />
1.  Can be used at any time whether in battle or during pulls.<br />
2.  /pet hold followed with /pet back off will effectively put the pet on standby and totally clear it's hate list (pet hold alone will NOT do this it only commands the pet to STOP attacking).<br />
3.  It's useful for avoiding pet aggro and early ill-timed engagement during pulling, mob AE and spell casting, etc.<br />
<br />
Suspend Minion (assuming level 2) -<br />
1.  Pet can be stored indefinitely with all buffs and equipment intact as long as you don't zone, die or log.<br />
2.  If any mob is aggro'd on the pet you cannot suspend it.<br />
3.  Amazingly useful for moving between camps where invis is required.<br />
<br />
Personally I have both on my necro (shaman only has /pet hold [still level 60]) and for me they are both a must-have skill.  Pet suspend is wonderful for moving between camps or simply having a buffed and armed backup pet for those &quot;oh crap&quot; moments.<br />
<br />
Pet Hold is the best thing next to sliced bread.  Pulling casters, using a pet to pull around corners (a shaman pet can single pull anything with /pet attack and /pet hold plus /pet back off that a level 58 could single with a range weapon/spell).<br />
<br />
If I had to recommend which skill to go for first I would say /pet hold then get the suspend skills when you have the spare AAs, but pet hold is defiantly a priority.<br />

<br />
Very wrong. Yes your pet will not attack anything when you use pet hold. But when you tell it to attack it WILL goto the mob that is highest on it's hate list. This means is lets say you have a 2 mob pull. The tank intercepts one and the others starts beating on you. The pet will aggro on the one hitting you. You VP it into the corner and pet chases after it. Ok so you /pet hold, target the one the tank has and /pet attack. Gess what you mutt will go right back to the rooted one. His hate list WAS NOT cleared. To send the pet on a diffrent mob you must /pet back off, which dose clear its hate list. <br />
<br />
Do not mistake the pet's standing there doing nothing with a cleared aggro list they are not one in the same. You maybe mistakeing this with haveing the pet on hold when the mobs are pulled. In that case the pet will not build a hate list untill you tell it to attack.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Whether or not it clears its actual aggro list or not, doesn't really matter, even though, what I have seen indicates its aggro list is cleared for *at least* the time it's on hold. Coupled with your observations it seems, as if the pet's hate list is &quot;on freeze&quot; during this. I'll test it tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Anyways, the effect of this is the same. Think about what happens when the aggro list of an NPC is cleared. <br />
I won't say more, since I'm sure it would get nerfed(not that it's game breaking or anything, just handy). Considering the nature of this &quot;feature&quot; all other pet casters gain more than us from this actually, since their pets are superior to ours.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just went to the Mage forums and found a post that explicitely says how to use /pet hold, so guess, if any Devs care they already know about this.<br />
<br />
Izudin's post from the Mage boards(just copied and pasted the 2nd paragraph):<br />
<br />
&quot;Also another tactic that was suggested was to just put the pet on /pet hold while the mob beats on it. In this mode the pet regens at full speed, so if the mob doesnt do too much damage your pet can still heal.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">With your /pet hold hotkey, just add another line. Mine reads as follows:<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet back off<br />
<br />
THAT will clear his hate list. <br />
<br />
Veni Vidi Vici</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Ok try this. Pull 3 mobs with out haveing your pet on hold. Get all 3 slowed and rooted apart. Let the pet fight with any one of the 3 that it likes for a few seconds. Now /pet hold. Wait a few seconds and target one of the other 2 mobs that your pet was NOT fighting on its own. /pet attack. Now if /pet hold has cleared your pets aggro list (which it hasent) The mutt will go and attack the mob that you &quot;Told&quot; it to. If its aggro list hasnt been cleared then it will go right back to the one that it was on to begine with.<br />
<br />
/pet hold works by makeing it so that your pet cant attack anything. This is in no way tied to its hate list.<br />
<br />
/pet back off works by clearing the pets hate list. That is why you have to spam the pet with it every time the mob hits it or you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Read my post, Snuggle. Whether the hate list of your pet is practically cleared or not, is irrelevant for this. <br />
As I assumed above, it seems like the Pet's hate list is indeed virtually &quot;cleared&quot; for as long as your pet is on hold. However, the moment you order your pet to attack whichever target, it will pick the target that was highest on its hate list, *before* you had put it on hold.<br />
<br />
I tested this extensively tonight. /Pet hold would *virtually* clear its hate list(or as i said in my earlier post &quot;put it on freeze&quot;) in the way described above. While the pet was on hold, it would regen at its natural regen speed, and a few times the pet would outright CH itself in the same way you can see NPCs CH after a succesful memblur. <br />
<br />
An NPC can't regen like that, if anything is on it's hate list. /Pet hold  can be used to make your pet offtank more effectively. I don't know what happens, if you do this with a &quot;Charmed&quot; pet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Look you can say &quot;seems like&quot; and &quot;virtually&quot; till your blue in the face. But the fact remains that if your pet is aggro on mobs A, B, and C when you place in on hold. It will &quot;STILL&quot; be aggro on mobs A,B, and C when you take it off. So that is in fact NOT a cleared aggro list. That the pet is standing there doing nothing. Has nothing to do with a prexsisting aggro list. That it is not adding to it's aggro list while its on hold also has nothing to with a prexisisting aggro list. <br />
/pet back off, clears 100% of all aggro from the pets hate list.<br />
/pet hold, clears no aggro from the list. It simply stops the mutt from attacking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">You are still missing the point. <br />
The pet regens as if the hate list was clear, *** is your problem ?<br />
Till you are showing me an instance where an NPC regens at his natural regen speed, while anything is on his hate list, you will take the &quot;virtually&quot; and &quot;seems like&quot; and like it. <br />
<br />
&quot;The fact&quot; remains that whether the hate list is cleared, temporarily cleared or whatever you like to debate over, holds abosolutely no importance for the purpose of using /pet hold to activate your pets natural regen while offtanking something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Bloxr Fatso</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So basically the question that's being addressed atm is:  &quot;Does the mutt regen at his NON ATTACKING regen rate when on /pet hold AND /pet back off (if you want him off-tanking just have him guard that spot so he doesn't leave mob) if the mob is still beating on him&quot;<br />
<br />
The underlying question is not whether aggro list is completely wiped.  Oh yeah... a possible easy way to test this:  I haven't been to chardok since revamp, but if the low lvl npc is still at zone, pull a normal mob to IZ and have pet solo a mob till it's low hp, then jump in and take the hits and kill the mob.  While finishing the mob sick your pet on the green quest dude and then promptly /pet hold and /pet back off to see if he regens at his normal &quot;fast&quot; regen rate.  Just a thought to make the test easy to check...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">My problem is that your wrong. I have never once said anything about that pets regen while on pet hold. And regen has nothing to do with the pets exsisting aggro list. <br />
<br />
Did a little test thinking that maybe there is a diffrents between hot buttons the pet window and typed commands. I went to PoS and pulled one of the nice little frogs at zone in. I let it beat on me some then rooted it and let the pet tank it for a few. <br />
I hit my pet hold hot button and the mutt comes to me. I target the NPC thats standing there at ZI and hit my pet attack hot button.....<br />
Mutt went to his frind the frog.<br />
Ok /pet back off, open the pet window and click pet attack. Still with the guy targeted....<br />
Mutt went back to the frog.<br />
Well 3's a charm or so fools say. /Pet hold I type in /pet attack with the guy targeted and gess what?<br />
Mutt went right back to the frog.<br />
Now please tell me just when and where pet hold cleared his aggro list? Oh thats right it didnt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Wonder how many times you are going to say that the pet went back to its previous target...Have i said this isn't the case ?<br />
<br />
&quot;Read my post, Snuggle. Whether the hate list of your pet is practically cleared or not, is irrelevant for this. <br />
As I assumed above, it seems like the Pet's hate list is indeed virtually &quot;cleared&quot; for as long as your pet is on hold. However, the moment you order your pet to attack whichever target, it will pick the target that was highest on its hate list, *before* you had put it on hold.&quot;<br />
<br />
See, I am saying the pet went back to its target. Why do you keep acting as if I was debating this or saying it wasn't true?<br />
<br />
Can you explain why the pet regens at its natural regen speed while under the effect of /pet hold? No, well I have been giving you the best explanation, which considers both facts, the pet regening and the pet returning to its target. If you don't like this explanation, I am willing to listen to yours.<br />
<br />
No NPC regens at natural regen speed while anything is on its hate list and the pet only starts doing so, when and while it's on hold. This is a fact your &quot;theory&quot; needs to include as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Lotrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">No Giac, it's not irrelevant. <br />
<br />
Case in point: Target mob A, /pet attack..Oh ****, wrong mob../pet hold before engage. Target mob B, /pet attack. Your pet will go after mob A every single damn time. Why? Mob A is still the primary target on your pet's hate list..ergo, it WAS NOT CLEARED by /pet hold.<br />
<br />
Simplify everything, on your /pet hold hotkey, add a second line that says /pet back off.<br />
<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet back off<br />
<br />
Genious strikes again. Oh wait, it missed...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">My initial post was in correct. It doesnt do anything but stop your pet from attacking period and when you tell it to re attack it will go after the one it hates the most. Guess I was thinking the mob on its hate list would of been dispensed by the time you let it attack again so with no mob to attack it would be set back to null. Anyways I know this and should of stated it more clearly however I play a necro and not only do I hit pet hold but in many cases I will hit /pet fd and then &quot;its&quot; hate list is cleared period. I shall make my pet hold key updated though like you guys have lol dont know why I never did that.<br />
<br />
/pet hold<br />
/pet back off<br />
<br />
Best way to do it with shaman pet. <br />
<br />
And this statement is 100 percent correct-&quot;No NPC regens at natural regen speed while anything is on its hate list and the pet only starts doing so, when and while it's on hold. This is a fact your &quot;theory&quot; needs to include as well.&quot; <br />
<br />
Pretty amazing thing to see if you have a pet focus item which shamans cant use but Mage,Bst, and necro pets that are focused and held with /pet hold regen at an insane rate..300 hp a tic.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Are you guys even reading the posts ?  :confused: <br />
<br />
Yes, the pet will return to the mob(I think everyone in this thread has been saying this at least once, and I have actually yet to see somebody denying it). Yes, /pet back off clears the aggro list(I think every idiot knows this). Yes, this is ****ing irrelevant, since my point was the pet regens at its natural regen speed while under the effect of /pet hold(which, as we know, only happens when an NPCs hate list is cleared), whether or not its hate list is cleared, put on freeze, temporarily ignored or whatever.<br />
<br />
I have given the best explanation I could come up with for this phenomenon(I want to emphasize again that this is irrelevant for the effect I was pointing out though).<br />

Again, /pet back off or the fact that the pet returns to its first target hold no relevance for this useful &quot;feature&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Quoted-&quot;/Pet hold clears its aggro list completely&quot;<br />
<br />
Completely a false statement. So don't accuse people of not reading your posts. The fact your pet regens its health back like his hate list is cleared is completely irrelevant. Its 2 different things totally.</div></div><hr />

In this thread there are two different ideas:<br />
- /pet hold doesn't clear list and /pet back off does<br />
- /pet hold makes pet regen faster <br />
<br />
One seems to be confirmed, the other does not, but both ideas are independant.</div></div><hr />
