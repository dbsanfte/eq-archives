I am not a big poster, but a longtime lurker here in the Glade.  I have an assorted bunch of characters on Drinal..moved over from Mith Marr way back.<br />
<br />
I play a 50 Ranger Human Tunare there named Mycah.  My parter in game is a 48 Ranger half elf Tunare named Arkiana.<br />
<br />
We have already begun the supply quest for a bow and have been looking avidly in game for a fletcher high enough to make the bow.<br />
<br />
We currently have 8 branches of planar oak and 8 oak bark tannins.  We wanted to get enough in case of failures as we know the rate is high.  We could easily get the rest of that list together with no troubles and would gladly donate leftover items or cash for your futures needs.<br />
<br />
Currently my ranger is guildless..but I was in Grey Bear Clan on Mith Marr..and then Wayfarer's Haven for most of Drinal until its demise last fall.<br />
<br />
Congrats on your accomplishments fellow Ranger! Send me a tell in game if there is anything you need...I also have a 52 enchanter that can enchant the mithril if needed.<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<br />
238 5 attempts at 233 dex then got a glowing black sword to get me to 245 dex 13 attempts<br />
239 5<br />
240 83 !!! Bwahhhhhh<br />
241 14<br />
242 2<br />
243 7<br />
244 2<br />
245 11<br />
<br />
(by this time my guild were chanting and saying do we here 246 , going once going twice .... then i go LD heheh)<br />
<br />
Then my ISP packed up as Kuvu appeared<br />
<br />
For info 3 hours work last night to prep for 100 mithril combines (would have been less but was in constant tells with many people because a valued Guildie died on Tuesday in RL<br />
/mourn Kinaman aka Matt )<br />
<br />
100 Combines<br />
34 Successes<br />
6 skill ups<br />
245 Dex<br />
<br />
So success rate is still horrid</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was attempting to master fletching, but gave up after a short bout of fletching mithril champion arrows.<br />
<br />
80 combines at 255 DEX.  Zero skillups.  Adios plats.  :(<br />
<br />
So I'm sitting here at 205 skill, I'll have to leave it at that.  <br />
<br />
In the mean time, I've got some leftover mithril arrowheads you can have, and a geerlock tool in case you haven't been using one.;)<br />
<br />
I also suggest making all of your components for the arrows next time in Gfay, then porting over to NFP or Thurg for a DEX buff or boon to get that extra push to 255 DEX.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Llegolas</div><div class="date">05-17-2002, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">OMG, Kinaman died???  :(<br />
<br />
I had no idea.  I've grouped with him in the past, very nice fellow.  Very sad when something like that happens, even if only knew them online.  /mourn</div></div><hr />

Only a few officers in the guild knew about it he asked us to keep quiet about it.<br />
<br />
The guild are shocked as it was a complete surprise to them and he was helpful, enthuisiastic and friendly till the very end.<br />
Sorta makes all the rest of the rubbish insignificant, he knew hed never get epics or phat lot or 60th yet still played to have fun with his friends.  Personally Ive never met anyone that brave before</div></div><hr />

Many thanks to Zhemau a fellow glader for the 2 bds he donated and Nuvin my guildie for being my mule.  Thanks also to Kuvu for pushing me to complete when i was depressed and all the rangers on Drinal who supported and cheered me.<br />

You must be doing something right.  My luck has been more like Llegolas':  &quot;80 combines at 255 DEX. Zero skillups. Adios plats&quot;   I have spent about 20k and am just 219 skill.  What's depressing for me is that it took you three attempts at 250. I might still keep trying though.  I was quite rich and didn't have much I wanted to buy with my plat anyway.</div></div><hr />

Im English and we used Longbows for ages you colonials had native american short bows so we have intrinsic knowledge<br />
<br />

<br />
i put lotr soundtrack on<br />
<br />
i went rough darkwood compound darkwood mithril arrows<br />
<br />
i prepped 100 mithril combines at a time<br />
didnt need last 26 sets so gave them to lonehert<br />
he has given up skilling up he wants a bow from me<br />
he had nada skillups from lots of attempts with mithril with 255 dex<br />

<br />
I was looking through you list above of the things I need to provide you for attempts and have 3 questions.<br />
<br />
1.  The smithy hammer.  I thought it was returned after a combine?<br />
<br />
2.  The scent of marrs are used to make the celestial essence.  Do you need both? Or, did you mean you needed the celestial solvent?<br />
<br />
3.  I checked the recipe and saw only 1 large brick of acrylia needed per attempt? Is that info wrong and it is in fact two? If so..UGH as that is the hardest part for me to gather atm hehe<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance..talk to you in game.<br />
<br />
I have almost everything needed for 3 attempts. Will be in touch.<br />

My enchanter is parked in nexus/bazaar these days, so if you need a Boon of Garou, you can send me a tell and I will help you with your combines.<br />
<br />
I see you know Zhemau as well. Is it me does he seem like the Opie Cunnigham of the ranger class? ( I posted this once before here but I thought it was worth repeating.)<br />
<br />
I am very sorry to here about the loss of your guildmate. In the end, the game is about people, not loot, levels, etc. My sympathies go out to your guildmates and other friends of Matt. The loss of a person at what I assume to be a very young age is tragic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 05:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thanks Philby<br />
<br />
Mycah all the items are on threads here or eqtraders about the bow but the 4th is double reinforced hence 2 bds for 2 celestial tempers 2 l bricks arylia 2 l bricks enchanted mithril<br />
the smithy hammer is bugged and poofs on both reinforcing combines</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Graywolf Longleaf</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 09:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">242 skill now.  I took the path Ueauvan did: rough darkwood (to 215), compound darkwood (to 235) and mithril arrows for the rest.  My average is 1 skill up per 40 combines with the mithril arrows.  Ueauvan is a lucky bastage.   I would be at 280 skill with his luck ;) but I will get there sooner or later :) and be broke  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 10:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No fair Im English and I know my parents !!!<br />
<br />
We just know how to make bows hehehe<br />
<br />
WTG Graywolf youll get there do 100 mithril combines at a time, its a pain getting that many prepped but it worked for me<br />
<br />
2 hints have LOTR soundtrack on and have fletching book open it cant hurt and it seemed to help me</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ueauvan</div><div class="date">05-20-2002, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at my numbers average tries to<br />
215 from 210 is 36<br />
235 from 216 is 18<br />
250 from 236 is 17<br />
<br />
so a stack of mithril post 235 Graywolf per skill up<br />
At 245 dex from 242 that would be 8 stacks 160 combines<br />
with estimate of 34 percent success no geerlok so 53 time 5 so 265 arrows to dump</div></div><hr />

This is with Wis at 255.  I need a break from even trying right now...I'll come back to it someday.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rotane Shagaminn</div><div class="date">02-19-2003, 11:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rwar, you guys are smarter than me on your skill ups.  <br />
<br />
I went Darkwood also to 215, then I went to acrylia arrows.  It cost me 8kp to go from 202 to 215 with 285 dex.  Acrylia blocks are expensive on torv, averaging about 75pp each.   With 285 dex I averaged about one skill up every 45 to 50 combines from 215 to 245.  It was much higher than that, but I went from 240 to 245 in 19 combines.  <br />
<br />
I am still at 245, just hit it last night, and my total cost is over 50k.  Not that I mind that, it is just ironic because I researched this and felt I went the most inexpensive route (oops).  Only thing I will say about doing it this way, is that if your patient and don't need to skill up immediately, and don't mind spending a little extra, you can easily get your supplies in the bazaar over a couple of months and do all the combines in SH at the dwarf forge.  There isn't a ton of running around.  Of course, compound bows might even be easier still.</div></div><hr />
