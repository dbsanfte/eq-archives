<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkfox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I do not really see a benefit with this spell. I know you get an extra 5 WIS, and something about HP regen but that is all greek to me. Someone told me there was a mana regen bonus, but looking at the info I have and while sitting around I didn't see that occur.<br />
<br />
Also you realize how hard it is to tell when you are siting or standing? Sheesh, sometimes I have to move the arrow keys just to see if I move or not :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">form of the great bear existed before the level 29 version was added to the game.  it gives 10 wis and 2 hp/tick regen...  Lasts a while to.  There's really no reason not to cast it, it's a free 10 wis and 2 hp/tick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you refer to Lucy (http://lucy.fnord.net/) it tells you what Form of the Bear (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=2523&amp;source=Live) does. Also, bear form adds infravision if you're a blind Barbarian.</div></div><hr />
