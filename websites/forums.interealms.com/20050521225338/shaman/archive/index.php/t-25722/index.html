Are there really people out there who didnt post because of the rep system? Are there people who changed their opinion on an issue based on it? My gosh, I hope not, if so then we are truly doomed as a species. <br />
<br />
Heres why I liked the rep system. It was FUN. Yeah, it was broken, and lame, and stupid, but it was FUN. I used it all the time. I commented on peoples posting in rep bumps I made to them (always signed). I didnt give out ANY bad reps, only good. If a post was bad, I just left it be. If a post was really good, I pos bumped it, EVEN IF I DISAGREED! There are a bunch out there who know this is true, because I signed em all. <br />
<br />
See, I compare this to the nerfing of the DE mask in 1999. There was no real reason to nerf that item. It was a fun part of the game that people loved. Its actual benefits were actually fair, shrinking for large races, etc. But they took it out, and it ruined the fun. Now we have potions of EVERYTHING. They took out the on-screen co-ords too. Now we have a compass and maps. They FORCED you to hit Sense heading, now you start at 200. <br />
<br />
Rep was fun. It didnt hurt anyone, and in fact, it gave people a private avenue to express their opinion without posting to the thread. I got a lot of bumps, both pos and neg, with legit points in them. Since I was never a guy to back down from a MB Fight, I ended up getting a LOT of rep bumps. It just so happened the pos outweighed the negs and I moved up. <br />
<br />
Trolls came. They negged a lot of people for stupid reasons. Then they left, and went to Druids Grove or whatever. And truth be told, SOME negative bumps actually MADE ME THINK. I remember one inparticular, guy said &quot;I agree with what your saying, but do you have to be so snotty and abrasive about it? If your right, your right, move on, no reason to bury someone in your self-rightousness&quot;. It was unsigned, and it was a big neg hit. I re-read the post in question, and damned if he wasnt spot-on. I was rude, I was abrasive, and I didnt need to be. Probably affects how I post to this day. <br />
<br />
Anyway, its just a thing. If anyone stopped posting or coming here because of the system, I am saddened by that. If anyone changed their opinion becuse of neg bumps, that bothers me. But I dont really think these things are true. I think MOST of the people had fun with it, but the squeaky-wheel minority was, once again, the loudest, therefore, its gone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Sunmoon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Well, based on this thread alone, it's pretty overwhelming that most people didn't like it.

<br />
Actually Sunmoon, if you really wanted to know if more people liked or disliked it you would run a poll..... judging because more people actually post on a topic is not the best method of figuring out this answer. I might run a poll anyway unless you removed that because 3 people complained one time back in March 03 that they didn't like it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Upset? lol, I am laughing at the angst some of you suffer because of it.... I averaged several reputation bumps a week myself, some were signed, most not. Some were rude, a couple offensive, some supportive. I didn't go home and beat my wife if I got another &quot;**** moron&quot; bump.... <br />
<br />
The use of the words cowardly, spineless, etc. are the things that make me laugh. You are asking the wrong person about being upset over this Wulfbane. I always found the system amusing. The only thing I don't like is that once again made up numbers win the day. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I honestly don't know whether to laugh hard or cry and feel pity in front of the ignorance and sheer stupidity of many people.<br />
<br />
Upon reading Slowd's post I once again saw myself put in front of this essential question: Pity him for even thinking something that pathetic or laughing and being amused about the amount of inherent stupidity?<br />
<br />
Earlier today I received a Private Message which actually made me realize that there's another approach and another option. This was the PM:<br />
<br />

Justice is great ain't it. And you now have no Grieving tool.<br />

<br />
Now, I am not Sherlock Holmes, but I remember often thinking that Slowd and Gagner, even though probably not the same person, were pretty close friends in game and possibly in RL which would support the study and theory of a few very respected sociologists that people who live close and/or spend much time together start to behave and think the same way. Even the level of intelligence seems to be almost identical, if they grew up together.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I am digressing, so back to the point. The other option beside laughing and feeling sorry is to point out openly how stupid they are to the people in question. This might help them realize that they need help and eventually they might find it a good idea to see a psyachiatrist. So here we go:<br />
<br />
Gagner67, you hopeless moron, I wanted you and everyone to know that whenever I felt the need to flame you for your ignorance I did so openly and never once &quot;negged&quot;, let alone &quot;grieved&quot; you.<br />
<br />
Furthermore I'd like somebody to explain to me how the hell one would feel &quot;grieved&quot; by the rep system. It's not like people could abuse it to stop you from posting and you should know that best as useless as your posts were.<br />
<br />
PS. Don't make kids!<br />

Gagner67 could not affect your rep if he tried.  Not only was he banned, but he had so many red dots Tikoko was jealous.  All he could do was PM or text a small, and likely wortless fragment, which actually worked well for him because the more he opened his pie hole, the more he sounded like like the president of the hilary duff fanclub.</div></div><hr />

You are correct, I did not mean that.  I meant &quot;couldn't&quot;.  Whew, was a rushed day, thought I might have accidently slipped in something offensive or typed in the reply box while cussing out a vendor in email.  Thanks for letting me know.</div></div><hr />

I *do* realize that you have a hard time understanding any text that exceeds 4 words, but I know, if you try hard enough, even you can do it. <br />
Reading my post again, you might notice that I said I had received that PM from Gagner that very day(so much for &quot;bringing up a post from the far past&quot;).<br />
 <br />
That would be step 1 and already a huge success in my eyes. The next step would be to put those words into context, then you might notice that Gagner is accusing me of using the Rep system as a &quot;Grieving tool&quot;. <br />
<br />
But hey, you'd understand that too well if you wanted to, since you have been using his same words in other threads concerning the Rep system.<br />
<br />
I do appreciate your effort at being witty by insinuating that I am bitter about the removal of the Rep system, but I honestly believe you are pushing your limits considering your scarce reading comprehension. <br />
<br />
Maybe you should work on that first and after a bit you might realize that I give a rat's ass about the Rep system, and that I find it absurdly amusing that some of the people in favor of its removal(like you) are celebrating this as some sort of &quot;newly-gained&quot; freedom of speech or maybe they just hope that their ignorance will now be less apparent.</div></div><hr />

  The best thing about the rep system had been that you could only affect someone else's rep if you had one already.  It meant that trolls or flamers couldn't actually use it to any abusive affect (of course since low rep didn't actually do anything how &quot;abusive&quot; it could have been is a loose concept)</div></div><hr />
