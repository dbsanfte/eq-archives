<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can anybody ABSOLUTELY verify that Improved Damage II focus effect items such as Imperial Wardog Collar add 20% to JBB damage?

Replies only from people who have tried this themselves please... no speculation...<br />

PS. I am sure this has been answered before but one just cannot search on 'JBB' on these forums due to 4 letter minimum.</div></div><hr />

bump* I am VERY curious too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well not sure about the Improved Focus II items but I do know the the ring I got off the lvl 56 Mage today did not do diddle dee for me.  Though if an Improved Focus II item did help then I would be very interested in it myself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Kintai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">they do not, i had a PMM from solb for a while, when i did have a JBB, and no alternate effect was noted on the damage done by the right click.  to note:  no affliction / spell haste / whatnot items work on epic, or other odd right clicks <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">no focus items affect a jbb and if it does its a bug and your setting yourself up for a huge disappointment if they fix it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>howie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">:confused:  Don't know if this is relavant, but just read one of the threads yesterday that talked about Improved DMG focus working on the procs of a Barbarian Spiritist hammer.  He stated that the proc with the focus item was 312 vice the normal 263.  Not sure if this is intended or a bug as stated above.  But, it's a decent jump considering mine procs 5 or 6 times an encounter on avg.  Over the length of a fight that could be an extra 300dmg.  Can't wait to try it out for myself with a mages summoned dealy!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I recall the 360 druid dot that's a right click on their kunark arms and velious bracers was affected by extended affliction III items, although this was awhile back and I'm not sure if the recent changes to affliction focus items have changed that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rebelheart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think this is just another VI bug or whatever<br />
to answer the question; Nope it doesnt.<br />
BUT when u have extend enhancement item and click your blackfur boots, u will find out it trigger EE focus...<br />
So why not JBB? i dunno, perhaps prevent being overpowered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Focus effects make you better at casting real spells. When activating an item you are not using your own spell casting ability, but that of the items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Thanks everyone for clearing this up.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Focus effects do not affect activated spells - period.<br />
<br />
There is at least one exception - the Burnt Wood Staff (mage only 333 point clicky bolt). All relevant foci work for it.<br />
<br />
Not that it makes a difference for a shaman of course.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">There is at least one exception - the Burnt Wood Staff (mage only 333 point clicky bolt). All relevant foci work for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You are absolutely correct. While Foci used to work with clickies when they first introduced them, they changed that pretty soon. The only exception being &quot;bolt type DD's&quot;. Bolts that are triggered are still affected by Foci which would affect the actuall spell as well. <br />
This is due to the nature of these spells. <br />
I can only attribute it to the inherent delay(while the bolt travels) between the actual cast and the impact on your target, that these type of spells share.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Trevurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oddly enough my Shadowknight's extended affliction item DOES affect the darkness spell off his Blood Ember Gauntlets - even post affliction focus change thanks to it being a damage spell in addition to a snare.<br />
<br />
So it's not QUITE as simple as &quot;Focus effects do not affect activated spells - period.&quot;<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's related to the kind of focus?<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's a &quot;hybrid thing&quot;?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Branoic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">It probably still wont work.. but focus 2 items only work on 44 under, since jbb affect is 45, maybe a foucs 3 or 4 is needed if anyone has a foucuse 3 or 4 might be worth a try... <br />
<br />
anyways it still probably wont work.. but if anyone gets a chance to test would be worth knowing..<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>WalkNot SoSoftly</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So the Pox on the Elemental Legs isnt effected by Foci effects as well?  Can anyone out there confirm this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shaben</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have a totemic breastplate, which has extended enhancement II. I also have a lot of jaundice armour.<br />
<br />
For the buffs from this armour (level 44 spells, click works at 45), the breastplate &quot;shimmers&quot;, or whatever it is that it does when it activates. I can't say for certain that the buffs are actually longer, but the extended enhancement definately goes off.<br />
<br />
Soooo, if it was going to work with the jbb, it would only have to be a level II focus item. However, it doesn't sound like it does, so I guess this doesn't matter.<br />

<br />
Incorrect.<br />
<br />
My War Charm of Crossed Blades (Druzzils Distance) goes off for my Blackflame sphere (GRC effect).  It definitely affects distance on it.<br />
<br />
I don't really know the why's for why some things work and some do not, but its easier to assume it won't work and be pleased if it does.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My thinking was that as Winter's Roar was a level 34 spell that a focus effect II item would be all that was needed.<br />
<br />
Anyway I borrowed a Wurm Scale Coat (Improved Damage II) and tried it out. No, it doesn't work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>rodain1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I can attest to the fact that summon mage focus items does not increase the JBB effect.  focus items are used for casted spells not effect type spells from armor and weapons<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">See ,w aaaaay back in the day focus did effect JBB , i remember that , but it was viewed as overpowered , which it was kinda , so it was nerfed so that no focus efffects would work with it. Now i know other things work with focus effects, but im pretty confident in saying that there will never be a focus effect to work with jbb and if there is one, itll be promptly &quot;fixed&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hibbert</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Focus effects and AA's affect at least some combat procs.
