<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Argaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Level51 Ranger here, looking for a good place to solo (have fungi+) or duo with a 49 shaman. Thanks in advance for any ideas!<br />
<br />
Karnors just really stinks! :)</div></div><hr />

Fear kite the animals in Jaggedpine, as well.<br />

You can try to solo or duo the elementals in the Hole, at the entrance.  I do not remember what the level for a single pull is, however.  You might need to hit 52 before you can single pull those.  They're good to 54.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Nocture</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">defidently choose JP, the griffs in there got me from 51 to 53 in about 10 hours of play time, and with your fungi on, you should have no downtime(Snare and Fear barely cost any mana)  the xp was uber at 48, but its still pretty good at 51-55, i think that the elementals in the hole are a bit high for 51, wait till like 57+ to go there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">The elemental warriors at the entrance to the Hole were a good place for me to solo at 52.  Didn't try before that.  Was doing them before getting Swiftwind and before a fairly major equipment upgrade.  With self buffs, it took some mana to stay alive (ie - to heal myself) but I did not need to break out Swarmcaller or anything like that to slow them either.  The crusaders hit me too hard now, at 54, to try to solo them, with better gear than I'd had doing the warriors, and with half the epic.  Self buffed entirely, ie - no aego, no clarity I could keep the first 3 or 4 spawns down on my own.  With KEI I could keep all 6 of them down, though there wasn't enough med time between the last and the first respawn.<br />

They are definately doable to a solo ranger, and well before 57.  Heck, at 54 most of them are light blue.  None are green yet, but very few are dark blue . . .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vanyarian Singollo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's the ol' tried and true bats and bugs in SolB (Nagafen's Lair).  Served me VERY well and is very easy to learn.  Other than that I recommend Jaggedpine.</div></div><hr />
