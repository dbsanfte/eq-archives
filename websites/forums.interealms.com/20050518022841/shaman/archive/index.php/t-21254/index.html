<br />
Happy Cinco De Mayo!<br />
<br />
EverQuest 2 Beta Sign Ups are now open!<br />
<br />
Make sure you sign up for the exciting EverQuest 2 beta!  Join the folks who have already added their name to the rapidly growing list for this amazing beta opportunity. <br />
<br />
Go to www.everquest2.com and click on the beta link to get your chance at a beta slot!  I hope to see you in the beta!<br />
<br />
Sign up now, tomorrow may be too late.<br />
<br />
<br />
Headlines!<br />
--------------------<br />
- You now have the ability to remove your own surname!<br />
- All characters will regen HP faster when sitting!<br />
- /rewind is back and ready for action!<br />
<br />
<br />
Surnames<br />
--------------------<br />
You can now use the /surname command to remove your own surname and add a new one.  Please remember to read the naming policy as listed on EQlive.station.sony.com as it applies to both first names and surnames.  You will still need to ask for CS assistance if you wish to have a name with double capitals or special characters.  Please note that this command can only be used to remove or change your surname once per week.<br />
<br />
HP Regen<br />
---------------------<br />
- All characters should now regenerate HP faster when sitting.  The longer you sit, the faster you regenerate! <br />
- You will not receive increased regen while under the effects of a DOT or while feigned.<br />
- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%.<br />
- You can now bandage while sitting.<br />
<br />
<br />
/rewind<br />
----------------------<br />
/rewind is back and should help if you find yourself stuck.  This is not an automatic rewind, you will have to execute the command.  We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the near future. This command is only able to be used once every 30 seconds, and in order to make use of it, your character will need to be stationary for at least 30 seconds.<br />

ROFL, CoH has given SOE the ****s,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">How does this show SOE is scared of CoH? This patch does nothing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i dont think CoH is really someone SoE is worrying over, this patch does do more then nothing.<br />
<br />
Increased regen and binding wound will defeintly help people level up their toons IMHO. Nice changes but nothing earthshattering i agree.<br />
<br />
The surname thing was a no brainer, this should have been done ages ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
On a side note, did anyone see the WoW review on x-play? It looked really nice and got high marks. Was nice to SEE and not read about the game for a change.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Its further evidence of the knee-jerk 'dumbing-down' of the game in response to products that draw EQ subscribers away.<br />
<br />
If you have been paying attention over the last year or so as more MMORPG's arrive on the market, more 'point and click' features arrive in EQ.<br />
<br />
Seriously, think about it, what does increased sitting regen do for a gamer...it caters for the casual gamer...whats the most popular feature of CoH so far? .. it accomodates the casual gamer<br />
<br />
You can now remove your surname...well that was right up the top of the list of '10 things EQ subscribers want the most' was'nt it?/sarcasm off ... but it is another simplification of the experience, in contrast to the RP experience G&lt;'s have been jamming down our throats from go-live.<br />
Surely you have noticed the name-nazis have all but dissapeared.<br />
<br />
I'm not bashing it, I'm a casual gamer so suits me fine, maybe I'll start playing my Berzerker again now I know I can regen nough for another fight while I do a jigsaw with my son.<br />
<br />
I'll bet my house on more and more 'dumb' features making thier way in to the game in the coming months as CoH sucks away clientle and WoW does the same.</div></div><hr />

       So right ,this patch do NOTHING . I guest they're no high end problem...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">actually there arent that much High end problems atm afaik. <br />
What problems are you reffering to?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Cush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Actually, I've always thought they should have increasing hp &amp; mana regen, the longer you stay sitting.<br />
<br />
Before the mass of FT &amp; Regen items, and all the high regen spells, it really sucked to sit for 10 minutes to regain mana/hp.  Why deliberately design your product to force people to find something to do, while playing your game?<br />
<br />
I've always seen it as a design flaw - excessive downtime requiring an alternate timewaster like Gems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>stygiana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">actually there arent that much High end problems atm afaik. <br />

<br />
And soon there will be no more high end either because every high end guild left for greener pastures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>salorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">And soon there will be no more high end either because every high end guild left for greener pastures.<br />
<br />
That might be another issue, yes.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">And soon there will be no more high end either because every high end guild left for greener pastures.<br />
<br />
Who can possibly tell if the pastures are greener anywhere else yet. CoH is far too young, does it have a problem at the &quot;end game&quot;?<br />
<br />
WoW is still in beta. Changes are being made regularly, some small,but some rather big. And no one knows ANYTHING about their end-game.<br />
<br />
This obsession with new games, and the subsequant dissing of EQ is REALLY beginning to bother me. EQ, from 1-65, is a FANTASTIC GAME. Problems do not begin to surface until YEARS of play. Honestly, if they released EQ right now, say, minus PoP and up, except with LDoN, and no one knowing anything, how long would it be before the &quot;issues and problems&quot; were discovered? A while, thats for sure. <br />
<br />
There have been other games. Whole guilds were disbanded because of DAoC. AO, SWG, these all chunked away at the play base, but look around. EQ is STILL thriving. Yeah, a lot of higher end players are leaving for WoW. <br />
<br />
DUHHHHH<br />
<br />
Those people have PLAYED EQ to its Max. What happens when you &quot;max out&quot; CoH or WoW? How long will it take? Will it be enough fun to KEEP you that long?<br />
<br />
Only time can answer these questions. They certainly arent answerable now. In the meantime, I am gonna log into EQ, work on some tradeskills, or maybe XP, or maybe camp some loots to sell for cash to fund my tradeskilling, or maybe go on a raid, or maybe start a new twink . . . <br />
<br />
Stop dissing EQ so bad until someone comes along and THOROUGHLY dominates this market like it has. EQ deserves SOME pprops, lets give em that much of a courtesy, eh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the near future...<br />
<br />
Hehe 'near future' is how long exactly?<br />
<br />
Kidding aside, i think they should make /rewind a normal game feature, assuming they can prevent major exploits with timers. Does anyone really believe, they can get rid of ALL collision and stuck issues?</div></div><hr />

We've been trying to do The Rathe Council for the last 3 nights.  Constant LDs, lockups, and zone crashes make it rather difficult.</div></div><hr />

Just did Rathe sunday and 2 box'd a chanter too so I could tash TM mobs.  I didnt lock up, go LD, or zone crash at all the whole day.  Doesnt sound like its directly related to high end.</div></div><hr />

We can only hope.  But it's probably more like cutting off one head and having another growing back in it's place.</div></div><hr />

just because &quot;you&quot; didn't lock up .. doesn't mean there arent' LD and lockup problems in earth B<br />
<br />
there definately are .. and with the rathe all it takes is a tank or a cleric to go LD to put your entire raid in jeapordy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, we have had a &quot;lucky few&quot; who also have not had problems.<br />
<br />
But, then again, that lucky few is in the extreme minority, because almost everyone who has been on these raids the last three nights has experienced it.<br />
<br />
We have a few guildmates who LD or lockup as soon as they get back from a 15 minute 1018 session because they went LD or locked up.  It's an ugly cycle, but hopefully, it's fixed.</div></div><hr />

Agree!!!!!!  After X years of playing this game, are you really surprised if there is not much left?  I mean come on!  How many games out there can you play for so many years?? <br />
<br />
Morpg's have exploded in the last few years.  Try em out, have some fun.  Or play something else entirely.  Be grateful that one game has sustained you as long as it did.  Its a rare thing.  Thats a lot of memories, alot of screenshots...but it cannot last forever.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>stewardx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">The LDs issues on RC are for real and a real PITA.  I have not had the issues but watching a good third of the guild go LD contantly really makes the encounter abysmal.  Its the last encounter our guild needs to get to time so we have been hitting it hard and its really begining to wear folks down.  The make up of this encounter makes the LD issues that much worse.  It bogs things down, making the entire event take longer to set up and can and does cause wipes or near wipes which take time to recover from.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Unfortunatly, I am at work....but I would like to know how significant the sitting regen amounts are at various levels.  Assuming they are feeding off of DAOC ideas, our regen spells stacked on a sitting person become quite significant now.  Not so much in the high end game, but up to the 50s it will make a huge improvement I think.<br />
<br />
I too am shocked that there is no further news about character lock-ups and mass LD problems.  Had a guide actually tell me it could be my lack of memory (2 gig) :P  My bot is the biggest problem, he lasts about 20 secs in PoK in prime-time.  512X256....not too shabby on the bot IMO.  I have even dropped all the eye candy settings and still have the same problem.<br />
<br />
On another note, CoH is a pretty cool game.  It isn't an EQ killer IMO, but like a previous poster said...It's a breath of fresh air.  I still laugh every time EQ2 messages come across on patches, because I think it is going to be a huge flop.  If SOE was smart, EQ2 would be EQ with the new graphics engine.  Once up, transfer all characters over and trash these P.O.S. servers we play on now.  <br />

Happy Cinco De Mayo!<br />
<br />
<br />
hmm i never knew the dev team was hispanic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hail,<br />
<br />
Someone on my server reported eventually getting regen up to 72hp per tick.<br />
Started off slow, then ramped up to 72 per tick.  He was surmising it would have gone even higher if he'd had more hp to regen.  The actual regen acceleration curve hasn't been derived yet by players to my knowledge.<br />
<br />
Now the question I have is whether sitting on a horse or drogmar will get you the sitting regen rate? :D   If so, we just got a nice boost outdoors, effectively cutting the our canni4 damage in half every other tick. :cool:  Duo pairs should be able to capitalize nicely, though soloers won't get full advantage since you will have to move around to pull and reset your sit regen rate to base.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

A lot of people celebrate Cinco de Mayo. it may not be a National Holiday, but for many people it's an excuse to put on a hawaiian shirt and drink yourself stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We dont have that holiday here in NZ, but hell if thats all thats how you celebrate I'm starting today.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Being on a horse isn't sitting regen, so it's very unlikely to benefit from this change. A guy on the rogue board regenned 8K hits in 10 minutes (regen rate is a function of hits). That's not nearly enough to make soloing practical for any high level character.<br />
<br />
I think the main reason is that, given the low population 1-65, they realised that melee were becoming extremely hard to get to useable levels. So the intention is to make it suck less to be a mid-level melee forced to solo. Not exactly game breaking or game saving IMHO.</div></div><hr />

I am gonna go out on a limb and get flamed back to the stoneage now.<br />
What I meant with highend is Uqua, as most highend guilds are exactly there or further (TR, AO and HnE I think). I actually think 10 or more guilds only on our server are on Rathe and most of those guilds are not highend guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Frakass</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Bugs are everywhere in EQ atm. Customer service is shatty (I like Aashlanne alot but I doubt anything will change).<br />
<br />
Plane of earth B has been very &quot;nice&quot; with us but we managed to get time flaged. <br />
<br />
day 1 : <br />
finding what councilmen are mezable or not, then partial wipe after 8 controled councilmen due to learning mistake in pulls.<br />
<br />
day 2 :<br />
6 mezzed councilmen then move to tank the next 6 ones. zone rollback --&gt; pissed people go to bed.<br />
<br />
day 3 : <br />
Avatar of earth dead. All happy about getting potime flagged after many months delay. We do loot and zone freeze, rollback and all but 10 lose flags<br />
<br />
day 4 : <br />
Avatar of earth dead. no problem except the usual LDs.<br />
<br />
day 5 :<br />
Avatar of earth dead. Login server mostly down so some camped toons miss flag again because PP depops before we can log them in.<br />
<br />
day 6 :<br />
soon ...<br />
<br />
having to do rathe council 4 times to flag our 130ish toons just sucks.<br />
<br />
After the rollback when we lost flags, GM refused to help (not a surprise) and said he had no logs for PoEb. we were not glad and he told us to email his supervisor .... Email was send the next day... Almost 2 weeks later, email is still unanswered...</div></div><hr />
