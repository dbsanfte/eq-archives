<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Since I'm sure everybody doesn't have a brand new video card that can handle all the features and I'm unsure what will and will not be on by default, this may prove to be useful for everyone come tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Quick system specs: Athlon 1ghz, 512mb ram, 32mb Geforce 2 GTS AGP, Win XP w/ SP2<br />
<br />
Right now, you'll see an &quot;Advanced&quot; button at the bottom of the &quot;Display&quot; tab in the Options, but it's greyed out. Tomorrow, it will not be. In this advanced menu are some more advanced options, some of which, you may or may not be able to use, or have any use for except to make things pretty.<br />
<br />
If you have an older video card, some of these may cause a crash until you disable them in the eqclient.ini. Right now, my eqclient.ini contains the following...<br />
<br />
VertexShaders=FALSE<br />
20PixelShaders=0<br />
1xPixelShaders=0<br />
WaterSwap=0<br />
Shadows=0<br />
<br />
... if I turn shadows on, chain desktop crashes. I had to go into the file and change Shadows=1 to Shadows=0 in order to STOP crashing.<br />
<br />
Shadows are self explanatory, but look to require a DX9 card to pull it off and, chances are, will be quite a performance hit. The rest of the options seem to be a bit more &quot;fail safe&quot; and won't cause chain-crashing if you turn them on and can't support them. However, if you are having serious performance problems, here would be another place to go in and turn things off or on, depending on your taste.<br />
<br />
There's also 2 sliders. One for Actor Clip Plane, another for Shadow Clip Plane. Both should be fairly self-explanatory. Shadow Clip Plane being how far away you can see shadows, actor clip plane being how far away you can see PCs and NPCs (similar to the &quot;Hide traders&quot; option in Bazaar, but as you get close, they'll start appearing, and it works anywhere).<br />
<br />
I'm unsure on the dynamic update interval and dynamic sky reflection size options, as my card can't handle much of the advanced options anyway. Additionally, if you are having performance problems, try turning Level of Detail on. What that does is make people/objects farther away, use less processing power to show up.<br />
<br />
I'll say this, the actor clip plane will be real nice for those with sub-par machines, especially in the Omens zones. No more staring at walls maybe!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hail,<br />
 32mb Geforce 2 GTS AGP<br />
Frankly I'm surprised you were able to play OoW at all.<br />
I just upgraded from a horribly lagged 32MB Nvidia TNT2 AGP to a 64MB Nvidia Geforce4 PCI (another ancient card, but it was free from a friend) recently.  <br />
<br />
One of the reasons I couldn't explore GoD safely was due to extreme lag with the 32MB card (even with practically everything minimized).  I'd been sticking to zones I know well or staring at someone's feet (to see when I needed to move).  The card I have now is better, but it is far from perfect. /sigh  I don't mind dying due to my own mistakes, but I hate dying because my framerate went to single digits &amp; I couldn't see or react due to lag issues.<br />
<br />
Bottom line for me is regardless of whatever super AA's, spells, or what-have-you, if OoW requires ANOTHER system upgrade to play I'm done with EQ. :mad: <br />
<br />
My Sister-in-law had to quit playing when they made playing on a Win95 platform impossible a long time ago.  I've since bought not one, but TWO machines to upgrade (primarily for EQ) &amp; made other incremental upgrades (memory, etc) along the way.  The E-machine piece of junk  computer I bought shortly before first buying EQ still runs but it won't play EQ (not enough memory)anymore.  We use it now mostly to browse Lucy, Alla's, &amp; message boards while my spouse and I play.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wazbuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">32mb Geforce 2 GTS AGP<br />
<br />
Maybe I will be able to play after all, at least laggily while saving to buy a new Card :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Karaab Stormbringer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have 2 machines sitting in my arsenal. The good one (referred to above), save Omens zones and the occasional issue with large player numbers (see: raids), runs quite well (even at 1024x768 with texture quality on high). Surprisingly, Gates zones are a little laggy, but Natimbi isn't too bad, nor is Qinimi (farther, been a while, but I do remember them being a bit of a headache on the poor video card).<br />
<br />
Omens zones I had huge framerate issues with. If you were around the first month or so of Luclin, that was how it was. Scary enough, aside from throwing another 128mb of ram in here, it hasn't changed since Luclin at all. Aside from some specific zones (sometimes just some areas of zones) and over 30 people nearby in post-PoP zones, I really have no problems.<br />
<br />
I remember a few months ago actually turning all the Luclin models on in Seb and had no problem at all... but that's also Seb, not the laggiest of zones by any stretch.<br />
<br />
At any rate, it seems to be to the point now... if you don't have newer hardware than a year or less old, you are better off not throwing down more expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If you have a lower end card... avoid zoning to BW from Dreadlands...<br />
<br />
I have a loaner GF4 MX440 while my Ti4800 is in RMA for a fan that quit working.<br />
<br />
Trying to move in BW was like 1 step forward 2 steps back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If your video card supports Pixel shader 2.0 you will prob notice some speed improvments with it on. Just a FYI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">LOL, Karaab  I use exactlly the same spec (except I run Win98)...and I have few problems also.<br />
<br />
I tried Beta and had exactlly the same experiences.<br />
<br />
Those of us on gimp machines hav plenty of tricks ;)<br />
<br />
For example - trying to run around the pit on a RZTW raid? framerate redlining?<br />
<br />
Solution: Alt-Tab between windowed and non windowed and watch the red line go green and healthy. Either its a re-draw or some cache is flushed or somethng cause it has saved my ass more times than I could count.<br />
<br />
Heh, I ran a 233 Mhz 96Meg VoodooII machine until Luclin.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">computers are so cheap these days its not funny. If your gonna put time and $13 a month into a game it makes sence to have the hardware to play it. Yes, I know first hand if you have no money it does not matter how cheap it is.  Trust me on this on, I wanna upgrade so badly but I just cant.<br />
<br />
However if you have an older CPU  - thunderbird or slower Athlon, p3, or any willamette core P4 - its time for an upgrade anyway especially if your running an un-tweaked Windows XP.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tuga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Karaab, thaks for the edit. Couldn't get ingame before, runs smooth as silk with. Game and machine totaly locked the moment I pressed server select. They should have defaulted these things to off till the player turned them on. My system isn't cuting edge but there's no reason an AMD 2700, 1gig ram, and Ti 4600 should lock up with default settings for any game on the market. Bleah.</div></div><hr />
