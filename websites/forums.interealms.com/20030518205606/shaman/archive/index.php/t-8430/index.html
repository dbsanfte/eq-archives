<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shantan Maverick</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last night I noticed I finally have enough cash for a fungi staff.  I'm wondering:<br />
<br />
- Is it worth 12kpp?  (I realize you may not be familiar with the economy on Innoruuk, just wondering if it is worth what to me is a very large amount of plat)<br />
<br />
- How long will I find it useful?  I just dinged 54. <br />
<br />
- Is it a huge mana savings?  I already have a horse and jbb and I plan on xping only outdoors from here on out.<br />
<br />
- How annoying is the snare effect?  If I get in trouble and have to run do I have to physically click it off or can I just click snare boots and have that overwrite it?<br />
<br />
- Is it a huge pain in the ass to equip when you have epic in one hand and a shield in the other?</div></div><hr />

Seems like a fair price to me<br />
<br />
  How long will I find it useful? I just dinged 54. <br />
<br />
Its nice for downtime, if you dont want to waste mana for casting regrowth on yourself. At lv 63, I never use mine anymore. I have probably clicked it once in the past 4 months.<br />

  Is it a huge mana savings? I already have a horse and jbb and I plan on xping only outdoors from here on out. <br />
<br />
If you are in a group, where you arent having to take much dmg, it is nice to use, because you are mostly standing still. It does save mana but not an extreme amount<br />
<br />

<br />
You have to click it off, SoW boots wont override the snare effect<br />
<br />
 Is it a huge pain in the ass to equip when you have epic in one hand and a shield in the other? <br />
<br />
Yes, it is more annoying than that PE hammer from VP, because the effect only lasts 3 mins or so.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Azhdarkhos</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is one situation where the staff is very handy to have:  when recovering from a res.  Coming back with no mana to cast regrowth on yourself, having the staff is very nice for jumpstarting the canni-dance.</div></div><hr />
