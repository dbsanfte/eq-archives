<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fokkilie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Was hunting in splitpaw and spires to get some loot for new weapons.<br />
<br />
Hit level 34 and decided to try Great Divide, Eastern Wastes and Crystal Caverns.<br />
<br />
Read up on Thurg Gate potion thread in glade.  50PP  seemed reasonable to get pottery skill up before going to CC for other materials.<br />
<br />
did about 10 combines... got no ups.   went to trainer and used training points on pottery till she said had to get skills elsewhere (21 i think)<br />
<br />
Got back to Thurg put on all Wis and dex gear.  OK it only made me 98 dex and 95 wis) <br />
<br />
did 60 combines for 3 skill ups and 1 bowl.<br />
<br />
Is that rate of skill ups or should i spend some of my measily 300pp in bank to get alot higher in wisdom / dex before trying to up pottery again?<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on good equip for the money I have would be appreciated.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Meecham</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When I did pottery I got a skillup about every other attempt, sometimes more.<br />
Recently, they nerfed pottery skill rates (along with fletchery) - they must have nerfed it a lot for those failure rates.<br />
You may want to head to eqtraders and see if they have info on new failure rates to see if you have the plat to work your skill up enough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i bought some junk wisdom gear and kei when i did it (after the nerf) and had about 160 wisdom and the 1-102 skill ups came reasonablely quick and cheap<br />
<br />
when i did the 102 to 140ish skill ups it was very very slow... i only had about 135 wisdom, had a mind buff less than kei and less wisdom gear at the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
so i'd try to  get it up to at least 150 or 160, maybe snag the +7 rings, there is a cheap shield that has +9, the veil with like 8 on it... bunch of other things too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daesun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Yeah, you used to be able to get to 122 in pottery for under 100pp... I guess they finally fixed it to be more in line with the other skills.. :)<br />
<br />
Group with a level 60 chanter and shaman and get buffed with Focus of Spirit (60 DEX), Visions of Grandeur (25 DEX) and C3 (25 WIS).  If you can keep the chanter around they can cast Boon of Garou on you for another 100 DEX.  Skillups should come easily at this point.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>SwordMage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The DEX plan is great for Fletching and Jewelcraft; however if one believes Naomi Denmother (and of course we all do), only the higher of WIS or INT helps for other tradeskills (STR for Blacksmithing). <br />
