<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok, I read once that if you have your alcohol tolerance skill maxed you get a small bonus to hp regen.  *I am not sure if this is true* and I plan on recording my standard regen rate (with my regen gear, and without it), then getting my little shammy drunk as a skunk for the next few days, and comming back here and telling you guys if it is true or not.  But this whole thing got me to wondering, are there alot of little known tricks like this that I just haven't read yet?<br />
<br />
so, I was wondering if you guys could post any odd little trick that you know that might be of help to someone.  I have read the tips thread in the medicine cabinet, but those are more out of game tips (you being polite on raids, using the shift button to pick up an entire stack at once, etc...).  I was hoping to hear some in game tricks that might not have been posted before, or that i might have passed over in my time lurking.<br />
<br />
Thanks...<br />
<br />
Also, if there is a thread that maybe has a few of these, if you could post it for me that would be great.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dread</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">When moving around, after you stop, turn a quarter turn either way before casting to make sure that your spell doesn't get interrupted.  I have found that to be a huge help, especially when casting in PVP.  It doesn't have to be a full 90 degrees, but just the act of turning someone makes the game think you aren't moving.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Lorddaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">the mana regen because your drunk is a side effect of the fact that you regen mana at the same rate, but with your Int/Wis being half or less of normal, and this affecting your manapool appropriately.<br />
<br />
let's say i have 1000 mana, and i regen at 10 per tick,or 1%. I get drunk and get the tunnel vision. let's say this cuts my mana down to just 500, i still regen mana at 10 per tick. so now each tick i gain back 2%.<br />
<br />
what you heard of is the old wives tale/uban legend. and it is propogated by those who do not understand math. and it goes back to the day when people had no way of really finding out thier mana pool because we did not have the understanding of all the effects like specialization, Int vs mana, and the other factors we have a better understanding of now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">actually, the poster was very clear to point out the same math that you did, and to note that he was NOT saying that your regen is better when you are drunk.  He was saying that your regen is better when your alcohol tollerance skill was maxed out.  Anyway, I don't believe it either, but, being a class that loves hp regen, and liking the idea of having a full alcohol tollerance anyways, I am going to go test it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Heres a tip I just got from a friend the other day. Most people know about afk swimming, Hitting num lock and swimming up againt a wall. But I hardly ever see skill raises that way. So do the same thing except, hold down either right or left arrow with num lock already on. Alt-enter into window mode. It will leave you swimming in circles. <br />
<br />
As long as you don't hit your arrow key again you can go back into full screen mode. Fun fact: If you hit your f9 you'lll look like you being flushed.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">best trick used to be when you could use a clicky to refresh spell gems and chain cast different spells.  i.e. cast Malos, click SoW boots, and Immediately cast Turgur's.  Alas this Bug was fixed or feature was removed, depending on how you want to look at it.  :(<br />
<br />
Best tip I've gotten into the habit of using now is to keep both Malo and Malos memmed whenever there are likely to be multi pulls.  The long ass refresh on them makes it take forever to quickly slow multiple resistant mobs, but either one is usually enough so use Malos on mob 1, slow it, then use Malo on mob2 since Malos will still be down.  Otherwise you end up sitting for about 3 or 4 seconds waiting on Malos to refresh before you can reliably attempt to slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">One thing that others have written about and that i myself discovered way back is that if you run forward and strafe sideways at the same time you do a vector run. This gives you a few percent extra speed since the sideways speed is added to the forward speed thus making you go forward at an angle.<br />
<br />
Every little bit of speed helps when youre running for your life.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well maybe most you know but some might not.  <br />
<br />
  Press the D Key to interupt spell casting instantly.<br />
  Jumping while running down hills will give you a burst of speed<br />
  /TGB on will allow you to cast your group buffs on other groups if you target a person in their group when you cast them.<br />
  /target playername will target the closest player character with that name within a short range. (a partial name works too)<br />
  Only monsters that can see you will agro you. (If you have mobs chasing you and you cast invise no more monsters will agro you unless they can see invisible.  Even if they are social to the monsters currently chasing you.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Only monsters that can see you will agro you. (If you have mobs chasing you and you cast invise no more monsters will agro you unless they can see invisible.  Even if they are social to the monsters currently chasing you.)<br />
[/list]<br />
<br />
this isnt true, the mobs will assist on you if they are social since you are fleeing... but they wont attack you until they meet their buddies.  I believe the only time this IS true is if you pull something by rooting a mob near it and then run away..the mob assisted but doesnt have direct aggro and doesnt get buddies when it runs by them--i've never done this myself, but have heard it was true.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kagn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Didn't know the invis trick.<br />

Thanks!<br />
<br />
I believe the invis trick does work, my friends use it in BOT all the time, instant click invis after pulling mob to not get any adds running back to your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gulug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">stand over your corpse - get your rez box. cast whatever buff etc you want on yourself which takes the most mana, whilst its in midcast click on the rez box.<br />
you will be rezzed and spell will land shortly thereafter - gives you a bit of a headstart. i know for enchs is great they can use this to cast C3/C5, not suer what the most mana intensive buff is for shams tho.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong...<br />
<br />
Hunting for my VT shard in The Deep yesterday, aggroed a see inviso mob on the run to the bridge.<br />
I rooted it, walked back a little to be out of melee range, recasted inviso.<br />
Then I ran back to the zone line and 10 secs later root broke.<br />
At the zone line, I was still inviso, waiting for the bugger hoping I could slay it and restart the run.<br />
No need to say the surprise I got when the mob came with ALL the non seeing-inviso mobs on the way.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Nice tip Gulug. The invis trick kinda works if the mobs are too low to assist but will aggro you. So you pull a blue mob run back, the blue mobs will come alone. I also used to use it in UP and skyfire, since you are ahead being invis you can determine the route which the mob following you is going, so can therefore be free to choose a path which seems safest and does not path through other mobs. Hard to explain but noone is wrong in this case.<br />
<br />
Also a little known tactic, say theres 4 mobs in a room, by pulling one mob in the room all 4 mobs come, however sometimes depending where you can fight a mob outside the room just in an assist range of one of the nearest mobs of the room and in some incidences only one will come instead of 4. Another hard to explain tactic you really have to see it to understand it.<br />
<br />
Virulent paralysis can be used to VP a summoning mob through a locked door, and you will be summoned past it.<br />
<br />
If you suspend a pet before rez, after rez you will still have pet suspended.<br />
<br />
I can't think of any more atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">invis trick doesn't work from my experience. I forget where, I was running through a zone, agrod a green animal (saw the message in the chat window-just kept running cause I didn't feel like dealing with it atm). I get near the zoneline, one of the people following me got lost or something, so I had to wait. I remembered that mob I agrod, figured I was way ahead of him, and cast invis. The funny part was, like 20 seconds later, I see this zelniak or something charging towards me from in the distance. So he attacks me, I kill the bastage. But he still knew where I was, even though I was at least half a zone away when I invised.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">You can single pull mobs that are on different factions using invis.(good example:bot. elementals / giants). you can attack an elemental, invis, and run to your gruop and you will only agro other elementals and no giants. I do this all the time to pull a pet for when I'm 2 boxing a chanter.<br />
<br />
Another good trick - if you pull 2 mobs and they are both healers, find a wall and use that wall to seperate them. they won't heal through walls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">The wall thing depends as well.  Walls only block spells if it's an indoor zone.  Spells go through walls in outdoor zones.  Remember that when planning raids with AE-type mobs!  :)<br />
<br />
Chutoi</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Zaviax McCleo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Speaking of walls in Dungeons this one comes in very useful when pulling casters.<br />
<br />
Once you aggro the caster mob get out of line of sight ASAP. A mob in a dungeon cannot begin casting on you unless they have line of sight so they will be forced to run toward you.<br />
<br />
I can't count how many times I've told the puller this only to see them stand there and take 5 nukes from the mob and then curse something about how they can't pull them. :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Speed has a big effect on aggro.  There are times, places and mobs where you will not take aggro if you zip by as fast as you can - but if you pause, look (or lag) the same critter will notice you.<br />
<br />
Aggro pulling produces a smaller aggro frenzy radius than does a direct attack.  I.e. if you scoot toward some mobs a step at a time, pausing at each step - you will be able to pull (some) mobs singly that would pull as a group normally.<br />
<br />
Root-single-pulling - I've only really used this one in PoS.  Half dozen or so armadillos have static spawn points around this lake.  The first couple come singly, but the next two always come together.  Without someone to harmony/pacify, I root the farther 'dillo, the near one heads toward me.  If our camp/kill spot is far enough away, even when root breaks, the rooted dillo will NOT charge toward us.  Once his buddy is dead, I just move over to be within his aggro range, and he takes off toward me.<br />
<br />
Fun thread!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>yadaf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">ive posted this before but heres a cool trick i like to use:<br />
<br />
first you need a illusion item that is NOT a playble race (skelly and such)<br />
then take off all your visible armor<br />
then click illusion<br />
then while in illusion ware your armor you took off<br />
then clikc off illusion, looks like your nakid<br />
<br />
you can do this with bear form<br />
<br />
and you can use this to get rid of your nasty boots or helm graphic or whatever</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Phatcow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">The mana-hp-booze-regen thing ... I think there is more to it ... the concept is which takes longer sitting on your butt regening mana or recovering from being drunk ...  If you have 1000 mana and you use all of your mana.  You sit down and start regening mana at 4m a tick = 250 ticks = 1500 seconds = 25 minutes?  I suck at math so I am not sure if this is right.  Now to recover from being drunk with max AT might take 10 minutes and your mana will be full.  <br />
<br />
Big issue here you really dont want to be drunk with evil mobs all over the place ... drunk casters and blue mobs dont go well together.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Jaimison</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">A helpful tip for those of us that are always getting /tells for buffs is to type /rt.  That will target the last person who sent you a tell.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Thsi is kinda obvouse but lots of people seam to forget this, Try to get the Warroir/Ranger/Pal/SK to position himself so that your Pet can attack from behind, this way he avaiods Reposts, dodges and abilities like that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">but just the act of turning someone makes the game think you aren't moving.<br />
That would be because you aren't moving.<br />
If you are running forward and stop holding down forward, it takes you a fraction of a second to stop running forward.<br />
If you start turning your character right after you finish running, the amount of time it takes you to do roughly a 90 degree turn to the side is more than the amount of time it takes you to stop running forward.<br />
Soooo, if you start casting a spell after turning a bit, you know for sure that you've stopped running forward and you won't interupt yourself.<br />
So ya, the reason the game doesn't think you are moving is because you aren't moving anymore...<br />
This of course only holds true on normal ground and not icy surfaces.<br />
If you try this on ice, you'll just be sliding sideways instead of sliding straight ahead.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Always face a mob beating on you.  Defensive skills only work from the front.<br />
<br />
(i see this mistake made a ton~)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Summoning mobs dont summon when rooted :)<br />
<br />
Want to go kill that mob way way over there in that extremely hard to get to place (up cliff, over broken bridge etc etc) without having to run there? Aggro him by casting (has to be in range ...duh) and immediatley sit, viola he has COH'ed you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Vulash</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Actually, regarding the turning while running thing.  Abasher or one of the PR people posted a long time ago that the game does not update constantly.  So while you are running, sometimes when you stop, it takes a few seconds for the game to realize you've stopped as far as casting is concerned.  When you turn, it sends an immediate update to the server of your new position.  Which of course now also lets the server know you are stopped.  So the trick to turn and have less interupts after stopping actually came straight from Abasher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Yhakfiend</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">When grouping with Mezzers:<br />
<br />
- create a hotkey to /assist your mezzer.  This helps you slow adds without running all over the palce in those areas with undead, obstructions, or other things that don't allow for easy cursor targeting. <br />
<br />
- Before breaking mezz on a mob, you can /assist the mob to see who the target will be.  This is more important for tanks to know, but it's also an easy way to see if you ticked off the mob a little more than you wanted to after it took 3-4 casts to land a Turgur's.  <br />
<br />
Also, just some tidbits:<br />
<br />
- Stoi, Torpor, or Quie yourself before casting Tigir's (AoE slow) on a group of mobs.  This'll buy you a little time if you get a couple resists.  <br />
<br />
- Don't piggyback a tank when slowing a mob.  Stay close so the mob doesn't move out of attack range of your tank, but position yourself so that if you get aggro, the mob will turn in your direction.  This especially gives warriors a better idea of when to mash that taunt key.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Boinshar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Assuming you are not being hit (which forces an interrupt check), spell interrupt check is based on the difference of your position when your started the spell and your position when you finish the spell. You can begin a rather long spell in a corner, run all over the room, and come back to the corner just before the spell completes (let go any direction buttons, full stop) to finish casting without dealing with an interrupt check.<br />
<br />
When you start to move from a state of rest, it takes a faction of a second for the game to realize that you moved. When casting a spell, you can start moving when the cast bar still has 1/4 to 1/2 of a purple to go and successfully cast your spell without an interrupt check.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">A great one I just heard which is awesome for time<br />
sensitive recovery from a death (IE: Ldon) is /cor to summon your corpse to you before the cleric clicks rez.    Once you have the box, cast Group focus, then accept the rez before it finishes casting.   You and everyone in the group will have focus, and you will have focus + rez effects.<br />
<br />
Quite a neat trick.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Kunderu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">/em Writes down awesome tips and tricks in notebook.<br />
<br />
Great info wish I had a tip to post, but thanks to eveyone who posted some great tips...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u37"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p37">The corner thing is important.  I can't tell you the number of times with different caster characters that when things went god-awful wrong and the rest of the group bailed that I stuck my butt in a corner and successfully gated away.  I use it a lot in dungeons when soloing.  Yes, you can still be interrupted by a bash or stun (except ogres, I think), but you won't be interrupted by movement.<br />
<br />
On the res thing, if the cleric is short on mana - torpor/quiessence yourself and canni4 a bunch of mana right after the res.<br />
<br />
On the invis thing - it works to a point.  If a mob is non-social, aggressive, AND doesn't see invis then it shouldn't aggro if you run by invis with a train.<br />
<br />
Myths are fun.  There was one way back in beta and early release that if you ran between the sand giant's legs, he wouldn't aggro on you... :)<br />
<br />
This one should be obvious, but...if the mob turns your way after malox and slow(s) - immediately torpor/quiessence yourself.  If you get it off it should save your cleric mana and can often save your own life.  Most tanks will be able to get the mob off of you before it hits you, but every once in awhile you'll get a mob with a taste for shaman.<br />
<br />
Slam.  The 3 big races (troll, ogre, barbarian) have an ability called slam that does one damage max but has the ability (however small) to interrupt spell casting.  It doesn't work on a horse or in bear form.  It does work with illusions of any of the three races (so yes, enchanters can slam).  It is useful against caster mobs, especially healers.  I haven't used it in awhile (usually on a horse or in bear form), so I don't know how helpful it is post 60, but I know it helped a good bit in pre-60s.  On a level 1 shaman, that 1 damage hit is a decent DPS increase, too :)<br />
<br />
Port stones.  Each healer class has a pottery made item that will gate them to their race's newbie area near their hometown.  I'm not sure what level they start to work, but they're great for getting around since the stone's destination is usually close to a pok book.  Bind near where you want to hunt and still have easy access to most places in Norrath.<br />
<br />
F1 targets you, F1 again targets your pet.  F2-F6 targets a group member, hit again to target a grp member's pet.<br />
<br />
Focus = talisman+str+dex.  If the buff slots are open - IOS+str+dex+talisman &gt; focus for a melee that isn't stat maxxed by focus alone.  Great for getting your warrior (or pet) to proc just a little bit more.  Also, maniacal strength stacks with focus of spirit iff the str buff is cast first.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u38"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p38">Summoning mobs dont summon when rooted :)<br />
<br />
<br />
they DO summon, but if something is close to them, it wont be you.  if you get a mob low enough that it would summon you and then root it and you are all by yourself and have no pets, etc.  You can count on being summoned.<br />
<br />
One of the best tips to anyone that does tradeskills... CTRL+click picks one of a stack and SHIFT+click takes the whole stack.<br />
<br />
Another tip for people that like dungeons and dont have someone to snare.  (i believe this is only true in places mobs assist each other, which is pretty much everywhere).  If two mobs on the same faction are near each other, when one gets low enough that it would normally run away it wont run if it has a buddy nearby.  The buddy must be there BEFORE the first tries to run away. (this works anywhere, not just indoors, but is mostly useful indoors opposed to vast outdoor expanses)</div></div><hr />

this trick can also be used in reverse especially in a &quot;vast outdoor expanses&quot;  if you get an add and the mob would normally run just root the add and move far enough away from it and the low health one will begin to run away.  :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Acanthurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">My best tip is for when you kill a mob that ends up in a wall, rock or way up a tree etc.  Your pet always keeps target on the mob even after its dead so to loot a mob you can't normally access just /assist pet and then /loot.  Been hunting Dryads in Jagged Pine and at least 10% end up in a rock where I can't loot em.  This trick lets me get that extra plat that otherwise would be lost.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean what i think it does ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I believe mobs that summon don't start summoning until 96%.  You can use that for pulling, agro control, etc.  Summoning mobs are also timed on summons.  Use that to your advantage if you need to root and back off.  I think it's 15 seconds between each summon, but I forget.<br />
<br />
For those of you with less well equipped groups, the tank may have trouble controlling agro.  Use root.  Root makes the mob turn to the physically closest PC in melee range.  Thus, if a shaman has agro for most of the fight due to a poor tank, warn the melee classes, root the mob, and let the tank get in its face.  Rogues can still get just barely in range (everyone calls this using max melee distance) and it won't turn on them as long as the tank is closer.<br />
<br />
Couple of other random things--while it's not ALWAYS true, the large majority of unsnareable mobs don't run.  They usually enrage as well.  Enraging mobs never run.  Make sure all melee and your pets are behind the mob and you can keep hitting it while the tank has to stop attacking during enrage.<br />
<br />
Unless you are trying to hold agro, pretend you're a rogue and stay behind the mob to melee.  Most of the defensive skills (for both PCs and NPCs) only work for the front of the mob.  If you are behind them, I don't think they dodge, parry, or repost--thus your dps will go up.  If you are running from a mob, YOUR defensive skills don't apply--they'll do a LOT more damage to you from the back--if you are off-tanking a mob and have to slow something else in camp, back up until you can see the mob without turning your back on whatever is hitting you.  <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">Here's a cool one.   Let's say you have a pretarget on a mob, but then start getting tells for buffs.<br />
<br />
With your pretarget targeted, hit TAB to target yourself. Now click on the people needing buffs and buff them. When done, target yourself again (using F1, not TAB) and hit TAB. You now have your pretarget back.<br />
<br />
Also, if fighting a mob and you think it may fall into a wall, hit TAB twice (targets self-mob). After mob dies, it'll disappear from your target. Hit TAB again and you're targeting the corpse... then just move close and /loot to loot it, even in the wall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">How to stop those runners.  If your soloing its far easier to do.  If your with group it must be cordinated.  But when that mob takes off running into a area that is not safe for you to follow due to adds dont...  Just step back a little and sit immiately.  4 Mobs out 6 will turn and come back for you.  Works alot better at lower levels then higher.  Another tip is most people dont realize root lasts longer then it takes to sit and camp.  So if your in a losing battle you are sure to lose and your too far from a zone to run to safly root your targets &amp; Flash of Light too if you have memed and sit down and camp.  YOu lose fluffy but at that point you would be sitting to get back to fighting status any way.  When Torpored you move faster if you side step instead of trying to run forward.  Just zip every were by side steping/straffing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Khelud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">One good way to break a camp that cant be single pulled is to pull with root, root the mob you want to kill away from its spawn point and camp out. 64 root should last the duration of camping out and getting back in.<br />
This is especially good against very high hp mobs that you dont want to be fighting at the same time (royal bugs in FG for example).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Summoning mobs dont summon when rooted :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is only simi true. There are some mobs that can summon that wont when rooted. Named drake in SF comes to mind (Darkwing, Blackwing, what ever it was) But most mobs will still summon you if they can rooted or no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Cabe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">Rooted mobs deff summon.  I use this trick to get to drusella's wing in HS.  Pull the 2 golems, then root that wandering one up there.  Dot him, and bling bling your in the wing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u51"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p51">Couple tricks/hints I use:<br />
<br />
To pull a caster mob, use a dot. The same anti-kiting code that makes them take less damage when chasing you will make them chase you instead of standing there casting at you and taking full dot damage.<br />
<br />
Bard songs Shield of Songs and Nyv's Harmonic reduce the amount of damage you take from cannibalizing, but you still gain the same mana. Can do the same with any rune spells, but you chew through those after a few cannibalizes - bard song stays up constantly (if the bard plays it).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Islowem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">About the dot the casters cause of anti kite code...<br />
<br />
That used to be true, but sometime in the recent past, they removed the reduced dmg from dots when a mob is running at you (being kited, etc)... Your dot still does full dmg whether it is moving, running, standing still, fleeing, rooted, snared..whatever.  <br />
<br />
Short answer, used to be true, no longer is.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">Yes, I know they removed that code, but caster mobs still dont know it. Try it and see.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">If you've done damage to a mob that summons, rooted or not, it can summon you...<br />
<br />
Uh, thanks for qualifying your argument :P<br />
<br />
In 2-3 months of soloing Umbral planes (approx 5 months ago, so patches may validate you)I used this method on every-single Gantru type mob, every-single time.<br />
<br />
Slow pull, sick pet, load up the dots, back into the corner, root.<br />
Walk away, canni dance to my hearts content.<br />
Root breaks<br />
Summoned...immediately...every single time, not before the root broke, not 5 seconds after.<br />
<br />
I learnt this technique here on the Crucible.<br />
<br />
I was allways using a pet so the previous poster that commented on that factor may have a point.<br />
<br />
Also other posters have commented that some mobs can some cant.<br />
<br />
Thats called qualification, try adding something constructive to your post next time Malone.<br />

One liners help no-one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">mobs that summon that have reached the point where they would summon (~97% hp for most) will summon (the person highest on the hate list usually) EVEN if they are rooted UNLESS! there is another target in melee range. <br />
--------------------------------<br />
<br />
Caster mobs dont care if you DOT them, they will continue to cast until they decide to quit.  I've done this plenty of times recently..pull a caster with slow, it starts casting, i DOT it, it finishes spell 1..casts another spell etc. until it decides to run at me.  Sometimes this is after the first spell, but not always.  This isnt some trick--its just your luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u56"><b>Fateholder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p56">the indirect aggro by rooting a mob and his friend will come after u but not aggro anything else if u are invis does work.  also if u are ally faction it will work too. <br />
<br />
another trick is the mobs aggro every tick so if u look at your hp/mana u can tell when a tick happens(when your hp/mana goes up) and then u can race by a mob and he wont aggro till next tick.</div></div><hr />

You didnt pull it with the dot - you pulled it with slow. Dot it first before any other spells then see how often they stand back and cast. Pretty amazing luck I must have because I cannot recall a mob ever standing and casting when I've pulled it with a dot. I was just in Droga a couple nights ago with a guild group, and I was pulling since I could get singles. Every melee mob I would pull with slow, every caster I would pull with Breath of Ultor. Not once did a caster stand back at cast at me - every single time they charged me without casting a spell. But, by all means, dont take my word for it - what do I know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u58"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p58">2 things about summoning mobs. 1 they must have had damage done to them to summon. 2 When they do summon, they summon the nearest target to them if they are rooted. So if you are fighting with a pet. And mob is rooted the pet is most likely summoned. Of course this does not apply to perma rooted mobs I think like Creator and stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u59"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p59">On the tradeskill front, here's one I recently discovered:<br />
<br />
Make a hotkey called /autoinventory.  This will drop whatever's on your cursor into your inventory.  While it's not different from clicking the item into your inventory box, it can save you a little time and mouse movement by using both hands.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u60"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p60">if you are buying mage summoned pet kit in the bazaar, do not buy it with your trader.  summoned items are no rent and cannot be placed in shared bank space.<br />
<br />
if you do find yourself with pet kit on trader (who is not your main) do not leave the bazaar with your trader.  in the bazaar you cannot be encumbered to a max, but if you step out into the nexus it will act like root if your trader has 65str but is carrying weight of 330.<br />
<br />
of you do happen to make this kind of mistake and realize it one step into the nexus, have someone cast sow on you so you can get back.  no way they will be able to buff your str or agi enough that you can move.</div></div><hr />

I'll try it. Guess i didnt catch the pull with dot part :); hoping it works as it would save me a lot of /pet backoffs ...</div></div><hr />
