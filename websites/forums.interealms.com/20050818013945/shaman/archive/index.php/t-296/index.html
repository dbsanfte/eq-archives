Not only as a soloing tool but it gives me the ability to heal in a pinch.<br />
<br />
I will say one thing though...anyone who says that JBBs dont make that much of a diferance in leveling or raids is on serious crack. I blew though 59 in a weekend and I never would have done it w/o my JBB. (best 20k I ever spent)</div></div><hr />

Thats ok because I will gain it back twice as fast w/ the JBB. ;)<br />
<br />
I did 25k dmg free w/ my JBB lastnte on the THO too. :)</div></div><hr />

LOL i went through 57  last weekend with JBB BUT i am pretty sure lvl 57 was nothing compaired to what lvl 59 is like..:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont have the Greater Bear Form spell currently.(bear form really annoys the $^&amp;* out of me with the motions and not being able to tell if your sitting or standing) I did purchase lesser bear form in SH though and I was a brown bear.(not sure if there is a diff between Lesser and Greaters colors)<br />
<br />
<br />
you went thru 59 in a weekend? where did you hunt? <br />
<br />
I did level 57-60 in the Grey. I would park myself in a nice spot up on the zone wall and pull to it. With the combiation of JBB+Epic+Dog+My weak melee things tend to die pretty quickly. I also had access to a friends level 58 druid so that made life a lot simpler. I would pull with Turgur, let the mob come to me Epic and JBB till dead. I let the dr00id keep my Regrowth, Natureskin and a nice damage shield on me at all times and I let her heal me whenever needed. That coupled with having several good friends who can KEI didnt hurt either. :)<br />
<br />
The only real problem with hunting in the Grey is the tendancy of people to train Shimmering Rockfiends on you. :( These things are pure evul, they are totally immune to cold so that throws your JBB out the window and they can pound you into the ground fairly quickly even with Turgur on them if your not careful. Usually mana permitting I would pull these before they would agro on me or to prevent someone from dropping one on me(they have a HUGE agro radius) <br />
<br />
When I did pull a Rockfiend I would Epic it then immediately Bane+EB it. Poison DOTs stick fairly well to these. They do have a TON of hitpoints though. Usually it would take 2 Epics+2 EB+2 Banes to kill one. That's with letting it beat on me with a 32hp DS on me and a hasted dog beating on it fulltime......</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just curious on your opinions of the pros/cons of playing a Vah Shir shaman over the other races?  Have you played any other shaman races?  With torpor and some nice equipment (which it seems like you have), I can't imagine there's much difference at 60 like the rest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Blackdust</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yeah, a big congrats to you. Vah Shir Oracle, that rocks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Heh your just a pl fiend... with or without the jbb you would have been 60 around the same with the equipmennt you problly have.  Just replace jbb with other dots and you would have been taking things down just a little bit slower.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Just curious on your opinions of the pros/cons of playing a Vah Shir shaman over the other races?<br />
The only real disadvantage that I have noticed from playing a Vah Shir is their low starting strength. My previous character to this one was a Troll Warrior so I am a little biased. But the 1st res I got in my late 50's(yes that was my 1st death) ;) I noticed that I could barely move. Which I found truely annoying, but in normal day to day play if I need STR I just buff myself.<br />
<br />
One other minor inconveince is the fact that Vah Shir eat like pigs. I was constantly restocking my food until I started purchasing Iron Rations which made it more managable. We get an innate STA regen bonus at the cost of eatting at an increased rate.<br />
<br />
As for the pros:<br />
Safefall Safefall Safefall...I absolutely LOVE this skill!<br />
Sneak: This is great for quests.(although I forgot I could do this until last week =\ I used to be really annoyed with the NPCs in Shadow Haven. Now I just sneak and buy or do whatever quest I want).<br />
MC Hammer Dance: I can groove with the best of them!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just replace jbb with other dots and you would have been taking things down just a little bit slower.<br />
<br />
Well, I started using EQcompanion around level 57. The fights that I realtime parced in 59 I was dealing out around 2400 free damage w/ the JBB on Timeless Golems. And around 3500dmg free w/ the JBB on Shissar Stalkers.<br />
<br />
Now if you consider the fact that Shissar Stalkers are 100% immune to Poison and Disease DOTs I would have had to kill them all with n00ks(very mana ineffecient) or just Epic and melee.(would have taken forever)<br />
<br />
Now, Timeless Golems can be poison DOTd so lets replace my 2400hp of free damage with a Bane and an EB thats 945mana per kill your replacing with manafree damage. <br />
<br />
This overall increases downtime even w/ KEI I would be burnig more mana than I would be regenning. And the downtime would be horrid if I couldn't pull just Timeless Golems.<br />
<br />
I do agree that I am a powerleveling fiend, but it's pretty damn clear atleast in this hunting spot that my leveling would have been DRAMATICLY slowed w/o the JBB.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Regen + Can = mana back</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Xantrik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Regen + Can = mana back <br />
<br />
I never said it wasn't I was mearly stating that if I didnt have a JBB my leveling time would have shot through the roof compared to w/o it. As it was I was doing a yellow bubble every 6 hours with no downtime. <br />
<br />
My point was I never had to stop and Can or Regen the only mana I was burning was on my the entire weekend was on my pulls with Turgur. Or if I had KEI I would drop a bane on Timeless Golems. Regen + Can IV just does not compare to the free damage of a JBB if why would I burn mana if I didnt' need to? =)<br />
<br />
Of course this is all dependant upon the place your hunting. If whatever your hunting is CR then the JBB goes out the window. But in the case of the Grey where the only thing that I have run across so far that is CR is Shimmering Rockfiends the JBB was invaluable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Yes we know the JBB is situational...<br />
<br />
Oh and let me revise my last formula for when you had the Druid to pl ya...<br />
<br />
Regen + Can + Druid Heals = mana back faster</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sithithar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Just want to put a comment in here...<br />

- Pull 2-3 shrooms in FG, slow em all, spear dot em all and nuke em down one by one with pup biting. Let dot work in parallel on 2-3 mobs, while you get nice XP at a steady rate. Another &quot;situational&quot; use of the JBB.</div></div><hr />

OR just Pox, Plague, epic and stand there and canni-4 back the mana and not worry about interrupts using the JBB. <br />
Same result.</div></div><hr />

Grats Xan!  *pulls your kitty whiskers*</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I don't get many interrupts with the JBB; not enough to worry about.  I find bane and poxx both on a shroom is spending too much mana for my tastes.<br />
<br />
But if I pull multiple shrooms in FG, I then DO note that tigirs wears off on them before they're all dead, baned or not, so I use regular slow on them, and I pull them one at a time.  When epic wears off, I pull a second, so I have two being worked by me and the dog and epic/bane.  First dies, second is dropping in health, so I pull a third, and from then on have two on me at all times.  Rarely have to stop, or stop for long.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I like to set up a situation where I can use canni 5 though.  It's MUCH better than sitting around canning all day with three dead shroom corpses around me.  <br />
<br />
Grats on your 60 kitty!  Wish my ogre had sneak.  THUMP THUMP THUMP -- honey, do you hear something?</div></div><hr />
