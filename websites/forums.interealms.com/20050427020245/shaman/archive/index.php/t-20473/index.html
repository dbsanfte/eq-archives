<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">looking for a good spot to dou for xp. I'm quite familiar with droga for loot but really want a spot where I can dou and get some good xp when i can't get groups. Don't have any flags although I am applying to an elemental guild on my server so that should change soon. <br />
Rangers got 1050 ac, 3400 hps unbuffed, 41% haste. Doesn't have eq or am yet.<br />
Shaman has 2600 hps, 1020 ac, 3500 mana, MP4, IH4, ft3, Horse, epic and all viable spells up to 63 except for ldon ones.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Macnair</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I'd suggest Plane of Innovation, if the focus is on gaining experience.  Zone in, move past the group that's there for exp at the zone in, and move either left or fight.  Your ranger can tank these np, your shaman will have little trouble slowing them and healing the ranger.  You'll figure out the mana management for your duo pretty quickly, and you will have about no down time.  You can do this for 20 minutes or multiple hours.  You will often have two mobs or occasionally three:  just pull the add over to the side, root it, kill the first one, turn and kill the second one.<br />
<br />
A slightly riskier suggestion would be the caves in the bottom of Plane of Justice.  The mobs here seem to be a little more resistant, they are hidden around corners, and they are closer together:  it can sometimes get a little messy.  But you have the offchance of looting an alkaline etched stone or two, to sell in bazaar for decent cash.</div></div><hr />

He pulls with snare &amp; I dot and kite.  Mind numbing boring but very good exp.  When we start to fall asleep he'll pull a red con to wake us up.  <br />
