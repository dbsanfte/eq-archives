<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Blarney</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok we don't have snare, but that is just a tell away, I see a bunch of posts about, how can I duo with a druid, how can I duo with a necro, etc...  Answer: easy they have snare.  Aggro kiting, aggro kiting, aggro kiting.  I have a 59 necro, and a 55 shaman. and many others but not applicable to this post.  Basically in PON you snare a mob, if you get 2 zone out.  With druid would be more smooth because snare lasts longer.<br />
Your poison line and the necro's poison line have massive aggro especially in the planes.  /pet taunt off and get to work.  necro should use level 29 snare, much faster cast time and this not the dot you're counting on because of resists.  So he/she needs to use level 29 snare.<br />
<br />
After they snare, throw in mailise line to help them refresh snare cuz average nightmare aggro kite will take 3 necro snares.  The aggro path should run from little house to dead tree, not sure of exact direction havn't done in a while.  Then take turns pulling the mob around in circles for a dizzying death.  If shammy aggroing use ebolt and tainted breath. <br />
<br />
Necros turn use, darkness, splurt, then ebolt, send pet, use level 4 poison bolt to add to aggro, usually refresh splurt one time and keep poison bolt.  Be mindful of darkness coming off, it's hard as heck to get back on.  <br />
<br />
If druid snare, best dot and I hear, have not tested, that flame lick will keep massive aggro.  Make sure pet taunt off, and level 59 is easily within your reach, 58 get's a bit slow, and 59 is brutal here.  <br />
<br />
After this try to get plane of valor aggro kiting group and just help out however you can.<br />
<br />
Still looking for non summoning mobs in Storms, have heard about them, but many deaths have not found them<br />
<br />
<br />
Slow may not hurt to have on the tree cuz if your necro/druid friend gets smacked, they will probably not recover from spins if mob is hitting at full speed.  Help yer necro friend out as well, keep regen on them and they can keep massive mana health conversions up</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>teccumseh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">A shammy and necro can team up and successfully pull in massive amounts of exp with single pulls at OC and POS.  I just memmed up my best 3 dots, krag's mending, chloroblast, and a root.  Keep yourself and the necro sow'd and buffed and your ready to go.  The necro kept agro very well, the 2 pets were chewing away and the shammy is happily dotting the crap out of that mob.  I just turned slow circles or ran a few steps to stay in range while my buddy the necro did all the running around.  The exp at lvl 59 was incredible.  Worked pretty much the same way in POS doing the frogs.  Course your further from a zone out there and those frogs kill rather quickly.</div></div><hr />
