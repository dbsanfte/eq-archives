<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>RizzWulfgard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">With reasonable pottery skill (128+) you can now make a LORE, NO DROP, potion with effect: Thurgadin Gate. It has a 10 second cast time and takes you to the bridge in Thurgadin.<br />
<br />
This is excellent for melee classes.<br />
<br />
Here are the details:<br />
<br />
1) Collect the following components: 3 Crystalline Silk, 2 small pieces of velium, 1 small block of velium, 2 glass shards, HQ firing sheet. Silk drops of Crystal Spiders in SoV, best place is CC but they also drop in Thugardin and VL. Velium pieces/blocks also drop in CC. Glass shards and firing sheets can be bought near the bank in Thugardin.<br />
                      <br />
2) Combine the 3 silks, block of velium and 2 shards in the pottery wheel for a unfired velium vial.<br />
<br />
3) Combine unfired velium vial and HQ firing sheet in a kiln for a velium vial.<br />
<br />
4) Leave the bank in Thurgadin and turn right. Go straight ahead to the tall statue. The middle building to the left contains the potion merchant, Frundle Frenkler. Say &quot;what velium vapors?&quot; to<br />
receive a velium extractor.<br />
<br />
5) Combine velium vial and 2 small pieces of velium in the extractor for your gate potion.  The silk and velium might take 30 minutes to collect 3-4 batches, the kiln and pottery wheel are both near the bank so its a great system for us melee folks.<br />
<br />

NOTE: The vials have a trivial of 128 in pottery skill so you probably want 130+ skill to be sure of making them easily. This is very easy, fast and cheap to do. Here is what I did to get to 148 skill:<br />
<br />
1) Go to Thurgadin bank. Buy 50 flasks of water, 50 medium jar sketches and 50 medium blocks of clay. Combine 1 flask, 1 sketch and 1 block in the pottery wheel. You should soon trivial on these around 30 skill. Just destroy the jars you make.<br />
                      <br />
2) Buy 200 flasks of water, 200 medium bowl sketches, 200 medium blocks of clay. Combine one of each in the pottery wheel until you trivial at 122 skill.<br />
                      <br />
3) Buy 50 flasks of water, 50 large bowl sketches, 50 large blocks of clay and 50 glass shards. Combine one of each in the pottery wheel until you trivial at 148 skill.<br />
<br />
Takes around 2-3 hours and cost approximately~120pp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Arsecn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Thanks for this info boss!  It is very precise and informative... spent about 2 -3 hours the other night/morning raising pottery from 0 - 148!<br />
<br />
Next step is to drop into CC for some early x-mas shopping ;)  Thanks again Rizzo!</div></div><hr />
