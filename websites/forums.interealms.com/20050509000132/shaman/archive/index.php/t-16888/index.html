<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just curious if there is any time(even with the AAs) where bind would would be faster than casting healing spells and canniing.  It seemed to me in the old days when I fooled around with BW that it was worthless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">any class with a decent heal like shamen, doesn't need bind wound <br />
<br />
unless your oom, which has never ever happened to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">For a shaman pretty much useless<br />
<br />
For a monk its nice...always had a joke<br />
<br />
Monk1 tells Raidhealchannel:1 '1111 INC Bind wound on %T 11111 Monk2 your next!!!~'<br />
<br />
Max skill bind wound for monks = 82 HP in roughly 10 seconds, that being said 92 monks BW at same time = roughly 7,500 HP(Cleric Cheal).  Then 10 seconds later another 7,500HP<br />
<br />
For a 3 second delay you need 276 monks operating in 3 groups at staggered times.<br />
<br />
Just something I thought about while bored trying to fall asleep<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Even if I was OOM, I would sit down and med until I had enough mana for a quiessence/tnargs mending/kraggs mending. <br />
<br />
Never in a million years would I bind wounds as a shaman.  That being said, its actually worthwhile to use bind wounds if you are a beastlord (up until you get greater healing or chloroblast).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You will find exactly one situation during a Shaman's career where Bind Wounds is viable :<br />
<br />
At extremely low levels, if you are DoTed, do not have the mana to cure or heal yourself, your siting regen isn't enough to keep you alive until it wears off, and your BW skill is maxed.<br />
<br />
By the time you are looking at AAs, BW has long since passed the point of having even theoretical usefulness for a Shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">i have used bind wound, in early lvls and in pvp.<br />
<br />
nothing like gating with dots on you and living thru bind wound and telling them you lived.<br />
<br />
after a few lvls,  not worth it; i hate to say.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I used bind wound at one point (maybe in the high 50's - a long time ago) when soloing was still a viable option.  I found that I could cann way down and bind back up (this was with 210 skill) faster than I could simply canni'ing down and then using heals.<br />
<br />
edit - typo'd 210 and wrote 110.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If i am not too wrong, my monk BW each tick(6 sec or less) not each 10 sec. <br />
I know because i BW-danced in paludal when i got DOTed (BW,sit for sitregen,BW,sit....). May be it was each 2 ticks,but i think it was only one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ragack</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I feel bind wound is worth getting up as though is doesn't heal for much, it is a mana free way to heal, my guild's recent Sky raid got into troub;e due to a mob being several island's down from where it should be and the MT was saved by several people binding his wounds giving the cleric time to cast his heal spell.<br />
<br />
Also it's cheap and easy to get up, as Cannibilize allows us to keep our health under 50% easily and safely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">We did Korucust the other day, and at end of fight almost everyone was oom, and dotted.  We had a few people manage to stay alive by using BW.  It was just enough.  Almost everyone who died, did so after the mob did.  Far as the AAs go, I dont think they are really worth it these days.  But BW does have its uses, its not totally worthless sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hail,<br />
<br />
My ONE bind wound success story... :D <br />
<br />
This was awhile ago in the old Plane of Hate.  We had a group of latecomers horribly (&amp; accidentally) train our camp, causing the raidleader (our guildleader) to call for everyone to camp if they can.<br />
<br />
The main tank, an enchanter, a mage, and myself were all guild officers, and we (without saying anything) all simultaneously decided to die heroically to let the other dozen or so people (we already had many dead) camp out.  The raidleader was our guildleader, and he died about 5 seconds after the camp call. :p <br />
<br />
I had 3 mobs beating on me (AE slow aggro) &amp; the tank had 2 &amp; the mage pet had another.  Enchanter (already at half mana) locks two of the ones on me down.  Mage pet dies.  Tank shifts to that mob while I'm reslowing with Turgur's.  Enchanter locks the rest down right as the warrior finished the mage's mob, but after taking a beating herself.<br />
<br />
Warrior health - 5%<br />
Enchanter health 20%, mana is low<br />
Shaman (me) health at 25%, mana at 5%<br />
Mage health 30%, 5% mana.<br />
<br />
Mage, Warrior, and myself bind wound the warrior to 50% while the enchanter keeps the mobs locked down w/ mezzes.  Mage uses mana to summon more bandages &amp; making rods.  I now have enough mana finish Turgur's slowing the last of the mobs and have enough for healing.  We break the mezzes one by one, with the enchanter going OOM right as the last mez wears off, but we finish the last mob off together.  What a rush!  We continue binding wound as we call for people to log back in.<br />
Still one of the most memorable half hours I've ever spent playing.<br />
<br />
Is Bind wound worth maxing out?  Sure.  Bandages are cheap, and you can work the skill while waiting for a rez or whenever you have some extra time.  Skill-ups are rapid.  Is it a practical skill to use?  Almost never, but you never know!  Is it worth spending any AA on?  I don't think so.  Binding up to 70% is good enough. :) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I think I read on Casters (ya I know) that this skill is maxed at 75. Anyone know what the max skill is for Bind Wound?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Meladrak Doushi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I think I read on Casters (ya I know) that this skill is maxed at 75. Anyone know what the max skill is for Bind Wound?<br />
<br />
Its different for every class.<br />
<br />
MOnks is 210<br />
<br />
Thinking Warriors is 210 as well but they have AA that allow them to Bind wound for more double the ammount of HP(as they do have more HP).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Vazzkorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman max BW at over 200 (210?) like all priest classes I think...I definitely know it can go over 200 as mine is already over 200.<br />
<br />
I can think of a few other areas where I have binded wounds...deep in a dungeon with roamers...survived a fight, pretty much oom, very low on hp and dog dog has bit the big one...options...gate out...can be a pain if your in a location thats tuff to get too (deep in Seb/HS)...or go invis or IVU depending...and BW up till you have some safety margin...<br />
<br />
BW has one great advantage over spells...you can bind while invis without breaking invis...has saved me a few times in very tricky situations where I survived barely...<br />
<br />
Now I suppose a person could sit there and med up and hope nothing wanders by or even invis and med...letting normal regen work...but I have always had bad luck with invis failing at the worst times and BW definitely works faster than just sitting specially if regen is down too<br />
<br />
Course I suppose this really only applies to those shammies who like to solo in dungeons<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Bind wound A.k.A Poor shaman's torpor :P<br />
<br />
At lv58ish I was useing BW a lot when I would get Lom/ OOM when solo camping things. Emporor in seb comes to mind.<br />
<br />
Also it is Int casters that max at 75. Shm max at 210.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>cepheusRZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Shaman max skill is 210.  I had this arguement with so many dumb@$$ casters in my old guild... Back and forth constantly until I posted SS's on our guild board showing that my skill had reached 210.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Meladrak - that's hands down the funniest thing I've read in a month.  Easily.  192 monks.  Thank you thank you!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Raid level dots from raid mobs that can leave you OOM (permanently so until dot fades) and losing hps, can require Bind Wounds to keep you from dying.  However, if this is the case, and it rarely ever is, you'll still be better off punching RC3 and curing that **** off you.  Or asking someone for a heal/cure.  Or just dying and getting a rez (It's a raid after all).  <br />
<br />
Bind WOund is of such limited value as a shaman, it's a wonder why I have like 180 skill in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>hdaana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I think those of us who have any skill in bind wound are the older players that used to play before kei clarity etc and with poorer gear when you got more of a beating and died more and actually had more of a need for bind wound. vs gettin rezzed and clickin off a stoicism or torpor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Raise your hand if you ever had a group full of people using BW on you while you cann'ied because there was a mage summoning them all bandages?  *laugh*<br />
<br />
Mind you, it was level 20 or 30-something, but I laughed so hard at the idea of five people all standing around me, wrapping me in gauze while I ripped hunks of my own flesh off...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Shinerbokk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have a skill of (1) in bind wound.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">my monk has 200 from BW on me while canni'ing - back in the day...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Xysander</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I loved bind wounds back when I was in my 30s and grouping with a mage every day.  It helped the struggle to keep up with being my groups only slower and healer on a daily basis (I was one of the shaman with a group of people standing around them binding wound).  I helped out when I'd out canni them and managed to raise my skill close to 200.  Haven't touched it since my 30s though so I can't imagine the AAs being worth getting.</div></div><hr />
