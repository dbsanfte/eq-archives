<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>MGP4ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am sure there is a virus hidden somewhere in a folder I have called C:/_RESTORE since it only shows the following 4 files in the folder: DISKCFG.DAT, SRDISKID.DAT, VxDMon.CFG, and VxDMon.DAT but when I click the properties of the folder it says there are 66,000 files in 5 folders and they take up 2.25 gigs of space yet even with hiddens off I cant find any other folders.  When I try and delete the files it says they are currently being used by another program.  I am sure they are slowing my computer down yet even with an updated McAffe it doesnt pick anything up during a full scan.  Anyone have any ideas how I can get that **** off my computer without having to shell out another $250 to my computer repair guy?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">you can always format your harddrive and do a clean reinstall, short of that I don't really have any advice though</div></div><hr />

run their free scan, that should clear things up for you, if you have a virus.<br />
<br />
also, defrag your hard drive monthly at least.</div></div><hr />

Careful of this if you happen to be running a raid array though.  A friend of mine lost all his data using this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>MGP4ever</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Thought about formatting but with all this Kazaa **** starting to hit the fan I dont wanna have to redownload 500 songs cause of fear of not being able to redownload them</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Tat2demon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The C:/RESTORE directory is made by your virus program. That where is stores the virus's it has deleted/quarantined ect. First shut down your virus program, and then try to delete them. If Mcaffee is running those files are in use. Then you need to open Regedit and delete from there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zakumara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">bah use norton ;)<br />
<br />
seriously, first do a full scan disk of your system, defrag if possible, check with online scan anti virus program.<br />
<br />
also keep in mind that even if you format you disk with having a boot sector infected it won't change a thing. There is alos removal tools needed to clean up your system if you have worm type, antivirus will detect the virus but won't be able to remove it sometime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Run a boot scan with your virus program.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I totally agree with the guy who said use norton. I HATE McAfee, it is possibly the worst virus program I have ever encountered. It never picked up any of the few viruses I had (yes I kept the virus lists up-to-date). Also, not only their anti-virus, their firewall also sucks, I had to remove it from my gf's machine because it somehow was really causing problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I won't get into the whole Norton vs Mcafee argument, since we all know Grisoft's AVG is superior anyways.  Regardless, alot of virus checkers will flag viruses that Windows has put in a restore profile, but it cannot remove them because they are Windows protected.  You don't mention your OS, but for the Windows XP family:<br />
<br />
1) Right click &quot;My computer&quot;<br />
2) Select Properties<br />
3) Select the tab marked &quot;System Restore&quot;<br />
4) Check the &quot;Turn off system restore&quot; box<br />
5) Dismiss the properites sheet (Click ok)<br />
6) Acknowledge the dialogue box confirming you want to turn off System Restore<br />
7) Reboot - all system restore files are wiped - turn it back on if you want.<br />
<br />
-Good luck</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Check how to turn off system restore and turn it back on - or hit F8 during boot to get menu, boot to command prompt, and delete that whole folder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I use avast, it's free and can remove anything with it's bootscan.  /shrug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Grann Met</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">That one does not definetly sound like a virus to me, you might just have hidden files turned off.  To remedy this, do the following:<br />
<br />
Right Click on Start<br />
Left Click on Explore<br />
Left click on the Tools menu<br />
Left click on Folder options ... (on the bottom of the tools list by default)<br />
- A window will open<br />
Left click on the view tab<br />
Now check the boxes &quot;Display the contents of the system folder&quot; and &quot;Display the full path in the title bar&quot; these 2 options are turned off buy default.<br />
Finally move the dot from &quot;Do not show hidden files and folders&quot; to &quot;Show hidden files and folders&quot;<br />
Left click Apply then OK then close all windows.<br />
Open up that C:\_restore folder and it should show you ALL of the files within no mater what ... failing that may i recomend Norton System Works 2003  ;)</div></div><hr />
