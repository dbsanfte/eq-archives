<br />
I'm level 55, and have been hitting CS pretty steadily for a while now.  My mage did it when he was 51, so a shaman shouldn't have much trouble.<br />
<br />
What you want to do is hit the &quot;a wyvern&quot; spawns.  They uncommonly drop &quot;a wyvern hides&quot; which sell for about 175-250p in the bazaar.  they rarely drop ToV quest gems, and they normally drop between 0p and 6p.<br />
<br />
The xp is increadible at 51-54, but it cuts down at 54 and 55... however, if no one else is camping them (quad kiters go there alot), I can pull in about 1000p an hour, after all is said and done.<br />
<br />
Try it out guys, it's worth trying.  :)</div></div><hr />
