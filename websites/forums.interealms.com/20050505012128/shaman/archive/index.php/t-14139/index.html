<br />
Best (and most realistic) idea Ive heard yet imho.<br />
<br />
Id prefer an aa per flag but that aint gonna happen.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fuudce</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The charm idea sounds plausable because it would give them relief on 2 issues: What to do with the people moaning that they wasted time getting flags, and the people moaning that the charm slot is pointless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I heard from a lil' mouse that it's going to be AA's</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">AA makes more sense ot me.  Why?  Because they're going to try to reward people who already had the flags AT THE TIME that they open up the tiers.  If they gave us a charm, then you could buff it up later by getting flags.<br />
<br />
On the other paw, if they DID give us a charm, it would probably be worthless to the guilds knocking on Time's door.  That would be good, because opening up tier 2/3 wouldn't effect them at all, so SOE might be a little less inclined to reward the already filthy rich.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I think charms are a great idea.  Why would it be a bad thing to beef it up for people who got flags later?  There would be at least some encouragement to actually get flags still that way.  AA would be better  than nothing but AA isn't too hard to come by and most of the people who are already flagged for everything have 100+ AA easily but I would bet few of them have decent charms if they have them at all.<br />
<br />
They could really make the charms pretty decent too.  2 ac, +2 to all stats and saves, 20 hp/mana for valor and storms flags.  Increase it by 1 ac, 1 to all stats and saves and 10 hp/mana per flag.  I'm pretty sure I read they are only going to open Valor, Storms, Bastion of Thunder, Halls of Honor, Torment, and Crypt of Decay so if you were flagged prior to the patch you would have a 6 ac, 6 to all stats and saves, 60 hp/mana charm slot.  <br />
<br />
Make it kind of like a quest.  Hail some gnomer in PoK and he checks your flags and gives you the equivalent charm.  Then if you got a new flag you could go back and get the upgrade.  Well anyway those are just my hopes and dreams but I would bet it will probably just be AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>KraksterSlanginbuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">AA points....omg...keep friggin dreaming people.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not everybody has 100 AA. I'm flagged for Tactics and others and I only have 12 AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That is why I said &quot;most&quot; people that are flagged for Everything have 100+ AA.  AA would be a decent reward its just I think most people would benefit more from a nice charm than 4-5 AA.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I disagree, an AA per flag earned is the way to go.  Why would you want a pointless charm?<br />

Do tell, where did you get it and what buffs it up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I like charms and the premise behind them, but I havent seen a single one that impressed me. I can imagine the folks who are more 'uber' than I would think even less of them. I think the best one I saw had a few points of wisdom, about 15 hps, and some focus effect (which was low level focus). Those guys and gals in the elemental planes will surely go ga-ga over something like that, eh? I know I did.  <br />
<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
And even the folks with 100 or so AA probably wouldnt scoff at a few more. They're not 'done' with AA's by a longshot. You need about 300-400 AA to max out, and those folks who have a ton are obviously interested in AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Meowlin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heres something to think about... giving an LoY item for a PoP content change? Not everyone had LoY, but everyone effected by this change has PoP. It would have to be something that everyone can use. Non LoY but PoP enabled people would be PO'ed if they got a charm they couldn't use. Otherwise SOE has their heads up their arses even farther than we thought.<br />
<br />
The most viable refund for flags to these zones (if any) would be AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Do tell, where did you get it and what buffs it up?<br />
<br />
Torgiran mines, off the Seer or something.  Must max 3 weapon skills (read: all of them but H2H).  Not a bad toy, but already beyond it's usefullness :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The reward will probably be that you will be able to enter the zone, even if you don't meet the level requirement for it. So those who flagged their alts, there's your reward  :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Is simple a charm would be the most fair. And enable it for everyone with Flags. LoY or not.<br />
<br />
Have a Fellow like the seer that you can hail. And tell her your class. And when you do you get a lore No drop charm That is based on the abilities of your class. And as you get flags including The elemental ones it grows in power along with you. Base the stats around The classes Abilities. For shaman With all of the teir 1 2 and three flags (And yes I know there are not many teir 1 flags) I would expect An item in the 125 hp 125 mana Ac 12 Wisdom 12 Stamina 12 Resists 12 And such. Make the damn flags mean something tangible. And if you get to time Then make it have an effect that is meaningful.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">&quot;flags ... you'll have to wait to see what that reward is. Upcoming for June 11th, 2003 (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/updates/upcoming_updates.jsp)&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll wait. But half of my &quot;flags&quot; are actually keys for alternate access, so I wonder if they'll count the same as flags for this reward.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">An item in the 125 hp 125 mana Ac 12 Wisdom 12 Stamina 12 Resists 12 And such<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but there's no way they would give out a charm that powerful.  That's like giving out ornate or elemental molds, which is just not gonna happen.  It would be nice .. but it's a dream.  The most powerful charms are nothing close to what you suggested. <br />
<br />
I'm actually a little curious as to how the level requirements will mess with people who are flagged but under the level requirement.  Will they be locked out even if they are keyed/flagged?  100 plat says they will be for the first week or so until the next patch hehe</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Lets face it...whatever they do is most likely not going to make everyone happy. The range of folks who already flagged is simply to broad. I hope its AA's myself, becasue at least its something you can choose to use how you wish regardless of how many you already have. My other hope would be that they have come up with some truly unique item that really set those of us that got flagged to be in those zones from those who will come after, but I have to admit I have no idea what an item like that would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">This is a far-fetcher because Sony demands cash for some of these, and other are not allowed at all, but here goes:<br />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">yes an AA per flag would be perfectly fair.<br />
<br />
completely fair reimbursement for the 3 times that the dorf failed HOH key containers.  completely fair reimbursement for the months that the agony mephit spawned under the world.  completely fair reimbursement for hours spent getting no exp camping in POI due to the rarity of perilium.   One AA, which I can get in 2 hrs tops... is NOT fair reimbursement for the effort that I put into the HOH key quest alone, let alone the others.<br />
<br />
I've decided to just ignore the &quot;reward&quot; because like Krakster says, it's gonna be something lame.   :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I like the charm idea a lot.<br />
<br />
It means that people still have some reason to get the flag even if they aren't imediately planning to go further into PoP. The ubers still need all these flags for progression, but at least they get something along the way.<br />
<br />
Those screaming for a huge reward need their heads examined. Getting flags is more about having a powerful guild or getting lucky with pickup raids. Why should you individually get a large reward for that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">1-5 AA's per flag depending on the flag is more fair.  Anyone that has had to the RZ script over and over and over and over and over to get the backflagging done knows that just 1 AA per flag would be an insult of major proportions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">HAHAHA more than 1 AA per flag... thats hillarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kylt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">They gave out AA pts for participating in PoP Beta and I heard it was a logistical nightmare that took weeks.  That was for what a hundred people?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">*shrugs*<br />
I'm just guessing here, but if they're using an implementation of SQL for their database, it's just a couple happy commands to display all records with certain flags, update to add 1 AA per flag (more could be done depending on what they want, who knows) and re-run the query to compare it from the previous output to ensure everyone got counted and there was nothing wrong with the command.<br />
And if they're using some form of Microsoft Access... /rofl Sony :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">***yes an AA per flag would be perfectly fair.***<br />
<br />
How is this fair? In a decent-great exp group i can get 5-10  AAs a day , how many days did it take you all to flag everyone in your guild for BoT and HoH?<br />
I bet it took more than one day. I also have a few guildies with Maxed out AAs+30 saved up. What good is some AA points to them when they cant get anymore? I myself am at the point where i ran out of useful AAs and now running out of semi useful AAs. What good are some points to me?<br />
<br />
I would rather get a free t shirt sent to my house saying &quot;I spent all this time flagging my whole guild for tier 2-3 and all i got was this crappy T-Shirt&quot; :p<br />
<br />
A charm would probably be the best way to go since nobody really has a decent charm, maybe make it based on flags like a poster suggested.<br />
Although compared to the time my guild spent flagging everyone (before things were made easier with /raid and mobs were untuned with broken slow mitigation), thats not such a hot reward either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Murphy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I would agree with Chuk. Reward needs to be decent to make up for the pain and misery that was reflaging our slackers several times over.<br />
<br />
What I would like to see is a charm that gives 20 hp for every tradeskill over 220. Plus it might make the Aid Grimel quest more palatable.<br />
<br />
Course that wont happen but let me have my little dream in peace:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure they'll just hand out an item that has near-VT stats  :p <br />
<br />
It would be too hard for them to put a little thought into what the average time is to get each flag, and hand out AA accordingly.<br />
(assuming handing out AA isn't the logistical nightmare as posted above) <br />
<br />
I want to be rewarded for the time I spent on getting them, not just the flag itself.<br />
<br />
AAs are good becuase everyone can use them (whoever has every single AA there is...I'm sorry, I really am...but you are like .0000005 of the EQ population and you scare me :p) and it would make up for the time so many of us wasted killing greens/light blues for key pieces that are now virtually usless.</div></div><hr />

Ahh yes, the obligatory bumaden &quot;evil ubers dont deserve shiit!&quot;  post.<br />
I was worried for a minute there. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I personally think the 'increasing power' charm would do the trick. <br />
<br />
Make this charm work for ALL flags in the game though, so the tier5 ubers have a charm that is equivalent to an 'average' piece of tier 5 gear, then work downwards ie: elemental flagged players will have a stronger charm than tier3 players etc etc<br />
<br />
This way, everyone who has worked for flags and progressed through the game as intended will be rewarded for thier effort.<br />
<br />
I don't see AA points been given out for flags; and personally, for the time I have invested backflagging people, 1aa/flag would be insulting...</div></div><hr />

Obviously the casual person that managed to get flagged for CoD and BoT because they caught a pickup raid that let them in for the hell of it is much more deserving of rewards for being flagged already.<br />

His guild didnt start as an Uberguild. They started Earlier, and did it better, than the rest. And Chuk has been there since Jump. But he has had time for people to ask him questions. And he has spent more time treating people who act like god given gift as they deserve.<br />

He is a decent fella. And been a leading edge shaman forever. So lay off the Uberguilds dont deserve ****.  Because we ALL are screwed by sony. <br />

Guys, I understand the effort involved with getting those flags, but I find it odd that you need more revard than you already have. <br />
<br />
You have had exclusive access to zones with very fat drops, great xp and low congestion for months before the general population hit the zone.  You have been able to cram trough the 60+ levels and put in a few hundred AA's to boot.<br />
<br />
You have had prime access to sell drops from these zones for a premium price in the bazaar for months now - the prices are going to fall now that everyone got access you know.<br />
<br />
What about being content with what you got?  Be happy if you get a <br />
'I was here first' button.<br />
<br />
Yes, the LOIO mob is going to move on from PoD to somewhere in tier2 next week, then on when the tier3 zones get more known.  Not a big problem - avoid the idiots.  Go somewhere else, its a big game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a big steaming pile of bullcrap. Most of the zones there do indeed have pretty nice XP (Torment being the wild exception, I don't think there is any XP in there), but fat drops? What planet are you living on? Windblades and girdles of mithaniel became mythical in their drop rate back in November.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Shaft</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">Gotta consider the source.. uberguilders base their RL sense of self-esteem on their gear - mere pixels - in a video game.

No because like you said it was an Alternate way of access...<br />
<br />
yes an AA per flag would be perfectly fair.<br />
<br />
completely fair reimbursement for the 3 times that the dorf failed HOH key containers. completely fair reimbursement for the months that the agony mephit spawned under the world. completely fair reimbursement for hours spent getting no exp camping in POI due to the rarity of perilium.

Your an idiot...Keys dont = Flags. Keys are the easy way out.<br />
whats that you say? but keys waist your precious time? so what? you trying to beat the game?<br />

In short, if you got keys instead of FLAGS you dont get &quot;The FLAG Reward&quot; come patch time nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u52"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p52">You guys are talking about 2 different types of rewards.<br />
The reward for going through all the flags the first or second time was access to all the new zones.<br />
The reward for going through the flags 10+ times is what we want compensation for.<br />
Some of us have gotten flags of certain targets at least 10 times.<br />
You have no idea how painful it is to have to drag the whole guild out to a Grummus killing, or a Rydda killing, all because of your your guild members is just missing that flag to be flagged for the planes.<br />
The reward isn't really meant much for the people that killed something to get a flag once and never saw the mob again.<br />
The reward is for poeple that have killed targets like Grummus, MB, AD, Rydda + other trials, and other flags many many times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u53"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p53">We understand that those that have already earned the entry flags for these zones have put some effort into that accomplishment.  We will be giving a reward to those that have done so,  though you'll have to wait to see what that reward is.<br />
<br />
When I completed all the alternate quests, I received character flags.<br />
I don't see where this statement from SOE differentiates between Alternate entry flags and raid mob flags, it simply says entry flags.<br />
<br />
People who do the alternate entry flags are not attempting to progress through the storyline of POP and move toward the elemental planes.  They are simply doing a quest to open a new zone for exping or small raids.  So when you give that to everyone by default, for free, it sucks for the people who invested a lot of time doing work to do a quest for that exact same reward.  People who kill the raid mobs are still going to need to kill the raid mobs for their storyline flags.  They also get a small reward in that those mobs drop items, though I understand when you can get elemental god drops, Grummus drops won't be very appealing.  I certainly can sympathize with people who need to raid mobs like grummus and aerin'dar over and over, but it is not quite the same thing.  Those mobs must be killed for their members to obtain other flags, not so their members can exp in that zone.<br />
<br />
Basically my comment is simply that there is no fair way to reward people for the work they have done doing flags, no matter what way they did them.  I think most raid guild members would rather just have the need for extensive backflagging really removed ( I know they also mentioned this was planned, in some way but I don't know how well it will be implemented ) and that would be enough.  Regardless, I don't think the &quot;flag reward&quot; will be anything to get excited over and certainly nothing worth flaming over.<br />
<br />
By the way, when you wish to call people names, the correct form is &quot;You're an idiot&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u54"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p54">When someone gets flagged through a boss fight, they get two things:  entry to a new zone/part of zone and a progression flag<br />
When someone does an alternate quest, they only get one item:  entry into a new zone<br />
<br />
SOE is opening up all tier 2/3 zones (excepting Tactics).  This takes away less than half the reward for those of us who did the flags.  They never said that they would open up HoHB, PoNB, Towers or anything of the like....<br />
<br />
Those people who spent the time getting alternate keys are the ones getting stepped over.  If there was a reward for only one kind, then it should be for them, not for us.  After all, even though we did have to do the flags again and again and again and again, the boss mobs DID have boss mob items.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u55"><b>Gooshemz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p55">I totally agree with finaljustice, the people doing the alternate entry quests are the ones getting screwed over, not the uber-guilders.  The ubers still get immediate acess to trials for the next zone, which the alternate people never get.<br />
<br />
Now...if you want to compare who is working harder to achieve zone access/flags whatever...go try getting a group together to hunt Diakus in PoS for Tactics access.  Unless you are a soloing 65 druid, you can more or less FORGET ABOUT IT.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, one of my server's local uber guilds was killing Behemoth Saturday night and they wanted some more people to help insure victory.  Several people from my guild were permitted to join, and we zerged Behemoth with 63 people (no strategy...just all out attack...he was dead in less than a minute...as were many of us) and I was flagged for Tactics in less than 1 1/2 hours.  <br />
<br />
In contrast, I've been working on the HoH alternate quest for over a month, and will probably not finish before the patch.<br />
<br />
So who exactly is working harder?</div></div><hr />

The reward should be something that is useful to a normal player because they are probably the ones that have had the biggest problems getting the flags.<br />

I have to agree with some of what he's saying here, but for very different reasons.  I look at Chuk's profile and I see that he's tricked out with lots of VT items and some elemental.

Doesnt matter if you killed it once, or a hundred times. You still had the flag before they removed it and the 'reward' is meant for those who had the flag prior to the removal of the flags. Your own personal feelings of being more deserving than others arent relevant.</div></div><hr />

My gear has nothing to do with flags, since you yourself said i do not benefit from those lower tier zones. i still had to spend  the time in getting my guild flagged for those zones though. Then going back and flagging more members, then going back again and  again and again and again and so on.<br />
<br />
Yours and bumadens argument that because i have some decent gear, my time is worthless but for anyone who has lesser gear plays 1-2 hours a day their time is much more important than mine?<br />
What kind of skewed logic is that?<br />
<br />
The fact i spent basically 2 months of my life flagging and reflagging (read not fun) lower tier zones so my guildies could help with raids in the upper tiers makes me just  as eligible as anyone else. 7 AAs if thats the reward is pretty much a slap in the face of all that work my guild put in. i guess becuase i have nice gear i shouldnt care i wasted 2 months of my life?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u61"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p61">lol slap in the face.  Ya right.  It seems like you already moved on and the rewards for all your hard work is the ability for the upper tier flags as said before.  Yes you probably encountered problems along the way but this is EQ we are talking about here.  I think 7AA is a bit too much and wishful thinking but with EQ's track record if that is what everyone gets I think everyone should celebrate with rioting in the street because that is more than they have ever given out before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u62"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p62">hrothgarx, you're retired, for how long now? did you go through full flagging  before ANY of the flagging changes went in? do you have any idea what a PITA it was when if you missed one hail anywhere along the line you didnt get the flag for a tough ass kill, or if you hailed one mob or npc out of order you missed a flag etc.  it was harder to get the flags than it was to kill the mobs needed to spawn the projections.  sorry, but i agree it is a slap in the face.</div></div><hr />

BTW Hrothgar is retired but I have a BST I still log in to play every now and then.<br />
<br />
If they give away AAs they are essentially giving away a free AA discipline to everyone that flagged the majority of zones.  Sounds more than reasonable when thinking of EQ.  I am surprised they are giving anything.  It shows the aging of the server populations I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, this just doesn't fly.  Your reward for doing an event the first time is your flag.  You reward for doing the event multiple times is to get enough people in your guild flagged that you can handle the boss mobs in the Elemental Planes (you DID say that you were doing the events over and over again for people in your guild, not total strangers).  You also get a reward by helping a friend.  In all the last battles for an epic that I did, I never asked once, &quot;what's in it for me.&quot;  I was helping a friend.  Were you different?  And let's not forget, all the boss mobs drop loot and have a good chance of sropping runes.<br />
<br />
And remember, I didn't say you should be left out of a reward, I said that the people who are the most deserving of a reward are:<br />
1.  Those alt quested (their time has been completely erased)<br />
2.  Those who flagged but are still working in those zones<br />
3.  Those who are flagged for those zones but also have an Elemental flag.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u66"><b>Gagner67</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p66">Some of you are thinking like SoE developers and some of you are new and are dreaming.<br />
<br />
Its as simple as this.  SoE does not like Content to be lost.  They say this all the time.  Hell, they bitterly try to stop exploits that do this.  An AA point per a flag or any amount of flags for your suffering just ain't going to happen.  Because what does that leave the whole flagging system as?  Useless!  And those FEW that are crazy about story content would need to get more people like themselves to pass some of those often 6 person annoying tests.<br />
<br />
The reward will be a charm.  It will be based on the amount of flagges.  And it will be weak and useless like all the other charms making sure not to out shine those charms that others have already taken days to camp in LoY.  And to those that don't own LoY and don't get the introduce June 11th flag charm will be GIVEN &quot;One&quot; sad attempt by SoE to influence even more ppl to buy LoY.  <br />
<br />
Its all about Market Planning.  <br />
They stray away from things that would make ppl too pissed but just give them enough to move on.<br />
<br />
If you Give ppl AA's for the flages they got get those casual players that could not get to where their guild was in the upper planes.  Now complaining/whine that they maybe able to be with their guild but because they did not play like crazy they don't get the AA points.  <br />
<br />
If you Give ppl a charm quite nice and comparative to their work to get flagged.  Again you get whines from those that don't have the flages.  And already spent lots of time on crappy LoY charms. <br />
<br />
If you Give a crappy charm.  It gives those that don't have a charm... A charm, making some a little happy.  Giving a few ppl (even those flagged for time since charms don't drop in PoTime) stats on it making some say, &quot;hey its free stat with what I already have for equipment in Time&quot; /shrug.  The ppl with out the flags /shrug thinking hey I did not have to do all the work that spent all day on and if I want a better charm I will go to LoY.  And those crazy on getting the best type of anything will continue to do the flagging to complete the charm.<br />
<br />
Ridiculous bah, I am going to play bionic command now.<br />
<br />
P.S. Virtual Paralysis is stupid.  Half the mobs that make a difference to exp (other than maybe Tatics) in the upper planes are immune to any change in there running speed (especially in good zone like BoT).  Virtual Paralysis also has a refresh rate just like root line so I don't get why you think 2.5 seconds thing makes any difference.  Oooo wait you could mem Petrify Earth and VP then when VP wears off you PE immidately.  Bah please there are better AA points by far on my mind like Combat Agility, lightning reflexes, Combat stability and innate defense that make more of a difference.  But for those that have taken the time to get the AA ability I am sure you will come up with some reasoning why, not to feel cheapened by this paragragh.</div></div><hr />

Backflagging is a PITA. And the one saying backflagging gives you good loot have never seen the loot dropped further ahead which you rather fight for. Who do you think want an item from Aerin'Dar when they know that they can go and kill a miniboss in e-planes for a better item? Sure, there are some minor upgrades, but not worth doing those events over and over.. And runes? after you killed FR a couple of times your guild will be stuffed with runes. <br />

Something is definately wrong there. Either they are lying and they know that the time they spend will somehow benefit them later or they have lost all contact with reality.<br />
<br />
Its just not possible for me to feel sorry for you &quot;poor&quot; uber people. You have yourself to thank for the game being designed this way because you keep on playing no matter how insane/bugged the content is. Until very recently no other group of players in the game was being catered more to than the truly ubers. This might be changing a bit now but I hardly see how that makes ubers deserving of a reward that useful to them.<br />

<br />
OK let's consider this for the sake of argument to be true (never was uber so wouldn't know). But what has this to do with the discussion about a 'reward' for flags at all?<br />
<br />
You make it sound (even if i think, you don't mean it exactly), that uber_guild_01 was on a dangerous and painful mission to improve gameplay for all the rest of us poor sobs  ;) . Just sad, that this guild doesn't exist ... In my opinion (you know, everyone has one) uber_guild_01 was there to:<br />
- be there first for bragging rights<br />
- grab phat loot<br />
and that's it already.<br />
<br />
When uber_guild_01 found a bug or a problem, they reported it most times, because it bugged THEMSELVES, period (can you tell, that i am cynical?). As someone else stated already, noone (uber or not doesn't matter) should get a reward for flag removal (i have some flags btw). This whole promise of a reward was BS imo, though SoE will probably come up with a lame gesture for the flagged (odds are 50:50 maybe) to calm down the heat a bit.<br />
<br />
And no guild WORKS on anything in this game (or should at least) and no guild DEBUGS this game (at least intentionally). I know it's a bit silly, but i am sitting at work actually, and believe me, there is a difference  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u73"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p73">***Sounds to me the only people getting jipped by the opening of flags are the people that spent time doing alternate quests and those that are still exping in the opened zones.***<br />
<br />
You mean those alternate quests where the droprate was increased 10fold and can flag an entire group?<br />
To my knowledge you can still do those alt quests for Tactics. so what was your point?<br />
<br />
Heck i dont know why anyone is saying this one deserves this while this one doesnt. im saying everyone who got those flags should get something they should be satisfied with. i find it mildly amusing people are complaining becuase we want better rewards that will benefit everyone.<br />
<br />
My only beef is no matter what , the reward will pale in comparison to the time  most of us spent reflagging  every once week bob who decided to log back on after 3 months of not saying where he been.<br />
<br />
I think the only way id be happy with this is if SoE hired Doc Brown to take his Delorean and fly my whole guild back to April 2003. That would be fair :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>Alyss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">All in all, my prefered reward would be that they didn't open these zones up.  That would really solve all the problems associated with it wouldn't it?   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
Opening them up simply screws the people who put the effort in to do the alternate key quests, who can't advance any further ... BoT/HoH/PoS were semi-ok hunting grounds; I'm sure after Wednesday they won't be, which forces me into PoTactics along with a lot of other people in my position.  Of course the real answer to this is to actually have enough tier 1 and 2 planes so 80% of the 61+ players on a server are not packed into zones with 100+ population and mob life expectancy of less than 30 seconds.  Any one remember LGuk and SolB before Kunark?  Not fun.<br />
<br />
Either SoE designers are smoking some strong crack or don't have the intelligence needed to figure out that &quot;adventure&quot; does not mean &quot;/ooc Camp check?&quot; in a zone where you can't move for people.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, I skimmed through the whole thing, and I fail to see where backflagging comes into the picture at all.<br />
<br />
Here's the picture (the way I see it):<br />
A bunch of people got flags for zones.  Some because they wanted to exp there.  Some because it's on the path to time.  Both use them for exp purposes (well, elemental people visit tier 2/3  alot less).  Now SoE is opening up those zones to not require the flags these people spent time on.  That is why they are rewarding it, because the exp zones that we worked to open up, are now open to everyone.  They take that away, they give you something in return (I'm of the mind it'll suck too, but here's hoping =)).  It doesnt matter if you killed grummus 40 times.  You got 1 flag, and you'll get 1 reward.  So will the person who did the &quot;collect 4 things off these stupid larva&quot; quest.  Both had somewhat exclusive access to CoD, and now do not.  That's what the flags are for.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, the only reward I'd care about is making the alternate quest flags equivalent to &quot;real&quot; flags.  <br />
<br />
That would mean something to me, even if I never actually get to the elemental planes.  <br />
<br />
I don't really care about some AA, although something is better than nothing.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for SOE in a way, because there's no way they can do this without a large number of people shrieking in outrage about something or other.<br />
<br />
But then, they (mis)designed PoP badly, so they are reaping what they have sown.  PoP is a flawed masterpiece, and dealing with that flaw is a painful process.  <br />
<br />
At least they are trying to do it, and I give them credit for that.<br />
<br />
Chuk is right that it would be more fair to base the reward on the time spent on flagging, but I have no idea how they'd do that.

<br />
I don't think we need any reward for this, you spend time on flag and enjoy the new zone; other got cheap free flag now without doing anything, Grsts them, they are few months late<br />
<br />
alt flag quest isn't hard, spend 1 night and you can get 1-2 group flag to zone(tactic is a bit difference and they didn't give out as free); similar to raiding flag which get lots flag in one killed; repeat raiding for backflag is a difference story, just like repeat farming stuff help whole guild</div></div><hr />

Quote - There is a mob in PoK on test server that is handing out EXP based on number of flags and a charm that gets better depending on number of flags, each charm is class specific and has stats that generally suit the class best. <br />
<br />
if you have 100% exp going to aa and you hail it is approximately 7aa that you recieve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u82"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p82">So does the quest mob treat boss flags and alt quest flags the same?<br />
<br />
Assuming that you get the xp/charm regardless of whether you got the flag from a boss or alt quest, I must say I'm quite impressed with the reward.  If you didn't think SoE would put a charm as the reward in there because everyone doesn't have LoY, you are truly naive heh.  Nothing like giving everyone with flags a lil extra incentive to shell out another 20 bucks to SoE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u83"><b>Kaneex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p83">/agree<br />
<br />
and sure enough the patch message said charms AND AA will be rewarded this week</div></div><hr />

- The Hollow Acrylia Obelisk - This is the old Acrylia key. It has been changed into a charm. This charm can be used by anyone, not just those that own LoY. <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like with some charms you don't need LoY. As the the old Inner Acrylia key getting turned into a charm anyone can use, so will the Flag Reward charm key be, I am guessing, usuable by everyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u85"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p85">Damn, and I was hoping for some prime bitching about how SoE screwed everyone without LoY! ;)<br />
<br />
I'm really starting to wonder *** is going on with SoE recently.  Last night a guildie was contacted by a GM who was... AUDITING gm responses.  Short version was that after review of his case, the GM determined that the previous GM mishandled the problem and this guy was going to fix it all up, in fact had already done so and gave multiple ways to contact him if the problem wasn't completely resolved now.  Could this be a sign that SoE is actually revamping their CS policy and practices?!?!  /gasp<br />
<br />
The end is upon us!</div></div><hr />
