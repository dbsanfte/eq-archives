<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zilaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been lately selling alot of things in the bazaar, and have found this very fruitful... but i am running low on things to sell...<br />
<br />
I was wondering what a good place for getting gear drops is...<br />
<br />
I am level 57 and can fairly easily solo level 60 below mobs... Any help would be apreciated....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Khasril Khaiine</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I found Howling Stones to be a good place to go, exp is good even on light blues and they are easy kills. Named a little harder but can get some semi decent sellable items. I ended up with 5 bloodpoints one trip hehe, always from same named. Another good choice would be Lguk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">LGuk items have very low value these days :(<br />
<br />
Howling Stones is a great place.  You might get just as much plat from farming gems off the beetles in Sebilis, though.</div></div><hr />

Level 57- Dranik's Scar.  Lots o' good drops in DS and DH, not to mention Noble's Causeway.  Even if you have the augment, camping the tree there is still a decent way to get some good loot. (swamp walker's veil, anyone?)  The tree is on your right as soon as zone into the PoD circle, and there is a 20 minute spawn rate on the Ukuns there.  You're looking for the Ukun Gutfeaster. In between pops run around to the south and east and smack around the Dragorns and Nocs...I stay away from the Kyv's, they smacked my 51 shammy around like a red-headed stepchild.  Good plat, some decent drops, but at your level I would say get a group together and run through some of the expo's for better looting.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... its the nocs that bug me... too magic resistant... i smack around the kyvs. ^.^<br />
<br />
<br />
but i was wondering what you mean by  &quot; expo's &quot;....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Expeditions. Dranik Hollows, Dranik Catacombs, Dranik Sewers. You need a party of at least three, but you get the place to yourself and there are two named mobs with static placeholders at the back.  What those named are &amp; drop depends on your group's level, but exp is generally good regardless.  You can choose ones that are thick with undead murkgliders or faction-giving muramites, too, which helps customize your exp time for what party you have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zilaza</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">neeto!<br />
<br />
<br />
now i just need a group that i actually know the members in. =P<br />
<br />
<br />
(in the expos at least, im gonna try sebilis tonight saying as how i have the key already, then if that flops ill try howling stones....)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Wow...a thread that works =).  Speaking of HS, i got my key for it over the weekend...but my friend (67 Drood) said to be careful about that place, as there are quite a few mobs that you effectively drop in on as you zone.  Any advice or comments about this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>shraklor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">there are 2 mobs at ZI, can be skellies or sperms, (skellies might be casters too). The casters tend to be necros or SK so expect a HT or fear. At lvl 62 with 180 MR I can resist some HT and all fears.<br />
After the first 2 die, you have like 18 mins before re-pops. Next pull the golems at the doors, most times you will get 2 per pull, and a named golem might be up too.  If you drop down into pit there are 3-4 wanderers down there (more sperms/skellies) and plenty of stuff in hallways down there too.<br />
 Named can be anywhere. I've gotten Bloodpoints, and monk clubs without going into any of the upper wings. The named golem also drops a NO DROP ranger knife. sperms run when low in health and bring friends if you let them.<br />
  There is a fake bridge on ?east? stairs I think. So if you pull those golems they may drop down and bring friends from below.<br />
sperms drop NO RENT candle which is key to North wing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">good info, thanks...can i take down these 2 mobs solo?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">-no- problem.  It used to be a popular solo spot for ambitious level 50+ necromancers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>spiritsofding</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">if u not been in hs before, then dont go in solo.<br />
<br />
its a zone that can punish the slightest mistook.<br />
<br />
Try and bring at least one friend, 60+ if possible.  If they got master key even better)<br />
<br />
beware of the carpets)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Its been a few weeks since I checked here.  And what I have noticed is that at lvl 52 now; even Blue content is difficult to solo.  Dont think I will be going into HS without a FULL group hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">You can do zone-in solo at 52.  Zone in with your pet up, Invis on, with Root memmed.  There are two wanderers pathing in a circle around zone-in, they don't always agro immediately.  Both are fully slowable and rootable, max hit around 200, with a couple thousand hp.<br />
<br />
Once you kill those two, you pull the pairs of golems from North, West, and South doors.  Root one, cast slow on the one that charges you.  With the two wanderers, that's 8 mobs, plus you can do any number of wanderers downstairs that are easy to single-pull.  It's a nice quiet place to get exp.<br />
<br />
Entering the wings solo at that level is pretty much a no-no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Hangurin Strongbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you find you have plenty of mana and time after the 8 entry mobs in HS, and if you get a sperm to drop the candle, go to the north wing.  There's 4 mobs in that room that are single-pullable as long as you target the first mobs in the room.  Fight them in the corner by the door and you should be good.  However, once that room is cleared, DO NOT go up the steps...it is a one way drop off.  Once the room is cleared, go back out to the entry and wait for respawn.</div></div><hr />
