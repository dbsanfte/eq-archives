<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am looking for a bit of advice on what to go for in the way of upgrades.  I am a casual player due to work and non guilded for reasons I won't trouble you with, so needless to say I am not super rich.  I know my primary concerns are raising my hp/ sta and getting my resists up.  I am just looking for some suggestions   on pieces that I might have a hope of getting (i.e. not VT pieces ;) .  Thanks in advance for your help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Solariis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You've got some nice items, far better than what I had at 55. The ODS, Lodi shield and tinmail shirt are all very nice but you've got very noticable weak spots in the face, arms and finger slots. You need less wis and more ac and hp there.<br />
<br />
Start off by dumping those jasper rings and replace them with the 6ac 65hp rings asap. Next replace those arms with just about anything :) JB arms or crystal chitin come to mind. Replace face with crystal spider eyes or veil of executioner or death mask of the elysians if you can afford that one. Get a goranga idol for the range slot. <br />
<br />
Also attend Kael raids if you haven't already. The leggings and BP are worth every effort to get. It took me about a dozen kael raids till I got my leggs but was well worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borgax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'd use a Ceremonial Iksar Chestplate over the Tin Mail.  The regen will aid you more.<br />
<br />
Put the Lod Shield on your back and buy a Sarnak Battle Shield for a good boost to resists and hp.<br />
<br />
Solariis' suggestions are good also.  Even Harnessed Grey Flesh Sleeves would be a good arm upgrade.<br />
<br />
Perhaps buying the pieces for the Earring of the Solstice isn't out of your money range either.<br />
<br />
Best of luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zebasik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thanks for the ideas.  Solaris those are exactly the spots I have been looking at mostly.  I just started picking up pieces for the Earring of Solstice yesterday.  The arms have been the spot I have had no idea what to get for.  Believe it or not I just replaced my Ulthork arms about a month.  I have a tendancy to ignore some slots;) .</div></div><hr />
