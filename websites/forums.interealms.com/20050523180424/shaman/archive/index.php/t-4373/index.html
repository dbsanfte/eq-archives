<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>blakkon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am trying to push my self buffed AC up over 1000.  Have a few upgrades that will eventually do this for me, but I keep looking at the 19 ac on my iksar BP and wondering how much AC I would trade for 5 hp a tick.<br />
<br />
Currently at 979 ac self buffed at level 53.  Should get a few more points in half a yellow when i upgrade to shroud of spirits.<br />
<br />
Gear:<br />

Seems to not be exactly right I think my unbuffed ac is actually 915.<br />
<br />
So to get 21 more ac, I need to add about 15 raw ac added to this.<br />
<br />
I have decent funds due to pottery GM, and am seriously looking at a lodi shield for back, and doing the shield of bane warding quest (guild working on these and I am next or the one after that).  And can also do the earring of soltice fairly easily (only need to buy smith and tailored parts)  for another 2 ac net.<br />
<br />
These two changes will net 15 more raw ac.<br />
<br />
Could also get 11 raw ac by getting a barbed ringmail BP and 50 hp., or 5 more ac from a froglok scale.  Or may get lucky on hate raid someday for rune etched..<br />
<br />
Anyways, with Lorec I am more concerned with balance than pure ac.  I think 1000 self buffed with 200 wis is a reasonable goal mid 50's and will keep me alive slowing most stuff my guild fights, and gradually get him to self buffed 1100 by  60.<br />
<br />
Now exactly how much ac would you trade for the 5 points regen?  Not saying I would ditch the iksar BP, just would take it off if I needed extra ac (read solo or duo with my Girls monk).<br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
<br />
Playing on FV there are perhaps 3 fungi's server wide.  Not even an upgrade option until I can camp it with my group.  Rare to see anything like Shissar or better bp's for sale, even WW dragon BP's are held by guilds.<br />
<br />
I have seen froglok scale and barbed for sale though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bigguss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If i were upgrading your gear to snatch a few extra AC points out- i'd keep the iksar BP and switch out the following:<br />
<br />
Back:  Get an Ancient Seahorse Hide Cloak (ac 20, +25 hp) - 4-5k (all prices based on Karana, don't know about FV)<br />
<br />
Shoulders:  Get some Imbued Granite Spaulders (ac 20, +10 to all resists) - around 10k<br />
<br />
Neck:  Get a Shrouded Medallion (no drop from 4-arms camp in Maiden's Eye, ac 12, +15 vs magic, etc.) or a Crystalline Torque (ac 12, Mana preservation III, from Velks, or 4-5k.)<br />
<br />
Bane warding shield would be a nice upgrade, too.  Or a Bone Braced Buckler.<br />
<br />
Replacing your rune etched bracer could help- best choice is a JBB, then (for pure AC) you could grab a bracelet of quickness, poison etched wristband (from DN, ac 13, 1-2k), or a bracelet of fortitude.)<br />
<br />
Bottom line:  I'd avoid replacing regen as long as possible.</div></div><hr />
