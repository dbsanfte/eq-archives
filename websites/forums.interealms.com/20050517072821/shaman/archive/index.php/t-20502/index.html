<br />
just for getting stuck on the terrain? yeah my a$$!<br />
<br />
I wonder how long intil they bring the servers down for an &quot;emergency&quot; patch to remove this ill-thoughtout command.<br />
<br />
It will be exploited, not quite sure how, but I know someone will figure a way. not to mention all the agro problems this could cause... I can see the petitions starting to fly now about un-intentionable agro.<br />
<br />
why, oh why, do they constantly throw crap like this in, but refuse to fix the stuff that actually broken? <br />
<br />
Sorry, should know better than to ask a 5 year old question.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, you just know it will be exploited, you are just not sure how...... do you think it might have anything to do with the number of customer service calls they get, or petitions they receive from players stuck in terrain? Or do you think they just invented the idea and decided it would be amusing to code?<br />
<br />
Just wondering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just wanted to add that this game is played by human beings.<br />
This should answer all questions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Arctarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">We're back to velious-era patches.<br />
<br />
Hopefully the 24 hours patches of the release are far away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">To me it signals the complete end of the guides and a severe reduction, if it's even possible, to GM support in game. I am sure ALOT of their petitions were about being stuck in the terrain. <br />
<br />
With this they can cut labor/support costs and fire some people.<br />
<br />
It's not amusing to code, as a matter of fact I'm sure it was a real pain in the ass, to figure out how to backtrack however many seconds in a real time environment and then to apply them in reverse order again in realtime, yeah real fun...<br />
<br />
No my point was, is this feature really needed...now I came to the conclusion several times, that , NO it isn't needed... nice maybe, exploitable, most likley... useful utilization of a programers time? Not compaired to maybe fixing class balance in my oppinion.<br />
<br />
But that just my oppinion, and you know what they say about them, everyone's got one..etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Come on now..surely there is something better to bitch about...look a little harder.<br />
<br />
Over half the petitions of my EQ career would not have been necessary had this command been implemented earlier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shoendesae</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've played since just after Kunark and I have never seen a use for this command. The only time I have ever had a terrain issue is when my ranger died and the way he fell put him in a wall... command wouldn't have helped even then...<br />
<br />
if half of your petitions are terrain related, then i can see your need for this command. I would think that correctly rendering the terrain would have been a better way to handle the probelm though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">With the bad clipping in a lot of zones, I bet this could be use to &quot;kite&quot; mobs and escape bad pulls etc. As we speak i'm picturing some creative uses in kedge to farm xp for mid 40s - 50's characters.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Haleice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I think I'm right in saying that it's a new command, that was put in to get people out of the terrain because of the new graphics engine. It only moves you back a small amount so I'm not sure how it can be exploited, but then again I'm sure some bright soul will find away.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Qhan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Wouldn't it be cool if you could rewind after a death? Yipee, free trip back to your corpse!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Rubitt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I have to asume this was implimented to cover themselves for some problems with the new graphic codeing.  typical soe to push an unfished product out and impliment bandaids for severed limbs.  <br />
<br />
as for exploiting im sure someone will come up with something...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>howjan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">It was put in on test because of the problems implimenting the new engine and the enormous amount of time charactures spent stuck while they were hammering it out.  We don't have near the cs support necessary to keep people unstuck and this command helped out emmensly.<br />
<br />
I highly doubt this will stay live for long.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenina Icemyst</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I moves you a few inches.  If you are stuck in a wall it will put you right outside the wall.  <br />
<br />
It really isn't a big deal but it is nice to be able to get yourself unstuck instead of having to have someone CoH you or port you or wait for a petition answer.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Has anyone actually had a chance to work with it and try it out? What does it actually do? And don't mind me if I miss the responses, busy dodging parts of the sky falling.<br />

now farm.<br />
repeat with anyother door in your way. GRATZ ! you just bypassed content !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">It doesn't work for me.  That being said, I got stuck in the flag in HoT tonight (/boggle) and couldn't get out for a good 2 minutes, couldn't sit to mem spells or anything.  Can't see through the wall there into the pit as well anymore either, the geometry has changed a good bit.  Friend had no ground in natimbi, which is pretty damn cool at night with the new sky (which look awesome).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Guild monk went through a wall on the second floor in Ssra and ended up in the basement tonight. Lovely.<br />
<br />
Also, everytime I get close to a wall, I duck. Total PITA when you need to cast and find out you are crouching.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Getting the ducking thing too. Also found I could pass through the wall of the LDoN Adventure tower in EF if I went backwards, and had some guildies in Ssra going through walls and dropping down a floor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">getting stuck on a lot of trees that i never got stuck on before. <br />
<br />
Before patch, most trees I would just slide around, nowI usually stick.    It's annoying but I just have to pay more attention to the trees now instead of being lazy with autorun :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Flabbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">My vah shir spent 10 minutes stuck mid air in the poo stream that leads to disease before my girlfriend COTH'd him to safety (and hopefully a bath). /rewind doesnt work, and collisions are HORRIBLE. Id expect a patch soon.  Also, you cant lev/climb walls anymore (my experience as an ogre).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Hodur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">There was a post from a dev on the safehouse (http://pub146.ezboard.com/fthesafehouseloungegeneraldiscussion.showMessageRange?topicID=29675.topic&amp;start=21&amp;stop=40) stating that they had to remove /rewind just before it was implemented because it could be exploited.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">On the bright side, all the people who shrink now get stuck on steps just like all us large races have had to put up with for years.  :D</div></div><hr />

I was able to lev/climb the arch in SSRA main lobby last night just fine.  Pretty steep incline too, nearly vertical.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>TPFKAFaern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">As I posted on another thread, we had people (while fighting Grieg) get sucked into the wall or fall into the wall and end up back at zone-in. (/e boggle).  Of course CotH doesn't work in GE, so those with no key and no inviso were done for the raid.<br />
<br />
I do wonder what repeatedly hitting /rewind would do.<br />
<br />
Insofar as the Kedge comments, you are correct sir, but I woud suggest you start in the low 30's.  Vis-a-vis the first level, the Fierce Impaler (Anybody remember the great guide from the old SC on him?) is the only one who will give you a semblence of a problem.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">/fastforward still works<br />
<br />
I have it hotkeyed, pummelling the key beats chain horse my a mile make use of it before it gets nerfed.<br />
<br />
Have no idea how they figure out where I am going before I do.<br />
<br />
/eject is still in-game and buggy though...great exploit.<br />
I used it to get my alt to level 7 of the Tower of Frozen shadow without a single key.<br />
<br />
/pause ... not sure when this will go live, but I can't wait this has allways been my biggest 'bug-bear' with EQ, especially when the wife needs me to look after my son for 5 mins..cant wait to hit /pause when half way through a RZTW fight.</div></div><hr />

Just waiting for the replies on this one</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get this too, but the corners i duck in are ones alredy occupied but torches (and whatnot) up in corner, so me being a troll would have to duck to not bump my head....i guess....hmmm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Pinot Noir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Great!<br />
There are only my complains... I only want to share my feeling with someone. If you don't want, please skip.<br />
<br />
<br />
We should enjoy server down.<br />
Because we can share the feeling of alpha tester though we have already paid. :p  <br />
I guess this DX9 patch should have been associated with GoD expansion.<br />
In my opinion, they did not choose to supply a playable expansion but to collect our money.<br />
Why the interval of expansions is getting shorter?<br />
Why they released an uncompleted expansion (it means that expansion requires eveyday's patch.... like Anarchy Online...)?<br />
Why they don't care our voice?<br />
Do they expect to keep a good fame as a game maker even now?<br />
Should we expect EQ2 , the product of such a game maker?<br />
<br />
I know that  even if I wrote this here there are no change.<br />
They never change their style untill users give up to follow them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably I am too sarcastic... <br />
<br />
They only wanted to serve us a new great featue ASAP.... I should hope so.</div></div><hr />
