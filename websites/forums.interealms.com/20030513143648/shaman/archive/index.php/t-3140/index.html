<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Xulak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I've been having datarate issues since I started playing EQ again 2 months ago.  Everything will be going fine, then out of nowhere, my datarate will go from 600 or so to oh say...5000.  This results in insane lag, to where I'm watching things that happened in EQ 10seconds ago.  The first time I attempted raiding with 24+ people, I was fine for about 10min, then the datarate shot up to 5000, sometimes hitting 7000.  I would say something on the channel, and it would finally go through after 56seconds(yes I was bored and timed it in my frustration).  Here's some info on my connection and computer - <br />
<br />
RR Cable from Hawaii<br />
<br />
Toshiba Satellite Laptop<br />
1Ghz pIII<br />
256Mb RAM<br />
16Mb GeForce2 Go<br />
<br />
The lag happens mainly when on a raid and everyone is doing something, be it attacking a mob or casting spells.  I have everything turned off, all models off, all spells off, all chat filters off exept group spells.  Lowest clip plane possible.<br />
<br />
Now, one thing I've noticed is it isn't nearly as bad since I started playing with the TV off, having only my comp on the cable line.  <br />
<br />
Is it the connection?  I regularly download at high speeds, up to 80kbps at times.<br />
<br />
Is it the comp?  I play other games such as UT and Q3 with no lag at all.  Perhaps increasing ram to 512?<br />
<br />
Another thing to mention is looting my corpse.  It takes me 5min.  I loot, and the second it starts showing me whats on the corpse my datarate surges.  Takes me 10-15sec to get each item from corpse to shaman, and then I have to relog after done looting to reset my datarate to normal levels, which usually works if only for a small amount of time on raids.<br />
<br />
This condition has made me near useless on raids.  I can't be relied on as a backup healer at all as by time my spell goes off the person has been dead for 30sec.  This is highly annoying, even though I only have this connection for 2-3 more months, I'd still like to fix it any way possible.  If it's the comp that's the problem, it will follow me as well, so I'd like to get that fixed if possible as well.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions I would be grateful for.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Lumppy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Try going to 640X480 resolution. I know it is a drag after getting used to higher resolution but it seems to help alot.<br />
<br />
If this helps I would say the problem is in your 16meg video card. I run a 64 meg Vodoo and still have video lag problems.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gotesblud</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm having the same problem as the original poster. I'll still be seeing text and myself hitting a mob for about a minute after it has died. Eventually, I'll always go LD on large raids.<br />
<br />
 The problem started suddenly about 2 weeks ago, and I'd changed nothing in my comp setup, nor game content.<br />
<br />
 I'm using XP on a Pentium 1500, a GeoForce 4 ti-4200, 30.82 drivers, 512 ram... Any ideas where the problem may lie? I've tried most every tweak I could think of, even going so far as to reinstall EQ. But no luck. <br />
<br />
 Thanks in advance for your help.</div></div><hr />
