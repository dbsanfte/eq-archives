<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Disclaimer - this is pure whimsy and never likely to happen.<br />
<br />
that aside, read on ...<br />
<br />
With the new and improved Suspend Minion AAs available to us, how about a reason to get more attached to good ol' dogdog? Given the apparent gimpiness of our new pet, wouldn't it be good if he got progressively more powerful as he stayed in play (or 'became more attuned to the physicl realm?').<br />
<br />
If dogdog were allowed to 'level' as he fought (being coded to act like a 6th party member - no xp leaching), he could perhaps hit harder, innately dual-wield, AoE taunt, quad, flurry etc etc as he reached preset amounts of xp earned. Not to any extent to upset traditional pet classes, but enough to warrant putting in some effort to keep him alive. At the end of your session, you could suspend your buffed and battle-hardened buddy ready for more of the same next time out.<br />
<br />
I'd be interested in feedback on this ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Neat idea but it already exists to some extent in another game...<br />
<br />
To give you an idea in WoW you pet lvls with you and gets different spell abilities as you level that you purchase for your pet.  So if you are lvl 9 and DING 10 so does your pet.  If it is a new spell lvl for him you go buy the spells mem them and presto your pet has Fireball 2 instead or Fireball 1.  If you whip out your lvl 1 pet spell at lvl 40 he will be lvl 40 and have the HP and mana of a lvl 40 of that type of pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So are you saying its not a good idea for EQ because it exists in another game?<br />
<br />
What you are describing almost sounds like when beastlords were first put in EQ, which may or may not have been copied.<br />
<br />
Well anyways, just because it exists already in another game is not a good reason to not consider it for EQ.  I mean everyone in the genre are taking each others ideas anyways.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">No what I am saying is it's neat idea BUT it's already in use in another game some what but it has nothing to do with mobs killes or time out it is purely based on a lvl for lvl metric.  <br />
<br />
As far as &quot;it was how BL pets used to be&quot; when they first got in, that changed pretty soon there after.<br />
<br />
The whole leave your pet out for an extended time or kill X amount of mobs with said pet or whatever you want to add as a way to make pets stronger just won't happen.<br />
<br />
It is still non the less a neat idea...</div></div><hr />

I could actually swear that when I was reading up on this game before kunark there was talk of it.  And it still hasn't happened.  But then again there were alot of false promises handed out with the original EQ that haven't been fulfilled and won't be.</div></div><hr />

Pets in old world used to get xp, and could level up over a long time iirc<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Cronikk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Look upon the thread title as a forum equivalent of the Amsterdam call-girls ... sitting in the shop window with it all on display, doing whatever it takes to entice you inside to sample the merchandise.<br />
<br />
Disclaimer: I have absolutely no idea what call girls are. Or Amsterdam, for that matter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Someday, I hope to build a game around what I loved most about EQ.<br />
Dogdog will be part of it, and Dogdog will level with you, and Dogdog will certainly get stronger in better ways than in EQ.<br />
Too bad I'll never be able to release it.  I think I'll call it Spirit's Call.</div></div><hr />

  Hmm.  With a name like Cronikk...</div></div><hr />
