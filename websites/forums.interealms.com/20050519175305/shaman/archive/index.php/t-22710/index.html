<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>SlimBritches</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Straight up PWNAGE Grizlor!  I'll have to work my booty harder, I'm only on LR3, and I got sick of grinding.  Went on a huge nostalgia run last week tearing through Crypt of Dalnir, Guk, Soldung and even went to freeport, charmed and cast grow X 3 and HoS on a grey wolf, and paid 500p to the first newbie to down the fabled &quot;Boss&quot; of freeport.  (Had to do it twice, first one got trained to guards :(  )<br />
<br />
All grind and no w00t make homer go... something something.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thats sweet.<br />
<br />
ND and then LR are my next purchases after I finish my healing AA's (only 11 more to go to max all of them..bleh)  I might buy them anyway before I finish AHG though, as I seem to have a pretty good crit rate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>jzak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You weren't standing at max melee distance.  There's a buffer area where you can cast on Suled Dar's Shade, but the rampage doesn't hit you.  This is assuming that the first hit listed wasn't from being summoned.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bludletters</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If I remember correctly Suled Dar's Shade is a belly casting mob so he would have been in the range of rampage and on top he had been summoned.  I love CA3/LR5.  I went defensive AA's first then healing I will finish up Healing Gift 3/Advanced HG then I will be going thru the COmbat Stability line of AA's.  Doesn't matter how much mana you have if your dead lol.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">This is awesome!  You lasted 8 seconds longer than a non LR5 shaman.  Not bad for 27 AAs. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(Just giving you a bit of grief, I'm on LR4 atm and it's definitly making a difference. :) )</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I still wish I woulda had logs on the one time I did ryda'darr and got on rampage. Missed me twelve times total out of 15 strikes, DI saved me from the 3 consectutive hits, manged to get out or rampage range and live to see the end of the fight.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">That wasn't rampage, that was agro, haha</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Shade is an easy mob to slow at least. :) <br />
Did you edit the logs (besides colorizing them)?<br />
Nice reflexes Grizlor. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">That wasn't rampage, that was agro, haha<br />
<br />
Chain rampages, thats what really amazed me about the whole thing. I was busy healing with my cleric and hadn't done too much with my shaman since the initial slow. Our main tank was still up and actually still had agro at that point in the fight (which was actually suprising with how RD usually went for us) but every rampage was killing someone. Soon as I saw the first string of rampages miss me I started running but didn't get out of range before the rest landed. Think it was the only time I ever lived through that fight too. Usually it was slow resist, slow resist, rampage or agro, dead.</div></div><hr />
