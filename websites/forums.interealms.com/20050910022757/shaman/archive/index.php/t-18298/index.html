<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just wanted to get some input.  I have never used a KVM before.  I have one keyboard on my lap and the other on the desk in front of me.  <br />
<br />
Do you really need to splice the videos to this device.  I prefer to keep 2 monitors up.<br />
Want switching between the 2 boxes to be on the keyboard instead of device.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on which one to get and also, does using a KVM make 2 boxing easier?  Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can use 2 monitors no problem<br />
<br />
For mine I just tap ctrl twice fast and it swaps to second box.  I got some linksys one, only one Ive every used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Orgak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't have 2 characters that I play simultaneously, however my mule account and future Rez Bot are on a second machine and I use a KVM.  I would think it would be very difficult to &quot;2 box&quot; in the traditional sense where you actively play two characters at once.  Obviously you could park a CLR for buffs and rez's but to have 2 toons engaged in a battle would be beyond me without 2 monitors.  <br />
<br />
I have a Belkin 4-port SOHO.  I'm very pleased with it.  It has keystroke switching as well as buttons which are conveniently located.  It does sound and USB.  Tip:  Get the expensive cables from Belkin.  Huge difference.<br />
<br />
The only problem I'm having is that on my 2nd (ghetto) box, I have a Radeon 9000 vid card.  When I switch away from that box I have to first go into windowed mode and then shrink EQ or it will lock up the game.  My primary is a GeForce 4, 128MB card and it works wonderfully.  Always did hate ATI anyway.<br />
<br />
Oh, and on a side note, this KVM works with the Logitech cordless desktop (Optical mouse version) which is rare.  I tried using the little cheapy Linksys (blue, flat, button on the front) and ended up bashing it in with a hammer.<br />
<br />
Edit:  I should clarify that I don't have the deskspace for 2 monitors so I just use one.  You can plug a monitor in directly to each of the boxes and when you switch your KVM, only the keyboard and mouse will be effected.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Shrewd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I 2 box quite a bit, and I would never consider doing a KVM style. <br />
<br />
It (the keyboard and mouse) does take up more room, but you need 2 monitors anyway so just put your keyboard on top of a monitor if you need it out of the way or behind a flatscreen.<br />
<br />
Canni, and adds are why I would never use a LVM. I like to go into dungeons and do semi dangerous spots, and being able to use both hands at once to cast 2 spells or otherwise. <br />
<br />
But if your low risk, there is no issue in it. Buff, solo, come back. switch for heals. etc. but that gets a bit old, and doesn't use the talents of both characters IMHO.<br />
<br />
I can canni macro, or nuke-a-duke w JBB, while backing up my chain stun pally, etc. It would suck having to switch every 3 seconds.</div></div><hr />
