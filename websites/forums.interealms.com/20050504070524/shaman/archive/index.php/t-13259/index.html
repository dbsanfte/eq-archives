<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, call me paranoid, but has anyone else noticed these anti-leveling mobs? They come disguised as normal mobs. The same ones you've been killing dozens of in order to level up in [your favorite zone here].<br />
<br />
The other day I was killing what had to be my 50th Ulthork Warrior in EW, none of which have ever given me any problems (level 37 with pet), when this particular chap decided to (1) resist 3 tagar's in a row, (2) resist 2 winter's roar, (3) resist 1 enduring breath, and (4) swallowed root for more energy (or so it seemed). I did manage to land a scourge and some other EBs, but had to pet kite it around to survive. Normally I slow, Dot, and tank these guys with no problem at all.<br />
<br />
Now, the kicker is that I was about 2 blues from 38 when I met up with this guy. Unfortunately, it seems like I meet up with one of these special, double-secret, anti-leveling super mobs that look normal at least once whenever I get about 2-3 blues from the next level. Seriiously. <br />
<br />
Maybe it's the odds. Maybe it's me. MAYBE it's EQ. But I think something is going on that is being kept closely guarded.  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think we have all had encounters like that at one time or another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>CaradocBertoxx</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">yeah sometimes I get a mob I can't get any spells to stick.. they keep on resisting.. blowing an extra 40% mana on resists really hurts sometimes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I've always suspected something like that.  Seems like every time I get close to a level I get a really tough encounter or a really ugly pull that there is absolutely no reason for.  <br />
<br />
My last death was just before an AA point.  I was in Scarlet Desert pulling Bloodtribes.  Normally I can pull three warriors or two shaman and survive.   I just finished a warrior (was nearly full health and mana) when a shaman comes out of nowhere and resists everything I have time to try and nukes me to death.  No malise, no root,  no DoTs, just nuke after nuke after nuke.  Very odd that one of the Bloodtribe would cast like that.  I've killed nearly a hundred of them and never been nuked more than twice in a battle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Sarnian</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a similar encounter in PoN.  I was waiting for my group to zone in so i decided to try and solo a spider.  The sucker ended up resisting slow, malosini, and root 5 times each and i had to canni to get the manna to finish it off.<br />
<br />
I think ill stick to the ravens and the treants :p</div></div><hr />

EB = Envenomed Bolt in this context.  49th level DoT.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Turc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">EB = Envenomed Bolt in this context.  49th level DoT.<br />
<br />
You're right, envenomed bolt is 49, but he was only 37 when this happened.  I am curious as to why he was casting enduring breath on the mob.  Is it some trick that I haven't heard of?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ndugu Sugarsmacks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Not only is he the wrong level for envenomed bolt, but he spells out &quot;Enduring Breath&quot; in the original post :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I would definitely have to agree with Taraddar.  Sometimes you just get very unlucky and get a ton of resists.  Everyone has had it happen numerous times I'm sure.  Also, I'm thinking he meant Envenomed Breath, not Enduring Breath ;)  It would be the poison dot he would be using at 37.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Sounds like the EB comment was sarcasm guys :) lay off  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Straif</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">A very very long time ago my roommate and I were leveling in upper guk.  We were level 34 each, killing the 3 frogs near the AC spawn.  Was not an easy fight at all and I was gettin pretty beat up, so I healed my roommate then myself and  nuked the mob.  As soon as the mob died I dinged, right after i dinged both other frogs turned toward me and beat the living snot out of me.  I barely survived the encounter, but was hillarious to hear...DING...and the mobs spin around and woop on me, &quot;hey no leveling on my buddies, buddy!&quot;  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>tannus vidar 2</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Envenomed breath comes before bolt...very simple typo...we all know what was meant...except the newbs who PLed past that spell...  ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Tannus is right. The spell was Envenomed Breath. My bad. Although it might as well have been Enduring Breath for all the good it was doing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Vorpatril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I have had many experiences like this. I will pull a mob just like all the rest and it will resist almost everything that I throw at it. I am guessing it was just a fluke of the random number generator, or...<br />
<br />
...my other theory is that when a mob is created, they randomize the stats a bit to make it more interesting. If that were the case, then every once in a while, you wind up with a mob with above average resists. This would explain me burning a whole bar of mana on trying to slow a Coterie Legionnaire even after it had MALO!<br />
<br />
Just a thought...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>bakkal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">There are definitely random ones.. Kililng for Scarlet Shard on the mesa, Slow, Root, Dog, dots.  Of the 50 or so I pulled 1 that resisted 3 slows, 3 roots, 2 breath of ultor, and epic.  It just happens sometimes *shrug* I don't think it's &quot;bad luck to randomness&quot; I think things just spawn with differing resists sometimes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I always run into that guy immediately after I ding.  <br />
<br />
This past weekend I dinged 65 (much cellebration in guild and group), next mob ate me, after malo got 3 slow  resists on a giant in BoT.  First time I have ever died immediatley following a ding, re-dinged 65 after rez on the next mob.<br />
<br />
When I was mid-20s hunting in NK, I was about to ding when that named griffon walloped me 3 times in a row, each time right after I had recovered and gained enough experience to ding again.  I think he could smell it, but I wasnt going to bed until I dinged and I was going to do it right there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">this was pretty recent, i was in a full group, 3 low to mid40s, two high40s and a low50. we were hunting wurms (helping a cleric friend get the glowing wurm bile, or something like that, i forget :) ). so i ding, (42 i think) am all happy, and we come across a named wurm, Krakador (sp?). conned red to the highest level in the group but they said lets try it. well the guy that &quot;pulled&quot;, attempted to pull in all honesty hehe, was killed in like one second. Before i could even speculate as to what the hell could have done that kind of damage, i get thrown up into the ceiling at about 200 miles an hour, land on the ground and take 2300 damage.....LOADING...PLEASE WAIT...lol. Not the same as pulling a mob you've pull time and time again, but a funny story how right after I ding I get killed back down :)<br />
<br />
by the way went to alla's and saw this mean fokker is 62, that wonderful spell is a gravity flux....now if shamans could get that spell, that would be sweet :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Oo yeah, I've seen that guy many many times one blue from level usually... Resist slow, resist another slow, a root,  interrupt heal, Interrupt heal dead .... <br />
<br />
If it's a caster, think what class caster he may be.... And dispell his buffs... Int casters have a shield line of spells that adds tons of mr (think will o whisps in plane of growth, major difference there). Kill familiars if any are present... Much resists there too. (haven't seen any yet)<br />

<br />
Yeah, I refer to them as Rabid Dingbeasts. They show up when you are one or two ticks from Ding. They /con as Blue (and I've seen a pack of Green Rabid Ding Beasts show up as well), but they have the hit points and resists of Vox.<br />
<br />
Then, if you somehow defeat them, and manage to Ding, the Rabid Dingbeast Party Patrol will show up to help you celebrate.<br />
<br />
I always zone immediately upon Ding, and go hide in PoK until they give up and go away.</div></div><hr />

Well what's to stop that from happening with normal charm or Dire charm instead of GM's?    I&quot;ve seen Enc's and Druids in grp's released (away from grp at a safe distance) dire charmed pets since they are green to group.   <br />
<br />
Back to the Anti-Leveling Mob's - but I've run into mobs that defie the random creation code with resists that have to run well into the 300 plus range.   <br />
<br />
Of course this is EQ and EQ Dev's ... so why would you be surprised after hitting a mobs that seems to push the bubble?  How many of us have run into a caster mobs that casts at max range plus 100, on the run, never runs out of mana, hits better than any melee x2, and path-warp-regen's at 500+ per tick?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Well something to help you out with those Uthorks though would work in other areas too long as you know your area and the pathing.  Use FoL will make the mob run if you step back out of Meele range once you cast it.  Its 1.5 sec cast so easy to channel though a non slowed mob.  Once it breaks the Flash of Light spell you'll get to try to slow it again as in comes in from long range.  If you are higher on the agro list then your pet it wont even turn on your pet.  Loved that spell when I was killing them.  The added bonus was it worked my Devination skill up just as I was getting to the level where I got Invisiblity.  Nothing worse then no skill in devination when you get invisiblity and fizzing a whole bar of mana trying to get that spell off.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Loreddar Of Karana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Yep, flash of light is great. It can get you out of some nasty situations. Only problem is that the blinded mob has this tendency to pick up other mobs when it comes looking for you again. I've thought I was safe with the blinded mob running away, only to be greeted later by the same mob with a few extra friends. It might not be too bad with the Ulthorks, since they tend to be camped quite a bit and few survive to wander around. But making a practice of this tactic is very dangerous IMO.</div></div><hr />
