<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Jedcea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Ok so here is my question.<br />
<br />
What if you arn't 65?<br />
You don't have Q?<br />
You don't have a bazillion AA's?<br />
However, you are to a point where &quot;old&quot; content&quot; is green. Should you be able to go to a lower PoP zone with a few friends and be able to keep your group healed reasonably well while makeing reasonable (mind, I did not say awesome) exp?<br />
<br />
As I am sure you can tell, my take on it is yes. However I have seen a major mix of folks saying that we do fine in this content. I am curious why that is the perception. Maybe I am missing something.<br />
<br />
Many of the changes that are proposed whether here or elsewhere if I understand correctly, are being talked about for GoD or Oow content where the spells won't be available until you either get to those zones or reach level 69 or 70. If we are proposing &quot;balancing&quot; or &quot;fixing&quot; the class, then I believe we need to look at what is needed at various levels post Velious.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?</div></div><hr />

Excellent post and I think I can answer this having started my first shaman in May 99.  It's about 2 things: <br />
<br />
1) content - if you want to push the envelope in a group usually a shaman healer does not cut it at any level or aa.<br />
<br />
2) power healing levels - since shaman don't get healing spells every 4 levels we are more powerful relatively when we first get them and this is especially true from 1-50 ish.<br />
<br />
3) other power levels - 49 comes to mind when you get your best old world content spells.  Oh, and any level where you get a new poison dot.<br />
<br />

PS: I agree with your post somewhat until mobs start hitting hard enough to warrant a slow each time.  Then IMHO we are a slowing class who can heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Between Sto and your heals, prior to getting our 10 second heal you will be hard pressed to heal. The way our healing spells are setup it seems like we are only intended to heal the casters in a group not the melee. If you can get a mob slowed first try then you have a chance of keeping up on heals.</div></div><hr />

You should and you can. That is, if you have at least Kragg's. It will not be easy and you may have to bring someone to slow in your stead. But then clerics tend to run out of mana too at that point in the game unless they have a slower.<br />
<br />
You will certainly need to readjust to early and more healing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jedcea</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok well here is the thing.<br />
<br />
Almost all old content is green right around 62 so a player really has no reasonable alternative but to go into PoP, which can be accessed much earlier. I guess my point is by 63 I would expect to be able to keep an average group alive in lower tier planes equally as well as I could comparable encounters at comparable levels in old content. <br />
<br />
I guess alot of it goes back to what is the role and vision of the shaman class. My take on it, I am a priest class, bottom line. While never wanting or expecting to be as good as a cleric, nor wanting rezz's etc, I do believe that healing should remain a primary skill.<br />
<br />
I guess what I am saying is I agree we need fast heal capability, however the only ones I am seeing spoken of is those for current end game levels which I believe leaves a huge gap between chloroblast and whatever that next spell ends up being. I believe there needs to be one in between the two. I have Tnargs, and it just doesn't cut it. You don't always have ten seconds for that spell to get off. Chloro just can't brdige the gap something is needed that can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmmm.................what I am reading on various boards states that shaman heal + slow falls far below cleric healing. <br />
<br />
If I am doing as you say and healing sooner, not slowing, etc. What happens when the wrong person suddenly gets aggro which whether we like it or not happens = /? How can I recover the situation? I have no problem with challenging, I would like a fair shot at succeeding.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">My take: I've been the main healer in groups with friends through most of my progression; just not so much in PoP. At 55-60, in PoI, PoD and PoN, a bounced slow on the first of a two-pullwouild have meant a group wipe if I was the only healer - except that we had a Bard in our group for pre-slow, crowd controll, and resist debuffs. PoJ was never any problem, even without him.<br />
<br />
So I'd say that there's a lull, before you get your best (so far) spells and rack up some AAs, where you can be main healer, but only if you're not the only slower and debuffer at the same time.</div></div><hr />

I'll take another crack at this since I didn't realize it was specific to level 62 and trying to heal in pop.  Those were my most difficult levels also.  All I can say is that things get better as you add aa's and equipment.  There is nothing wrong with you if you can't heal efficiently at that level and in that content.<br />

<br />
Lol maybe I am confusing a few things here. Sorry not meaning to.<br />
<br />
While I can fullly see the ability improves as you get to be higher level with better gear, aa's etc, the tier one content also becomes what is considered trivial. A shaman at that point should be fighting in tier 2 / tier 3 should they not?<br />
<br />
<br />
Many folks have said our abilities have not &quot;kept up&quot; since Velious.<br />
<br />
I probably should have posed it in more of a true / false type scenario as it is definitely aimed toward a very specific point along the progression.<br />
<br />
1) A shaman at this level has difficulty fulfiling thier &quot;Priest class&quot; roll in this content? True/False<br />
<br />
2) If 1 is true and we are discussing &quot;fixing&quot; the &quot;Priest class&quot; aspects, should this also be addressed as part of the &quot;fix&quot;? True/False<br />
<br />
Obviously my answer is True on both counts. <br />
<br />
<br />
BTW thank you for confirming I am not crazy that it is extremely difficult at this point. = )<br />

<br />
I was able to primary healer in POV/POS on my most recent shammy at lvl 60.<br />
<br />
And thats with no AA's.  Actually it was painfully easy and I stayed FOM, just takes strategy... since you have to get the mob slowed every time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">What sort of trouble are you having?<br />
<br />
I mean, are you running out of mana?  Are you not able to cast fast enough?  Are heals not big enough?  Are tanks dying too quick for you to keep up?  <br />
<br />
Do folks die when you bounce a slow?  There are a lot of different ways to have problems healing.  I don't honestly think that a shaman should be able to heal as effectively as a cleric or druid in the places you mentioned. <br />
<br />
Should they be able to keep their group alive through a lot of canni and some spell haste focii and AA?  Sure.  I get what you're saying but PoP mobs hit way too hard for our heals (and mana ) to keep up when we are both healer and slower before 65.   The game changed with PoP.  Either accept it or pick a different class.  They're not going to go back and retune the mobs so we can be main healer with 5k buffed tanks against PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
I'm definitely, absolutely not trying to be mean.  I understand it's probably a little culture shock to go from luclin/velious/kunark-era zones where shaman healing was pretty solid and then go to PoP where it's not quite enough without some focii and quiescence.  I'm just trying to let you know the reality.  At 62 and 63, you're not going to be able to heal as efficiently as a druid or cleric, and if you can keep your group alive it is going to be a struggle.<br />
<br />
Good luck.  =)</div></div><hr />

Actually there can be several misc contributing factors, not all at once mind you but each one can easily turn it into someone wiping. <br />
<br />
The following scenarios come to mind. Resisted slow, add, another group member accidentally getting aggro. Mana is not the problem. The real problem I see is not being able to cast fast enough and heals not being big enough to get the situation back under control. <br />
<br />
Those are some very good questions and I appreciatte the opportunity to talk through some potential scenarios.<br />
<br />
Lets take the following example, what would you do?<br />
<br />
The group ranges between 60-63 with average not spectacular by any means gear, figure 10 aas a piece.<br />
<br />
Lets say we are in PoN and we pull one of those lovely little raven guys who resists slow, the MT takes some pretty heavy hits and you are casting Tnarg, all of a sudden one of those tree guys is there and aggros on another player lets say a caster, what do you do to get the situation back in hand?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Root one and get everyone to move back.<br />
<br />
But seriously, does everyone have their thumb up their ass when this happens?<br />
<br />
For tanks, A SK can lifetap to help you with healing, a pally can group heal, a warrior is going to have to taunt a pray he gets the tree on him.<br />
<br />
Any caster (bar a mage) can root the mob off.  A mage can offtank with his pet (which should be focused and he should be using a tank pet unless you have an enchanter). A BST pet can offtank just fine as well.<br />
<br />
Rangers can do fine CC, rogues... just DPS.<br />
<br />
If you're grouped with a warrior, make sure they don't neglect their AC for all HP.  All HP is nice if you have complete heals landing, but for shaman healing avoidance and mitigation are key.  I know when I used to play my SK/SHM pair, I'd tell the warrior not to tank, because even though she had 800 more HP, they did jack since her AC was about 100 points below my SK.  She tied herself to cleric healing by gear selection - even though her HP went down slower as a percentage, the SHM didn't heal as a percentage, as she absolutely lost HP faster.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">At 58 I pretty easily healed in POI factory where mobs are hitting for around 500? but no procs.  This assumed that there was only one person taking a beating at a time, and single pulls (or fast roots on doubles) helped immensly.  What you can do will largely depend on how good your tank is (mine at the time was a 63+ SK/ 65 ranger).  Until you get into tier2 (and maybe even 3), Kraggs is by far your best heal since you don't need burst healing usually--you need efficient heals.<br />
<br />
At 63, I easily (although it got iffy at times) healed in BOT vs stormriders, but the giants just hit too hard to be the slower AND the healer at that level.<br />
<br />
At 64+ I easily healed in HOH, although there were a couple wipes with multi pulls that had resistant mobs.  SO anyway, my point is shaman are decent healers in tier1/2 and parts of 3, but your tank is going to make a difference (i.e. a level 58 warrior isn't a good tank for tier2, etc).<br />
<br />
So where do shaman clearly suck at healing?  When things hit for 800s and 900s or more and mitigate slow and come in multiples.  Of course, I concede the point that some shaman with time level gear with above par tanks aren't going to notice the problems that the more casual non-raiding shaman with a 65 tank with bazaar gear and 30 AAs will notice in these areas, and it gets worse in upper end GoD where shaman can't even heal one round of combat while spamming the best heal without getting a crit on every heal.<br />
<br />
So to sum up:  There really isn't a problem that I ever noticed in lower content (as long as you are of the PROPER LEVEL, which you clearly are), but there is a problem in hard LDON's, upper tier POP and a good majority of GOD, and this will probably get worse in OOW assuming no changes are made.<br />
<br />
P.S.  A group of 60-63s only shouldn't have a single problem in PON assuming you aren't pulling trains on your group.  Even if there is a resisted slow and an add comes into camp.  Tell the tank to back the F*** off and kite it around if it looks bad, at least this would be my response. For perspective on this, PON (in the area with the trees and such) used to be turning light blue at 62...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>beriah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">How the hell can you get a resisted slow in PON after casting Malo? I dont even get resists there at 60 without malo, but hell if you toss malo first at 63 there is no way in hell you will get a resist.<br />
<br />
If your short on time, root all incomming mobs, malo, slow them.. then tell the tank to engage.<br />
<br />
Like I said, tactics is really key.. and there are lots of tricks you can do to handle heals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">You can heal just fine in tier 1, and slow with a moderately geared tank, say 4k buffed hps. Bounce a slow though and ya might end up with a dead tank. Teir 2 your looking at a 6-7k tank, and once again if you bounce slow your probably looking at a dead tank (from my own personal experience)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My take: I've been the main healer in groups with friends through most of my progression; just not so much in PoP.

<br />
Samanna is correct.  But really I think it goes even further because in some &quot;troublesome&quot; groups I had during those levels even being a secondary healer and slower agro and lack of crowd control killed a lot of the groups.  Many (not all) tanks had difficulty holding agro especially warriors of that level and I was a paper shaman of sorts back then.  The defensive aa's, casting subtelty, more ac, more hps that I have now make a HUGE difference in survivablity as well as having Q on full time in tough situations.<br />
<br />
Anyway I suggest just blowing thru those levels, getting to 65 and spending a weekend playing non-stop in BOT to get some aa's and maybe some ornate chain junk.  I remember when I made the decision to get out of the &quot;hell&quot; level of 61ish it took only 2 days to make 65.  Get in good groups and stay.  Get in castle group in Disease, then move to POV and get in OC or IC, then get in any South group in BOT and stay there.  The reasons for these camps are that groups usually survive people leaving the experience groups and its a 24/7 solution.<br />
<br />
My idea obviously does not address your concerns about level 62 &quot;suckage&quot; nor is it a barrel of fun, but in 2-3 days of playing your problem will be solved for the most part and thats not bad.  After you hit 65 then you can do LDON's which will sharpen your skills in a non-camp environment.<br />

Just trash mobs of course but even though the MT moaned like a baby I would slap stoicism on him.  Pallies or SK don't really rely on damage to hold aggro so its no big deal if they are slowed.  But like was said earlier if a caster in your groups get aggro from an add tell them to deal with it till you can slow it. Wizards, necros, druids can root and mage and bst are soloing classes so if they can't handle an add they aren't exactly the best at what they are doing.<br />
<br />
 The trouble I had was when a couple slows bounced and I had to choose between heal and slow.  Usually a root and yell to back up helps alot.  Or just have one of the other classes root the mob at camp spot.  Any good tank will know to stand as close as possible to mob and all others at max melee range. So aggro shouldn't be a problem with rooted mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Invest a few aa points in VP. You can really solve a ton of problems with this ability. Bouncing the mob away from the group is the key. A lot of people dont see &quot;MOB ROOTED&quot; messages til its too late and root is off. <br />
<br />
Honestly, a shaman as full-time only healer and slower in a lvl 60 group in POV is GOING to have a difficult road. Not impossible though. Torpor is essential, as is Malo. Malo on incoming (most good XP spots have a decent window you can see the mob coming) and Slow asap, then drop a heal asap. Good use of root and tank-swapping helps too, Torp the MA, let the SA take over a bit, Torp him, blast heal the MA. <br />
<br />
Not easy thats for sure. If you have someone else who can slow, that would be better. You could focus on healing. Paladins are nice as back-up healer-tank combos in these types of groups. A pally friend and I did so many LDoNs with just us healing and me slowing and any 4 other people, we dindt care. Had 2 rogues and 2 wizzies once, I stopped bothering to slow, heh.</div></div><hr />

A large percentage of tank aggro is generated by means other than how fast they are swinging the metal. Taunt, spells for knights, beg-disarm for warriors, there are lots of ways. Torpor IS your bread and butter. If you have Knights tanking, they can take that time to stun-lifetap-dark-blind. It is not only a viable option, its pretty much a necessity. In fact, if you dont have the spell, go do the Stoicism quest, its even worse, but is STILL enough to put you well over the top of healing in those places you describe. <br />
<br />
Oh and as for the melee responses, tell em to suck it up, 6 tics of a snare/slow isnt gonna hurt THAT much. Tanks stop bullets, not drop bombs. Thats what Wizards are for.</div></div><hr />

If your tank is below 70% or so there really is no reason to not have Torpor running on him really. What you loose in tank taunt you make up for in lessened heal aggro anyways.<br />
<br />
You do have an alternative in Kragg's mending though - I would wager it is a little worse overall but the tank will feel better. :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Benadan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Lets take the following example, what would you do?<br />
<br />
The group ranges between 60-63 with average not spectacular by any means gear, figure 10 aas a piece.<br />
<br />
Lets say we are in PoN and we pull one of those lovely little raven guys who resists slow, the MT takes some pretty heavy hits and you are casting Tnarg, all of a sudden one of those tree guys is there and aggros on another player lets say a caster, what do you do to get the situation back in hand?<br />
<br />
Root the add, torpor/sto the caster and get back on the MT. Assuming the caster in question is not a chanter, you should have some one designated to tank mezz duty. Healing 2 targets gets alot harder, and as much as the melees may not like it you need to be using your HoT in this situtation. Your HoT will not replace actually healing but it will slow down the HP drain giving you a better chance to keep up with both targets.</div></div><hr />

If there is a druid in the group why would he be healing?? A mage could be in trouble if they do not have the correct pet up. With a beast in group let him slow, and you just focus on heals.</div></div><hr />

Melee will complain loud and often until they realize it is this way or they can do a CR and look for a rez. It is when you start to fall behind in healing that you use your HoT, not right off the bat. If the melees clearly understand that you need to use the HoT to keep them alive they grumble less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Wodon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">PoV main slower/healer is doable from 60 if you have malo &amp; a good puller, or someone to kite/cc any adds. Outer is probably the best camp for it, as you get a fairly good lead for casting. EC &amp; WC can be a prob because of the hills. That said, another 58+ druid or shaman is a big help (druids are great for harmony pulling there). Mind you when I've done it, I've always been on a mount &amp; had mana regen buffs (PoT9 was good enough).</div></div><hr />

How true.  I do know my warrior friend help track down a cheap copy of Q for me she hated torpor so much, but she never turned down a chance to get exp, torpored or not.</div></div><hr />

Fortunately im blessed with having skilled friends to play with, wich is the sole reason i dont give my account away or cancel it.<br />
<br />
However, as a shaman, i am not blessed with the surplus healing power to take care of ALL tier 3/2/1 camps. Neither am i packing the surplus healing power thats needed to take care of a mediocre group.</div></div><hr />

I did main healer in PoN with a tank in mostly crafted. Fight zone walls if you are having problems with adds(note... not zone in/out). Root and back off. Get that in peoples heads, or dont feel bad when they die. Make an /assist puller hotkey, and have it malo'd on inc, you really shouldnt have any problems landing slow.</div></div><hr />

Bah, torpor them on incoming I say. :D <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">A lot depends on who's in the group and who's pulling but I agree that a 62+shaman should be fine. <br />
<br />
If you've got a bard then you should be getting single pulls, pre-debuffed as they arrive in camp. Already its 34% slowed and snared, or at least its resists reduced. Malo + slow and you shouldn't get resists.<br />
<br />
If you've got a chanter then they can help with tash/slow, and also mezz any adds. In a pinch they can use rune to protect people.<br />
<br />
Paladin MT? Get them to help out with group heals and emergency heals, they're actually very good at it. Ask them to stun on inc, gains a few valuable seconds to debuff and all but guarantees them aggro.<br />
<br />
SK MT? They can lifetap at the start if things get hairy. Snare and kite. FD if its really bad and someone else can take a few hits.<br />
<br />
Warrior MT? Should have enough hp and mitigation to take a few hits unslowed before you're ready to heal. <br />
<br />
Ranger? Have them pull with snare, so you have time to malos and slow on inc. No problems to stick torpor on youself before the pull if aggro is a worry. They can help heals a little bit too in a pinch.<br />
<br />
Beastlord? Get them to help slow. Can also help heal in a pinch, and offtank mobs with their pet - who they can heal remarkably well. Often, pet will take aggro if the MT backs off and pet taunt is on, which is great if you need a couple more seconds before a heal lands.<br />
<br />
Mages - same deal as beastlords with their pets.<br />
<br />
Wizards - masters at AE snareing and kiting, put it to use if you get adds. Can also burn mobs down fast if MT isn't looking like making it.<br />
<br />
Monks - can still tank a little, particularly with discs and mend, and then FD before they get too low on health. <br />
<br />
The overall message is that you CAN heal, but it does require a bit more skill on behalf of the whole group than with a cleric. On the flip side you can replace that cleric with some dps for faster and more exciting xp :) And as others have said, don't be too shy to use torpor on the MT (don't hit the rogues with it though!) at the start of a fight. They can always click it off after a few ticks if all is ok.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u40"><b>Finn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p40">Yep.  I remember.  Those were tough levels for shaman to slow and heal in PoP.<br />
<br />
I remember that you can't slow the mob to early, or you get aggro.  And you can't heal the tank too early too, or you get healing aggro.  And if your slow gets resisted, and you have to recast it, you get aggro.  Then you fall into the tnarg-slow spiral, where you only have time to keep the tank alive and not slow the mob.<br />
<br />
I would say to stick it out to 65 and get Malos and Q right out of the box.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>zolexa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">I did some healing in PoD courtyards 58+, PoV 61+.  Main thing this as mentioned, tactics.  Did a PoV group somewhere around 61 where cleric rep ws still inc and the warrior LD'd.  We had the ranger tank for a while.  Once slow most mobs aren't an issue to keep a reasonabley geared person healed.  The ranger in this case would snare-kite until slow then tank after.  This gave me time to malo/slow.<br />
<br />
Sounds like from your PoN senario adds where your biggest issue.  Having a group work together to all fill into CC roles when the group make up is less than 'optimal' is needed.   Everyone needs to pay close attention and margin for error is less.<br />
<br />
About Torpor on tanks.  Was 64 doing a hard LDoN with friends all 65.  Cleric had her PC fry about 10 mins into the adv.  The tank was exceptional, but I would still need to heal him.  We had a bard, who took to pre-slowing, but even though I was strained on mana, I still slowed myself.  The differencein the slows meant an extra heal or two.  I tried not to Torpor the warrior, but once or twice I had to.  Later he asked me about it.  He was shocked to see me cast it on him, but he knew at that instant, it was my only option.  Most tanks I've had to torpor in the past realized this also.  If any complain I simply ask, Would you rather be dead or snared?  They usually deal with it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">I lived in that content for a long long time. <br />
<br />
Torpor the tanks. If they bitch Let them die. <br />
<br />
Keep regen up at all times. It doesnt seem like much but it is the differance. <br />
<br />
If mana is getting to be a problem Swap down to a lower level slow at times. I have used Togors or even Tagars on occasion when mana was tight till I could get back in groove.<br />
<br />
Buff the snot out of them. Yes Agility aint much. And it probably won't help. But 3% is Three %. Give them AC buff Since cleric isnt around. <br />
<br />
If two coming on pull Blind one. Then root that sucker. Or get the tanks used to backing up and root and split that way.<br />
<br />
You have mutt O Doom. Use him to split. 10 seconds of enrage can make the differance. Then make a new pup.<br />
<br />
Basicly to do it you have to work 53% harder than a cleric does. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u43"><b>Trazzaz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p43">I guess what I am saying is I agree we need fast heal capability, however the only ones I am seeing spoken of is those for current end game levels which I believe leaves a huge gap between chloroblast and whatever that next spell ends up being. I believe there needs to be one in between the two. I have Tnargs, and it just doesn't cut it. You don't always have ten seconds for that spell to get off. Chloro just can't brdige the gap something is needed that can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tnarg's is NOT a  ten second cast time ... IT is a  3.75 sec cast time or so and  heals  base  for  1300hp.     Krag's Mending is a  10 Sec cast time and is 1950  hp...  Krag's is  lvl 58   Tnarg's is lvl 62 .    Topor is  300hp a  tick and  is  lvl 60  with these three spells I was more then able to be main healer and main  slower all the  way  up to  BOT and HoH.   There are  LOTS of places you can  go at  lvl  62  for decent  but not  awesome  experience. <br />
<br />
 Listed below are just a  few:<br />
Chardok B ( Halls of Betrayel ) <br />
Sol C ( Caverns of Exile) <br />
Madiens Eye<br />
Akheva Ruins<br />
Umbral Plains<br />
Accursed Temple of Cazic Thule<br />
Plane of Hate <br />
<br />
YOu should be able to  solo, dou or  group in any of those  places.   Also if you ahve all the  spells  up to lvl  62   you  should be  able to  handle  PoI , PoJ, PoD, and most of  PoN .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Jaidin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">At level 63, Tnargs is plenty of healing to keep up with an unslowed tier1 mob until it is under control.  Keep Tnargs and Kraggs memmed at all times.  Hell, back then I think I even had Tnargs, Kraggs, and Chloroblast memmed since chloro took a lot less mana than Tnargs did.<br />
<br />
A few pointers for the original poster though:<br />
<br />
1. Malo on incoming.  Don't listen to anyone who says to wait until the tank has aggro on this spell.  Assist the puller and spam your malo key until it starts casting.  If you do not have malo, do the same with malosini (they both have similar aggro).  Then note if the mob still smacks you first and if so, leave the group or boot the MA (seriously, the malox line is so low aggro that a single arrow takes it practically).<br />
<br />
2. As soon as malo lands, cast slow.  Don't try to do a quick heal on the tank inbetwee, get that mob under control asap.  As has been said before, with a malo on a tier1 mob first you will see a slow resist one out of maybe 50 casts, *maybe*.<br />
<br />
3. Make sure you are on a mount.  If not, this should be a priority.<br />
<br />
4. I was never a big fan of Torpor on the melees when there was a mob in camp.  However, with an sk or pally tank that is an option as they will generate most of their aggro through spells anyway.  On the other hand, make sure you have torpor on yourself at all times and using canni4 as much as possible.  Tnargs might be costly and ineffecient, but constant torpor/canni4 goes a long way :)<br />
<br />
5. Try to get yourself and groupmates buffed with virtue and c3 if you can.  Some say they are &quot;crutches&quot; - don't listen.<br />
<br />
6. Beware of the dilemma you will be faced with if you decide to level to 65 and try for Q, basically that you will not be able to stay in tier1 planes (except for some very specific spots).  The XP at even level 63 in tier1 is horrible compared to tier2+.  Basically, if you plan to get to 65, you should move on to tier2+.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">At level 60 in pov inner I could keep group healed with excelelnt dps and be main slower.. that was before it was released to the world, so of course was different type of players going in there lfg.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Nothing wrong with using Torpor.<br />
<br />
Remember that the MT plate class is not necessarily there for their ability to do DPS. Other classes can easily maintain significantly higher dps than the Warrior (or, indeed, the Paladin or Shadowknight). The tank is there to generate enough aggro to maintain the mob's interest.<br />
<br />
Their aggro does not really come from their dps, but from a combination of taunt and aggro proc. Rate of proccing is not effected by the slowing of attack speed associated with Torpor, neither is taunt rate.<br />
<br />
So, although it is a commonly held misconception that torpor is not a good heal, it is, until Quiesence, our most mana efficient heal, and should be used as such.<br />
<br />
I never use our mini CH - I find the 10 second delay just too restrictive. I got an umproved healing focus item at about level 58, and I could crank out more healing with the smaller fast casting heal(Tnargs Mending?), which, in combination with torpor, should be enough to get the job done.<br />
<br />
In terms of mana efficiency, use Toropr as your primary healing tool, with Tnargs as a spot heal when you need a bigger hit of healing fast.<br />
<br />
when you are in a healing role, the hardest thing is to keep up with the mana expenditure - you should never sit, and if you aren't actually casting, you should be mashing that Canni button and torporing or stoicing yourself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">I was never a big fan of Torpor on the tanks, usually if I'm slowing it's a relatively small group and I don't want to hurt the DPS. People I grouped with on a regular basis before I had Q knew that if I was using Torpor to heal, the mana situation was getting dire. Otherwise, KM and chloroplast/Tnarg's was usually good enough to do the job. <br />
<br />
My trick to playing healer in a small group was to also pull, if possible. Pulling with Malo means that even if you get an add, you can usually park the malo'd one before you get back to camp and have it last a while. Pulling also gave me the option of putting my pet on one if it was a difficult pull. Puppy doesn't last long but usually long enough to get a pull under control. Even when it goes well, pulling with Malo means that you'll almost always have the mob slowed by the time you get it back to the group. Even at 65, if I'm duoing some place like Tactics, I still prefer to do it that way.</div></div><hr />

...or you could just spend a long day and level to 65?? And I don't say that to be flip.  Heck, what other thing (pp to buy 65 spells, maxing tradeskills, quest etc) in EQ can be remedyed by playing a full day?  Be very thankful that experience flows pretty fast in good POP groups.<br />
