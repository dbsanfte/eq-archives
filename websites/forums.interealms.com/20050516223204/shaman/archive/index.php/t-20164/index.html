<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...threads can we start that focus on healing issues and what changes could be made to healing.  We know that we have healing issues.  It doesn't need to be posted in a new thread every 10 min.  We know that FA's duration is ****y and that we'd like to increase it.  We know that some if not most of you are unhappy with the shaman class.  We don't need a new thread every 30 min discussing the fact that you plan on quitting your shaman if your demands aren't met.  Don't you get this is why the shaman community is now an absolute joke to most others.  We haven't started a &quot;we hate beastlords&quot; thread this week, maybe it's about time for someone else to step up to the plate and start one.<br />
<br />
Seriously, all this constant whining is downright frustrating.  I can understand all of the current problems with the shaman class.  But, what can be done about it.  Creating 30 new threads about the same topic and backing it up with different numbers isn't going to help us at all.  Seriously, I have problems now even reading more than the first few sentences in topics like this now that they are all the same.  What can we do about this then?<br />
<br />
Stop with the rampant rants, and how we suck as a class now, and I'm going to reroll as something that matters now.  Well, there is only one class now that really matters and that's a cleric.  Warriors can get groups easily to me it seems.  But, you know what, lately it's been &quot;we need another cleric&quot; or &quot;we need a warrior for this group&quot;.  So, if you are that unhappy, then create a cleric and be delegated to your one role in life.  Push the CH button, watch your spell the tank, count to 5, then hit it again.   All the while sitting in front of a wall not knowing how the fight is actually going.<br />
<br />
If you want something done with our class, then what needs to happen is somethign that we as a community has already done once.  We need to present another arguement for us and send it to those proper authorities.  Okay, but this didn't work for us once, then why should we do it again.  Why not?  What will it not do for us.  Send the damn thing every day.  Keep sending it over and over and over again till someone finally responds and tells us why we won't get the upgrades that we feel we need as a class.  Yes, I know you did a great job with the first proposal glori, but if you want something done right, then we have to be persistant.  Endless ranting and whining is not getting us anywhere, and has turned more people off than it hasn't.  <br />
<br />
I love my shaman.  I've said it before, and I'll say it again.  I don't like what we've become and I do feel just a slight bit underpowered at times.  However, I look at other classes and how and what they rely on and I'm glad that I chose a shaman.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  If you aren't happy, then don't play the shaman. <br />
<br />
If we want something done, then we as a community need to come together like the first time and present a decent and intelligent arguement about what we feel is our downfalls and what could be done to possibly fix them.  Once we've done this and submitted it to whomever, we need to keep at it until we get the response that we want.  Whether it be a response to why we won't get changed, or a response to what we can look forward to.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the boards have exhausted many, and maybe even driven some away.  But if the frustration is so great for many, then they are going to want to vent it out.  <br />
<br />
Unfortunately, until a rep from SOE steps up to the mic and gives us their detailed vision of what shamans are, or possible plans of tweaking us, people will remain unhappy.  Instead, it's been alot of dancing around our issues.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I dont think that the threads are &quot;do this or I quit&quot; threads.  They seem to be more along the lines of &quot;ok, I've had enough, time for something else&quot; threads.<br />
<br />
I myself don't currently expect Sony to do anything about the shaman class.  In fact, it seems very clear that they have no intention of doing anything about the shaman class.  If I choose to play another class, it will be because the other class is more fun to me though -- it wont be because I think that will somehow induce Sony into doing something.<br />
<br />
I used to enjoy every asepct of my shaman.  Now I enjoy the raiding asepct of my shaman only (because thats where I still feel useful and relevant).</div></div><hr />

Well the whinning can be frustraiting to some.  And the frustration of the class spawns whinning in others.  Maybe we need an official &quot;rant&quot; forum?</div></div><hr />

Yeah we did this already.  See the sticky notes at the top of the forum.  The response we got from this was Brenlo saying &quot;What's a Shaman&quot; and telling people not to bring up shaman issues on the SOE forums.<br />
<br />
It's perfectly reasonable for people to be upset and frustrated.<br />

Yes, we did do this already.  Once.  Brenlo's response of &quot;what is a shaman&quot; was made on a live chat forum in jest after it was already said that they wouldn't be discussing any class balance issues.  Or am I mistaken???  What I said we should do is push the issue again and again until they actually send a response back to the community.  A real response.  Not something said over a live chat (unless of course it's a live chat made up of us and them).  Yes, they might even block one email address from us.  Well, create or just use another one.  Force them to respond.  Glori... what response did you get back to the proposal that we offered before????  If I remember correctly, we didn't get one.  Not one answer back.<br />
<br />
I understand it's okay to be upset and frustrated.  I am too.  However, what good has it done us so far?  Not one bit of good, except to make us a laughingstock, right up there now with the monks.  <br />
<br />
I do agree, it is a double standard about telling people not to post rants anymore, but that isn't really my intention.  My intention is to say that enough is enough, do it in one thread.  There is no need to post a new one everytime that someone decides they have something else to offer to the table.  Maybe we just do need a new forum titled &quot;Rants&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Force them to respond.  How?  How do you force them to respond?  <br />
<br />
We have no power here.  We can jump up and down on our little messageboard and hold our breath until we turn blue in the face.  We sent snailmail, we sent email, we posted in all the places we could.  That is the best you are going to get from this community.  These actions did not force them to respond to the issues, other than to tell us to shut up.  <br />
<br />
This is part of what makes people so frustrated.  This feeling of helplessness, when you try your best to approach a problem in a calm, rational, constructive way..and just get brushed off and ignored.  Then it turns into this feeling of us vs them and it should never be that.  I think something as simple as having a representative come here and speak to us would prevent these feeling of frustration.  Look at the problems with spirit call 5, 6.  People were upset, people posted it was broken.  Someone came over and patted us on the head and said it would be fixed.  As far as I know it hasnt been, but someone reassured us that it would and then everyone felt better...<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe we just do need a new forum titled &quot;Rants&quot;  I disagree, I want any SOE representatives to see how upset we are.  I think it would be too easy for legitimate complaints to be thrown in a rants forum.  Anyways, that hasn't been my decision to make for quite sometime now, so I won't say too much more.  :)</div></div><hr />

Preach it brother!<br />
<br />
Gets tiresome hearing people tell me what I can and cannot post, what I should and should not post.  If someone has a problem with something why the hell shouldn't one post on the subject??<br />
<br />
I'd rather have discussions on the class balance issues than read another &quot;what class should I duo with&quot; thread.  But I am not going to tell people not to post about it.<br />
<br />
The board is about discussing the shaman class, and thats what is being done.  Theres only so many debates that can be had on whether or not the jaudiced bone bracer is worth it, or where I should camp for exp at level 35.<br />
<br />
The game advances, and the discussions about the game advance.  If you don't like where we have advanced to, welcome to the club.  Go back 20 pages and read the old news if you would rather do that.</div></div><hr />

have you ever been on any forum and saw someones signature that showed their best backstab was.. or how their highest nuke ever was????  If I had a nuke that crit blasted for (1) then i would post it.  Loot at gangaskans 1337 nuke.  Merely, my posting my best nuke was more of a &quot;holy ****, that was the best one that i've ever seen myself get&quot; as opposed to a &quot;holy ****, look at how leet I am&quot;.  That nuke was in the most advanced of situations, done with a huge ice focus item with a bard in the group with his new dd focus spell.  Really, who cares, if you'd like to know.. I'll post someday an over 1300 bane crit when I get one if it makes you feel better.<br />
<br />
Anyways, we've had exactly one time lately where a person came to the forums and posted.  Yes, I'm glad he did it.  But that is one time.  Tell me henora how many times we've sent that email to someone discussing our problems.  I read the message that Chutoi posted on the forums at eqlive. Now, remember it was on page 9, and before it was followed by 9 pages of whining and then another 10 pages after it of whining.  If it wasn't for someone pointing out it on page 9, 99% of you prob wouldn't have even see it in the mess.<br />
<br />
If we don't want to do anyting about the problem then that is fine.  Just leave it on the forums and maybe someday someone will notice it.  Cause it's working so far.  We've come along ways this past year in getting what we needed.</div></div><hr />

This post seriously infuriated me. And does so even more now. There has been absolutely no feedback whatsoever on this issue, and the impression we are getting is that SoE seriously believes, against all of our feedbacks, that we are fine.<br />
<br />
We aren't. As such, I feel that the more people complain the better the chance of anything getting done. Perhaps when there are anough posts, and enough people are doing feedbacks, enough people send emails, then perhaps we will get heard.<br />
<br />
I agree with you that people should not just complain on this board, but also use the in game feature /feedback and proper email's to say the same things. Show your displasure everyway possible, including complaining here.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Valsuvius, if you have to say good things about shaman and EQ in general to stay on good terms with your contacts on the dev team just go ahead and say it.<br />
<br />
Most of us don't play that metagame.  We don't participate in the useless excuse of beta testing that SOE offers and we're ignored when we go through the sanctioned channels.  That is why you see fairly serious discussions here.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Excellent point even if I'm sick of seeing repetitive threads about shaman inadequacies too. And hey, if shaman suck so damn bad why do so many people use them in multi-boxing configs? Hmm. <br />
<br />
Because shaman can do both slow and heal. Chanter cant heal, druid cant slow , bst cant heal enough. Doesnt mean we are balanced. Somewhere in the grand scheme of things everythings was slanted heavily toward slow being all powerful. As thats being changed and more healing is needed we are still being treated as &quot;all powerful&quot; because we can slow. <br />
<br />
   Sure i can two box in alot of places with a shaman and whomever. That isnt particually hard to heal in tier one , tier two even ldon ive done with 3 and the shaman healing. How well would that go if 70% of the mobs in ldon normal mitigated slow for shaman without healing aa or alot of gear? The fact that 3 shaman in a group could crit heal on tnargs at the same time and not heal a okie geared warrior but a mob could take one out in that time is kinda irritating. IN ONE Person events too. I just dont see the point sony holding back on fixing us up a little on heals. So what if it unbalances some lower pop stuff or ldon pop stuff. That stuff isnt hard to do anymore as it is.</div></div><hr />
