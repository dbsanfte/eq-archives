<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beelziod_EternalWrath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I solo'd about 40 aa pts there.<br />
<br />
I would solo in the area just east of the zone into HOHb you must be warry of the wandering LT. 's but its not too hard.. just root rot.<br />
<br />
You can also easily do Hero Hall and the Trial rooms just watch and not get the unrootables.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>zimgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Do you pull with slow.....or try to root first before slow?<br />
And what spells you use?<br />
ATM I do not have any 65 spells but Malos.<br />

Pull with Malos, run away a bit.  Root mob with the lvl 64 root.  Then Slow, Sinia and Mal Decay it.  Get on horse, mem up lots of dots and lay some serious rotting smackdown on the mob.  Re-root as necessary.  Collect AA points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Whenever you solo anything in PoP, you want to pull with malos (or malo in your case, doesn't make much difference).  If you pull with slow and it gets resisted, then you try to root it and get resisted, then get resisted on root again, you're either going to have to kite around (not alot of room to kite in most pop zones) or just die (which especially sucks in lowly populated zones like hoh).<br />
<br />
Pull with malo, run away a bit, and root it with the root of your choice.  I have ornate legs (greater immobolize clicky) so I just use those, but any root will work, really.  When I solo in pofire, I keep true greater immo memmed because it casts a lot faster (1.8sec vs. 3sec) and I am more likely to get it off between their attacks (only partially slowable, and hit for 800's).  Basically, though, any root will work.<br />
<br />
Once it is rooted, apply slow, malosinia, malicious decay, whatever else you want.<br />
<br />
Start dotting, and remember to refresh root and slow, if applicable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Togh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">When I want to solo for pure XP, this is where I go. I dual rot 2 Valorian Guards at a time with epic/BoU/BoS. It usually takes me about 7 minutes to kill them both to get 11% total. This is the best XP I have found so far, although I'm not elemental flagged.<br />
<br />
I usually take NE, SW, or NW camps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Salas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">when i solo'd there i found that they have way more hp then pov mobs and give the same xp there also hard to split</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">If you don't have much hps and really can't afford to get hit, here's how you do it.  First buy Virulent Paralysis.  Pull with Malicious Decay and then hit VP to root the mob.  It's never resisted if you MD first.  Never had it resist once like that.  Then at your leisure, apply malo/s and turgurs, then start stacking dots.  Start with the ones that won't break root and work to the other ones.</div></div><hr />
