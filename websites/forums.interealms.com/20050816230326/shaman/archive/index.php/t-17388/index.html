<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>loobusk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Man is this pissing me off; <br />
Im able to run two instances of EQ in windowed mode. I also made it so that ALT+TAB would work under windows XP to switch between the two programs. And yeah, even on my P4 2.6 ghz HT, 1024mb ram, radeon 9800 pro, there is lag prevalent while running two sessions at once with above avg modes(all models, 1280x1024, full clipping, no FSAA or ansio.f) But I can deal with that. What I cant stand though is the fact that on random and unpredictable occasions I lose control of my mouse pointer when switching between the two instances. I have to ALT-TAB repeatedly to make it work , but it happens again and again, and gets REALLY aggravating when for example my duo needs to run and I cant target anything to follow, or when my tank needs a desperate heal from the cleric...the cleric is looking at the sky(Although I can use the keyboard to do some of this, it is virtually impossible to change directions, click on objects, or target; especially while on autofollow%T, which is most of the time.)<br />
It seems as though when this happens, the mouse pointer gets stuck on the start menu or the desktop. Trying to click on anything will result in the whole window itself being moved, and the start menu popping up. I've tried auto-hiding the startmenu, un checking the option to keep it below/above windows, etc. I even tinkered with tweakui, but to no avail. What the heck is causing this? Has anyone ever faced this problem before or perhaps know of a fix? Help would really be appreciated because more and more I try to play EQ under these cirumstances the more frustrated I am getting with the game altogether. <br />
P.S I use a optical cordless, Logitech MX 700 mouse and cordless keyboard combo. Winxp SP1, all the latest drivers, no background programs or detectable ad/spyware (I'm kind of a freak at this:/ ), cable connection.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Your issue sounds like EQ gets confused about whether it released the mouse or not.  You may need to smack your mouse release key combo on each switch.<br />
<br />
EQWindows has been fixed to work.  I used to use it for multiples on the same box and it worked fine.  Lately, I've only used it for a single session though.<br />
<br />
What I used to do to kill lag when running multiples was drop the clip plane on the bot to nil and do everything with hotkeys.  FSAA and aniso with your card on 2X can improve speed on some applications - not sure about EQ.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">My setup does that too, even using EQW. It works fine for hours then all of a sudden starts acting strange like that... nothing in EQ puts me in a worse mood than having to release/renew the mouse every time I alt tab back to my shaman account :mad:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Happens all the time, I'm used to it.  Rapid Alt-Tab'ing will return it.<br />
<br />
But the best way to get the mouse to snap to your current window is to Alt-Enter.  It forces it.</div></div><hr />

If I may.. don't download EQW.  It's no longer a supported application (i.e. the designer no longer does anything with it) and since several patches ago occasionally the keyboard will lock up entirely in one of your sessions.</div></div><hr />

Yar I just happened to hit reply on your post and it was last... and I was too lazy to delete the quote =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Haagen, can't say that I've seen that problem myself.  It's most likely a problem with some bit of software that's been installed.  A recent one was the ATI hotkey manager causing issues.</div></div><hr />

Just one experience of many, but personally I'm not sure how anyone could use EQ's windowed mode to 2box and not go insane.  I can't even use it to 1box, as when i alt-enter to window it, my screen goes really dark (tinted window bug).  I have experienced the mouse locking problem in Sony's windowed mode, which by the way seems very laggy when 2boxing - maybe something about not sharing memory?  At any rate I have a good system and EQW runs two (or more!) windows quite well, unlike Sony's version.  I've never experienced the keyboard locking bug mentioned, but then I haven't twoboxed in a while; I cancelled my second account about three months ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have the same problem all the time when I'm running two boxes on my main system (only when I'm trying poorly to run a third character). I didn't want to use eqw because of the bug listed that makes you have to reload if you ctrl-alt-del in win2k and I use this quite a bit to unlock mouse/kb problems.</div></div><hr />
