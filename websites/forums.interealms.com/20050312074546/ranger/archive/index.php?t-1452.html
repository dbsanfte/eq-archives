<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xlurkerx</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, last week, I was thinking... No one is ever in the ranger channel. I know how useful the glade is, so I thought how useful it would be to have a ranger chat channel. So, I joined the chat channel, /whoed up rangers, and sent this tell &quot;I would like to advertise the rangers chat channel on this server. /join rangers:rangers&quot;. What surprised me, was that most of the rangers replied with &quot;Cool thx&quot; or &quot;Thx man&quot;. I had no &quot;go away&quot; or anything negative. It was all cool :cool: <br />
<br />
Anyways. After sending tells to all the 50+ non-anonymous rangers on at that time, we had about 15 people in the channel. That was cool :) Now, zip ahead to yesterday.<br />
<br />
Now usually, we have 5-8 people in the channel, usually the common ones have /autojoin rangers:rangers enabled, as do I.<br />
So yesterday, I'm on this kael raid with my guild, down in quest house. As we're medding up, ready for the next round of giant slaying, I notice a ranger's corpse which I have seen in the channel before. I see someone rez him and he pops up and loots. I wave at him and say hi, and before he says anything, he hands me a Goranga Idol! (8 ac 4 dex 3 str and some resist - ranged slot) I say thanx so much, and I'm just shocked, I've never talked to him before, the only way we know each other is we've both talked in the channel.<br />
<br />
I've just like to say Thanks to Puvien (if he visits here) and to rangers for being friendly and cool :cool: . So, if you're on prexus, /join rangers:rangers and if you're on a diff server, get your ranger community in your channel and start chatting :)<br />
<br />
Thanx</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldaas</div><div class="date">04-17-2002, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">awesome!  i've also noticed that rangers are some of the most friendly people.  I've never really gotten too much for free off them but information, and information can be the useful thing sometimes.  I've had people suggest spell stratigies ( like using SLR to heal pre 39) and equipment upgrades (DHY and so on).  Anyways its great to duo with another ranger.  I usually duoed with a number of rangers while i was in IC.  One snare and the puller fear.  Safe and effective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Erryn_On_Prexus</div><div class="date">05-29-2002, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">now I know the rangers:rangers secret chat channel on prexus.  Ok so you were probably the one that invited me into the channel when they first came out, but I lost track of the channel name and was trying stuff like ranger:ranger, theglade:ranger ranger:theglade glade:ranger etc....<br />

See you prexians online</div></div><hr />
