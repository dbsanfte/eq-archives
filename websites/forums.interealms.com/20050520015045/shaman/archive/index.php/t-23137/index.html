<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'd like to know what everyone thinks of the current crop of video card, especially with respect for current EQ, EQ 2/WoW down the road, and even other games in general.<br />
<br />
Right now I have a GeForce 4 Ti 4400.   It's been a workhorse for me since I bought it awhile ago (when they were new).   The rest of my computer has been upgraded over time, and only the video card is &quot;old&quot;.<br />
<br />
I've kinda resigned myself to the fact that the new cards (and even top end old cards) are still expensive.    New mid/mainstream cards are in the pipe and coming down (GF 6600, ATI X600) and those should be cheaper.<br />
<br />
I generally buy a card, and skip 1-2 generations of cards.   I have mostly been an nvidia fan, but the ATI 9800+ lines of ATI have been getting some impressive feedback.<br />
<br />
Currently in stock around town (Toronto) I've been able to find name brand X800 Pro's,  3rd party X800 Pros and XTs, X800 Pros that &quot;possibly&quot; can be overclocked/modded into XTs, and original model GF 6800's.<br />
<br />
Currently EQ does not support hardware rendering in GeForce 6800s... this has been confirmed on the tech boards, and they are looking into a fix.<br />
<br />
Original GeForce 6800s have good performance... but are noisy, take up 2 slots, run fairly hot... not bad cards... just not as &quot;clean&quot; a design as the ATI cards.<br />
<br />
There is the pure ATI X800 Pro, which doesn't seem to be upgradeable to the XT level.<br />
<br />
There's Sapphire X800 Pros which &quot;maybe&quot; can be softmoded up to the XT level of pipes and clocks for the same price.<br />
<br />
There's Sapphire X800 XT's, which cost more but are for sure to be XT level.<br />
<br />
I'm kinda picky about my cards... I really don't know, or trust Sapphire... I think that if I wanted to go ATI ... I'd want a built by ATI, and not Powered By... but I could just be cutting myself out of free performance upgrades for the sake of being &quot;pure ati&quot;.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have any thoughts on &quot;Built by ATI&quot; vs &quot;Powered by ATI&quot;?<br />
<br />
For about $500:<br />
- ATI 9800 XT.... old tech (heh, &quot;old&quot;)... old speed king... solid card... slightly cheaper.<br />
<br />
For about $600:<br />
- ATI X800 Pro... pure ATI, 2nd fastest model available, almost for sure not easily upgraded to XT level.<br />
<br />
- Sapphire X800 Pro ... virtually the same as the ATI, $10 more, at least a modest chance that it can be software (bios) upgraded to the X800 XT level.   &quot;free&quot; performance upgrade... however this is not guarenteed, and even if it works, stability may be affected.  A lot of success stories with early models... but also some problem stories.  <br />
<br />
- ASUS nVidia GeForce 6800 ... it's their custom card, V9999 Gamer Edition... original GF 6800 (big, noisy, hot).    They did some custom upgrades on it... it's nearly equal to the GT performance.<br />
<br />
For about $750: (ouch... getting expensive)<br />
<br />
- Sapphire, X800 XT.    Top of the line &quot;powered by&quot; ATI... at a dang expensive cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's also the option of ordering a GeForce 6800 GT version online... for about $600.   The GT is the refined 6800 basically... smaller, cooler, quieter, and better performance than original 6800s.   Ordering online has hassles of waiting, might be out of stock, etc...   it's not really the waiting that bothers me so much.... it would just piss me off to be dragged along week after week saying &quot;its on order&quot;.   Thats why I like using real stores, with in stock.<br />
<br />
A 6800 looks like a BAD buy right now, with EQ not fully supporting it... I figure SOE will get this fixed up pretty quick ... they are part of the nvidia &quot;The way it's meant to be played&quot; or whatever campaign... nothing says you suck more than not supporting your partners new best card.<br />
<br />
As I said... I'm a bit hesitant on the &quot;Built by ATI&quot; Sapphire cards... I'd be leaning pure ATI... but the chance of a free software upgrade to an XT level on the Sapphire is really appealing.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have one of these cards and regret it?   Like you bought an X800 Pro, and were just disappointed?  (or the opposite, really excited?)<br />
<br />
I'm also looking beyond Everquest... EQ 2 will require a nice DX 9 card.    My current GeForce 4 is only a DX 8 card in hardware I think.... maybe even EQ 1 would benifit from a fully DX 9 card.<br />
<br />
(Keep in mind my prices above were Canadian prices, ballpark, take 30% or so off them for american prices)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your thoughts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, I have been pleased as punch with my Nvidia GeForce FX 5200 with 128 memory.  Now this is certainly way more low-price than your other options at about $75 US. on sale but it works like a dream on my machine P4 3.0 ghz.  No need to spend that much on a card IMHO unless you are boxing a bunch of toons.<br />
<br />
I used to have the Ti4200 also and the above card is significantly better as you might excect.  Is it uberific, of course not but a good buy IMHO.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">My understanding of the FX 5200's were that they are remarked GF 4 MX cards.    There was a review on Toms Hardware that showed the performance of the GF 4 Ti series was better than a FX 5200.<br />
<br />
I believe the FX 5700 are where the performance starts to be better.  <br />
<br />
Of course, I don't have a 5200 (or 5700) so I can't say that as a fact, and that particular video card roundup could have shown the Ti 4x00 line better in a specific test.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Here it is:<br />
<br />
Tom's Hardware 2004-1 Video Card Roundup (http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/index.html) <br />
<br />
A couple of specific tests...<br />
<br />
Call of Duty - OpenGL (http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/vga-charts-05.html) <br />
<br />
The GF 4 Ti 4400 beats out the FX 5200 pretty well (but I doubt it's really noticeable at those framerates)<br />
<br />
Quake 3 - OpenGL (http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/vga-charts-06.html) <br />
<br />
Results are much closer in Quake 3.<br />
<br />
Halo - DX 9 (http://graphics.tomshardware.com/graphic/20031229/vga-charts-09.html) <br />
<br />
Halo is DX 9 and makes heavy use of Pixel Shaders.   Not a perfectly fair comparison since the GF 4 is running in DX 8 mode I guess... but still fairly fast all things considered.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Alphar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Bite the bullet and buy a x800. It is a one slot solution that doesn't require a gargantuan power supply and the quantum leap in performance means it will last for years down the road. The ONLY advantange the Nvida card has is the support for pixel 3.0, which won't show up in games for probably 5 years hence. The leap in performance with these new cards just makes the choice a no brainer. My x800 smokes my old card and it was a 9800xt.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">well .... for $150 us  ( 1 million canadian  :p  )   you could get a geforce    5500   pny etc  256 meg ram  fully loaded   at best buy   thats what i bought and i couldnt be happier    i can pretty much run full models and particles without laging on raids  pok thats a nother sotry  wuwu  4 fps roxxors your boxxxors</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I would recommend getting the pci-express version of the card for forward compatibility, especially since you mention that you tend to skip a generation or two.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Budana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would look into a  MSI ATI RX9800PRO Video Card, 128MB DDR,256-bit, DVI/S-Video, 8X AGP, Model &quot;RX9800PRO-TD128&quot; -RETAIL.<br />
<br />
Check newegg for details.  Cards are shipping with the extreme core.  People have been able to OC them to 9800XT speeds.  All you do is load a driver and windows will see it as an XT.  Then if need download Rage3D tweak and away you go.  I'm very happy with it so far.  It will get you by until Sony gets there card situation taken care of for just under 200 dollars.  Check out the reviews on the card they says alot for it.</div></div><hr />

i heard pci express isnt worth it right now  not for the price amount   stick to agp</div></div><hr />

That would require a new mother board that supports PCI Express and seeing how he said most of his equipment was new, it would not make much sence</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Depends what game(s) you're planning to play.  I run a 9600 pro, and have 0 lag at all in WoW.  Release can't get anything but better.  It ran EQ just fine before I quit too.  If you're going for EQ2, I'm not sure how well that'll hold up.<br />
No sense upgrading if you don't need to, wait until you must, then grab the best value.  IMO, paying &gt; $200 for a video card is just silly, though.  Paying $750 for one is absurd =)  If you need one now, I'd vote for the 9800 line for best performance / price - should be down a good bit with their new line.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">First off, if your paying 500 dollars for a 9800 XT pro, I'll sell you mine for 450 and save you 50 bucks..Thats waaaay to much..Go to pricewatch.com and check there....However, Id rather go Nvidea...Great great cards... From what I can gather, EQ was built around the Nvidea chip set as apposed to the ATI chip set.. At home in the states Im using a 9600 pro 256, great card, but with EQ it seems to have some issues..Now here in Japan , IM using an almost identical system but a Nvidea 5700 FX 256.  And it rocks..Its a sweet sweet little card, that you can pick up easly for less then 225.00 U.S.$  So, dont waste the money getting those uber superfantasic will wash your car while you sleep cards...Try the 9800 xt pro...It doesnt matter who makes it as long as you get the ATI inside logo...They make the chip, the other guys just make the cared..Or if you want to save some money go with the FX 5700 256.. Just make sure you have a gig of ram minimum...Damn ole eq is hard on the memory..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">On the point of Sapphire brand Vs ATI normal cards. I recently got a new computer and I'm running a 9600 SE ATI. The card had major problems with running high spec games including EverQuest. It often crashed and the frame rate dropped hugely. I returned the PC and they installed a Sapphire 9600 SE which has worked much better with my system. However I think most 9600's are a little 'dodgey'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I completely agree with Jaruden here.  When I shop for new cards I look for the best performance under $200.  Chances are I'm going to get 80% of the power of the card that costs twice as much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">A lot of very good thoughts here, thank you.<br />
<br />
Re: Sapphire.   I recently read that Sapphire actually produces most of the &quot;brand name&quot; ATI cards... they're an ATI manufacturing partner... lol... I laughed when I read that... &quot;One for ATI.... one for Sapphire... &quot; ... plus Sapphire goes beyond the reference design with their &quot;Toxic&quot; line.<br />
<br />
It's so hard for me to make a final decision on this.   Trust me I don't want to spend $600 for nothing.... I'm not that rich... I wish, but sadly no.   But I have managed to save enough that I can get a newer high end model if I want.<br />
<br />
I keep thinking to myself... if I buy a $100 card... will I notice a difference over my GeForce 4?    If not... it was a waste of $100.    What if it's a $200 card... much difference now?     What if I buy a $600 card... surely I'll notice the difference... but is it worth $600?<br />
<br />
I'm not thinking of EQ only... although I probably do play EQ 1 now more than any other game.<br />
<br />
Take Doom 3 for example... playable at 800x600 with high quality on my GeForce 4... but it did slow down and it wasn't buzzword compliant with fancy dancy AA/AF on to the max.  Do I NEED that stuff... probably not... but I'll let you know if I ever get a card that lets me turn it on all the time :)<br />
<br />
I think any card, ATI 9600+ or FX 5600+ will technically be &quot;better&quot; than my GeForce 4... but the question is how much I guess.<br />
<br />
One advantage of the X800 or GF 6800... is that it will be good for a few years.   Other cards will come close... but for a couple years... I'll be ahead of the pack.    It's not an e-penis thing.... it's just a &quot;For a couple years, you won't even have to think about video card upgrades&quot;.... and thats what I was like when I paid $500 for my GeForce 4 when it was new.    The FX generation didn't impress me at all... and now ... the 6800/X800 generation kinda does I guess.<br />
<br />
Dangit, I think I'm trying to justify it now lol.   A fool and his money are easily parted.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Groovdog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">First off, if your paying 500 dollars for a 9800 XT pro, I'll sell you mine for 450 and save you 50 bucks..Thats waaaay to much..<br />
Have a feeling he was quoting Canadian :)<br />
<br />
I have a 9800Pro 128MB and it works great in my hi-end box that I three box (SOE not EQW too) on. Works good on my 2box mid-end machine as well. The new NVidia cards are just messy and by the time Pixel 3.0 comes along in actual games you will have cleaner solutions that will be far cheaper. Being at the bleeding edge has a tendency to be a fools game (was there for 10+ years and regret it). Bought far too many $300+ video cards in my life ;)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I'll second the idea of getting a 9800Pro 128meg card. You can overclock them/ bios update them to XT levels. The driver even calls them an XT. It's significantly faster then a 9600/5700 level cards.<br />
<br />
For around $180.00 I think it's the best buy going, plus ATI has superior video quality.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Alphar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The thing is that the newer cards (x800, 6800) have made such a leap in performance that you can no longer buy 80% of the power for 1/2 the price. These cards have more than doubled the performance of the 9800-5900 lines of cards. The frame rates of the newer cards cannot be touched by any of the older cards. It really has nothing to do with trying to be on the bleeding edge. <br />
<br />
And it is definitly true that EQ loves memory,simply the more the merrier.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Pjrell</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Actually, I just bought a PNY Verto 6800 GT video card off of Pricewatch.Com for $389 with free shipping so they arent as expensive as the $600 price you quoted earlier.  I have also seen that they do not yet support hardware rendering in EQ yet and this is something that has been a problem since May when it was first identified.<br />
<br />
I bought this card not for EQ but for Doom 3 which is sitting at home unplayed because the framerate is barely playable at any resolution higher than 640x480 on my GeForce FX 5600.  I would rather wait and play it in its full glory at a higher resolution than to play it at a lower resolution unable to fully appreciate the graphics.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">about 8-12 months ago i bought a Radeon 9800 Pro 256 .. i spent $499 at the time and i can say, i haven't been happier with a purchase. Granted it's doesn't have a fancy &quot;x&quot; or &quot;xt&quot; anywhere .. and it may be a generation or two ago .. but it supports DX9, and runs EQ flawlessly .. full models .. full effects, full everything. In fact, i haven't come across a game yet that it didn't run perfectly. UT2004, Flight sims ..  everything i've run has been fast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you've already answered your own question. It's a matter of how long do you want the card to last? As with all things computers it's a law of diminishing returns. You pay $100 now and you will probably want to replace it in a years time. spend $200 and it's going to be about 18months $400+ and it'll last you maybe 2-3 years before you think that it's old and out of date.</div></div><hr />
