<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have recently made a troll shaman instead because of hearing how HP=mana and well Trolls have natural regen so that would mean more mana and plus they look bad a$$ with the luclin graphics.<br />
<br />
So I was wondering how people worship as a troll shaman? Inny or Cazic? Will I be prevented from certain items that are made for certain characters that belive in a certain god? I have a 5 shamen with a troll worshipping Cazic just because I think fear is so much better then some hate ( What the hell am I going to do with hate? Hand it over like a pie? I much rather prefer installing fear into the hearts of my foes). So what do you guys htink? Will making a troll under Cazic possibly hindering any use of any widely loved and useful items?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think he may be talking bout roleplay?<br />
<br />
I have heard bout this concept a time or two, but I know it not.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I have seen it so does that mean i have to restart and make one that follows inny?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">If Trolls were meant to instill fear, they'd always run around naked  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I picked Cazic because of the 'fear' factor haha.<br />
<br />
There again, I picked Troll shaman because trolls that cast spells just seemed hilarious, so don't listen to me ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Cazic worshipping trolls can get the iksar cudgel quests.<br />
Innothule worshiping trolls can get that necklace with the gimpy snare effect.<br />
<br />
Either one is a fine choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">So what is so good about a 5/20 weapon that is used by iksars?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Medican</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Sorry forgot to mention I was a troll</div></div><hr />

There are 8 of them.  This is the last one:<br />

<br />
edit:  to clear up any confusion, any race of shaman can technically do the iksar shaman cudgel quest.  However, only shamans that worship cazic-thule (all iksars and some trolls) can raise their faction high enough to receive the quest.  It is intended for iksars but as a cazic troll, you can do it.  It is a nice item because it has a unique effect and great stats, and it goes in your range slot (that's the best part).</div></div><hr />
