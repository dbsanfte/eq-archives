<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ouzo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">was playing my berk alt, in ot. Been useing my 65 shm to buff ( camp zerker..log to buff..re-log zerker) Was LOM and casted Q to heal myself before doing cann5. HP was zipping along..got past 2500 hp and hit cann5 and died. I was like ***. it was in fact about or alittle over 2500 cause i looked. So now im dead and look like a dumb arse infront of these 30-35 toons.<br />
anyone die from a weird bug like that before?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Samanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Yeah... quiet 'work from home' day today, so I log in. I swear to you, I log in, get put up /lfg, open the /lfg tool, and get a tell about GoD Trials.<br />
<br />
HFS!!<br />
<br />
So I grab a KEI and meet up, we get to the sewer zone-in (my first trial run - they're like np, we'll get you flagged!)...<br />
<br />
And the world unloads - work problem ticket, current project issue, vendor call, my niece goes into labor... so I have to bail on them. I stay there to buff them (rogue bailed too), I /afk to do some work... and come back nekkid in EC. :(<br />
<br />
On the plus side, I did survive the nekkid CR to Barindu, looted, and gated. Good thing the spirits of my ancestors gathered around me - I never would have made it alone!<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Cascet Wurmhardt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I havn't died by canni bug, but I think that at least every shammy has canni deathed at least 1 time..I know I have.  But now i'll watch for that bug and not canni5 till 3k hps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I never directly killed myself with canni, but one time I was in BOT and some zerg guild was zerging whatever boss is there with ~100 people.  So a giant comes and I canni5 a few seconds after slowing (thinking I didnt have aggro anymore).  When lag caught up to me I realized I had been hit a few times and had gotten low hp aggro as a result of canni.<br />
<br />
HP update 'bugs' are always the most fun for shaman :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Was on Ranger alt traipsing around the Feerott.  Agro the Bouncers and I go hightailing it for zone. Halfway there SOW wears off. Quickly stop and cast the first foot buff at the top of my gems.<br />
<br />
Yep you guessed it - snared myself.<br />
<br />
Tried casting SOW over it - but by then I was getting pummeled by both of them.  To compund matters - I accidentally taunted one.<br />
<br />
If MOBs could laugh - these would be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">^^^ROFL^^^<br />
<br />
Bouncers cost me a nice little CR with my Ranger at level 40ish too.  They conned yellow and I was all set for my first big non-fear kite solo.  All buffed up and ready to go, have em on track and he popped out and startled me, so I cast snare.....grrrr on myself.  The good news tho, once I looted my corpse and headed back to NK spires (pre-PoP), the named cenataur that drops the bow was up :)<br />
<br />
Spraggon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Heh :) Did a hard LDON tonight, and the bard pulled three (I'm thinking he was not sober at the time, but that's a whole other thread). Chanter mezzed, tank commenced beating, I debuffed and slowed while the chanter was mezzing and then started working my way through the mezzed ones. The following chain of events happened so quickly I almost don't know if I've got it right: mez broke, chanter died, VP'ed myself into the corner (yes, MYSELF, and I can't figure out how I targeted myself, lol), and was promptly eaten. <br />
<br />
Quick. Relatively painless. :p<br />
<br />
/bow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hmm Tordail I think that I have grouped with that bard.....<br />
Anyway, best stupid shaman trick I can think of is what I did in a pickup group in a LDON hard a few weeks ago...was doing it sans CC other than 2 rangers who had a set of big brass ones each and they bow kited adds while the warrior, rogue, and I killed the main target ( yeah were pretty nutsy that way ) and the cleric did his thing.<br />
Well the cleric goes LD (the only sane one in the bunch) and so I am slowing healing and dotting like mad....well a train develops and the rangers go on bow kiting while I proceed to get my arse handed to me by probably 3 or 4 mobs....I run back naked and blast heal the ranger who was at like 20% health, and got waxed again as I hit my Cann V button :) forgot I was buck naked and buffless heheh...at least I did it with dignity and they all thought that an add had got me ( I didnt correct them :p )<br />
EDIT: VPing myself...I gotta try that sometime....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Hail,<br />
<br />
I killed my twink cleric in Mistmoore less than an hour ago right outside the castle (soloing).  /shrug.  Nekkid CR back, loot all but 1, and fight the green trash that I had dragged with me while running back.<br />
<br />
Kill 2-3 more mobs (the ones that whacked me the first time) and then Sir Bronton (sp?) runs up right as the last mob is about to die and he HT's me and I die again.  /sigh<br />
<br />
Second nekkid CR goes smoothly enough.  4-5 mobs later, I gate (instead of dying) while low on health/mana.  <br />
<br />
Manastoning at the MM zoneline in Lfay to get mana back - I click once too many times and die for the third time in under an hour.  <br />
<br />
At which point I looted all but 1 for the 3rd time, and logged to check these boards.  I'll click rez the bodies w/ a friend's account tomorrow. :p <br />
It wouldn't be so bad except that's not the first time I cannibalized myself to death as a cleric.<br />
<br />
A PoTranq canni5 death in front of a 50 person gathering raid force is probably the height of ignominy imo. :p   I still have friends who bring that up and it happened awhile ago.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ssti</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">The height of ignomny is a blond moment that wipes your raid..... <br />
<br />
This was a long time ago but we'd had some &quot;technical&quot; difficulties on a Mith Mar raid.... Imagine a field of corpses with a few people rezzing up in the corner of the room while a cleric is kiting about 20 *****cats , trying to gain breathing space for the raid to recover (IE. running around the room flailing his arms and screaming madly while at &lt; 10 % hp) <br />
<br />
So I get rezzed in, buff people up and target the cleric that's running the cats around... I see he's at about half a bubble of hp and think if one of those cats gets a lucky swipe in he's toast and the immediate result would be Kitty Kitty Gang Bang on what's left of the raid sooooo......<br />
<br />
I figure he has healing aggro and reason that a quiescence wouldn't generate enough aggro to cause any problems.... worst case, if they take offense I can allways go kite too if any of them decide to come for me..... I was wrong... so wrong. Oh, the humanity. <br />
<br />
Quiescence lands, and as I'd thought it wasn't enough for me to steal aggro, however I hadn't realised that the cleric in question only had aggro by virtue of being in frenzy range. So, 2 ticks later his hp were no longer frenzy, the cats lost interest and proceeded to pulp the raid. They kept me for last, confirming the fact that quiesc didn't generate any significant aggro.... but somehow no one cared about that minor detail at the time.   :D<br />
<br />
Edit : The *****cats in the message is the word filter taking offense at the use of the term &quot;p u s s y cats&quot;,  not any vulgarity.... just figured I'd point that out cause it made me chuckle. <br />
<br />
On a related note, try going to dreadlands and doing an inc message while targetting the chickens.... The results can be hilarious if you have badword filter on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">So we're raiding avatar of smoke in PoA (ohhh the joy!) and entire raid wipes  :eek:  A few clerics get out but they need someone to train the mobs away so we figured it would be a while until we got our rez boxes. A shadowknight in the guild mentions hes going to go lfg in PoV naked while we wait for rez. So a beastlord and I decide to join him for a bit of fun, i mean what could possiblely go wrong?   :rolleyes: So we head to outer cave and the SK pulls a mob with snare, beastlord pet attacks and i start laying on the dots. Soon enough we have 1 dead mob  :D  Considering i only had about 2k hp with no gear and only focus, i decided hmm maybe ill try to purple club with CanniV to freak them out. Wait until hp get to 1965 and... LOADING PLEASE WAIT . . .<br />
<br />
The guild thought i was a complete idiot when i /gu er need a rez in PoV aswell now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>bigbadbowlindude</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">yea, happen to me too, I made double sure I had enough hp I did, petitioned it heard nothing of course.<br />
On a brighter note it was my last week before my acount was expired so I wasn't too pissed, just gave me one more reason not to look back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Larenn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">My dumbest moment, from about three months ago...<br />
<br />
I bought GoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bought GoD.<br />
Actually, I am kind of glad that I got GoD....Natimbi farming has been very very good for me...looted 2 of the Shell Inlaid Collars, a set of Abysmal Seaweed Wraps and I have 3 of the 4 drops I need for my beastlord twink to have a nice quested 1hb...GoD at the high end may need some retooling, but for plat farming, it has been very kind to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">So many dumb moments.<br />
<br />
1. Right after Luclin came out, the guild was raiding the Deep. I was bored and playing with the /facepick command, trying to get the perfect look. I had changed the camera angle so I could see myself better and somehow hit autorun. Yep, ran right down the hall into a bunch of mobs. Luckily, did NOT train the raid.<br />
<br />
2. Guild was raiding Sraa and we wiped on something. We were running back for corpse summons and I was waiting in the Grey to lev/EB/SoW guildmembers running back. I got a little low mana and without thinking hit can 5 since I was full hitpoints.<br />
<br />
Naked, that is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">One day a while back I was helping a friend with a Ragefire kill. <br />
<br />
Well Uber my friends and I are not. And it was a big deal for her and her friends so we ended up with about 40 people all told. Yes I know we could have done it with like 6-12 But it was a special time for her.<br />
<br />
So I am getting everyone buffed and Canni away madly like I am want to do when someone Decides it is a great time to pull guardian wyrms as filler while we buff. But of course didnt say anything. I canna5 Down to around 200 Hps. And Then Chomp I am dead. <br />
<br />
I was not a happy camper. <br />
<br />
As I am proceding to loot my body and get my Composure back. I mi**** the Canna 5 button. I had all my gear. but was unbuffed and still had res damage....<br />
<br />
<br />
Fell over dead.<br />
<br />
Needless to say after the embaressment and anger wore off it was a pretty damn funny thing. But all told it was a pretty good time and we killed that damn dragon really really dead. <br />
<br />
Snoww Brokenhammer E marr. Retired</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Stupid moments list:<br />
<br />
-Going linkdead in the meatshop in Thurgadin was annoying.<br />
Being an ogre, and coming back in to a place where i could not cast because I could not stand up, and there being no porters there for 25mins, while a queue of angry people built up outside was really fun.<br />
<br />
-Handing in hundreds of bandages to the halfling outside Rivervale to become non-kos, then promptly dying to a rampaging rogue guildmaster.<br />
<br />
-Running across the dreadlands as a level 60 shaman, running into Gore, and clicking my fungi staff instead of my sow booties.... /sigh<br />
<br />
-Double-shrinking in Vex Thal. When the raid moved inside the front doors, I had to indivually jump up each step. It took forever because i fatigued myself jumping. <br />
<br />
-Running in bear-form to a Zlandicar raid. The nice ghost dragon insta-killed me as I ran past. When I came back, being bound outside DN, i zoned back in, cast bear form and ran to my body...twice...in bearform both times...while the rest of the raid laughed at me.<br />
<br />
-Getting my nice new spear from Kael Drakkel, the one with the cold-based proc, and giving it to a vendor, thinking it was a fine steel spear. I didn't realise until a week later, and I wondered why my spear wasn't proccing at all.<br />
<br />
-When a friend was doing a quest with the Otters, i had the gold coins on me. I had the quest mob targetted and took a screenshot. Well, I tried too. I had remapped my auto-attack to the plus-sign on the numeric pad. Guess what I did? /sigh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I had been foraging with my ranger overnight once, and when I came home from work the next night, I  camped the ranger out and switched to shammy. Went AFK after choosing her on char select to take care of some after work things.<br />
<br />
Came back 20ish min later naked next to 2 of my corpses...in pok.  <br />
<br />
Yup! Shammy canni button is in the same place as the Ranger's forage button... *cry*<br />
<br />
Good thing my hunny is a cleric :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I had remapped my auto-attack to the plus-sign on the numeric padYes! someone else respects the Numpad+ and uses it as attack key of choice! :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Slacethehard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Died in Potime, but forgot to bind outside in PoTranq instead I was bound in PoK, starts to run back when I get a /tell asking for focus and sta for a group, being the every friendly shaman, I say sure meet at PoTranq stone. I'm tapping me foot waiting a few minutes when this group turns up, while I cast Fos7 and sta they are all /oocing how great I am and yeah Slace is uber, so because I'm naked my mana disappeared after casting, pre-loaded my raid spell set and you know whats comming next. yup I'm low mana so I hit Canni 5 and die like a fool infront of this group I just had calling me uber! I ate the rez and went back to PoTime somewhat humbled.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Dumb moments:<br />
<br />
One day I wanted to test if you could actually fish with a fishing spear. Didn't work, so destroyed it. Later, hunting in PoTactics clicked on epic to dot it, but didn't work. Clicked again. Still not working, ***!? Had a look and there was that fishing spear. Yep, a few hours earlier I'd destroyed my epic, not the fishing spear. Good news, GM replaced it 4 hours later, after much laughing at my fate.<br />
<br />
Bardic dumb moment - clicked my SS helm and went to scout ahead with my eye of zomm. Got distracted for a moment, came back, continued scouting, fouind some mobs.... splat! Yep, you guessed it. EoZ had expired so I sent my bard right into a room full of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Ladihawk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I realize this is a Shaman forum but this question got me thinking on death.<br />
<br />
First bad time was with my lvl 10 Mage in West Karana. For some reason she had a bad target bug. She would cast on say a blue bear and an entirely different red mob would come back and whup her and pet. This caused her to die 26 times in 6 hours giving her 1/4 bub exp. She /petitioned and spoke to the Fennin Ro GM who told her &quot;i can't help what you target and then poofed&quot; lol.<br />
<br />
Second was with my main who at the time was a lvl 55 Druid named Ladihawk. She was farming crag spiders in East Karana when Tarbul Earthstrider (mage epic unknown at the time) pops up. Hmm says Ladi dark blue this is a cinch. So she targets Tarbul and casts snare. Somehow targeting changed mid cast and she was snared. NP. Re targets Tarbul and casts root. It holds on yep you guessed it...me. Meanwhile Tarbul decides to walk on over and see what the problem with this very dumb and not moving Halfling Druid was. He got in range and i cast root. Resisted not good. Snare took this time. So i decided to cast Winged Death before he got to me to get some dmg in and hope my root wears off. Target showed Tarbul so i cast and my hp takes a nose dive. Looked at target and i was again the target. Meanwhile Tarbul was here and proceded to teach me some manners on being in the wrong spot at the wrong time. Came back for my body and he standing on top of it and refused to move. Had to get a friend to sneak in and grab it lol.</div></div><hr />
