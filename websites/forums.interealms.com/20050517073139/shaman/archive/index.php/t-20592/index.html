<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sat night, the guild is raiding RZTW and he decides to make an example of me, I never knew he could do this...in fact after it happened no-one on the raid could recall ever having seen this before so maybe its another new feature of DX9, btw I have a screenshot to prove it if needed.....read on and laugh at my misfortune :)<br />
<br />
Fake RZ....I get killed but of course am bound outside...no problem, the guild gets him to 50% and he gates to the pit...all according to plan.<br />
<br />
**Corpse count:<br />
**1 Corpse Tactics at fake RZTW<br />
<br />
I zone back in to join the rest of the guild at zone in, Neco summons my corpse, I loot up and leave my bridle on it for later....we run to pit and drop down for the big fight.<br />
<br />
About to engage RZTW in the pit, some dickwad aggros I am one of the first to get wiped, some escape, some dont.....I don't...still I am bound outside...no problem.<br />
<br />
**Corpse count:<br />
**1 Corpse Tactics zone in.<br />
**1 Corpse South pit wall.<br />
<br />
I levi, sow, run back in and people are dropping to the pit to loot up and get ready for another attemp...quick smart. I jump off the south wall, fall a couple of feet and RZTW yells at me &quot;You are Banished&quot; or some such thing.<br />
Next thing I see &quot;Paineel&quot; on my screen in white letters...at this point I am laughing loudly to myself..I'll simply gate back me thinks...WRONG<br />
I zone in to Paineel, I have lev up, but I zone in ....you guessed it...I am floating above the hole. I make a mad dash for what looks like a ledge while my past excursions to the Hole flash through my mind, wondering how to escape. Within seconds I get the &quot;Hole&quot; or whatever message, I'm zoning into the Hole, hmm me thinks (I zone slowly) &quot;at least I have lev!&quot; (see, been a long time since I was in the Hole) &quot;I'll simply channel Gate while I float down to the monsters....no problem....&quot;<br />
For those of you who dont know and those who may have forgotten (take me for example) when you zone into the Hole through the 'Hole' lev gets stripped....I plumet for 20000 damage.<br />
But I'm bound outside Tactics...so no problem.<br />
<br />
**Corpse count:<br />
**1 Corpse Tactics zone in.<br />
**1 Corpse South pit wall.<br />
**1 Corpse &quot;The Hole&quot;...down by the Scale Keeper :)<br />
<br />
Of course my wee excursion to the Hole only took about 2 minutes so I am still back in time to participate in another bash at RZTW, I lev up, sow, run in and with my eyes closed and fingers crossed drop into the pit to join the rest of the guild....just in time to see RZTW depop....<br />
<br />
Oh the humility...<br />
<br />
<br />
Banishment? when did he start doing that?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think that happens if yer not in the raid that does the trigger or whatever. Assuming you were, it is a bug.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Barbacus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I was, but the script was all fugged up...ended up triggering a second TZ and VZ without killing Dedorin and co a second time...that zones very buggy atm</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's had the ability to do that for a while. It's suppose to happen when you aggro him from above the pit. It was the response to some people figuring out a way to warp him out of the pit so you didn't have to deal with adds. He can also send you to VP, PoAir and a few other places i don't remember off the top of my head. The poair one drops you right on top of a Death touching mob too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kahn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">More places he can banish to:<br />
Kedge Keep - by Phinigel<br />
Plane of Fear - not sure where in zone<br />
<br />
The devs have humor! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Koridar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I always get ported to Maelin in the Library in POK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">That sounds almost as much fun as that one patch about a year ago when you were able to randomly fall through the floor in ssra and would repop randomly in some other zone.  Was cool to see half of my guild fall through the floor and then say &quot;why am I in pok/hole/karnors/etc...?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">He's been doing that for a while now. Last time round we had a couple guys bounced to Maelin and one to the Spiroc Lord in SkyPlane for a hug and a DT. :)  It seems that if you get agro early while lev'd (i.e. still floating down), you can get banished rather than killed as it deems you as outisde the pit not in it. You should feel happy, last time we did RZ I had 5 corpses stacked up in a tidy pile by the time it came to rezzing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Basma</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">we killed rallos zek the first time this past friday and he does banishes folks who arent in the raid....his adds are the hardest part about the encounter i think..we had aboout 20 mobs in the pit after he died..and only about 30 of 70 of us got the flag...sad to say..the mobs should depop after he is killed or something..or even at least pop the projection in a corner and not the middle of pit :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Burzlaff</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He's done that for quite some time to avoid KS/n00b issues.  You may have disbanded from raid for that first summon and not realized it or the first person to aggro may not have been in raid and you were second so it tossed you before killing the first (happened to me pulling him to the corner once).<br />
<br />
And on a side note, possible places I've personally seen to be ported (in addition to the ones stated earlier):<br />
<br />
PoHate, PoSky, Pig Pens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Balanthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">They made him do that to get around the Z-axis exploits people were doing like sitting up top and healing, nuking, etc to avoid adds.<br />
<br />
So if you were falling down and somehow got aggro above a certain height, you will get ported regardless if you are in raid or not.  <br />
<br />
We had a cleric who died and ran back in try to heal from up top and got ported to Fear for her effort.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Balan is correct.  He can banish for height aggro, as well as anyone not in the trigger raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yah one of our monks got ported to plane of fear, that was a serious PITA. At least make it places you can zone into and summon corpse without too much of a pain. Also had someone sent to phinny's room in kedge keep once.<br />
<br />
On a side note, at least the hole is an easy CR. Just drop a DA'd cleric in. This is what my guild used to do when we'd kill the gaurdian of the seal all the time. Nothing is kos near the landing spot so we'd just tell everyone to jump in the hole.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Outside the raid, but in the pit, it's usually PoK. Getting on the hate list, while above RZtW's head = vacationing in new and interesting locations. Doesn't matter if in our outside the raid there.<br />
