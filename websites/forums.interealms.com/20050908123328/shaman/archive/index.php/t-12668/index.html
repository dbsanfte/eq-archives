<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Harena</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have been having a lot of problems using magelo on my 2nd computer.<br />
<br />
Initially I couldn't even access the site but solved that. Now I can just get to the site and view it but not make any changes.<br />
<br />
It does not refresh and even affects the forums. If I go to lets say General forums and later want to switch to another forum, I keep getting sent back to General Forums and have to close IE and restart it to get to another forum.<br />
<br />
I also cannot update my equipment and info but can see the changes made using my other comp after refreshing the page.<br />
<br />
I check with my other computer and all the settings seem to be the same.<br />
<br />
I am not a computer savvy person and any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help/info.<br />

PS Also is there anyway to get magelo to work on an apple iBook?</div></div><hr />
