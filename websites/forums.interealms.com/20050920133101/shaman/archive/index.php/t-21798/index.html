<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shaman_Seductress</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello again.<br />
<br />
Once again I come to you for aid.Man I must be getting annoying now? :(  Anyway,I think I have a good idea of were to level,but I just want your opinion:<br />
<br />
1-9: Field of Bone<br />
9-14ish:Kurns Tower<br />
14-24ish:Paludal Caverns<br />
24-30ish:Marus Seru,Mistmoore,or Maybe LDoN?<br />
30-??: This is where im stumped.<br />
<br />
Advice would be great.<br />
Thanks.<br />
<br />
Amy<br />
Newbie Shaman of the <br />
Xev Server</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Shunami</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What race are ya?  It makes a little difference at low levels.  Unless you are Iksar, I would not recommend FoB at the lowest levels, because the newbie guard there has a mighty wide aggro range and so do some of the aggro mobs there.  Kurns tower is a huge amount of fun though.  I personally avoid Paludel like the plague, but thats just me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Stragak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Here's where I have hunted (race not important).<br />
<br />
1-3 Newbie zone. It wont take long to hit 3, so don't bother wandering so much.<br />
<br />
3-8: Steamfont mountains. Kobolds are decent exp, they dont add or help (with exception of Shamans healing), and they just sit there waiting to die. Also you will make enough to pay for all your level 9 spells and probably all your level 14 spells by level 8.<br />
<br />
9-14: Either go to field of bone (the pit area until 10 or 11, then on to Kurns) or.. go north of the kobold camps that got you to 8, kill wandering mobs till 9 and then just a bit farther north is the minotaur slaver camp. After a rough battle on the first pull, you can break up the minotaurs and fight one at a time. Decent exp, loot and faction with Gnome guards (Ogres are dubious by level 12, Troll/Iksars by 14 if you start at 9). TIP: Flash of light will often &quot;mez&quot; the minotaur you pull after he runs a while as long as you DON'T MOVE after you get the &quot;worn off&quot; message. Course you might HAVE to move when the other mino starts to run away near death.. but sometimes you're lucky, then med up and take a couple steps to pull the &quot;mezzed&quot; one back to you.<br />
<br />
14-18: Kurns tower is nice. Most skellys on the upper floors are single pulls or just run up and bash them, just stay on the far side of the next closest skelly and he won't help in all but a couple cases.<br />
<br />
** Now is the time to do your LDON startup quest, if  you have that expansion so you are ready in case you get an invite **<br />
<br />
18-24: High Jerk Tolerance: Paludal Caverns, no contest. Low Jerk Tolerance: The Overthere between the Pok book and the &quot;mud pit&quot;. Up to you, I usually avoid PC, but sometimes I go there. If you run into nice people, it CAN be a fun time, though your weapons skills might fall behind due to the rapid leveling.<br />
<br />
24-30: Hmmm... LOIO is nice. Kill goblins (faction up for Firionia Vie and Cabalis guards). Exiled Iksar (faction up for Cabalis Necro/SK guild). Outpost explorers (faction up for all Cabalis guilds EXCEPT Necro/SK, and faction down for Firiona Vie). If you don't mind losing FV faction, this is a FAST way to get faction with Iksars, instead of the bone chip quest. Oh, when the Iksar guards faction is up enough, turn in those explorer knives to the Iksar guard standing way, WAY out from the city by the ruins for LOTS of nice iksarian faction.  Feerott is also nice, lizards near the fallen pillar across the river are decent exp, and drop FS weapons, though really the goblins in LOIO drop PP sometimes as well, and you get the faction boosts.<br />
<br />
30-34: The harder lizards in Feerott, or move from LOIO to Frontier Mountains or even back to Overthere (grouping is best, but if you have good Iksar guard faction, the lovely arcut sisters (near the ramp into the cavern in middle of zone) will protect you, from anything except chickens.. even the Dark Elf Dragoons have fallen to them.. although things may have changed since last I was there.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps or at least gives you some more choices...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zamrak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">All the lizards on the temples in Ferrot come single if you pull them wisely (ie dont pull them across the pyramid) and pull the one closest to you (Move around). Just watch out for the other statics when moving around.<br />
Also there is 1 or 2 roamers on the island. Normal lizzies</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>The Judge, Alchem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">24-30: Hmmm... LOIO is nice.<br />
<br />
LOIO has an experience penalty for the zone.  Gunthak Beach to 40-46, Dulak Harbor to 51-55, Nadox+GoD+Planes after.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Trujia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">HighKeep used to be good for 24-32ish then again for 51-55 but I am not sure about it now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">On lots of different characters, I've done HHK from 19 (when 19 was a spell level) to 30 (when 30 was a spell level).  It's really a great place when you have the only group down in the basement.  On my shaman I came back to solo nobles/bards at 49 (when 49 was a spell level :p) and stayed there until I dinged 57.</div></div><hr />
