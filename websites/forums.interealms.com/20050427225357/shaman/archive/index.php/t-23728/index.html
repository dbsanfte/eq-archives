<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Looking for suggestions on soloing in OOW with decent xp vs risk.  Say with difficulty of Tactics, vxed, or ferubi and similar rewards and risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>kalamani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Pick a zone. you can solo in them all. None are as hard as ferubi, vxed etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">almost everything i fought in WoS summoned...i would compare the solo to perhaps a PoE solo /shrug...i did'nt go to far in yet though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">You can certainly solo in Noble's Causeway, most mobs do not summon.  I've seen several druids and necros solo there.  The murkgliders are not very tough and do drop some nice gear.  However, they do have a fair amount of hp, so you will use up a quite a bit of mana getting the kill.  May be a bit slow, but the exp and loot are very good, at least at my level (65, 29 aa's).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The muckgliders do go down easy and have low resist rate on magic and posion so are relatively easy to solo.  Just root malos slow then burn with BoS, Bane, and anethema.  Nice thing is that can do it mounted and med while fighting.  The xp seem to be about a half a tic per mob but for me loot was poor. I will try the dragons near the WoS zone next and see what happens.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The gliders are 100% slowable as well, aren;'t they?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">IN WoS south/east of the Zone there is a tunnel (south of the raid mob)...mobs do not summon &amp; VP &amp; root both seem to stick. forget the name of the mobs but they look like Jelly fish. first couple will be singles but after that you a 2 pull or 2...there is 2 big rooms there with mobs that surround the perimiter of that room. not 100% sure but i believe you can single pull those &amp; jsut go around &amp; around in a circle...about 7 mobs...think it would be endless spawns...I will be trying this this weekend. GL &amp; let me know how this is if it works</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">They may be fully slowable elsewhere but in Nobels Causway I get the mostly message.  The hit me for 508 max and must have a decent attack as they do not miss a often as many mobs and hit near max a lot as well.  I find it necessary to keep them rooted and take as few hits as possible.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>jolav21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Tried Soloing the above spot that i mentioned.It is very possible but they have a ton of XP...I took 3 full durations of VP b4 the mobs died...about 1.5 Blue ticks of XP per kill of lvl 66 xp. Good news is that the mob never broke VP early which was good</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Ubex</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Will give this a try.</div></div><hr />
