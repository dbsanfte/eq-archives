About time there was a mass frogleg roasting!!<br />
<br />
Of course, they wrote it wrong...it's the trolls that should take the city...everyone knows ogres are too dumb to use magic... :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tenjhai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Actually in EQ2 can't any race be any class? I had heard that it took a bit more work, but that was the case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the most important thing is to remember is that the Trolls are in Neriak which means they lose a 2nd city and have to shack up in Freeport. ;)<br />
<br />
Also take heart...it took lifting of an ancient curse and leading of the Orges by the Avatar of War to take Gukta.<br />
<br />
We only needed to blessed by Mithaniel Marr when we took it from the Trolls.<br />
<br />
Edit: Mionr tpyos corrcetoins</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally I think that wasn't a good idea story / game mythology wise.  Makes the races loose alot of their uniqueness.  Coupled with the any race / any class thing, there may as well be just one race.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Tyck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Kyruk cast bolts of lightning at the ogre wizards<br />

<br />
Ehh..close.  There are only 2 STARTING cities.  Most of the other cities still exist, and will contain quests and spells and such, but everyone will start in either Qeynos or Freeport.<br />
<br />
And yes, any race can play any class, though stats (which are supposed to mean something) make some combinations less desirable than others.<br />
<br />
So, you will see gnome monks and ogre bards.<br />
<br />
Anyway, its about time those slimy frogs got whats coming to them.  Remember, they invaded and slaughtered the trolls in Grobb just because thier whiny god Marr told them to.  Karma is a bitch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You may have strayed from the Path of Valor but you owe it your life.<br />
<br />
Barbarians and Frogloks are brothers of the spirit that have fought together as allies in the past and will do so again. :)<br />
<br />
Especially when all the good races get together and help smack down the Rallosians and Minions of Cazic-Thule in the coming war before EQ2.</div></div><hr />

Well if you really want to think about it, justice swings both ways. Froggies sacked the troll city, for no reason. I woulda helped the ogre's, karma's a bitch.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, the Barbs get whupped by SNOW ORCS. It took a huge army of ogres to take Gukta, but apparently Redwind and buddies had no problem... <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Solemneyes</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">don forget if you read back to the chapter where the avatar came to the ogres he mentioned another was going to the orcs... I would assume they have had similar help...<br />
<br />
In any event I doubt it was redwind lol<br />
<br />
Love this story so far - lots of death and destruction :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Orcs!  Orcs TOOK Halas?!  Margyn Mccann alone could have dropped all of the orcs in EF!  My only consolation is that even the cheasiest snow orc is tougher than most of the other crap and I guess it's a small consolation that it wasn't the gnolls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Freaking orcs took over halas?<br />
<br />
SoE needs to hire some better story writers. Seriously. They should get in touch with some known fantasy writers and have them write some real stories for the game to follow and progress through, like dragonlance or sword of truth or any of the D&amp;D writers. That would make EQ 10 times what it is if it was a breathing and changing storyline. It would bring the quest back to everquest.<br />
<br />
<br />
BTW, i just have to say it one more time ... FREAKING SNOW ORCS ???  Come on  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>jeyche Deychundei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">hey atleast yu can go to halas... Nexus is gone and soon all that'll be left of my home is burning rock from the sky.... im packing up now, <br />
<br />
i think i'll by me a nice house in Qeynos, nothing will happen there</div></div><hr />

<br />
And we all know how important stats are.  :)<br />
<br />
I must be an Iksar at heart, or a glutton for punishment... or both.   Cause I plan on an Iksar Wizard.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Jedani</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Screw raiding tonight- I must go start slaughtering snow orcs now to stop this from happening in the future . :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Come on you barb people! If a pack of Frogs can take out a city of trolls, then CERTAINLY Redwing and his buds can light up Halas, sheesh! They prolly just came at night, since yer all blind then anyway</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Raccoo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Sure Blazz, and we didn't see them carrying torches to burn down our homes? =P<br />
<br />
Would've been more believable to have Vox/Icegiants come and destroy our homes. =\</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Good story. What is there to take in the Rathe Mountains though? Gypsy camps and Fallen Druids rings?  <br />
<br />
And yeah, Snow Orcs taking over Halas is pretty weak, You'd hope that there were lots of giants in the mix, or that a certain Kodiak bear got killed several times over.<br />
<br />
....totemic helm, now that was hell!</div></div><hr />
