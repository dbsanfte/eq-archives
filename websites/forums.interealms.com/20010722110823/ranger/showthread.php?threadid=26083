	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Ok..... I have some questions here about this whole plot line.<br>
<br>
Here is what I know so far and other things that I have been able to peice together:<br>
<br>
At the birth of Norrath all dragons were of one faction. There was no "Claws of Veeshan" and no "Ring of Scale" just the Dragons. Veeshan was the first god to ever create life on Norrath, and it was her brood she placed here. She clawed the continent of velious to sorta stake her claim so to speak. <br>
<br>
From what I can Gather two Dragons of differing Colors created an abomination by Mating. Their progeny was Kerafyrm who was ultimatly powerful. <br>
<br>
For reasons that I have yet to find out the members of the First Brood imprisoned Kerafyrm inside Sleeper's Tomb and he became known as the Sleeper. I have heard that the only Dragon with the Key was  I believe, was Jaled' Dar, Phara Dar's father. (for those who aren't aware, Phara Dar is the leader of the Ring of Scale, lives in veeshan's peak)<br>
<br>
Then we have a cloudy area of history for the Dragons. Sometime after the imprisonment of Kerafyrm a sect of Dragons left Velious and traveled to Kunark and established what we know today as "The Ring of Scale". At this point in Time Lady Vox and Lord Nagefan were part of this sect that broke away from the Claws.<br>
<br>
Slowly the RoS built up power in Kunark. Many years passed, the Shissar empire was obliterated by their own god, the Iksar came into power, 4 of the 5 ancient iksar tribes rose to power only to be obliterated by the Sathir of the last major tribe. One dragon in particular, Trakanon, foresaw tat these dark rites would cause unimaginable woe and grief upon Norrath.<br>
<br>
At this time, Trakanon was Phara Dar's wingmate, and Jaled' Dar was the leader of the Ring of Scale. (Jaled' Dar being the leader of the RoS is just speculation but it fits the storyline)<br>
<br>
Trakanon is, or was, if not the wisest, among the wisest beings upon the planet. He was blessed, or cursed, with foresight. He knew the events that would occur upon Norrath, but was forbidden to interfere with these events.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately for him, he chose to intervene anyway. This Sathir of this ancient tribe of Iksar's was upon a mighty ship in Timorous Deep. Trakanon, in league with another being supposedly sunk the ship in the middle of the ocean, ensuring that this king would no longer live to cause the problems that Trakanon had foreseen. Hence the Wreckage in Timorous deep.<br>
<br>
This plunged the Ring of Scale into a war with the Iksar. Iksar's killed many of the Ring of Scale dragons, hellbent on entering Veeshan's Peak and laying waste to the last of the dragons upon *their* continent.<br>
<br>
It was at this time that Jaled' Dar met his end (you can see his remains in the Field of Bone). Jaled' Dar became a Shade instead of passing into Oblivion and went to reside in what we call the Dragon Necropolis. Furious at his untimely death, and absolutely convinced that Phara Dar and Trakanon had plotted to have him killed, Jaled' Dar awaited his chance for revenge.<br>
<br>
Phara Dar, on the other hand, was convinced that Trakanon had plotted to have her father killed so that he could assume his place at the head of the Ring of Scale. Trakanon was banished from the Ring of Scale. Here the history gets a little muddled. Some sources say that Trakanon conquered Sebilis and placed himself as it's ruler. Other sources hint that in a last ditch effort the Iksar managed to imprison him inside Sebilis where he could cause them no more harm.<br>
<br>
Sometime later Trakanon became cursed to everliving death, an undead being forced into continuing his life in his already dead body.<br>
<br>
Now we come back to Lady Vox and Lord Nagefan. It appears as though they got it into their heads to create another Kerafyrm and made plans to mate. They were discovered, and banished from the Ring of Scale. I don't know what means the RoS took to ensure they did not mate, but for whatever reason they have not mated yet, and hopefully never will. Once they reached Antonica there is a side story somewhere saying that Nagefan had an underground tunnel built into his castle that allowed him to leave and hunt at his leisure. Again He and Vox made plans to mate but this Time Veeshan herself interfered. She collapsed the mountains in lavatsorm around Nagafen's castle and seeling his escape route. All that remains now is the great lava pool where Eajag spawns.<br>
<br>
Later Nagafen's castle was rediscovered by Gnomes who set up an outpost to mine for ore. <br>
<br>
Now, back to Jaled Dar. Jaled Dar at this point want's revenge for his death, and has decided he want's all dragon kind to die. When you speak with Jaled Dar, he basically says he wants you to enter the Sleepers Tomb and awaken the sleeper, though I don't think he tells you specifically why. The reason: he wants the sleeper to destroy all the dragons, and cares nothing for what will happen to the rest of Norrath. He just wants revenge. He also wants peace I think. He wants resolution in some form as he is trapped on Norrath as a Shade. Basically he wants the peace of obvilion. It's possible he believes waking the Sleeper may accomplish this goal.<br>
<br>
He then sends you on a quest to obtain one of the talismans from the 5 ancient dragons of the First Brood, to prove your on his side: Zlandicar, Klandicar, Illiandar, Sontalak, and Lord Yelinak. <br>
<br>
This is rather confusing as when you are in Dragon Necropolis if you listen to him long enough you can piece together parts of this story. There are many phrases he shouts to the zone such as:<br>
<br>
"We were wrong! he must be awakened...."<br>
<br>
"Trakanon my old friend, you betrayed me!"<br>
<br>
"Zlandicar! I know you are here. You are always here.. please we must talk!"<br>
<br>
Among others. I know those probably are not exact quotes but they are pretty close and basically mean the same thing. <br>
<br>
The problem is that the Dragons themselves are all very tight lipped about the storylines here. It's very difficult to figure out what is really going on and how things tie in together.<br>
<br>
What I do find interesting though is that when Kerafyrm IS finally awakened Lord Nagefan shouts to the zone about him being awake and how they are doomed and his and Vox's "Long awaited nuptuals can proceed". This is where you can surmise their intent to mate. <br>
<br>
Also Jaled' Dar shouts something similar to this: "The fools believeed me! Now I will have my revenge!". That is no where near an exact quote but it means basically the same thing. So now we know that Jaled' Dar was playing a ruse and tricking the player characters into doing what he wanted. Also it seems that his motivation is revenge. <br>
<br>
My questions are numerous. There is a lot of Hoels in this storyline. Can anyone fill these in? Also, it's not exactly clear why Zlandicar is in Dragon Necropolis. He ties into this somehow but I have not yet been able to figure out exactly how. Apparently he is a cannibal and feats on the remains of his dead kin inside the Necropolis. He has also been cast out of the Claws of Veeshan. It is not clear exactly WHY but I suppose it could be for previous acts of canibalism.<br>
<br>
Then we come to the Story of War between the Giants and the Dragons. I believe this takes place before the formation of the Ring of Scale but who knows. That is something for a different post though and we can discuss that later.<br>
<br>
For now, can anyone provide any additional info on the story behind the Sleeper and the Dragons? Or correct anything I have said? If you make corrections or additions please list your source so that I can research it out. There is a lot of speculation and guessing out there that is not backed up by fact and I would really like to ferret out the true story.<br>
<br>
Thanks.</font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Trakanon was the leader of a small faction of the Ring of Scale once.<br>
He lead the Ring into the destruction of the Sebilisian empire because of his hatred of the iksars. He then chose to remain in Sebilis to "gloat" over the destruction he'd wrecked, his hatred never really quenched, and thus he still sits there.<br>
<br>
The Field of Bones was created when Trakanon fooled Jaled Dar into leading an assault on Cabilis. Jaled Dar and his offspring was succesful in killing the king and his hatchlings, and most of the iksars, but were badly badly driven back - many of their own dead. Iksars live on, but as a remnant of what they were.<br>
<br>
This is what I've heard. Both from Verant sources, they may of course be "warped" so as to present a multi view plot.<br>
<br>
As for the Kerafyrm plot... that makes sense. And it's a damn good story if you're right. Nevertheless, a kickass read.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
<br>
Oh yeah. Shoulda read the links first. Codsan is right, that's the story Verant has released over the year.<br>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Kivorn I hate to rebuff you but I have it confirmed that Trakanon was not the leader of the Ring of Scale at any time in history.<br>
<br>
The lineage of the leaders of the RoS is as follows:<br>
<br>
Jaled' Dar(slight Speculation but EVERYTHING I have read suggests he founded the Ring)<br>
<br>
And then the current leader, Phara Dar.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the links Legen though I think there is a LOT of eronious info there as well as fact. I think one of the problems is history that verant has Discarded when they changed their plot outlines. A lot of the info that was presented was recorded in Beta and I think some of that Info was discarded before release. Therefore some is contradictory.<br>
<br>
This is the new Timeline after having read through the threads on the Safe house:<br>
<br>
Veeshae marked Norrath and created the Dragons as the very first living beings on Norrath. This was the Age of Scale. The First Brood were the vey first beings to tread Norrath. <br>
<br>
The First Brood consisted of the following Dragons, some living and some deceased:<br>
<br>
Lord Yelinak, Zlandicar, Klandicar, Hsagra, Jaled' Dar, Illiandar the Keeper, and Sontalok.<br>
<br>
After untold millenia we come to the War of Scale in which Dragon fought dragon supposedly. I have another theory though and will search for clues as to the truth of this theory. My theory is that 2 members of one of the following Broods, of differing Colors, mated. Their progeny was Kerafyrm Up to this point no two dragons had every tried or thought to mate outside their color. This was a mistake made and an abomiation was created. This abomination was ultimatly powerful. Kerafyrm was likely not very sane either. I blelieve that Kerafyrm decided to obliterate all life in his insanity and thus all of dragonkind went to war against Kerafyrm. <br>
<br>
Eventually the combined might of all the Brrods was able to defeat him and using the power of their Talismans the members of the First Brood Sealed him away in Sleeper's Tomb. Some speculate that the 4 Warders are also of the first Brood but I think it likely instead that they are extremely powerful Dragons of maybe the 2nd or 3rd Broods. Possibly even of the same Brood that Produced Kerafyrm.<br>
<br>
At the closing of the War of Scale several laws were put in place. One of which was that forbidding of another Kerafyrm. In other words, no two dragons of Differing colors would ever mate again.<br>
<br>
Next we have the introduction of the Followers of Rallos Zek into the world and the War between Kael and Skyshrine starting. This as I said can be discussed in another thread. It's also very interesting. <img src="images/smilies/smile.gif" border="0" alt=""> Both about the War between Kael and Skyshrine but also the entire Storyline about the followers of Rallos Zek.<br>
<br>
Sometime after the start of the War Jaled' Dar decided that he was not happy with the way that Yelinak was ruling Dragonkind. Apparently he is not alone and Jaled' Dar takes a large number of Dragons with him to Distant Kunark where he establishes Veeshan's Peak.<br>
<br>
Now we start into the History of Kunark and the Shissar, the Sarnaks, the Frogloks, and the Iksar.<br>
<br>
The Shissar were the original sentient life on Kunark to establish an organized society. They were a race trhat delved into MANY powerful magical arts. The most notable being Necromancy. Eventually they angered even their own gods who wiped them off the face of the planet. The Shissar had kept the Iksar Race as slaves and this slave Race rose to power after the annihilation of the Shissar.<br>
<br>
There were 5 Tribes of Iskar in Kunark, the Kunzar, Kylong, Nasthar, Obulous and Jasarth. Each rose to power seperatly under the rulership of 5 differnt Sathirs. Sathir being the Iksar term for King. Anyway, Eventually one Sathir in particular, Venril Sathir of the Kunzar, was able to seize control of all of the Tribes and establish his own Empire in the City of Sebilis using his knowledge and power of the Necromantic arts stolen from his ancient Shissar masters. <br>
<br>
From here he ruled over nearly all of Kunark. Basically everything save the provinces of the Ring of Scale, who up till now had stayed aloof and seperated from the affairs of the "Mortal" beings. <br>
<br>
Eventually Venril began to Age but sought to prolong his life and even become immortal throughhis Necromantic Powers. His research eventually led him to Innoruuk who he made a pact with. However, during the ritual to make Venrith Immortal his some interfered and disrupted it. His son, Rile, wanted the throne and if his father became immortal he would never get it. So he sabotaged Venril's plans. Suppossedly Venril Sathir's Spirit became locked in a Phylactory Similar to the now famous one that Miragul created for himself. The same Phylactory that Drussela now holds. Apparently Rile had it entombed with his mother.<br>
<br>
Rile continued his Father's work of expansion and consolidation of power but unlike his Father he had no interest in magic or Necromancy. Instead he was a warrior emporer. When he finally died his Son, Atrebe, became the next Sathir. Atrebe was a Master of Necromancy very much like his Grandfather Venril.<br>
<br>
It was during Atrebe's Rule that the Iksar first came into direct conflict with Dragon kind. Atrebe is responsible for the creation of Sarnaks which are a result of the combining of a Dragon and an Iksar which create an intelligent race of Dragon Men., The Sarnak's became the slave Labor to the Iksar's much as the Iksar's had been to the Shissar. He also combined a Dragon and a Froglok to create what is called a Sokokar. No one knows what these looked like but they were apparently Flying mounts used by the Iksar's.<br>
<br>
One dragon in particular, Trakanon, foresaw that this Sathir would cause unimaginable woe and grief upon Norrath. <br>
<br>
At this time, Trakanon was Phara Dar's wingmate, who is the daugter of Jaled' Dar and some unkown dragon. <br>
<br>
Trakanon is, or was, if not the wisest, among the wisest beings upon the planet. He was blessed, or cursed, with foresight. He knew the events that would occur upon Norrath, but was forbidden to interfere with these events. <br>
<br>
Unfortunately for him, he chose to intervene anyway. While Atrebe was upon a mighty ship in Timorous Deep, Trakanon in league with another being supposedly, sunk the ship in the middle of the ocean thereby ensuring that this king would no longer live to cause the problems that Trakanon had foreseen. Hence the Wreckage in Timorous deep. <br>
<br>
Atrebe's son Ganak then took the throne and declared total war upon the Ring of Scale. The Iksar's killed many of the Ring of Scale dragons, hellbent on entering Veeshan's Peak and laying waste to the last of the dragons upon *their* continent. This War lasted for nearly 50 years and culminated in the battle between Ganak riding upon a Sokokar and Jaled' Dar in which both Kings were obliterated.<br>
<br>
Jaled' Dar became a Shade instead of passing into Oblivion and went to reside in what we call the Dragon Necropolis. Furious at his untimely death, and absolutely convinced that Phara Dar and Trakanon had plotted to have him killed, Jaled' Dar awaited his chance for revenge. Emporer Ganak's Shade now resides in Trakanon's Teeth and gives out the quest for the Key to Sebilis. (will fill in more details here when I get the chance to hail Ganak again)<br>
<br>
Phara Dar, on the other hand, was convinced that Trakanon had plotted to have her father killed so that he could assume his place at the head of the Ring of Scale. Trakanon was banished from the Ring of Scale. Here the history gets a little muddled. Some sources say that Trakanon conquered Sebilis and placed himself as it's ruler. Other sources hint that in a last ditch effort the Iksar managed to imprison him inside Sebilis where he could cause them no more harm. <br>
<br>
Sometime later Trakanon became cursed to everliving death, an undead being forced into continuing his life in his already dead body. <br>
<br>
Now we come back to Lady Vox and Lord Nagefan. It appears as though they got it into their heads to create another Kerafyrm and that they could actually control their progeny and made plans to mate. They were discovered, and banished from the Ring of Scale. <br>
<br>
Once they reached Antonica there is a side story somewhere saying that Nagefan had an underground tunnel built into his castle that allowed him to leave and hunt at his leisure. Again He and Vox made plans to mate but this Time Veeshan herself interfered. She collapsed the mountains in lavatsorm around Nagafen's castle and seeling his escape route. All that remains now is the great lava pool where Eajag spawns (There is more here about the discovery of Nagefan's Lair by the gnomes that I will add later)<br>
<br>
Now, back to Jaled Dar. Jaled Dar at this point want's revenge for his death, and has decided he want's all dragon kind to die. He cares nothing for the rest of Norrath he just wants to exact his ultimate and final revenge upon all those who have wronged him (which in his mind is every living thing on Norrath) As Harla Dar says if you talk with her, Jald' Dar's shade has gone insane. He also wants the peace of obvilion. He is stuck here on Norrath due to his deep anger and Hatred at what he percives was a conspiracy to destroy him. One of his Shouts in DN is something along the lines of "Release him... release.... release ME!" Which indicates that he is looking for a release from his undead state and his imprisonment in Dragon Necrpolis. It is possible that he believes waking the Sleeper will accomplish this goal as well.<br>
<br>
And this brings us to the present day. The big plot here centers around Jaled' Dar. Kerafyrm, while ultimatly powerful, is just a tool being used by Jaled' Dar. It is hard to say if Kerafyrm is even capable of rational thought beyond the destruction of everything and everyone. Regardless, the real Schemer here is Jald' Dar. <br>
<br>
Unfortuntly, I think the only way to find out if there is a Resolution to this plot line is to kill Kerafyrm and see what happens. However, I think it will be some time before Kerafyrm dies based upon what we have been hearing from the guilds who have done Sleeper's. <br>
<br>
On my own server I have talked with a few members of Da'Kor (Now Magister) about the Sleeper and things don;t look promising. Still, one day who knows.<br>
<br>
Once again, if anyone has anything to add to this or corrections to be made please post em. Also PLEASE include your source so that your stories can be verified. The best sources are, of course, in game dialog with NPC's.</font></p>

<br>
Kunark Timeline, wish I knew the SoV one...<br>
<br>
Timeline & History<br>
<br>
-2312 - 2813: Rise of the Shissar Kingdom.  The Shissir were a race of intelligent snake men which colonized and ruled what is now the Overthere.  Their dark capital was Chelsith, overlooking the cliffs on the sea.  The Shissar nation grew slowly and to prominence as they explored dark rites and forgotten evils, and would lay the foundation for much of Iksar knowledge and philosophy.  They enslaved the Iksar and used them as workers and food.  The Shissir’s brutal disloyalty and blasphemous pride angered even their own gods.  A great plague arose in the empire called the Green Death and washed over the kingdom in just a year.  So fierce was the plague that no Shissar is known to have survived it.  The Iksar were immune, and rose from the ashes to migrate outward across the continent, forming five principal tribe-states over the next several centuries.  A new city was slowly erected over the first ruins of Chelsith, ruins that today still exist below the earth hiding forbidden evils and dark magic powerful from an age before time.<br>
<br>
  -2113 : A shaman Iksar necromancer named Kotiz converses with the lesser god Zebuxoruk, and in exchange for 100 intelligent sacrifices, reveals to him battle knowledge which is inscribed in the unholy book of Zebuxoruk  The book disappears upon Kotiz’s death.<br>
<br>
-1999 : A young and powerful warrior-mage of the Kunzar tribe rises to train the Kunzar to unbelievable levels of combat prowess.  Coded in the ancient book of Zebuxoruk, and deciphered by Venril, advanced war techniques are implemented, and armies of dead are animated and bent to his will.  His Kunzar armies march North and West with unyielding fury.<br>
<br>
-1999 - -1989 : The War of Joining.  Sathir’s troops conquer and annex the remaining four Iksar tribe-states, Kylong, Nathsar, Obulus, and Jarsath.  Sathir becomes the first king of the new Iksar empire Sebilis and heralds in an era of magnificent empire building.  The old Kunzar city of Sebilis becomes the new imperial capitol and Innoruuk is the deity of the state.  <br>
<br>
-1988 - -1985 : First Slaves’ War.  Sathir’s troops crush and enslave the hill giants, forest giants and Froglok in a sweeping campaign of carnage.  He orders the construction of naval shipyards at Viesar and Danak.  Newly acquired giant and Froglok slaves are put to work, erecting powerful monuments and cites in the name of the Sebilsian Empire.  <br>
<br>
-1984 : Trade begins with other continents.  Sathir’s navy is immune to piracy because of its potency.  He also uses the same to plunder the hapless vessels of other nations when he pleases.  The cities of Charasis, Torsis, and Sebilis grow in might, power, and grandeur.<br>
<br>
-1950 : An aging Sathir seeks to cheat death, and makes an unholy pact with Innoruuk.  The weak and sick of the Empire are routinely sacrificed to swell Innoruuk’s Cauldron of Souls.  Sathir is given the knowledge of lichdom, and prepares an amulet into which he siphons his soul.  It is to be placed in his corpse upon his own suicide, and after dark rites performed by loyal initiates, Sathir hopes to rise again as an immortal undead king.  However, his first son Rile, heir apparent to the throne, learns of his father’s plans and interrupts the ritual, rendering it a failure.  The priests rescue the amulet and speed it away.  Rile destroys Sathir’s body and assumes the throne.  The amulet is hidden in the crypts of Charasis, where a new dark cult forms dedicated to reviving Venril’s soul once again.  The cult is named the Arisen.<br>
<br>
-1941 : Rile continues the same egomaniacal empire-building strategy that his father began.  He leads a vast army against the mountain giants at Konikor, seizing the most productive mine on the continent in the Battle of Konikor.  The mountain giants are enslaved and forced East to erect monuments of power for the Sebilisian Empire.<br>
<br>
-1936 : Rile orders the construction of a tower stronghold in the North Wood (now Warslik’s Wood).  He assigns his trusted general Kurn Machta to oversee its construction and to be its lord.  Kurn settles into his duty with fervor, slaughtering and torturing all who would oppose the Empire.  This hated warlord swells the ranks of slaves in the East with fresh bodies monthly as he butchers and enslaves giant after giant.<br>
<br>
-1930 : The Council of the Hammer is formed by Karatukus (ancestor of Warslik), a great and wise forest giant.  The Council brings the formally warring giant races together to form a united front against the Iksar with limited success.<br>
<br>
-1925 : Rile orders the construction of a southern stronghold similar to Korn’s Tower.  The tower is named The Kurn, and is overseen by the vampire Iksar named Chosooth.  Chosooth assails the giants from his nearly invincible fortress, and after they fall before his Iksar and undead hordes, he animates the giants to form an undead giant battalion of immense power.  Rile is pleased.  Most of the continent definitely belongs to Sibilis.  Only the dragons and pockets of mountain and forest giant resistance remain unconquered.  <br>
<br>
-1918 : The Ring of Scale meets in secret, and the dragon lords argue about the impending Iksar threat.  Trakanon advocates powerful direct and immediate intervention on behalf of all the races against the Iksar.  He is denounced by Jaled-dar, leader of the Ring.  Trakanon does not give up, and slowly gains support among the younger dragonkind.  The Ring of Scale rules to intervene against the Iksar only indirectly.<br>
<br>
-1915 : Rile sets out to attack kingdoms on Faydwer, taking great naval vessels to the north.  His campaigns are successful and he is able to plunder at will.<br>
<br>
-1906 : A great squall arises at sea and shatters the Sbilisian navy.  The king’s own warship, Fetid Plank, is lost with all hands.  News of Rile’s demise brings great mourning in the Empire by the Iksar.  His first son Atrebe assumes the imperial throne.  The dragon Trakanon is rumored to have been behind this alleged ‘squall’ at sea, and it was indeed he and his dragon allies who sank the armada.  The Ring of Scale is outraged and Jaled-dor orders the punishment of the dragons involved.<br>
<br>
  -1907 - -1857 : The Insurrection of the Younger begins, a civil war of the dragonkind.  The younger dragons face the elder in a contest of wills, magic, and might.  Every so often a great clash can be seen from the sky, from which flaming shredded massive corpses rain down upon the mountains with the crash of thunder.  It is a dark time for the children of Veeshan.<br>
<br>
-1889 : Atrebe delves heavily into the elder magic of the Shissar and of his grandfather.  He is reclusive and mysterious, and all fear him.  He uses his dark powers to conduct foul experiments in his mountain workshop of Kor-sha.<br>
<br>
-1882 : Atrebe successfully magically melds a captured dragon with an Iksar, creating a new and horrid race of intelligent dragon-men which he names the Sarnak.  He breeds them quickly and secretly, bending and training them to his maniacal will.<br>
<br>
-1866 : Atrebe successfully magically melds a dragon with a Froglok, creating a new avian mount for his armies.  Fiercely loyal and deadly in the attack, Atrebe breeds them in earnest.  He names this new monstrosity the Sokokar.<br>
<br>
-1860 : Atrebe’s newly trained air force descends upon the remaining giant strongholds in a massive campaign of conquest lasting just a year.  In the end, the Iksar are victorious, conquering mines and cities and enslaving the last of the mighty giants.  Now only the dragonkind stand unconquered by the mighty Sibilisan Empire.<br>
<br>
-1857 : The Insurrection of the Younger ends with the older dragons winning the war.  Trakanon and his followers are placed in stasis and banished to a magical prison in which they are doomed to oblivion for 600 years. The Ring of Scale then works to subvert the Iksarians indirectly through agents, magic, and division.<br>
<br>
-1856 : Atrebe perishes in one of his own foul rituals gone bad.  His workshop and most of the mountain that contained it is destroyed in a blast of black-green fire.  His third son and lead general, Ganak, acts quickly to assassinate his brothers and rises undisputed to the throne of Sebilis.<br>
<br>
-1856 onward : Climatic changes begin to reshape parts of the continent.  Earthquakes occur more often than ever.  Winds increase in the lands north of the Great Swamp, and the land becomes more and more barren and desert-like.  Land rises on the south side of the Bay of the Moon, and the south entrance to the sea is narrowed.  Viesar and Danak suffer great earthquake damage as well.<br>
<br>
-1850 - -1796 :  A fifty-four year war erupts between the dragonkind and the Iksar, when Atrebe attacks the Ring of Scale with all the might of his airforce.  His first victories are decisive, but he awakens a sleeping fury in the dragonkind, and many an Iksar town and city are laid waste by powerful dragon fire and elder magic.  In the end, Ganak clashes in the sky above the Field of Bone with Jaled-dar, leader of the Ring of Scale.  In a mighty clash, they are both incinerated by magic and fire and explode into flaming chunks which rain down upon the land.  The war is inconclusive, but the Ring of Scale is smashed and broken, and the dragons retreat from their relentless hunters.  The Iksar are quick to rebuild from the devastation using all the might of their slave labor.  Ganak is hailed as a great hero, and his death is mourned for years to come.  His only son and successor, Chottal, rises to take his father’s place on the imperial throne.<br>
<br>
-1795 : In a final blaze of revenge, a horde of dragons attacks the imperial palace by night, destroying it and the king.  Only a handful of dragons escape with their lives, however, and they vow to return one day when the empire is weak.  With no heir to the throne the Iksar nobles create the Emerald Circle, which will rule in the stead of a king.<br>
<br>
-1795 - -1525 :  The Emerald Circle of nobles rules the Empire with total authority.  Cities are enhanced and trade is expanded.  The navy is rebuilt and prosperity returns to the empire.<br>
<br>
-1524 : Arguments over land and influence escalate to a fervorish pitch within the Emerald Circle.  With no enemies left to vanquish, the Iksar nobles turn on each other, and the Empire is split asunder into five great states, each based upon the ancient tribal divisions of the Iksar themselves.<br>
<br>
-1523 - -1296 : Over two hundred years of civil war wrack the continent, as noble families and merchant houses wage war after war against their neighbors, each seeking to gain the upper hand and claim the title of emperor.  The Ring of Scale has its agents meddle in every alliance and affair, always pitting the lords against one another.<br>
<br>
-1296 : Great earthquakes once again rock the continent.  Viesar drops into the Lake of the Moon and is lost utterly.  Danak is slit asunder and half of it slides into the sea.  The naval forces and merchant vessels of the states are destroyed in one day as massive tidal waves wash over ports and vessels alike.  Cities are rocked by the quakes and commerce is disrupted.  Starvation and want begin to spread across the empire.  The End Days begin.<br>
<br>
-1295 : The Iksar try desperately to rebuild, but starving Froglok and giant slaves begin to revolt.  The Iksar are unorganized and desperately struggle to keep their minions in line.  A Sledge merchant brings a wealthy haul of items to the Arisen.  They discover one of the items is the pendant of Rile found in the north sea.  The Arisen believe if they can find the bones of Rile, they may be able to resurrect Sathir using the amulet.  Their plans never come to fruition, however.<br>
<br>
-1294 : All the slave races of the Iksar are in full revolt.  Even the Sarnak turn against their masters.  Cities burn and war is waged across the continent.<br>
<br>
-1294 - -1257 : Goblin lords in Faydwer hear of the calamities and begin shipping invading troops to Kunark to pillage the land.  Kurn’s Tower is smashed and broken by an army of giants led by the massive mountain giant Warslik.  The Karnor is smashed to ruins by forest and hill giant forces.  The cities of the Iksar are assaulted and burned.  The Iksar flee in terror to the forests and jungles where they are hunted down like dogs.<br>
<br>
-1256 : Trakanon and his dragon allies burst free from their 600 year imprisonment.  Trakanon and his forces descend upon the weeping cities of the Iksar and reduce them to ash and ruins.  Clouds of poison float through the streets of city after city, slaying any remaining Iksar.  They breath fire upon the West Wood (now the Burning Wood) and set it ablaze, covering most of the continent with the haze of smoke which dims the sun for the better part of the year.  Crops fail across the land and starvation kills more than the wars ever did.  After a year of dragon devastation, it is clear that the Sibilisian Empire is no more.<br>
<br>
-1257 : The bones of the Iksar and other slain creatures are gathered and spread across the Field of Bone by Trakanon and his followers as a permanent warning to any who would seek to fill the shoes of the Iksar.  The Ring of Scale reforms about Jaled-dar’s daughter Phara-dar.  They demand an end to the destruction lest the continent itself be ripped apart.  Trakanon refuses to rest until death and vows to stand watch over the Iksar that if ever they should rise again, he would be there to smash them down.  He takes of residence in the council chambers of Sibilis and remains there still to this day.  His young followers rejoin their brethren in the Ring of Scale lest they be banished again or slain outright.<br>
<br>
-1256 - -752 : Over the next 500 years, the other races begin to build new cities and cultures and intercontinental trade begins once again.  The goblins dig in the northwest, multiplying and raiding the giants and remaining Iksar.  They establish mines and armies, claiming the land for themselves.  The giants return to bickering among themselves, with alliances constantly shifting so as to keep the balance of power between them.  The Froglok return to their home in the Great Swamp, to their city of Krup.  The Sokokar forget their training and domestication, and become the foremost hunters of the Iksar in the Emerald Jungle.  The dragons retreat to secrecy and seclusion, to once again pull the invisible strings of fate from afar.  The Sarnak hide in Trakanon’s Teeth, and begin to slowly and secretly build cities and mines, and to train for the day when they would take the place of the Iksar as masters of the continent.  Smashed and broken, the remaining Iksar fall back into a tribal existence, scraping out a life of hardship and torment in the Emerald Jungle and the forests. <br>
<br>
-752 : A sledge explorer searches the ancient wreckage of the fleet which sank at sea under the leadership of Rile long ago.  He discovers the corpse of Rile draped in jewelry and takes it whole as a trophy.<br>
<br>
-701 : The corpse of Rile is sold to a goblin king, Kaboktok, who places it in his throne room for all to see.  He claims it was his goblin ancestor who slew Emperor Rile at sea.<br>
<br>
-622 : The mountain giant king, Farslik, descendant of Warslik, descends upon a rich goblin city.  The mountain giants, with the aid of frost giants, capture the city-mine.  Farslik takes the bones of Rile as a souvenir.<br>
<br>
-546 : For the first time, the Sarnak venture out into the ruins of the Iksar cities.  Few return, but those who do possess priceless scrolls dealing in dark rituals and forbidden magic.  The Sarnak begin to explore dark magic themselves, finding they have an uncanny knack for its use.<br>
<br>
-491 : The goblins mount an all out offensive on Konikor, sacking it for all its worth.  Part of the bounty are the bones of Rile, which are sold to an Iksar merchant who then travels east.  The mountain giants retake Konikor that same year.<br>
<br>
-483 : The merchant (whose name is Vlistis) sells the bones of Rile to the descendents of the Cult of the Arisen.  They take the bones to Charasis and begin to search for the Amulet of Sathir in the wreckage, hoping that by bringing the soul of the father into the body of the son that they may perhaps bring back the first king of Sebilis.<br>
<br>
-433 : Fifty years of searching finally reveals the Amulet and dark rites are performed upon it and the bones of Rile.  Nothing happens and the cult members believe they have failed utterly.  They leave the bones of Rile on an altar beneath the ruins of Charasis.<br>
<br>
-389 : The Sarnak, hungry for more dark knowledge, journey into Charasis to loot its ancient tombs.  A priest in the group find the scrolls the cult was using and in the presence of the bones of Rile unwittingly completes the ritual.  Venril Sathir is sucked from his place of torment and after 1600 years is joined to the body of his backstabbing son.  He rises from his bed-like altar and slays all the Sarnak.  One of the Sarnak he transforms into a vampire, one that will loyally do his every bidding.<br>
<br>
-388 - -288 : For one hundred years, Venril Sathir travels among the ruined cities of the Iksar, collecting what remnants of power he can, and building about him an army of the dead.  He travels west and seduces goblin and giants lords alike with promises of immortality and untold power.<br>
<br>
-222 : Venril establishes himself in the Dreadlands and begins to rebuild the shattered ruins of the Karnor.  His minions raid caravans for weapons and supplies, and he begins to build expeditionary forces.  He magically perverts some of the mortals to make a legion of lycanthropes, led by Thuuga, a wizard Iksar serpent changer.<br>
<br>
-175 : The giants meet in the council and decide to unite against an unknown enemy in Karnor, whose horrid legions are pillaging their cities and caravans.  The goblins are asked to join to stomp out this new presence in the Dreadlands, and agree to do so for a price.  They would receive Konikor, the richest mine in the world as their own.  The giants agree and an assault is planned.  The dragons are the ones to leak information to both sides that this threat in the Dreadlands must be stopped, fearing themselves that this unseen force may be an Iksar wizard of reborn power.  The dragons also convince Thuuga that Sathir believes the lycanthropes are expendable and untrustworthy, and that he will eliminate them soon.  Thuuga secretly joins the Alliance of the Stone against the undead.<br>
<br>
-172 : The Alliance of Stone (giants and goblins) descend unwittingly upon the Karnor.  Venril is alerted to the attack before it occurs, however, by an agent of the Ring of Scale.  The battle lasts for an entire year, and in the end, Sathir’s forces are crushed and driven back, most decisively by the betrayal of his lycanthrope troops.  He takes refuge in the Bile, at an outpost he names Varis.<br>
<br>
-171 : Agents of the dragon council convince the goblins that the giants have no intention of giving up Konikor (which was untrue).  They council the goblins to sneak attack and take it by force while it is weak.  At the same time, agents of the council advise the giants that the goblins intent to take Konikor in battle and other mines as well.  The dragons’ plans work, and war ensues.<br>
<br>
-171 - -142 : A thirty year war is fought between the giants and the goblins, called the War of Lies (in that each side believes the other to be liars).  It ends in a stalemate, with very heavy casualties on all sides.  The giants retain control of Konikor.<br>
<br>
-132 : The Sarnak establish outposts in the Frontier Mountains and being to capture Sokokar young and train them as battle attack dogs.<br>
<br>
-130 : One of the members of the Ring of Scale disappears over Trakanon’s Teeth.  Trakanon is implicated, however no evidence can be found.  In fact, it was the Sarnak testing their prowess in combat against their dragon ancestors.<br>
<br>
-101 : The Sarnak invade and conquer two small goblin mines in the Frontier Mountains.  The giants take once again to squabbling amongst themselves.  The Sarnak begin to breed Goblin and Froglok slaves.<br>
<br>
-50 : The first landing by elves is made at what is now Firiona Vie.  The elves are slain within the year by Froglok raids.  Venril Sathir relocates back to the Karnor and begins to rebuild once more, only more quietly.  He rousts the lycanthropes from Karnor into the wilds of the Dreadlands.  He begins to animate an army of the dead once again.<br>
<br>
-25 : Again, elves land in Firiona Vie.  This time they are able to resist the Frogloks.  However, the swamp and hill giants see them as a threat and descend upon Firiona Vie in force.  All the elves are slain save for a few who escape back to the sea.  Sathir re-establishes his outpost at Varis as a lookout to the East.  He sends his best lieutenant to the lost city of Kaesora in the Field of Bone.<br>
<br>
-2 : The elves land once again in Firiona Vie in force.  A fort is erected and the giants are too busy squabbling amongst themselves to notice.  The Froglok raid continually, but are unable to breach the elves’ defenses.<br>
<br>
-1 : Adventurers, mercenaries and frontiersmen arrive at Firiona Vie.  They are elven, human, and dwarven.  The growing town is fortified further and begins trade with a more peaceful hill giant tribe in the Dreadlands.  They lyncathropes form an uneasy alliance with the hill giants of the region to suppress the rapidly growing power of Venril Sathir at Karnor.  Sathir sends an agent that appears to the Sarnak as one of their own and within one year is elected to the king’s council.  There he begins to subvert the Sarnak to his own designs, convincing them to eliminate the Ring of Scale altogether.  The dragons’ agent in the council mysteriously vanishes one night, never to be seen again (assassinated by Sathir’s agent Korucust).<br>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2">Very interesting Sean. Where did you get the timeline? Can it be verified as fact? Most of what is in that time line agress with what I have dug up but there are some discrepencies and I would like to find out which is true and which is fiction.<br>
<br>
I am also going to go in game and see about fillinmg in some of the Holes in the story with in game dialog from quest NPC's. <br>
<br>
Hehe I think this is gonna become my new project. Compile a history of Norrath in a fairly abridged form and incluse as much Lore from each area as I can.<br>
<br>
Also Sean, I don't think a time line such as the one you posted about Kunark exists yet for Velious. I think the Closest your gonna get is the LONG speach that the Dragon Sage goes through. He details the History of Velious from the Age of Scale to the present day.<br>
<br>
Interesting Dialog and I'll have to log and post it next time I am out that way.</font></p>

<br>
There was a post from Kendrick in there somewhere that said Trak is not undead, and he is just plain old. His body is in the state it is becasue of powerful Shamanistic and Necromatic powers that he has abused over his lifespan. <br>
<br>
And I don't think Naggy and Vox had it in thier heads to create another Sleeper. I think they just dug each other and wanted to get down and do the horizontal boogie.<br>
<br>
One of the other interesting facts that I didn't see in there is that after Jaled Dar  and Ganak had it out over the field of bone Zlandicar comes out and starts chowing down on Dar's remains and now he has a taste for only dragon.<br>
<br>
Now I have never been to the necropolis, but from what I have heard Zland is in the Necropolis with dar's shade, anyone know how this happened? And I guess he talks about wanting to eat more dragon, yum!</font></p>

But dragons are forbidden to kill each other, one of their most sacred laws, so they allow him to live in his exile. <br>
<br>
He is in the condition you see him due to the magics unleased during the war, vile necromantic and shamanistic powers prevent his wounds from healing.<br>
<br>
The same applies to Vox and Nagafen, they attempted something very very bad, and rather than being killed, they were sent into exile. <br>
<br>
What they wanted to do was mate. <br>
<br>
Dragons of different colors are not allowed to do this. It happened once before in history, and the result was Kerafyrm. <br>
<br>
What transpired after Kerafyrm being born was the first war between dragonkind, and the cost of that war was higher than any could imagine, hence the injunction against killing their own kind.<br>
<br>
Jaled Dar was not killed by Zlandicar, but Zlandicar found his charred remains a tasty snack when they were interred in the Necropolis. <br>
<br>
Jaled Dar hates Trakanon, blaming him for his death, rather than Ganak. Ganak was merely doing what he had to do to preserve his empire and people. Trakanon started the war that led to that. This hatred is what keeps his spirit attached to this world.<br>
<br>
Zlandicar is also protected by the injunction that prevents dragon from killing dragon, something he twists to his advantage, as his diet consists entirely of the flesh of his kind, usually dead, but not always......<br>

Here is the quote from Kendrick I was looking for. Enjoy.</font></p>

<br>
I don't believe Trakanon to be undead, though Emporer Ganak stated as such.  You cannot hit Trakanon with undead spells for one.  Also, if you read the story of Edril, Trakanon talks about his own passing.  IMO this infers that Trakanon must be living to die on his own.  It's my understanding that if he were undead he would be "everlasting" (though for the lifespan of a dragon they could be darn well called immortal)<br>
<br>
Anyways, my few thoughts there.  I have to agree with Sean that if a book was compiled with the "10k pages" of info Kendrick references are in the designer vaults, I'd buy it.</font></p>

<br>
I can't find any still existing in game references to that story and as well it contradicts some other things that have been said in game by other story characters.<br>
<br>
Then there is the story about the Clockwork Dragon. Originally the Clockwork Dragons name was Trakanon. This was verified by in game dialog with NPC's. Now those same NPC's call the Clackwork Dragon Big Bynn. <br>
<br>
Once again it becomes a problem of seperating fact from fiction.</font></p>

It seems to me that awaking the sleeper could not nessicarily be a good thing to happen for a server....<br>

Course I might just be giving verant too much credit and about all that will happen is a few corney scripts... I guess we'll see eventualy...</font></p>

	<p><FONT face="arial, helvetica" size="2"><blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>-1256 : Trakanon and his dragon allies burst free from their 600 year imprisonment. Trakanon and his forces descend upon the weeping cities of the Iksar and reduce them to ash and ruins. Clouds of poison float through the streets of city after city, slaying any remaining Iksar. They breath fire upon the West Wood (now the Burning Wood) and set it ablaze, covering most of the continent with the haze of smoke which dims the sun for the better part of the year. Crops fail across the land and starvation kills more than the wars ever did. After a year of dragon devastation, it is clear that the Sibilisian Empire is no more.<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
The only problem I have with this part of the story concerns the meteor in BW.  Now...Trak and the other dragons may have done this to BW, but it seems it was either already in ruins when they started (and not all of it is in ruins) or a meteor came along after they did and added to the already done damage.<br>
<br>
Or I'm completely mistaken about a meteor in BW.<br>

<br>
I'm sorry =p.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>You cannot hit Trakanon with undead spells for one.<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
NS, he's immune to magic.  But you can have them resisted.  If Trakanon wasn't undead at all, you wouldn't be able to have the spell resisted.<br>
<br>
Also, the paladin /disc that only gives crips/crits to undead mobs works on trakanon.<br>
<br>
Hmm combine the "undead" flag used for undead spells, the paladin disc, his graphic of having chunks of flesh missing that he probably couldn't live without, and the fact NPCs in the game say he's a vile undead wurm, and one would probably think that trakanon is, in fact, undead.<br>
<br>
<blockquote><FONT face="arial,helvetica" size="1">quote:</font><hr>Also, if you read the story of Edril, Trakanon talks about his own passing. IMO this infers that Trakanon must be living to die on his own<hr></blockquote><br>
<br>
Yes, Trakanon "died" at the end of beta appearently... and whether or not that is all a load of BS is still up in the air.</font></p>
