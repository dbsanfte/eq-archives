<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Something I've thought about a bit lately really came to light the first time my guild did THO last week. <br />
<br />
When I was a little shaman kitten I remember looking at Winterstorm and thinking how incredible that item was. Here I am now with THO laying dead at my feet and winterstorm comes up for loot. I take one look at it and don't bother sending a tell on it. I guess the other shaman present didn't either because gratz me for forced loot on something that not too long ago seemed impossible to obtain for me. <br />
<br />
So I'm thinking back on other things that have changed in the way I view things. Since when is 55 low level? When I started playing lvl 30 characters were absolute gods to me. Wasn't doing fear challenging at some point? Last time we went we were getting randomly DT'd by Fright every 30 seconds and it wasn't threataning it was annoying. <br />
<br />
I guess its just one of those thigns that as you move up you start to look at other things differently. And I thought I'd ask what other things people have had thier perspective shift on as they grew older. Whats changed for you?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Death is now a great time to hit the head or raid the fridge!!<br />
<br />
L30 shaman with rusty flail and banded &gt; L30 shaman with REIF and Fungi.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have that Winterstorm and use it a lot as well as my epic. I sold my JBB and bought a bracer with better stats on it. When i want to mana free nuke something i equip the winterstorm and nuke away. The damage isn't as much as the JBB was but it cast faster so it catches up in damage after a few chain casts.<br />
<br />
However.. when I saw that I thought oh cool a new toy.. not .. ohh cool UBER LOOT.<br />
<br />
I think the biggest change for me was when i first started a shaman and saw the Arctic Wyvern gear that.. one could make themselves. I soooo  wanted a set of that so I picked up a sewing kit and started tailoring. Fast forward two years to when I finally make 250 in tailoring and look at the arctic wyvern gear that was once so uber in my eyes and think.. &quot;wouldn't be caught dead in it&quot;. I also once tought the KC shaman loot was incredible and couldn't wait until I could go there and get some.<br />
<br />
* Something recently that made me sit back and think was when i took a small group of 3 people into the Arena in kael (me, sk and a wizard).. and we owned everything. Pulling 3 sometimes 4 mobs at a time and having no problem. Made me think back to when I was level 58/59 and we were doing arena raids with a whole raid force.. and pulling 3 mobs usually meant a raid wipe. it made me feel a little proud of our little group but also made me a little sad.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">level 10 and running around N-Ro and seeing a shaman with epic .. wow!<br />
<br />
level 34 soloing mammoths in EW .. and being terribly afraid of the snow griffins and manticores<br />
<br />
level 46 and my first hate raid, i musta gotten killed about 8 times that night :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">hey.. being scared to death to run theu Kith forest at night so you sat at the zoneline waiting for daylight.<br />
<br />
When i &quot;moved&quot; from everfrost to the freeport area and ran all the way from Halas to Freeport scared to death. Conning everything in my path, not running at night because i couldn't see anything and how relieved I was when i finally got there about 1 1/12 hours later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Hrothgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I remember when it used to be frightening to run from qeynose to freeport.  :) I remember I put every meager scrap of armor I had and my rusty mace in the bank and made the run through hostile Highpass... was great fun.<br />
<br />
I also remember...<br />
/shout Will bind for PP!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Finally getting a chance to camp trainer hill in CB for that awesome shiny brass shield...only to get your butt handed to you 3-4 times in a row.  After all those hours/days of poking orcs with my rusty spear finally paid off though.  That was a good day.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I remember when you didn't have to suck up to a uberguild to get anything done in the game.  I remember when the difference between a uberguilder and a regular Joe was 1k hp instead of 2k or more, 500ac, and FT-15.  I remember when the game was fun... <br />
<br />
My theory is that SOE wants to get people to quit.  They know the real addicts won't, so they make the game enjoyable for them.  They know that by screwing everyone else, they will leave - and oh look, what's that coming out soon?  EQ2 did you say?  oh.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember when it was terrifying to run around in Everfrost and see the Vengeful Composer, Lyricist, and the dreaded Soloist being trained to the guards and killing everyone in their path. <br />
<br />
I remember having to beg for infravision to get through the blackburrow tunnel. <br />
<br />
I remember running my level 12 ranger from Freeport to Halas, it took me 5 hours, I kid you not. I printed every map from eqatlas at work and planned the trip with great anticipation, managed to bum a sow and a bind in highkeep. I was absolutely amazed at the &quot;high levels&quot; hunting there.  I did this all so I could twink Saraei (my new main) with my ranger's leather armor and a fine steel 2hb someone had given me lol.  <br />
<br />
I remember waiting on lists to get into a high keep guard room group in the 20s. <br />
<br />
I remember living in Cazic Thule, Lower Guk, and the troll guards in Rathe Mountains in the 30s. <br />
<br />
Riding the boat from Butcherblock to Firiona Vie the day of Kunark release and falling off the barge in Tim deep because of some bug where the barge did not go high enough to let you get on the boat. <br />
<br />
Seeing 2 level 51 characters camping the AoF room in cazic and thinking that the level increase would make the game unplayable due to fewer people being needed to hold rooms and not wanting full groups. <br />
<br />
I remember paying 3k in gfayfor my totemic helm and being so excited. <br />
<br />
Shortly thereafter Saraei went on vacation... fast forward from 3/01 to 3/03... <br />
<br />
I bought a metal linked crown in the bazaar for 49pp, which was an UPGRADE to my totemic. <br />
<br />
I sold the totemic helm for 350pp in the bazaar...<br />
<br />
My, how times have changed. This is going to be interesting. =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
HAHA!  And that $%!@ random icebone skelly that was like level 7.  Killed me EVERY TIME argh.<br />
<br />
I got my totemic helm for 3500...and that was when it was going for like 5k :(  Had to do some serious guildy begging for that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">&quot; remember when it was terrifying to run around in Everfrost and see the Vengeful Composer, Lyricist, and the dreaded Soloist being trained to the guards and killing everyone in their path.&quot; <br />
<br />
HAHA I hated those guys. My revenge.. Taking my level 2 or something warrior.. buffing her up with all my level 60 shaman group buffs and &quot;soloing&quot; one of them with her near the entrance to halas with a gang of newbies cheering me on.<br />
<br />
I remember paying 3k in gfayfor my totemic helm and being so excited.  <br />
<br />
Ahhh I remember the day i finished the quest for mine. Was SOO excited. Took screenshots of me wearing it and emailed my BF and work saying LOOK WHAT I GOT! I then remember hanging onto that helm long after i outgrew it because of those fond memories. Then finally running into a &quot;true&quot; shaman newb who seemed so excited about being a shaman and wearing a cloth cap or something so i handed it over to him, and watched them get just as excited over it as i did when i first got it. Nowadays if I tried that would likely get a &quot;pfffttt,thats junk.. I got better.&quot; from a level 2.  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Hagle</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I remember how scarey it was to see spectre's in feerott in the dark.<br />
I remember taking a trip to Freeport from BB and seeing Seafurrys for the first time and saying wow im gonna kill one some day.<br />
I remember seeing a clr solo a SG in oasis and being mystified.<br />
I remember my first solo kill on a HG at lvl 39 and people saying wow cause back then we didnt have horse FT 1500hps and 800ac at that lvl.<br />
I remember when totemic was very uber.<br />
I remember my first solo kill on a UP goranga with crap equip and no lvl 60 spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Xahra</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I remember when I started playing lol...my iksar shaman was my very first character; I made her to play with my brother's shadowknight.  I was using that piece of trash cudgel until level 8 or 9 lol, 4/25 or whatever it is.  So my brother, who was working on blacksmithing, made me a forged steel morning star.  Well, we were both astonished at why they would even make a weapon so good.  Oh...my...GOD.  It hits for 13!<br />
<br />
My guild was raiding Fear the other night, and all kinds of stuff was dropping that made different people on the raid say, &quot;OMG, I wanted one of these so bad a year ago!&quot;  Then, we had the same thing with the golems...when I was in Fear a year ago, I was terrified of the golems and thought their DT ability was almost like cheating.  Now, it was like, &quot;Okay...how many people do I need to rebuff after the fight?&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Dorothy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Oh I remember those good ole days<br />
<br />
Seeing an Ogre for the first time which wasnt an NPC. (First days there were less than 50 peeps on) :(<br />
<br />
Running to Qeynos Hills and trying to talk to the gnome near the ruins &quot;thinking&quot; he WAS a player!  Ouch that hurt.<br />
<br />
Deciding to make a Troll and leveling at T2 in WK since so many peeps were hunting my poor guards.  Funny how people hate you killing those guards, but could care less about the Troll ones.   :mad: <br />
<br />
Deciding which weapon to use 1HB or 2HB, then Verant makes our epic piercing!  In the early days we didn't have piercing.<br />
<br />
Thinking there must be nothing bigger or meaner than an HG.  &quot;HG to T2!&quot;  Wait a second....I'm in T2!  eppp!<br />
<br />
Wondering how the bandits got the guards on the payroll in WK.<br />
<br />
Finding out there is an auction channel when a bronze mace came up for sale on day 3.<br />
<br />
Hitting consent soandso and hoping they didn't loot your corpse.<br />
<br />
Or my favorite....hunting at the orc highway in Oasis and one person was lookout for those SG's since there were like 30 of em!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Naarlina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Great thread, here's my personal favorite...<br />
<br />
First making the run from Everfrost to Qeynos at level 7 (Someone gave me this incredible buff called SoW!), then at level 12 (with my own sow) making the looooong run to Freeport, only to find this amazing thing called the EC tunnel.  I had never seen so many players and so many cool items!  Totemic boots 500pp....who the hell has 500pp!?!?!<br />
<br />
As I levelled I later started pharming spiked collars from blackburrow and running them back to the tunnel to sell.  Eventually I saved up 400pp (can you believe it?) and bought my uber Staff of the Observers, which I think I used for the next 20+ levels.  I still have that thing in the bank.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Fethanin_ECI</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I remember when I first started EQ, I went through about 20 characters, all in freeport, and none of them got out of the newbie zone... then one day with my uber lvl 4 naked magician I ran out into West Commons... and I saw some other guy running towards me and was wetting myself as I thought he was a mob, and I ran away from him lol</div></div><hr />
