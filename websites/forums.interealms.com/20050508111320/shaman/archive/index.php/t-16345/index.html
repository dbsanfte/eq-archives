<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Adventure stones require a two step process. Firstly, zone into your home city. If you're KOS to your home city, apparently there's one in Rathe Mountains you can go to.<br />
<br />
As you zone in, a voice whispers something in your ear telling you who to go see about the Wayfarers. Go talk to that person, follow the dialog. He'll tell you to go talk to one of several people at an adventure camp.<br />
<br />
Then go to an adventure camp. Talk to one of the guys the first person mentioned by name. They'll ask you a few questions, the answers will be from the original dialog. Follow that through, and you'll get the adventure stone.<br />
<br />
It's pretty easy.</div></div><hr />
