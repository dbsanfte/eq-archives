How does Agilty affect dodge, riposte, block, parry?  Or Dexterity affect dodge, riposte, block, parry.<br />
<br />
No. None of your stats figure in to these.<br />
<br />
Dexterity affect dual wield and double attack?<br />
<br />
Nope, see above.<br />
<br />
Does Dexterity act as Intelligence for combat skills, helping you learn them faster.<br />
<br />
Not sure about this, I'll try to remember to check it on Monday.<br />
<br />
Since Strength increases ATK, it affects chance to hit, not just damage done. (This one conflicts with your recent Dex/Str post, but Str DOES increase ATK. Is ATK only related to damage?)<br />
<br />
No. ATK and AC, despite the fact that they are represented by one number, have several different factors that make them up.<br />
<br />
AC, for instance, is the combination of two factors:<br />
<br />
    * Damage avoidance<br />
    * Damage mitigation<br />
<br />
ATK is comprised of two different factors:<br />
<br />
    * Chance to hit<br />
    * Damage potential<br />
<br />
Some of the beta people will remember when AC and ATK were presented with the two factors listed seperatly. This was confusing to a lot of people, so the two seperate factors for each rating were combined into a ratio versus 1000.<br />
<br />
So, in other words, just because more STR increases your ATK, it doesn't mean that your chance-to-hit is also increased.<br />
<br />
Since Dexterity was a Primary Stat for Monks, I think we should at least know how it affects us.<br />
<br />
As for the questions regarding dex and the monk, I'll check Monday to see if they figure into the monk-specific attacks.<br />

Look at the date on this post.  Look at what we have now.  It was a different game then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm well aware of the date of the post.  I'm also aware that, with the exception of new caps with diminished returns, stats have changed very little since then.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Bumping this to hopefully dispell some confusion.  Someone got all worked up and sent me nasty messages via the reputation system such as:<br />
<br />
Gordon was telling the truth in his post, boy you don't know the game you play. You however, are making no sense.<br />
<br />
If you don't understand limitation in programmnig do us a favor just play the game.<br />
<br />
and this gem...<br />
<br />
****ING FAGGOT<br />
<br />
-- so I'm guessing there was a misunderstanding here.  <br />
<br />
The quoted section on my first post is an old Q&amp;A from Verant.  The italic sections are questions from players followed by Gordon Wrinn's responses.  I only wrote the first paragraph where I did not offer any opinions on how stats work.<br />
<br />
I copied this because, for years, I've seen people ask why STR buffs increase your attack rating and does it improve your chance to hit.      I was hoping to remove some of the folklore surrounding this issue by copying an official statement.   <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You are exactly right, the core function of stats has not changed one iota since release.  I think this is a very useful bit of lore that should be hung on to.  <br />
<br />
Copy it into the tips thread in the library if you want to live forever in a place you can quickly find.</div></div><hr />
