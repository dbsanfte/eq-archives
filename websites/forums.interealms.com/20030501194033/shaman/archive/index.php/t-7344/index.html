<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Nubok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Last created 40 SoW potions, and I had 6 or 7 failures. My alchemy skill is at 40, so the potions are trivial. Is it normal to have that many failures? Aren't we supposed to succes 95% at trivial? Or does the failure rate decrease if I enhance my alchemy skill further?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Keep working at it, at 65 I get about one failure in 20 on average, so I think by then you've hit the 5% minimum. There's a formula somewhere if you care to search for it and work out the exact level you maximise your success rate on sows.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">The formula for success rate is reportedly:<br />
<br />
Success Rate = (1.15 x Skill) – (Trivial – 70)<br />
<br />
so for SoW with a skill level of 40:<br />
<br />
Success Rate = (1.15 x 40) - (37 - 70)<br />
Success Rate = (46) - (-33)<br />
Success Rate = 79%<br />
<br />
So...<br />
<br />
If you had a 40 out of 46 rate = 87%<br />
If you had a 40 out of 47 rate = 85%<br />
<br />
Either way, you did better than the norm.<br />
<br />
As your skill gets higher, trivial actually starts to mean &quot;success&quot;.  The higher the skill level and the trivial level, the more likely you will reach the 95% success rate cap.<br />
<br />
For example, a shaman with skill of 165 attempting to make port potions (trivial at 170) would have a better success rate on a NON-trivial potion than you with a skill level beyond the SoW trivial.  See:<br />
<br />
Success Rate = (1.15 x 165) - (170 - 70)<br />
Success Rate = (190) - (100)<br />
Success Rate = 90%<br />
<br />
Hope that helps.  :)</div></div><hr />
