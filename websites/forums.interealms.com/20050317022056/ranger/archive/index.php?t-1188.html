So far I can think of 2 good spots, but both are kind of out of the way:  the Hole and seafuries in OOT.  If they are camped, we made the run for nothing and neither of us have a lot of play time to spend half the evening running around.</div></div><hr />

Dark blues are plentiful at 53, it's easily accessible, and stuff doesn't hit that hard. You'll be hard pressed to run your cleric out of mana.</div></div><hr />

Cobalt Scar is good experience, when it's not filled with quad kiters (as it usually is these days).  The back part of City of Mist is a good spot.  You could probably do well in Lower Guk with that combo, if you can get a camp like the hand or the sage that's not too hard to break.  If you have keys, the top of the Tower of Frozen Shadow is great experience, but it is a bit out of the way.  It's rarely camped, though.  These are all places I've duoed with my wife, who's a druid, so I'd expect a ranger/cleric duo to be effective as well.</div></div><hr />
