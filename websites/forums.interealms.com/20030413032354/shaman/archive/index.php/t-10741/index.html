<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aridor1</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi, i have been grinding faction in chardok by myself for a couple days and since i was at bottom faction when i started it hasnt gotten much better.. i was thinking of an easier way to get faction and this was my idea:<br />
<br />
is there any place in nurga/droga with a single goblin spawn and no roamers around?   if so, would it work to have your pet parked right on it and have you standing right on it also, where the gobby spawns.. i am bound outside in fm so i thought every night before i go to sleep i could gate there, run to this spot, summon pet and go to sleep.. have the gob spawn on me and automaticly attack me, and pet kill it.  this would be nice since during the day i can raid, exp, do tradeskills, other quests, whatever.. and at night i could just get faction.. sure it would be kind of slow, but if its doing it while i sleep i dont mind if it takes like 2 weeks..  also, eventually every single buff that i and the pet have will have worn off so, can spirit of the howler (55pet) solo a goblin while im tanking it? im lvl57 and only have like 1900hp completly unbuffed.  ideas?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Larbonal</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I doubt it, because I do believe that they run, so you'd either have to give yer puppy a weapon that procs snare, and hope it goes off, or find a REALLY good spot where there's a single gobbie with none for miles around, and I don't think that's the case.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Largus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">This topic was brought up a few months ago and the general consensus was that it is not possible because of what larbonal said. They run and others are too close for it to work.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like 61 pet would work and you could probably get 61 faster than doing the faction work at 57, heh, good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">yes this could be done, but thers no guarantee to make it fool proof-  you wake up one morning and found u are naked at your bind spot lol<br />
<br />
i think i noticed something yesterday.  in nurga u get faction when ur pet kills a gobo, even if u dont hit it etc.  in droga this dont work!  I need to recheck this one....<br />
<br />
anyway, i can think of some safe ish spots in nurga to do what u just said.  thers a round cave with some iksar miners, and 2 goblins in, if u get a runner  they got to run a long way to get agro.<br />
<br />
best plan is to try this tactic, while at the keyboard, just sit and watch for an hour,  if u get trained by a runner, then  thers yer answer!<br />
<br />
another factor is project alpha,  if dog dog, can stun or dot or snare the mob, then u can stop runners.  its unlikely that you will get no procs at all during a fight, but it could happen!<br />
<br />
if u got a necro and a cleric goblin pop together then u could be buggered.  i have seen my pet feared by a boneseer once....<br />
<br />
wellit worth a go, id be interested in results.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can't remember if repops kill pets but for some reason i am thinking they do...</div></div><hr />

<br />
yup, zone/server-wide zone repops kill pets.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ridik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I pondered this idea a few months ago as well and it didnt work at all.  However, with 61pet I think its possible.<br />
<br />
The key is controlling the runners.  Make sure pet has summoned Haste item, and for weapons Im thinking 2 Ebony Bladed Longswords would work best.  Worried about runners, forget snare and stuns, just flat out root the bastard.  Was also considering EBsword and a SBD.<br />
<br />
Definetely need the 61 pet though, and definetely need more testing done to be sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Saw a necro trying to do this back in my factioning days.  Needless to say I later saw an unrezzable corpse laying where the necromancer once was.<br />
<br />
Too risky IMO, those zones are just too densely packed to try it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>oogha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">nurga is quite empty in parts.<br />
<br />
tbh the downside of doing this is that all the faction drop items will rot; rember the skins give 3 faction hits each.<br />
<br />
maybe next week, i can try this out myself- too busy atmo</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>kilher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I don't remember if it was here or on the necro board... but once somebody did the faxion math and it proved that to get faxion for chardok afk like this, you'd have to be afk for like half a year or something insane.  I dunno the exact number/length of time, but figure that each faxion hit from killing a goblin is 1pt... then take the spawn time of the mob you are afk-killing and do the math.  It really isn't worth the risk.  Say spawn time is 30 mins, that'd put you close to 63 days of solid afk-killing to get just 3000 faxion hits, which if you are bottomed out KOS still wouldn't be enough.<br />
<br />
What you want to do, is grab a cleric, enc, and a wiz.  Can replace the clr with a good druid if you want.  Then YOU pull a huge train for AE faxion.  You could get a tank to pull, but then you have to worry about whether or not you will get all the faxion hits.  If you do use a tank to pull, then cast fleeting fury over and over on him as soon as he's in range.  You won't get all of them, but most.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grimthor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Best way I have found to get faction through AEing is to wait until the Wiz has done his first AE, and aggroed all the mobs, then you toss him a heal.  Immediately puts you on the hate list for all the mobs, and you will get faction when they drop.  He will probably need the heal anyway at some point....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">hiya grim,<br />
did that work for you all the time?  i was factioning with a bard and he would pull a good 20/30 mobs at once and i would be healing him.  sometimes i would get faction sometimes i wouldn't...i found it worked better to just torpor him and have a few of my fastest casting rain spells up =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">get a mage to summon you full pet gear, get a fungi.<br />
<br />
   With that you can do pet factioning in a few spots.   no clue if 55 pet can manage but 61 pet sure does it easy enough.   I do it overnight with no fungi rather regularly, but avoid it during the day when there could be someoen running from a train who takes a wrong turn.</div></div><hr />
