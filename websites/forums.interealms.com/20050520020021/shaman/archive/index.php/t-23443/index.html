<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juka</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Thinking of coming back to the game after an 18 month hiatus, just playing casually.<br />
<br />
Problem is, my school just implemented a new policy limiting bandwidth usage to 2 GB a month. I don't really want to come back, play maybe 15 hours in the next two weeks, then have my internet connection blocked for the rest of the month because I've exceeded my bandwidth allocation.<br />
<br />
Anyone know?  :confused:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Considering you can play EQ on dialup, which is around 5k per second at max speed...<br />
<br />
2,000,000,000 divided by 5000 (a high number, I dont think EQ uses that much even) gives you 40,000,000 seconds of EQ play.<br />
<br />
Divide that by 3600 (number of seconds in an hour) = 111 hours. There you have it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">guesstimating 5K/sec maximum from EQ (pretty sure it's lower than this) you could play for 4 days straight and still have about 200 megs left before going over your cap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm running EQ atm on a DSL, its running on average around 1100 bytes/sec between in and out data streams.  At that rate you'd have about 500 hours of play time to reach your cap, or 21 non-stop days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">So what do you plan on doing for the 9 days you can't play????</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zyphyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The 9 days accounts for sleep, bathroom, etc.</div></div><hr />

nah...if I did come back I really would be a casual gamer - got burnt out on the high end game and no real desire to go back to it. Also I don't have the time to play 4-6 hours a night like I used to - grad school eats up my time like nothing on earth.<br />
<br />
Just thinking of creating either a beastlord (a class I wanted to try but never did) or a froglok, which came out soon after I left. I've got some plat and nice twink items to reroll with, was thinking a fungi patch vest, fungi staff, cloak of flames and sceptre of destruction or two would be a good start to either a kitty beasty or a froggy warrior :p <br />
<br />
I would try berzerker (sp?) but I've heard they're gimped to hell and beyond  :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>seventh.Tikoko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">generally EQ sucks only 1kb/s per instance at around 4 or 5 datarate.. its less if youre doing less, more if youre doing more.. the max ive seen used when only using 1 window is about 2kb/s</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>tewdogs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">When I was on a capped plan I never ever went over 3 gig for EQ. <br />
Trivia note: You USA folks might find it amusing that I used to pay $90 per month for 3 gig. Thankfully the competition commision in Australia have recently threatened our monopolising national carrier, enabling the introduction of affordable non capped adsl. 8)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Kaab</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have a 2 gig per month cap and I've never exceeded it, even when I was unemployed and two boxing 50 to 60 hours a week.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I was able to play EQ on my old dialup connection(which was 24k, my phone lines sucked) without any problem. I'd always monitor task manager to watch my bandwidth usage. When I was just fighting or running or talking, whatever, it would stay down less than 10% bandwidth usage. If I zoned, it would jump up to maybe 80%. My zone times were still pretty fast, like maybe 30 secs or so. if any of you math wizards want to figure that out to a roundabout bandwidth usage, feel free ;)<br />
<br />
But you should be able to play EQ on your school account without even coming close to the 2gb usage limit.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">There is no way you will exceed 2GB/mo playing EQ.  And even if you did I seriously doubt your ISP/School is actively monitoring you and will shut you down when you hit that level.  More likely they would look at a printed report and contact you to tell you to cool it.<br />
<br />
The file sharers WILL be hit by the 2 GB/Month limit, and I suspect that's their target.</div></div><hr />

School is doing something pretty cool about that this year - we're running a Napster pilot program where all students are able to use Napster for free - downloading legal music as much as we want. They're planning on keeping bandwidth usage down by caching the 1000 or so most popular downloads on a central campus server. The whole project is being funded jointly by the school and by Napster itself; if it works out well it will become a permanent feature paid for by the Student Assembly at a discounted rate - they figure it'll run about $25 / student / year, included in our activity fees. Too bad we don't get free IPOD's this year like Duke does :mad:<br />
<br />
File sharing such as Kazaa and BitTorrent are allowed, but we've been warned that we're up sh!t creek if RIAA or MPAA comes knocking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">That's a pretty good setup juka.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>dennman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what school is that juka? thats a good positive way to let the students do what they want in a legal win-win way</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">EQ doesnt require full use of even a dial-up connection.  I used to 2-box over a crummy dial-up connection that usually only connected at 28k tops, and it worked fine.<br />
<br />
Zoning took forever tho.</div></div><hr />
