I had a castle group for 10 hours last night keeping one of the courtyards plus the front totally clean and we got....one parchment. This is sick for some of the best exp in the zone.<br />
<br />
Are there any places that tend to drop them more than crawlers/bugs? I only need two but if I only see one per 10 hour grind session I'm going to have AM3 and EQ before I win a roll.</div></div><hr />

Big spiders seem more reliable than underbulks/crawlers</div></div><hr />

There are two spawns every 2 sets of stairs and then 4 of Gryme's guards that are pullable without pulling him.  I heard they also drop deep in the cave.  Otherwise you might want to try other zones for parchments.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't seem to matter where or what you are fighting. Its definately feast or famine though.</div></div><hr />

There's a camp I like to take that I call 3 hut.  If you keep running along the right wall, you'll get to a point where there is a Wretched pusling hut in front of you, a corruptor hut a little behind and to the right, and just a little further to the right is another hut of wretcheds.  With really good groups, you can pull all 3 huts and have constant pulls.  With decent or mediocre groups, I stick to just the wretcheds, and take my time to make sure I don't get adds.  They have never resisted my harmony, although the pulling is a little wiggy and you'll get the occasional add when you shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Hunted there 3 times, and have always had parchements drop.  Had 3 in one camp which lasted about 3 or 4 hours or so, including 2 of a single mob.  In my experience, the puslings is MUCH better on parchement drops than castle.<br />
<br />
If you are on Zeb server, stay the hell away from my camp!  I think I&quot;m pretty much the only person who ever takes groups there and I like to keep it that way. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Katalaeia</div><div class="date">11-13-2002, 03:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, as a counter...was in a castle group (again) this past weekend, again about 10 hours...we got 3 parchments, and I finally won one. Grats me on CotR :) I'm gonna stay in 60 and grind out AA for a while so I've got some time to get another one.<br />
<br />
It just seems to be spurty. People on Quellious say that bugs/crawlers are the best rate for parchment drops (or at least the people I ask), and I can't beat the exp without getting flagged for tier 2 planes, so I'll wait and keep grinding.<br />
<br />
No, I'm not on Zeb :p<br />
<br />
We tried puslings one night but letting the warrior pull was a big mistake. These things must have insane aggro because her &quot;single&quot; pull brought like 8 to camp. Ouch...</div></div><hr />

The area described above is where I've pretty much camped for the last week and a half and only seen 5 parchments.  2 from the wretched in the building with the rats and 3 from pestilent pulsings.  The wretched pulsings can summon and hit in the mid 300's the pestilent hit in the low 300's but have a harm touch for around 900dmg. <br />
<br />
I camp there with my druid partner and harmony has not failed yet.  Just the druid and I are able to keep all three buildings clear.  He charms one of the rats, I slow em, DoT from epic and sic my own pet in.   Watching that rat pull out 200 dps is sick.  Good exp in a duo though, they are all over level 55 I believe. <br />
