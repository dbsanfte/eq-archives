<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">First off, I'm assuming there will even be focus 5 effects, like mana preservation 5, an upgrade from mana preservation 4. <br />
<br />
But assuming there will be in OoW, does anyone know if there are plans to put these higher focuses on LDoN augments and Tribute Masters, the same way one can currently get many level 4 focus effects from those two sources.<br />
<br />
I haven't seen mention of this by the developers but perhaps I missed it and you all can fill me in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Focus Effects after Level 65 (http://eqlive.station.sony.com/community/dev_view.jsp?id=63311)<br />
<br />
Try that link.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gummox</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">That link mentions nothing about augments or tribute, and doesn't answer the questions asked.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Tordail Farstryder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Grow up, Gummox. I realize it does not specifically answer his questions, I merely posted it so he'd have perhaps a starting point regarding foci. If you had read his post carefully you would see he assumed there would be level 5 foci put into the game. The post I linked says otherwise -- at least to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes, there are going to be level 5 effects in the game.  I dont think that there will be focus 5 effects added to LDoN just yet, as in the dev chat log it was stated that SOE has no intention of upgrading armors and items for OOW release, though there will be new items added at a later date (currently being evaluated).  <br />
<br />
Its possible that Tribute effects will be added to scale up to focus 5, but I havent read or heard anything about that yet.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">If LDoN augs don't keep up with the need for basic top end focus effects then it will pretty much make LDoN near obsolete for higher levels. I certainly hope they add them soon. I don't expect the exotic best ones to be on LDON but things like spell haste 5 should be definitely.</div></div><hr />
