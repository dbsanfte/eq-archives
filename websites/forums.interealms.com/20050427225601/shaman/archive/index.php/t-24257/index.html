<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kazracr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I made ot 48 in dulak off of the scouts at zone in there easy enough but alot of them are light blue so i was wondering is there a better spot for exp then dulak i tried the hole but was to hard with 2 mobs each pull and i i seemed to have to med mroe then normal. any other hidden spots for decent exp? I have a fungi tunic a jbb and a horse and decently equiped 910 ac and 1500 hps or so unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Parbuc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If I remember correctly you should be able to go to Grimling Forest at your level and camp the area around the tunnel entrance to AC.  There are plenty of mobs there and the exp is steady plus you can sell all those runes for decent plat at a vendor.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Vusum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well i was thinking if memory serves you could do the skellies at the temple in dl.  Or the seafuries in oot is decent with a jbb.  Or if you can grab any decently equiped tank try solb.  Its a hotspot atm so more exp per mob and not too hard to grab a group there if grouping doesn't bug ya.  Or if you get really really hard up for exp grab a tank and muck around in burning woods killing just about anything.  There are some decent spots in there but you might need to grab some cc, bard or chanter will work wonders for ya.  Once you get turgur's hit PoP because then you are actually useful in groups and don't look back.  Hope that helps.<br />
