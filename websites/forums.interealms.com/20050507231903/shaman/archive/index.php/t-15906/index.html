<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just realized I dont know the board that nerco's use the most. Wanted to look at some stuff , can anyone hook me out with where they hang out at?Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>libeck</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Think it's http://necro.eqclasses.com</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Discordja</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I'm not sure what the most common one is but I know http://necro.eqclasses.com has a fairly busy forum.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>eqphreak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">what forum?  There's no link to any forum on that page ...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">thanks for the info :) looks like the ticket.<br />

Eqphreak i think you have to be registered and log in to be able to get to the forums. After i did all that i was able to go to the forums.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">There is a ton of good information in those forums, especially if you're looking for places to hunt. I used it extensively when trying to find good exp spots for my necro twink.<br />
<br />
I also found a significant minority of the posters there to be total *******s. If you think the Shamans Crucible has lost some civility, I would point you to that board as an example of what I hope we don't become. If you think we come down hard on people who maybe should have used the search function first, take a peek at some of the flames on the Necro board.<br />
<br />
I'll leave it to others to discuss the &quot;typical Necromancer player type&quot; versus the &quot;typical Shaman player type.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Wycked Bonecallor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">a couple of the main reasons on the flames on people not useing the search function on the necro boards &quot;and were (kinda) nice to the new people&quot;, is <br />
1, people asking the same fuggin question everyday and geting 30 threads about ti<br />
<br />
2. our boards are privately owned and operated, and funded, our host is gracios &quot;sp?&quot; enophe to do that we don't want to jack his bandwith rate up higher with useless double posts or double threads from different people asking the same question 30 times.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Antmf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The necro board is full of flamers, although there are quite a few that will help you god forbid you ask something and didn't use the search function... You will get eaten up.... I play a 65 necro and I do read the boards alot but hardly post questions because of this. Normally when you see a question that has been asked a million times normal people don't want to waste their time and wont even reply but the people on the necro board not only reply but berate you to boot.Although I love the necro class as much as shaman I do not favor that board. Unfortunately that board has tons of good information on the class heh...<br />
If you must post good luck but beware there are a few sharks in them there waters lol :)</div></div><hr />

  Wouldn't linking them the thread that first answered the question then locking the thread (or just answering him then locking it) save a LOT more bandwidth than 30 some people responding with flames and leaving the guy with STILL no answer so that he posts again in a couple days with a new name?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Zarniwoop</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Actually, a lot of the times they will flame you while sarcastically answering your question (or linking a handful of threads that you would have turned up had you used the search feature). As for whether or not this is effective in encouraging searching or reducing bandwidth, I don't know.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">People bitching about not using search bug me on ANY forum, including this one.    This game is not a new game, and just about any question asked has been asked before.    Why not take the New Post links off of the boards and let people search and only reply to threads?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the posts that get flamed like this will either:<br />
<br />
1) Have 30 related threads show up in a simple search<br />
2) Have 3-4 existing threads visible on the first and/or second page of the forums<br />
3) Be part of the General Info - Read here for answers to questions etc post that is easily found.<br />
<br />
When you have 5 posts on &quot;tell me what to wear!!&quot; + 4 posts on &quot;where do I hunt?&quot; per day you tend to stop taking them seriously and just get pissed off.<br />
<br />
Lots of great info there and lots of great people. You just have to be able to not take **** seriously. If you are a stuck up tight ass who can't take a joke or a flame don't even bother....<br />
