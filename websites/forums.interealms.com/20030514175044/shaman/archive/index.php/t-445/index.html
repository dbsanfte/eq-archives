<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grickk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Can a Shaman kill him and get the boots at anytime or do you have to do this as part of the spear quest and in order?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Each step of the shaman epic requires a faction check.  By the point you get to black dire, you've had several +True Spirit faction hits.  I would suspect that you might not get the boots if you did the quest without having done the prior parts.  On a good note, the parts prior to black dire can be done very quickly.  If you have access to a porter, you can do them in a couple of hours.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can kill him anytime you want, but you can't turn in the pelt for your boots until you've done the previous steps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">What type of a group would be able to take him out? My guild is raiding mistmore in a week, and I would love to be able to kill this guy. What would be a minimum group of people, or even more than 1 group, to take this guy out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Frankly, you could do it with 3 people.  60 tank, cleric, and yourself.  I have a friend that did it solo (60 ogre shaman with JBB and good equipment).<br />
<br />
For lower level groups, I'd recommend 2 groups of low 50's or probably 3 or 4 of 40's.  If you don't have a 60 puller, you get all four of his friends, too.  Before BD spawns, his friends were green to me.  After he spawns, they also respawn a lot stronger (you can't kill them first--they will respawn with BD).<br />
<br />
I'm sure you already know that if he's not up, you have to kill the Advisor to spawn BD.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Carne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">exactly what I was looking for, thanks. Hope we can pull it off, as I am only lvl 31 atm.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kronenbourg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Did black dire with a 52 shaman (me) a 59 monk, 60 wizard and a 52 paladin.  Had no problems at all with that lot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Kieran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&gt; If you don't have a 60 puller, you get all four of his friends, too.<br />
<br />
That's not true; at around 55, I single pulled BD - the blood wolves were all green to me then, and the usual rule of thumb that works for me is that things don't add on a pull if you're 11+ levels higher than them.<br />
<br />
I cleared the area in front of the castle by myself, and cast from there down on Black Dire in the valley - resisted the first slow, but since it took a while for him to run up by the time he arrived the second one was coming in on him. I also didn't get harmtouched when pulling him, perhaps because of some peculiarity of line-of-sight. While the slow landed second time despite no debuffing, every ebolt bounced.<br />
<br />
55 shm, 56 monk, 57 SK, 40 Cleric killed Black Dire with basically no heals needed since he only put out about 1500hp damage before he went down. He has about 10khp, double-hits for 220 max and has a nasty Harmtouch; the main thing for you to worry about is getting him slowed, and if you do have bad resists with slow having a tank that can taunt him off you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Diabalein Avidyia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">killed him today with an assortment of lvl20-50's   he is one bad mofo for a yellow con. and yeah he resisted EVERYTHING I tossed at him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">He is definitly soloable.  If your feeling particularly desperate you can even use an exploit.  If you climb up the ramp to enter the actual castle you can look down from the cliff and see the dire wolf surounded by his posse under you.  Levitate yourself, pull the dire with cancel magic or some other low agro spell and run on top of the castle roof.  The wolf will be unable to hit you and you will be able to cast on him.  Enjoy at your own risk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I wish you didnt mention that on the public message board for every shaman to see, walruss.<br />
<br />
:(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Zool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I killed him pretty easily.<br />
I just asked a 52 pally and a 54 Rogue in the zone for help.  While they were coming I (with pet) pulled the Black Dire with friends.  Dog held them off for 5seconds and took HT and I waited at zone fer em and zoned-out when they came.(zone area was clear)  <br />
<br />
I zoned in 1min later with non-agro Black Dire. Buffed the 2 party member 52 Pally and 54Rogue and me(51shaman) then we killed him.  He resisted 2 slows so I just Healed.<br />
<br />
-Zool.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>BryeLLe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">So is BD a timed or triggered spawn? It seems that for some, he's already there. But maybe that's because someone else killed the advisor previously and BD just happened to be waiting around?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zool</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Hes triggered by the death of that guy the Pallys kill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Killing the advisor spawns black dire.  If he's already up, someone has killed the advisor recently.<br />
<br />
Also, I believe 54 or higher can single pull black dire out of the group of wolves.  Not too hard with some higher level people, probably a group of 2 of 50'ish people.  You don't lose anything by losing to him, except some time, so no harm in trying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Myfistow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I got him at early 50's somewhere, with a higher level Shaman and Paladin (both mid to upper 50's).<br />
<br />
Shammy friend was able to land a slow on it, it came solo, and the Pally tanked it.<br />
<br />
BD dead.  Took a minute or two.  We might have healed the Pally once or twice, nothing major.  Total cakewalk.</div></div><hr />
