<br />
----------------------<br />
<br />
4/11/2002<br />
<br />
Samin's house was broken into while he and his wife were at work. <br />
<br />
The thieves broke a window and enter the back door. They ransacked<br />
my bedroom, tearing everything out of it's place. Took most of my <br />
guns, my wife's jewelry, and some personal items. Among those<br />
my social security card, my humidor w/2 cuban cigars in it, arg!<br />
<br />
On the up side, they did not hurt my two chihuahuas which were<br />
inside at the time.<br />
<br />
Things they overlooked, *scratches head*, my watch ($250),<br />
my new dvd player, my stereo, 100 bucks in an envelope on my dining<br />
table, various other easy to carry things worth lots.<br />
<br />
My only guess is they were after quick cash, jewelry and guns.<br />
<br />
Tis a sad night here, after working all day, having to cope and clean up<br />
this mess. What is the world coming to? Btw, I live in a rather smallish<br />
city in a more rural neck of the city at that. <br />
<br />
Crime knows no bounderies I guess.<br />
<br />
Oh well, time to make phone calls, cancel stuff, get new stuff, etc.<br />
<br />
I thank the heavens above for my dogs safety though. <br />
<br />
Word to everyone.<br />
Get insurance NOW! I thank goodness I have it.<br />
Get security system.<br />
Get deadbolts, etc.<br />
Always be aware before entering your home.<br />
<br />
:( :( :( :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
It will be awhile before your lives return to normal.  You'll find that it will be difficult to sleep, as the sense of security you once felt in your own home will suffer for quite awhile.  I'm not saying that to freak you out, that's just the way it is.  It's normal.<br />
<br />
Also, not to freak you out, but I have suggestion:<br />
Throw away your toothbrushes and other personal items and get new ones.  (this is due to a possible urban legend, but you never know what sick people will do).<br />
<br />
The whole situation sucks, I'm sorry it had to happen to you. :(</div></div><hr />

I worked for an insurance company in the auto claims division. Morons would break into someones car.. try to get the stereo out, fail and then steal the change from the console.. duh..<br />
<br />
Check me out! I stole 43¢ and a stick of gum!</div></div><hr />

Best of luck.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to hear about it though Samin.</div></div><hr />

I agree you should replace your toothbrush and stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your story reminds me of when my grandmother's house was broken into. They stole the 5-year-old VCR, the black&amp;white TV, and her electric typewriter - all easily replaceable. They left over  a hundred thousand dollars in jewlery, African art and European crystal completely untouched.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There're two types of thieves, your typical low lives and more professional thieves.  The former tends to take things that are hard to trace and easy to liquidate.  In Myrea's case, that's the type that seemed to be doing.  This type also tends to be more dangerous in terms of hurting the occupants of the house, because they're much more jumpy and scared.<br />
<br />
The latter one seems to be what happened to Samin, or those who are starting to be professionals.  They tend to steal things that they know they can sell in the black market, hence the guns and jewelry, as well as tends to be in and out within 5 mins.  If only guns are stolen, likely they were just some dumb kids, but if someone takes jewelry, they'd damned better have some underground connections to sell those things to.  Guns, Jewelry tends to fall into those category.   However, the latter category tends to be less shaky and thus less likely to hurt people.  They're out for cash, not to hurt people.</div></div><hr />

Do it now.  Identity theft may be part of the goal here.  If you think the material things are tough to lose, imagine losing your credit, your name being drug through the dirt, and having creditors suing you and winning for claims on purchases you never made.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 10:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Samin, real sorry about the thefts and the violation of your secure home and privacy.<br />
<br />
But I want to bring up another subject (which I am sure some of you will flame at me for doing so):<br />
They ransacked my bedroom...Took most of my guns.<br />
<br />
I am suprised this has not disturbed anyone else but me.  I am bothered that several more guns have just entered the underground criminal economy, to be used for criminal and nefarious purposes.  If Samin had never owned these guns, the criminals would not have these additional guns, and whatever future heinous crimes may (or will) be committed with these guns may not have otherwise occured.  Sadly, I do feel that the originator of these guns do bear some degree of responsibility for their future misuse by the criminal underground.<br />
<br />
The fact that Samin lost control of his guns to the criminal underground I think sends yet another message on the problems of private ownership of guns.<br />
<br />
You may think that this &quot;chain of responsibility&quot; legal theory is farfetched.  However, in other areas of &quot;responsible care&quot;, this legal theory has a firm legal and doctrinal basis.  For example, if a chemical company produces a toxic material (dangerous to people or environment), the chemical company is ALWAYS held at least partially responsible for the safe, clean destruction/disposal of the material....even if the material is sold and the new owner mishandles it...even if the material is sold to a licensed disposal company which illegally dumps it (e.g Monsanto and Times Beach).  Responsible care legal theory is also firmly in place in medical malpractice, accounting malpractice and transportation legalities.<br />
<br />
Samin, please tell me the guns were originally locked in a safe or other type of theft-resistant cabinet (which at least shows you made the effort of responsible care)?<br />
<br />
Oh yes, one more thing.  I am not a gun-hater.  Nor am I a gun-owner.  I do believe a man (or woman) has the right to defend their family, home and property, whichincludes gun ownership.  But, I also believe a gun owner carries an extra onus of responsibility, which  *especially*  includes making sure more guns don't get into the hands of criminals.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jaraxel</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm against guns in general.... /real/ merits of combat are done with HTH combat...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tevyn</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have to disagree Locz (surprised? I think not....) If someone stole your truck that you had locked up in your garage, would you feel responsible or be held liable or accountable if whoever stole it used it as a get-away vehicle? If someone steals your credit card and uses it to purchase a gun that he uses to comit crimes, are you not then just as liable as Samin? There's a BIG difference between your examples and gun ownership. In every one of your examples, the responsibility was placed on the shoulders of people or companies who explicitely manufatured or provided services for the consumption of others that were potentially hazardous. Samin's gun ownership is for his own consumption and nobody else's.<br />
<br />
In all honesty, there's really only so much you can do. Ever tried to hide something from a child? You can't do it. Where there's a will, there's a way. Yeah, you can make it more difficult by locking the guns up in a gun cabinet, but I guarantee that if someone really wants those guns, they're going to get them no matter where you keep them and how you keep them locked up.<br />
<br />
Samin, Sorry for your loss and your experience. I strongly agree with Micheall. Report the SS card ASAP, and change anything anyplace that you used your SS number, i.e. bank accounts, credit cards, hunting licenses, etc. EVERYTHING. Also, make a very detailed report of the guns that were stolen. You don't wan't to become a suspect later on down the road.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Locz if you want to bring this issue up in another thread in another time please do, so I can rip you up one side and down the other.<br />
<br />
But harping on a subject as hot as this in time when Samin has enough stress already is low, inconsiderate, and in general uncalled for.<br />
<br />
Go take your soapbox elsewhere at another time when someone's feelings are not running high already and at a time when someone is not feeling vulnerable.<br />
<br />
Swear some people have no consideration of others.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Locz</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Tevyn:  If, for example, I kept explosives in my bedroom, and they were stolen, would I be responsible?  Answer:  Yes, partially.  It is irresponsible to keep explosives in your bedroom.  Guns are no different, they both kill directly.<br />
<br />
Your example of a credit card or getaway vehicle are misdirections.  A credit card is not a weapon.  A credit card is multiple steps displaced from a weapon (visit a weapon seller, use card for purchase, take receipt of said weapon...that's 3 steps displaced).  Nor is a vehicle a weapon (excepting intentional collisions).  A vehicle is displaced mutliple steps from a weapon in that it has to be stolen...and used to transport a third-party weapon from one location to another.   The guns on the other hand...are weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I did say I was very sorry Samin's home had been violated.  And I do understand the stress he has been through.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Telumehtar Ben'Kiriath</div><div class="date">04-12-2002, 11:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think you are missing the point... another thread and another TIME... <br />
<br />
If you want to come back to this topic in a few weeks after Samin has had time to get things straightened out and won't feel like a debate will somehow be a beating on him personally then I'd be glad to take you on but NOW is just not the proper time for this.<br />
<br />
If Samin is indifferent and states so then bring it up sooner but I'm not inclined to debate over a subject which at the moment hits a little too close to home for someone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When I was a kid I was visiting my mom, and she went to work one morning, leaving me home alone (I was... 12 I think). Well, apparently some theif had been watching the place but hadn't noticed that I was visiting and broke in while I was sleeping (between 8 am and 11 am) and went through the place... took moms jewelry, the TV, two cameras, the stereo, the microwave, and a sewing machine. Also an Igloo cooler and the entire contents of the freezer, and a pad of sketch paper with my charcoal drawings on it.  *scratches head*<br />
<br />
I didn't notice the TV gone until my mom came home after I asked her where the hell the microwave went. The room the jewelry was taken from was across the hall from the room I was sleeping in.</div></div><hr />

She has slept through sirens and ambulances showing up next door to take one of our neighbors to the hospital (heart attack, made it) the cats running back and forth (playing with each other and yowling loudly) across her sleeping form several times, and my stubbing my toe brutally and ranting and raving about her moving the furniture around.  <br />
<br />
Of course if I open a box of chocolates with three closed doors between us she is up and there immediately to chide me for eating something bad for me (you remember I'm diabetic of course) and ask if she can have one or more.</div></div><hr />
