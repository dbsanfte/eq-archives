<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">It seems like every single one of them is played by someone who's 13 IRL. I've yet to group with a single one that was at all good at following directions, not breaking mez/sheep, or understanding rules like &quot;everyone pass on bind on pickup so we can determine who should get it&quot;. 2 nights ago we had the 20sta staff from Uldaman get looted by a hunter of all people because they thought everyone was passing on it. And just yesterday, I got suckered into helping some people in a SM run and no matter how many times I yelled at him, the hunter wouldn't assist the warrior and kept breaking my succubus' seduce.<br />
<br />
What is it that draws this cesspool of horrible players to one class? is it the disgusting 'cuteness' of taking care of a pet and being able to name it? I just don't get it.<br />
<br />
I hate to blacklist a whole class, but if I group with another Tauren hunter with a gorilla pet named &quot;monkeyboy&quot; it'll be too damn soon.<br />
<br />
Edit: thanks Valgoth, fixed &quot;tauren hunter&quot; haha. Posting on the shaman board, so my brain had some sort of screwup.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I must agree for the most part, only non-guildie we had on a dungeon crawl the other night, 60- hunter, 2500 friggin hps, thought he was the cheese, he sucked and slowed us down.<br />
<br />
You know there are good ones, but it is hands down the easiest class to solo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yeh, all classes have there share of dipsh!ts, and the ease of soloability definitely draws more to Hunters than any other class it seems.<br />
<br />
Soon we'll be saying the same thing about Rogues, or Shaman. A few weeks ago it was Pallies.<br />
<br />
Personally, I consider myself an exceptional Hunter (and only 2400'ish HP's). Ya just gotta know when to plink off that big agro magnet nuke and when not to. And if you do get agro, ya have to be smart enough to know how to get out of it. I do.<br />
<br />
Never had a complaint yet.<br />
I hate to blacklist a whole class, but if I group with another Tauren Shaman with a gorilla pet named &quot;monkeyboy&quot; it'll be too damn soon.I think we just identified your problem. Those damned Shaman trying to tame pets and impersonate Hunters...gives us all a bad name! :)</div></div><hr />

Hah, I'm 46 and am just shy of 3k.... and I'm wearing some pretty crappy stuff.<br />

<br />
Exceptional hunter here.  Level 56, Hellscream server.  Must have been my years of training as a shaman.  I'm not the highest level hunter in my guild, but I get plenty of compliments and groups.  That said, I don't usually play with non-guildies, but yeah, some of the hunters I've run into have been clueless.  Just check the hunter boards, misinformation runs rampant.  If you want to play with a great hunter some time, just log on to Hellscream and give me a whisper.  We have 4-5 in guild that will impress you.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and hp means little to a good hunter.  If played right, we almost never get hit, FD, disengage, wingclip, and a big @ss bear/cat to tank for us.  Agi &gt; HP, we are a ranged dps class.  :)<br />
<br />
BTW, nice build Val.  I'll be 60 soon enough.  Love the class.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The main complaint I have with Hunters is they seem to be aggro magnets. On raids there is one or two that CONSTANTLY pull aggro off the tank. No idea what they are doing but they end up dying a lot or using all the priests mana.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Its trendy to hate hunters.  Paladins are so 3 weeks ago.  Seems to always follow a major nerfing, because the nerfed class always starts complaining loudly, which people then percieve as whining..... you know this dance, right?<br />
<br />
Like all classes there are good and bad players.  Aggro control is a basic MMORPG skill.  If you ping-pong, you suck, go practice.  If you can't control your pet, you suck, go practice.  Hunters have little excuse to ping-pong with feign death.  The way threat works in WoW needs work anyway, however.  Rogues steal aggro way too much also, which says to me that tank classes need more threat tools.  <br />
<br />
Then of course there is the neverending greed issue: &quot;OMG a ranger rolled on THAT?&quot;  - oops wrong game and class, same complaint.  <br />
<br />
I find the general supply of clueless people is quite high in WoW as a whole (thx diablo), but the class distribution seems pretty even to me.  Hunter soloability probably increases the number of morons who make it to high levels though.  If you encounter a stupid one, boot them from your group/raid.  Its not like they provide anything essential, and they are about 3rd or 4th now on the list of good DPS classes.  I feel fortunate to be included any time I join a raid.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">This has nothing to do with nerfing. I'm just noticing a trend of hunters having a higher RQ (Retard Quotient)<br />
<br />
Paladin hate I can understand. I simply hate them because they're annoying, not because they are necessarily powerful or not. Still, seeing one charge into a group of three +2s in Tanaris, kill the named for the same quest I'm doing, then simply run away from the others is kind of dicouraging.<br />
<br />
How were hunters nerfed? Other than some stupid change that affects those spiders from blackrock spire by 0.4dps.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">1) Snarler, level 42 named Wolf use to have +100 to all resists - NERFED: No longer has resists.<br />
<br />
2) Fire Roc, bird that use to have +240 Fire Resist - NERFED: No longer has resists.<br />
<br />
3) Spire Spiderling, use to have 1.0 attack speed (.77 if spec'd properly) - NERFED: Now has 1.5 attack speed.<br />
<br />
4) Sandfury Guardians, unique looking elite snake mobs in Zul'Farak  - NERFED: Anyone who had one tamed logged in to simply find them gone, even after Blizz said they were just disabling the ability to feed them.<br />
<br />
5) Ammo Pouch / Quiver Attack Speed Bonus &quot;bug&quot; - since beta they were giving double their intended attack speed. Ranged weapon DPS was adjusted in beta to compensate because they were unable to identify the cause.  - NERFED: Now give correct Attack Speed bonus, but ranged weapons were not adjusted to address the DPS deficit the bug fix created. This one bug alone is why we're no longer &quot;the&quot; top ranged DPS class. Granted, I don't believe we were intended to be that anyways, considering we get pets. A built in tank AND the top ranged DPS class? Sorry, the peeps who believe that were living in a pipe dream with blinders underneath those rose colored glasses.<br />
<br />
6) Several buffs that increase attack power work on all other classes EXCEPT HUNTERS after they fixed a bug with Aspect of the Hawk not applying correctly after another Apect was cast. Had to remove buff, unequip weapon, reequip weapon, recast AotH. Please note that these attack buffs USE to work. The fact that they don't now is either a new bug introduced by sloppy coding, or a nerf. You choose.<br />
<br />
Shall I continue? The Hunter community has earned the right to be angry over some of these. Let's not even get into the issue of bugs they've acknowledged, but would rather work on adding &quot;/golfclap&quot; to the game than fixing (pet run speed bug after being snared anyone?). Which, btw, King B, Takk, et al are rumored to be next on the chopping block due to a revamp of how pets work, and how we'll be able to customize them with pet &quot;talents&quot; (if you will) by spending all of those accumulated training points they have saved up.<br />
<br />
1, 2, 3 and 4 allowed for a modicum of pet uniqueness in that they were situationally useful. I feel bad for the people who tamed Snarler and leveled him to 60 only to find him no better than any other Wolf model out there, actually worse in some cases.<br />
<br />
5 and 6 are both just damned sloppy coding.<br />
<br />
Even so, the good ones learned to overcome and adapt. I have, and still enjoy my Hunter better than any other class (and yes, I've tried them all).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Hey, bad pet pathing affects Locks as much as, if not more than you guys. Burning a soul shard every time I use an elevator, or having to stop for 5 seconds out of every minute or so for the pet to keep up is seriously retarded.<br />
<br />
When they 'nerfed' the delay on the spire spiderling, they upped the damage per hit so it's basically the same dps, did they not?<br />
<br />
Regarding sloppy coding, Shadowburn is supposed to give a soulshard if you get the killshot with an exp-yielding target, but it never gives one if you have a shard in your backpack (the one you start with, the 16 slot one), and only about 80% of the time if you don't, simply because it's buggy. It costs a soulshard to cast, for an instant nuke the same ratio as our normal nuke, and still inferior in any way to shaman shocks. go figure.<br />
<br />
Not necessarily a bug, but just wretched game design,  the 8 debuff limit will kick off effects in a first in, first out format. Having a 600 damage curse of agony or a critical debuff like Curse of Shadow/Elements get overwritten by some warrior's deep wounds is really encouraging.<br />
<br />
Pet resists are kind of a sensitive subject. I'm not saying that pets should have no resistances, but the only one of mine that has resists is the felhunter, which is specifically anti-caster. All the others have 0 across the board, or -75 shadow/arcane i the case of infernal/doomguard due to the *requirement* to keep curse of shadows on during the charming.<br />
<br />
Then there's the current enslave bug, which took massive effort on behalf of the community to even get the dev eyes to see it. Currently, the first enslave works as normal, but any enslaves afterwards break within 30 seconds. I even tried it on level 25ish demons in Ashenvale (22 levels below me) with curse of shadows on. First enslave lasted 5 minutes, the 2nd broke after 30 seconds like clockwork. All we got is a &quot;we're looking into it&quot; ... so basically, our two engame pets are completely UNUSABLE right now.<br />
<br />
From this side of the fence you guys seem pretty well off bug-wise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
pvp server, hps = key. Low hp hunter, means I hardly have to even work hehe.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I group with a hunter in my guild every day and have him well trained.  I also feel, in general, from a player quality viewpoint, Hunters are the EQ Druids of WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
High agi = more chance of a crit and higher crit damage. I guarantee if I see you first you won't have a chance to get to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I guarantee if I see you first you won't have a chance to get to me.That's pretty much a given between Hunters, Rogues, and Mages. Whoever gets the drop wins.<br />
<br />
Also, high AGI equates into pretty decent armor, which means higher mitigation. I've got higher armor than several 2H Shaman I know. Of course their spells do considerably more damage than a Hunters, so even encounters with them usually end up with whoever got the first shot wins.<br />
<br />
And Krup, Hunters are only vocal right now since we were the most recent to receive the nerfenema. Prior to the last patch the Hunter community was pretty complaisant. A few weeks ago it was Paladins all in an uproar. Next week it'll be another class. Get use to it.<br />
<br />
But calling Hunters the &quot;EQ Druids of WoW&quot; is just off the mark. Then again, I'm sure you'll dub next weeks nerf candidates the same thing when they become vocal. Just cross your fingers it won't be your class, because you won't have a leg to stand on and will have no justification to complain after your condemnation of another class being vocal about negative changes to their class. Good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Krup</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Actually Val, I called them the EQ Druids of WoW because:<br />
1. Folks new to the game viewed them as easy to play and a shortcut to higher levels<br />
2. They are ridiculously easy to solo - even poorly<br />
3. They solo so much they tend to be played horribly in groups<br />
<br />
They are the EQ Druids of WoW.  There were exceptions in EQ as I'm sure there are in WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, back when I was 56ish we were running through Maraudon for some people and the 60 hunter got aggro on every pull.  <br />
<br />
This was with me pulling out every trick in the book to generate threat.  I finally gave up and let him tank while the priest (my wife :)) got mad at me because hunters are ****ty tanks.<br />
<br />
I later found out he did this all on purpose since it was an easy instance for us, but clearly shows how possible it is for a hunter.<br />
<br />
(As a side note, for those of you who say that your warrior brother/friend/guildmate is so great that he can hold aggro on 18 mobs and no matter what you do you can't get aggro off of him?  I call BS on that as usual, you are full of it... warriors can get and hold aggro well, but it's not perfect.  If when you try, you can't get aggro, you are not that good :))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like all the hunter posts... waiting for you to name something that wasn't a bug fix or wasn't intended to begin with that you all took advantage of.  No  sympathy, just like for pallies and SotC and whatever other class that had bug fixes.<br />
<br />
Waa waa, Blizzard never said pets can't have resists or we weren't supposed to have haste items stacking...waaa waaa.<br />
<br />
Most hunters I've spoken to have seen a dps reduction in the add-ons that calculate such things, but in practice, it didn't seem as bad as everyone thought it was going to be.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Honestly, I can't argue any of those points. Though I don't know if the new players see them as &quot;easy&quot; because as a new player they'd really have no point of reference to draw upon, unless they had played other classes to a sufficiently high enough level to make a comparison. But then they're not &quot;new&quot; players, are they?<br />
<br />
Perhaps it's the &quot;fun factor&quot; built into Hunters that make them so appealing to those &quot;new players&quot;. The ability to tame unique looking pets (vs what Warlocks get at least) along with decent melee (during the lower levels) AND the ability to do decent ranged damage. All three of those add up to a whole lot of fun very soon after creating your first character.<br />
<br />
Points 2 and 3, again I can't argue. Played with even a modicum of common sense a Hunters survivability when the sh!t hits the fan is far greater than any other class. Let the pet take the beating while we either flee or FD. Yes, we have a 'get out of jail free' card. A couple of them as a matter of fact.<br />
<br />
I suppose I've never really been subjected to the point you make in #3 though. I solo alot, yes. But I also duo with my wife more than I solo as well as grouping with guildies. I know the nuances of my class and what I can bring to a group. I'm also willing to prove the doubters wrong. All it takes is saving a complainers ass once (usually) to get them to change their tune. But I understand that may not be the norm.<br />
<br />
So, ok, yeh, I see your point, sort of. But you'll just have to understand why I'm sensitive to the less than favorable perception my class seems to be subjected to on a daily basis. I consider myself a good player. Not the best mind you, but good enough that I don't add to that perception. We may be 'few and far between' though.<br />
<br />
One thing I'm pretty sure of though, Hunters who use to play Shaman in EQ are probably more prone to being the 'good' type than the bad. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">or we weren't supposed to have haste items stacking...waaa waaa.Just like all the other ingorant responses by an obviously uninformed person.<br />
<br />
I never said anything about &quot;stacking&quot;. There were TWO fixes to pouches/quivers. Get your facts straight.<br />
<br />
One was an exploit that needed to be fixed. This involved having both a pouch and a quiver in your inventory, thereby &quot;stacking&quot; the haste given by each. I never utilized this exploit.<br />
<br />
The second of the &quot;fixes&quot; was where a single pouch or quiver was still giving double the intended attack speed bonus. So any Hunter who used a SINGLE pouch or quiver was receiving double the bonus even if they didn't use the exploit I mentioned above.<br />
<br />
Back in beta ranged weapons (guns, bows, crossbows) had their DPS reduced to compensate since they weren't able to identify why Hunters were doing so much damage. When they finally found the cause and corrected it (the 3/22 patch), they failed to go back and remove the DPS reduction on ranged weapons they had originally implemented as a bandaid to their poor coding.<br />
<br />
Also, people had posted asking about certain pet attributes and were responded to by Blizz reps with &quot;working as intended&quot; (paraphrased of course), only later to have them do a complete reversal and change those very things they were told were working properly.<br />
<br />
So again, get your facts straight. It always amazes me how someone who doesn't play the class feels they know enough about it to make such ridiculous posts/claims as yours.<br />
<br />
I also said I adapted and still play my Hunter. Did I see a reduction in DPS? Yes, a slight one. Did it affect my playstyle or fun? No, not in the least. Did I have one of the nerfed pets? No, but I do have Bangalash who blue have said &quot;should&quot; have his fast approach speed on attack in the past, but are now saying &quot;we're not so sure about that&quot;. Will it affect me if he gets nerfed? No, at least not to the point it will ruin my enjoyment. There are other pets out there, and right now I'm using a Pridewatcher that I like better anyways.<br />
<br />
Regardless of how I've approached these changes, others aren't as easily adapted or accepting of change. Nothing Blizz has done has &quot;destroyed&quot; the class, but that doesn't change the fact that what was once condoned and approved to be &quot;working as intended&quot; by Blizzard has recently been changed and people are reacting. It's a common occurance in MMOG's. Humans don't like change. It's our nature.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said (which agreed with your &quot;it didn't seem as bad as everyone thought it was going to be&quot; position), it didn't really have much of an effect on me, or anyone else with even a smidge of knowledge in playing the class.</div></div><hr />

be surprised what sprint/vanish can do, even if hit with a dot sting/concussion, I usually manage to close with a hunter. I can say that I have never lost to a hunter when I started at full health, ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Agility at the expense of stamina means you die, period. I see every other rogue, hunter out there so loaded with agility they think they are King Tut, hit em twice they are fleeing for their lives.</div></div><hr />

He was ofcourse a legend back on Everquest having had the highest HP warrior on the server back at the beginning of Luclin, with skills to boot.<br />
<br />
I feel a hunter in a group is an excellet measure of how much skilled a player really is. Play bad and you suck, play good and you dont suck.<br />

They're still screwed item-wise though, being the last class implemented.</div></div><hr />

Let's just drop it. Neither of us need the headache. We're both skilled players in our own rights. I'd never try to tell you how to play a Warrior, though you clearly have at least a base understanding of playing a Hunter by ways of you 31 alt.<br />

Regardless, I think we can both agree that  with your last statement...&quot;special olympics&quot;. :)<br />

Thanks for the levity. This thread needed it. :)<br />

I'm sure I would have been extremely mad about the patch if I were you too (if hunter was my main).  I shouldn't have been so derogatory.<br />
<br />
They should change bow/gun dps to account for the haste bug fix, I agree with that for sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Just a short note on the issue of hunter aggro.  Yes, being a dps class, we can pull aggro if not careful.  However, that is obviously one of the differences between a good hunter and a wanna-be.  I'm full Marks spec with 335 agi unbuffed (360 usually since I am an alchemist), and put out some decent dps without having the buffed up pet of a Beast spec.  I have to manage aggro well or I end up in melee all the time.  Guess what, over 56 levels, I've gotten pretty darn good at it.  If a warrior can't hold aggro as well as my unbuffed pet, then the group has bigger problems than me.  Fortunately, I rarely run into this situation.<br />
<br />
Oh, and since most folks play on PvE servers, agi &gt; hp is the rule for MOST hunters.  But I agree Mill, if I was on a PvP server, I'd certainly pay more attention to hp.  As an alchemist, I always have a bag full of ac buff and health/mana potions in addition to Mongoose (+25 agi and +2% to crit), and with First Aid at 300, heavy runecloth bandages and FD, I can drop out of combat and self bandage for 2000 hp in 8 secs.  Since Freezing Trap will hold any mob or foe for up to 20 secs, and even scatter shot lasts for 4 secs, if I have to have a heal, I can get one, just about any time.  Heck, I can even down a Limited Invulnerability pot (6 secs) or invisibility pot (18 secs) and get out of a tight spot.  So in essence, my hp pool is much bigger than 2500 and my overall survivability is much higher than you would suspect.<br />

A good hunter should be the last to die.</div></div><hr />

hunters are an amazingly powerful class, I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would bitch about then. mail armor, almost rogue dps, at range, powerful pet, a good hunter should almost never die. there is a reason it is the most populous class out of all of em.</div></div><hr />

You might want to take a look at the server list hehe.Just a little over half the servers are PVP, so I'd think it's pretty balanced actually. Though the game had a larger draw of former PVP players simply due to the fact that, well....it's a BLIZZARD game. :)<br />
<br />
/edit:<br />
<br />
PVP - 47<br />
PVE - 42<br />
RP - 7<br />
<br />
So actually, if you count the RP servers as &quot;non PVP&quot;, PVE servers make up slightly more than half. Even so, the PVP servers are, by far, the most crowded.<br />
hunters are an amazingly powerful class, I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would bitch about then.See my reference to &quot;humans hate change&quot;. Especially change perceived as negative, which many of the changes in the 3/22 patch most definitely were. They don't see the future pet enhancments (which I'm REALLY looking forward to myself). They choose to focus on only the negative aspects.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Indeed griz that does mean the new spider has the same dps but they didn't use it fore the dps. The fast hit rate meant two things:<br />
<br />
1/ More interupts - its the frequency of hits not how hard they are that makes for a lot of interupts. <br />
<br />
2/ The ability spirit bond - Last ability in the beat mastery talent tree. Every time your pet strikes an enemy, you gain 20 health. Lasts for 30 seconds. 1.5 versus 1.0 attack rate clearly makes a HUGE difference for this ability. More hits means more health restored. <br />

anyways I agree warlocks do have a lot of bugs :)</div></div><hr />

Only time my pet engages in combat is when I solo (or duo with wife), or when he's not relegated to covering the healers ass. :) If there's no healer in the group, he's still on passive and only does what I TELL him to do, WHEN I tell him to do it.

Uhmmm.  If you know he is going to FD, why are you healing him?  Might happen the first time, but after confirming that he will FD if taking damage, I'd stop healing him.  That way, the tank, if he has been generating any aggro, will get the mob, not you.  If FD fails, feel free to give the hunter a heal, since he will need one at that point, and you can do so without risking getting hit.  Heaven forbid the priest gets hit.<br />
<br />
A good hunter only goes FD when he is sure that the right person will get the aggro.  Better the hunter die than the healer.  Then again, good hunters are the last to die.  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually Free Action pots are great for all classes, but especially hunters, since just about every class can root or snare up close.   Yeah, you may avoid wingclip's snare/root, but you'll still get dazed for 4 secs by my scatter shot.   Long enough for me to run and get some shoting space, drink a pot, or bandage for 1000hp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
true, but they have to bust through 4300 hps before I close, if I do, they are dead, no ifs, ands, or buts. I havent used free action pots yet, it is about time I think, druid root can be annoying as hell.<br />
<br />
Obviously stealth factors in here, if a 60 hunter who knows what he is doing cathes me at max range, I would have to say I am dead, that is the whole trick though, don't let them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">Im pretty sure Free action pots make you immune to daze as well. I know you are immune to stun, root and snares.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's actually a very good question.  Don't think I've ever had scatter shot not work, but maybe the folks were not using free action pots?  Most melee's think that once they get in melee range the hunter is dead, so they don't prepare properly for scatter shot or wing clip.  The description says stun and movement impairing effects, so I assume daze is not included.  However, we all know how accurate their descriptions are.

Your hunter was either very silly or not prepared.  As has been said, against a Druid, outside, you are nuts if you don't have free action potions.  yeah, the new and improved Druids are tricky, but not unbeatable.  My RL buddy and GL is a comparable level Druid, and we dual all the time.  I actually win more than I lose, however, the recent Druid buffs and Hunter nerfs have made it much more of a challenge.  I guess I just have a lot of practice (I just remind him that I'm a better player, always goes over real well).</div></div><hr />

dueled a top equipped druid while waiting for a dungeon, he had crazy gear. Very good jumpy jumpy player too, made full use of forms, roots, etc. First time, with my abilities all hot, beat him pretty easily, second time he beat me, it was very, very close, final root I was plinking away with arrows and almost had him, but he mana potted and moonfired me.<br />
<br />
Hunters, if they are prepared, are tough, but only a friggin moron would annouce his presense to a hunter, dueling is not an indication of skill either, when a rogue duels, they know where you are, and that is your primary survival skill. Would be like me starting a duel in the hunters face.</div></div><hr />

Late reply.  I see where you are coming from Val, however, the dazed and stunned behavior in game is different and distinct.  Stunned, a mob stands there, dazed, they walk around without purpose.  Since they are still moving I considered dazed as being treated differently.  However, as I mentioned, I have not tested, so I will do so to confirm.  Good stuff, thx.</div></div><hr />

I guess you are right.  I should make a macro to whisper to each hunter in the middle of a fight, where often multiple people are taking damage, as follows:<br />
<br />
Uriah to Hunter X:  Are you going to FD now since you stole aggro, or should I heal you?  Please answer real fast.  <br />
<br />
Or, I guess I should just learn my lesson and never heal hunters.  I mean, not too many hunters are going to confirm in advance that they don't need me healing them in an instance.  <br />
<br />
Often they get aggro in multiple add scenarios, and freely shed the adds they aggro, who get on me even without healing the hunter, since I'm usually casting on someone.  Then they pop up and start on another mob without recognizing one or two is beating on me.  Fade does jack if no one else has tagged the mob.  Or the mage doing AE takes another couple of licks, which isn't much of an improvement.  <br />
<br />
I don't mind some hits, but a lot of hunters have no clue how aggro is working in multiple mob fights and they don't pay attention to cloth wearers.  This is true for a lot of classes in WoW, as aggro management is often pretty weak (particularly in pick up situations) but hunters stand out.  <br />

Gart, my point was simple.  If you find yourself in a pick up group and a hunter FDs and causes you physical discomfort, then ask him if he plans to do that everytime he gets hit, or would he prefer that you heal him.  One or the other.  I would imagine that given this exchange, a. the hunter will stop using FD or b. he will do it again and you will not heal him for the rest of the night.<br />
<br />
OK, I'm not a healer, but that's about what I would do to any player of any class that was putting the healer in jeapardy.  Oh, and I never said anything about priests, but I agree with ya.</div></div><hr />

The situations will rarely be that cut and dried.  Or at least the predictability isn't that cut and dried.  <br />
<br />
In some multi-mob situations the hunter will need to FD, and in some he absolutely should not.  Often it may depend on how bad the tank or the mage is getting waxed.  I may or may not have time to heal the hunter.  And I may or may not need him to grab adds heading for me (or who would head for me).  I do not believe you can simply dictate that in advance and be effective.  <br />
<br />
The hunter has to be alert and make the right decision at the time.  <br />
<br />
Your advice would cover some situations, but I just don't think it's really practical.  <br />
<br />
Damage spikes a lot in this game, more so than healing in EQ I think.  Priests are really down on using a 4 second heal because they believe it's way to slow in combat to be effective.  This is often true, although I do use it when I think I can.  In contrast, EQ clerics far more frequently would use a 10 second heal.  <br />
<br />
I often feel like I'm healing as I would with a shaman in EQ, more so than feeling like I'm playing a cleric - even though I am a priest.</div></div><hr />

I have not tested Free Action potions against scatter shot yet, should be able to tonight.  However, I did find this response to a druid issue on FrostShock which talks to &quot;daze&quot; effects.  Seems to imply that Free Action potions will not help you against &quot;daze&quot; attacks, but still needs to be tested.  For what it's worth, below is the post by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Shapeshifting to Escape Movement-Impairing Effects  What Should Work and What Shouldnt<br />
<br />
&quot;Many of you have expressed concern about the Shamans Frost Shock and the Mages frost spells. The slow effect remains on a Druid even after shapeshifting. This is not acting as intended and should be fixed in time. The Daze effect, however, is not meant to be removed by this act. The thought behind escaping through shapeshifting is that your physical form is difficult to hold through entangling. The philosophy is similar with polymorph in that the Druid has greater control over his physical form and cannot be transformed against his will when in animal form. Even with frost effects, youre changing your shape and shaking off the frost clinging to you. Daze, however, exists to ensure there is some risk from running away -- it is a mechanic in place for balance reasons, and no class can dispel it. The effect is equivalent to a knock on the head and thus would not be dispelled by changing ones form; it is a mental effect rather than a physical one. &quot;</div></div><hr />
