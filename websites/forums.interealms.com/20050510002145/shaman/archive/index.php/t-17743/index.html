<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">told my daughter i was learning magic from playing EQ.<br />
<br />
she was a bit skeptical to say the least.<br />
<br />
i ask her if she would like for me to change the moon's color, and would that be proof of magic.<br />
<br />
we finally agreed that if i could change the color of the moon to red (all the other colors were just &quot;to hard to see at night&quot;) that indeed my magic training on EQ would be for real.<br />
<br />
so, i blew into my hand, made a fist and threw it at the moon.  then looking down at her, i said you know the moon is really far away right? Yes.  well it will take a whole day for my magic to hit it. <br />
