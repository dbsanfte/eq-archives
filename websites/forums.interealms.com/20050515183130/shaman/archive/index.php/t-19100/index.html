Game Description: Sickens your target with a fever, causing #3 damage initially and #2 damage every six seconds for %z. <br />
<br />
Wow, want a fast disease DoT?  Look at the whopping 145 damage per tick.  And talk about efficient, the mana cost is only 393.<br />
<br />
Perhaps they could change the name of the spell to &quot;Plague of Delusion&quot; if they think we want this in its current form.<br />
<br />
Suggested fix:  Make this do 600 damage per tick for 24 seconds with the same mana cost, casting time, and recasting time, and you'll get my attention.</div></div><hr />

Yes, that's right. We are getting a 25% mana reducing focus on this ****ty dot while other classes are getting 25% mana reduction on their main nuke etc.<br />

While this focus effect is completely worthless there is also several focuses that are similiar/better that works on ALL dots that we can cast.<br />

if they werent that clueless they never think up these spells. and i have horrible feeling that now they put a little efforrt into it they wont change it cos they cant afford to take poeple of the next expansion! so they`ll just keep it cos hey it`s done and it`s cheap and most other classes will like it!<br />
<br />
course perhaps someone at sony if a right bastard and having a good laugh, but again i doubt it.<br />
<br />
if the spell line up stays the same and the aa i just wont buy GoD , now if no shamans by GoD, it probably wont affect their perceived success, but hell i bet if there is good content in God (which seem doubtful given their complete lack of sight with shaman) all the uber guilds will complain for us, cos despite it all poeple like shamans on raids if only cos it means they dont have to slow.. and malos still pretty good. <br />

- Unfortunately that will never happen because 90% of EQ players are clueless and they think that a shaman is God's gift to groups. Shamans weren't a solo only class like druids a year or more ago, they were very often with groups. And even if a shaman wouldn't do a thing for a group, people would still want them because we can solo Yeldema and we have AGI buff.</div></div><hr />

I have played a Shaman for 2 years. I have bought every expansion so far. I will NOT buy this one until they put something in it worth buying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 Ahahahah.. I know I'm having a good laugh, and SoE is laughing all the way to the bank. This is just too hilarious, shaman have been getting boring re-tread spells since Luclin. A few of us tried to make a statement by not buying Legacy of Ykesha, back when they were in the middle of a Shaman nerf. It didn't work and I doubt it would this time. There are too many fools ready to be parted from their money for shoddy, unimaginitive expansions and poor customer service.<br />
<br />
 Yet another slap in the face, yet again shamans just take it. &quot;Thank you sir, may I have another for $30 + $13/mo?&quot; Sorry to gloat, I'm just glad I never bought LoY or LDoN. New expansions came out while raging macroing + duping was ruining the economy and the value of hard won items, but hey the suckers will keep paying - no reason to stop working on those $$ making expansions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>korask shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">only time i ever use disease dots is on emp snake fight.  Soloing im much better off chaining Blood/ancient/bane and in groups im much better off pulling slowing and baning and tossing patch heals and qs where needed.  Bane was a good idea though weak compared to the similar dots other classes got.  This plague of daluda is a kick in the nuts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">A few of us tried to make a statement by not buying Legacy of Ykesha, back when they were in the middle of a Shaman nerf. It didn't work and I doubt it would this time.<br />
<br />
Actually, shaman boycotts worked twice.  First was PoP, when we were given several useless single stat buffs.  A lot of shamans, like me, boycotted PoP until they were changed.  <br />
<br />
The LoY boycott was interesting.  They gave us Pure Blood, the same spell as clerics and druids.  But we already had the spell in the form of Disinfecting Aura, so they changed that to remove 36 disease counters, despite the fact we already had Abolish Poison, making DA a duplicate spell.  The outrage from the shaman community is what gave us Blood of Nadox, which is a decent, though limited spell (can't be cast out of our group, like several other of our group spells).<br />
<br />
When I saw Bane with its remarkably dumb 24 second recast time, I posted on this board saying we should boycott because of yet another bad idea, but was laughed to scorn and called a whiner because everyone said how good LDoN would be.  I finally caved in and bought the expansion, and am sorry that I did.  I don't have Bane, but I'm really don't care, and won't really care until the fix it.<br />
<br />
What I see here is a consistent pattern of poor design applied to our class in expansion after expansion.  Plague of Daluda is yet another bad idea in a long line of bad ideas in the grand tradition of Rabid Bear, Alchemy Mastery, etc.  It would be nice if for once we could head this bad idea off before it goes into production.  Where are all the shamans on beta test?  You all should be up in arms over stuff like this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Vannilla</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Ultor + Pox is all the disease we could ever need for soloing. The only times I've used Ultor on raids have been on blobs and a couple of other VT mobs. Disease dots aren't worth casting on PoP bosses, unless you want to prove that you can cast 6 dots on Fennin without getting smashed. In exp groups, I believe I memmed Ultor once when I was trying to select BoS in the dropdown spell menu. We need a new, fairly low agro &quot;All occasion&quot; dot from this expansion. Something that can be used in raids and exp groups without feeling we've wasted mana when we've done a whopping 1200 damage in the 30 seconds a mob lives (And spent nearly the same amount of mana doing it). Bane is a good spell, and what DoTs should look like if we're going to get real, usable upgrades. If not, give us a respectable DD so we can at least add SOME tangible damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Actually don't think necromancers (the other DoT class) are getting a nuke either. They weren't last time I looked anyway, just getting a small upgrade to a L60 DoT.<br />
<br />
That said this spell is insultingly stupid. The last thing any DoT users needs is a pointlessly slow disease DoT. Heck, in my guild the current rule is that any DoT under 30DPS should never be cast to avoid taking up a debuff slot that could be used for something noticeable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gruog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Actually what would be cool is change it to a disease nuke instead of dot!<br />
<br />
Fast cast, high damage, long recast with low mana-efficiency.<br />
<br />
Say 1700-1900 damage, 3-4 sec cast, 10+ sec recast , and about 700ish mana.<br />
<br />
Having it a disease nuke would be very easy to use on most mobs plus our disease debuffs would help alot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm absolutely not buying GoD without wholesale changes to the spell lineup.<br />
<br />
I've seen not the slightest bit of proof that this expansion has anything I want. At least LoY gave me a larger bank space, armor dye, and the mapping feature.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Call it something like &quot;Putrescent grasp of Daluda&quot;<br />
<br />
475 mana, 1600hp disease nuke<br />
<br />
1 second cast time (Just to be cool), and then a 12 second recast so we can't chain it.<br />
<br />
Sort of a &quot;KAPOW!&quot; type nuke.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, copy ancient destruction of ice, only make it 325 mana and give it a shaman-ish spell name.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">alternatively, a 500 mana (Disease) DoT that does 600 a tick for 4 ticks would work, if it were given a resist modifier.<br />

Their customer service level is really, really slipping.<br />
<br />
DoT's suck, suck, suck.  And the bottom line is, if DoT's ever become good we'll just hit the 36-detremental cap on the bosses.  Hell DoT's suck now and my guild is almost always at the cap, what with the various 20 damage a tick DoT's all the melee's weapons proc. <br />

<br />
They are all playing other classes, while silly noobs are playing shamans cause 'they are gods gift to groups' as someone put it.  It was pretty much like that when I beta testing LDoN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Only disease dot I *ever* use in groups/raids/solo/porno is from ele pants and that is only because it's a free click, and then it is resisted a **** load unless I hit the mob with MDecay(hi waste of spell slot).  If it weren't a free click, I wouldn't use any disease dots.  At this stage disease dots, poison nukes, rains...all useless.  I use our rain spells 2 times, Coirnav and Phase5 trash.  Poison nukes? Coirnav.</div></div><hr />

pofire has this, except it's 14-15% aa per kill, but still pretty nice.<br />
<br />
honestly, i see everyone complaining, but me, i wouldn't mind a spell like this.  most of my time spent playing EQ is raiding, and the few times that i do xp, i usually solo w/ a lfg tag up.  <br />
<br />
i would really like to have a spell like this when i'm soloing.  other than the low dps this dot puts out, everything else about it is nice.  that 393 mana thing is so low compared to our other dots..<br />
<br />
anyways, while i think this dot has its uses (more for me than you other shaman i guess) and i certainly wouldn't mind its presence in my spellbook, though it won't make me buy GoD</div></div><hr />
