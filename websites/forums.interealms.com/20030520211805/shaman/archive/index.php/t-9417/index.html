<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Apikoros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">This is just my bit of advice for a nice mix of loot and XP. It goes without saying that the succesful soloer always, always, always has KEI. I did all this relatively untwinked, no JBB etc. I am a rot/root/DogDog shaman just in case that makes a difference. I hit with slow, disease DoT, then root and send in little meat shield.<br />

1. Dawnshroud Peaks from 40-44. Right off the Netherbian Lair. I hung out on the hill top between Grieg's End and Maiden's eye. I killed as many wandering Sambata's as I could and then would kill Zelniaks etc when it was slow or overcamped. I did some time killing the plaguebones in Dreadlands towards the end of 44. The acrlyia from the sambatas sells real well in the bazaar. Most of this is well known stuff, you can check other posts for more advice.<br />
<br />
2. Tenebrous Mountains from 44-49. At least on Drinal, it is pretty much uncamped. To get there get a GG/TL to Grimling Forest and then run. Avoid the big Grimling Camps. Towards 49 there were more light blues then dark blues but there were enough to kill plenty for level. The two best places to hang are the zone near Grimling and the zone near Katta Castelum. Near the zone to Grimling Forest the Grimling Runner will spawn. He drops the grimling runner pouch which you can hand in to get the rallic pattern with which you can make the Rallic pack. 85% weight reduction, 10 Giant slots, trivial at 15 to make. Check out www.eqtraders.com for more info. I recommend killing any Grol Baku, Meeda Hune, or Cral Ligi. Those are the little alien dudes. The most common types are the soldiers and the other types drop items for the twilight sea armor quests. They all drop gems that sell decent and windstones. Windstones can be sold (at least on Drinal) in the bazaar from 200-400pp each. The spiny weapons are lousy and don't sell for anything.  The Darkwing bats are un-rootable but slow works. The dire sonic wolves are not bad either. Also, you'll see Grimling Orefinders and Grimling Geomancers run through, kill them too. Loot isn't bad or the experience. Be aware of the coterie scout. He can be invis and may attack you out of nowhere. I just kept Spirit Sight up after he wasted me the first time. He was blue to me at 45. He has a NASTY life tap thingee that wastes you. <br />
<br />
3. Scarlet Desert 49+ That is where I am now and having a ton of fun. I made my own camp between the two sun revenant/reaver camps on the wall on the way in from Twilight Sea. Just been pulling those guys who have some nasty procs and spells, and the occasional bloodtribe or tro jeg or cheetah or whatever is blue. Experience is awesome the loot is not. It is fun, and on Drinal pretty empty.<br />
<br />
Hope all this helps! I wanted to return something for all the help I've gotten from long time lurking here.<br />
