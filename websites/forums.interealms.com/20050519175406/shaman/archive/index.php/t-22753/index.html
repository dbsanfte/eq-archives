<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Fyrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I need some expert advice from all of you Shaman:<br />
<br />
38 almost 39 shaman here on Inny.<br />
I started this character 2 years + ago and am just coming back to him so please forgive my ignorance.  I have a 59 BST and a 54 Mage so I know this game decently, but I am a complete idiot when it comes to horses.<br />
<br />
My playstyle is SLOW, Poison, Disease, melee to death with pet chewing on MOB with me.<br />
<br />
Root, DOT, DOT, cani, med is just not my gig...but will it have to be later?<br />
<br />
I solo 99% of the time.<br />
<br />
That being said, my questions:<br />
<br />
1. Can I still melee on a horse? (My Soulstripper is about to start procing!)<br />
<br />
2. How do you folks typically play who do own a mount?<br />
<br />
3. I see a lot of people giving advice to buy a cheap horse at least to start off with.  I understand the meditation, speed and weight reduction benefits but will this fit my playstyle?<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dunwut</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. Yes you can melee on a horse but it can be a pain.<br />
<br />
2. When I had a horse I rarely used it when soloing. Most of the time it was for groups so I could get sit med without the aggro. If you tend to solo outdoors then a horse may be a good investment. If you solo indoors then a horse is wasted plat.<br />
<br />
3. Unless you have a ton of cash to burn then the cheapest horse is best for shaman. I sold mine back once I got Cann5 as I found myself never using it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>kittyshaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i bought a horse and jbb at 44 (i think that is when jbb is useable, it has been a long time).  the 9k horse is all you need.  i then played a little different style than most shaman probably play...<br />
i would sit on horse with pet set to no taunt, pull with slow, add a dot (depending on which mob I was killing), then sit on horse without melleeing and blast with jbb while pet chewed on its ankles.  The reasons I did this...  1) sitting mana regen rate on horse unless moving or meleeing (less downtime between pulls).  2) pet takes no damage (i usually only added haste to pet and dex if he had proccing weaps).  3) seemed to be the fastest way to get exp from 44 (or was it 46 for jbb?) until mid 50s.  i focused on high ac with my gear to keep damage at a minimum.  i would cast stoicism on myself for healing.<br />
i vote for a horse if you are playing outdoor groups or planning to solo with a jbb.  the 9k mount will be just as good as the 100k mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">At level 65. 310 AAs, time/kt acces I still don't own a horse. Long Live old models!</div></div><hr />

If you solo most of the time I think you will find alot of use for it.  I know you dont like to root and dot but it will become a strong option for solo very soon enough.  The horse will make a world of difference when that day comes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Scarus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Grouping, especially somewhere like BoT, it has made life much easier.  Although I got a lizard (to match my Iksar).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>UgZug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">All but VERY rarely, I only use my horse to travel.  I just need to move around too much on raids to try to do it on a horse... plus if you get summoned you block the melee... which gets you a firm talking-to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">First major piece of twink gear I buy any caster and still use it whenever I happen to be in an outdoor zone at 65. Best 9k I have ever spent. <br />
<br />
It will be useless to you if you still mellee since you lose the mana regen, but if you get JBB or when you get the 49 dots you'll be much more effective sitting and dotting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I like the lizard better then a horse.  It's tough to see around the horse's head at times.  Simply put, I use my mount every time I am in an outside zone.  You will find that soloing becomes increasingly harder as you gain levels.  It is still possible but groups yield a lot more xp faster and easier.  That is when your mount will come in handy big time.  If you are going to keep soloing up into the higher levels you may not need one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Just to echo what Haneb said - Drogmor &gt; Horse.</div></div><hr />

Nothing beats that.  100k horse is great for travel in GoD, allows you to run without sinking high up on walls and actually outrun even the kyls.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kryscha</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Before I say anything, I'm going to admit that horses weren't in game until I was 60, and I never bothered to get one until 65, so what I think may not be as valid at the poster's levels.<br />
<br />
1. Given your situation, a fast horse (100k+, the only useful one imo) is going to be out of your reach, unless you've got some rich friends.<br />
2. The moment you melee on a horse, you lose any mana regen advantage.<br />
3. Horses are great for the 'easy' groups where all you do is slow on inc, throw some nukes/dots, and maybe a few heals around here and there.<br />
4. Be aware, if you are on a horse, you CANNOT duck to interrupt a spell, you must walk around on the horse, or click the horse off and duck.<br />
5. Due to (4.) I found a horse extremely restictive when soloing or grouping, and after playing with it for a few weeks, never used it again.<br />
6. The slow 'start-up' period on a horse if you have to run away can get you killed.  If you're running, it's because you're in trouble, and if you're in trouble, you probably need to get out of there ASAP, not wait for your horse to pick up speed.<br />
7. Did I mention how frustrating it is not to be able to duck to interrupt a spell?  Nothing like having an &quot;Oh Crap, I need to cast xxx&quot; moment, and then having to stuff around clicking off horses/moving around until spell stops casting/etc<br />
8. You either need an AoN, or new models on to use a horse. I personally loathe the new models (my Iksar looks fugly)  so for pure self-enjoyment, I prefer to look at myself and think &quot;Damn, I'm one sexy Iksar!&quot;<br />
9. A horse is a real pain to use in melee, especially if you have dog dog chewing on a rooted mob with you.  As you should know, a rooted mob hits whoever is closest, and on a horse that position can be hard to work out. If you misjudge this distance a lot, you'll end up wasting any extra mana advantage healing your pet back up.<br />
<br />
My personal opinion on horses is that for an active caster (I primarily think shaman here) a horse is more of a disadvantage than an advantage for someone playing to the full capabilities of the class, even at lower levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Horse is great. Currently saving for the most expensive one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I have a 9K drog.  I rarely use it anymore and have been considering selling it back.<br />
<br />
I just cant sit still anymore.  LDoN ruined that for me.  Before LDoN if I could use the horse my kilt was planted on it.  I used my horse for the first time in weeks tonight, and after about 2 minutes I clicked it off.  <br />
<br />
My wizard, however, still lives on his horse, but thats because he doesnt move it he doesnt have to.  With a shaman i can canni to make up lost mana; a wizard doesnt have the luxury.  <br />
<br />
I loved my horse though, before I outgrew it.  Poncho and me were inseperable, even though he ate me out of house and home....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Tebion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i only use mine for traveling or when i am really in an easy group where i dont have to move a lot. (or when i am really running low on mana and dont have time to cani)<br />
even the 100k drogmor/horse takes soo long to pick up speed that it is almost useless when i want to give my best. and on raids/in interesting groups it moves too slow for me to be fast enough in debuffing multi-incomings, there i have to change my position fast to keep overview  of which mobs i already debuffed and which are still chewing on the casters unslowed.<br />
<br />
but i always use it for moving in god (outside trials), because its the only way to reach a zone alive when you encounter a see invis mob/invis fades :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>takk the silent one</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">My playstyle is SLOW, Poison, Disease, melee to death with pet chewing on MOB with me.<br />
<br />
Root, DOT, DOT, cani, med is just not my gig...but will it have to be later?<br />
<br />
At 38 it is still possible to  melee some without  having to melee... but with PoP and GoD , some mobs are just too damn rough to even consider tanking it (slow gets mitigated or resisted, hits over 1K, soon ya a dead shaman) So you have to learn how to do the Rot and drop type of kills.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Can I still melee on a horse? (My Soulstripper is about to start procing!)<br />
<br />
you can but I wouldn't recommend it. One thing I notice more on the horse ( I got the cheap one) is I get stunned more.  Also a horse doesn't immediately run at top speed like you would if you had SoW . It gradually gains speed and  it doesn't stop on a dime (meaning that if you stop it will still keep going for a bit.) This in melee could mean your death imo. <br />
<br />
<br />
2. How do you folks typically play who do own a mount?<br />
<br />
The best time to use my horse is in a Pop or outside zone with a group and if possible with kei.  Because of stunning problem, and slow gradual running rate (unless you buy the 100k horse) you want to avoid melee on a horse.  Dot and rot soloing works ok with a horse but  if you get hit alot or dump the horse and run. Also with a horse the head alway gets in the way so  a lot of people shrink themselves to avoid this problem. If you get a lizard the head is not a problem but  there is a bit of a bounce as you run. The main advantage of having a horse is that you don't need to med and you don't need to worry about the canni dance (meaning that you canni to your hearts content)<br />
<br />
<br />
3. I see a lot of people giving advice to buy a cheap horse at least to start off with.  I understand the meditation, speed and weight reduction benefits but will this fit my playstyle?<br />
<br />
<br />
In a word , no... If you are meleeing this is not too good with a cheap  plow horse.  However in high end mobs its becomes suicide if you  try to melee it.  Then you have to learn to the fine art  of letting your mobs rot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Shambler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Well.. for grouping in PoP zones or any other outdoor zones, a mount is a godsend.<br />
<br />
The main benifit for a shaman is no sit agro after you do your slowing. Also when you do the &quot;canabalize dance&quot; you no longer have to time siting before the mana regen tick ;), you just click cani over and over. Zzzzz. I remember I had a hotkey for /sit/stand and cani.. heh cani sit stand cani sit stand cani sit stand cani (rubs sore fingers)<br />
<br />
I would say if you want to continue your current playstyle of melleing the mob, save your plat for now. However, I bet you will want to get a mount by the time you are 48 or 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Maitz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">For open zones easy exp groups horse is great. Had 9k horse in my early PoP groups later bought the 100k one and never looked back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">At 38 or 39 I'd say wait a little longer for the horse.  The main advantage of a horse (mana regen) doesn't work if you are meleeing and you still have a few points to go on weapon and defense skills.  Keep meleeing until at least defense is maxed.  Once I had my JBB and drogmor my melee skills stopped moving.<br />
<br />
Once your skills are capped the horse is great for root/rotting or pet tanking.<br />
<br />
Keep saving that money though.<br />
<br />
Horse+JBB=powerlevelling.  Once you get to 45 and can click JB armor the horse will truly come into it's own.  You will never feel as powerful as you will at 45 with a JBB and Horse.  That feeling of power will last into the mid 50s (At 56 I'm just starting to reach the end of it).  The JBB will outdo shaman melee for many levels and mana free damage while meditating is hard to beat.<br />
<br />
The JBB is a great investment too.  I could sell mine today for twice what I paid for it and I don't see that trend changing soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>SnowwSilverhammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Horse is a great Idea if you are fairly static in your gameplay.<br />
<br />
I do 90% of the pulling when I am in a group or leading a raid And the other 10 % of the time I am swirling around the groups or scouting so I actually don't own a horse on Snoww.<br />
<br />
A horse would give you more options though and options are always better.<br />
<br />
Snoww Silverhammer Bashy RABID bear  E marr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Personally, my recommendation is just buy the cheapest one, and see. Its 9K. Thats not a difficult amount for anyone to farm, even mid-30's players (tradeskill items are such MASSIVE money makers its not even funny, and can be farmed by level 1's). <br />
<br />
If you use it a lot, and want speed, upgrade it. If you dont, put it in that &quot;carry everywhere&quot; bag, and pull it out when you find a situation where its useful. Having it gives you options, not having it makes you less effective because you have less options.<br />
<br />
There is another important reason to have a mount that people seem to miss, as well, and that is Sit aggro. As a Shaman, I never sit to med, HOWEVER, given the wide range of spells my character has, I am constantly shifting spells in and out of my lineup for buffs, special situations, etc etc. You actually SIT to mem a spell you know, unless you are on a mount.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Hail,<br />
<br />
I would buy the cheapest mount possible as soon as you can.<br />
Many of us who are now 65 with tons of AA's and maxed worn FT do not remember the agony of spam-clicking Cannibalize I or II (if you were lucky enough to have it at 39) to regen mana with MAYBE FT1 or 2 worn.<br />
<br />
There are tons of zones that you will be leveling in.  Many of them will be outdoors.  Some of the best ZEM bonuses (Mistmoore for you right now, City of Mist, etc) are also outdoor zones.<br />
<br />
Even if you dismount for every pull and only mount up during combat (without meleeing), the manaregen from the horse will significantly reduce your downtime.  You are rapidly approaching the point where  your melee damage becomes insignificant in reducing the mobs health.  <br />
<br />
Once you are 44 and have Stoicism, I think you will find it more efficient to be tanking in the face while on horseback WITHOUT swinging a weapon when soloing than how you fight now.  <br />
<br />
Pet attack, Slow, DoT, DoT, Stoicism, Canni until DoTs need refreshing, rinse repeat.  <br />
All the time you are chewing hp and casting spells while on horseback you will still get the sitting regen rate.  That's a pretty huge benefit compared to proccing a weak DD a few times (maybe) per fight while only getting the standing manaregen rates.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Doranur_Aleguzzler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I had a horse/drog for awhile when doing lower tier PoP. Little room to move and high aggro mobs made sit aggro a huge consideration. Once I got into LDoN and the higher tier indoor PoP zones where you can't use a mount, I got used to being able to move around again and not be tethered down, though the mana regen was sorely missed. Then came Canni5. Haven't looked back since, indoor or out. I prefer the mobility and I no longer have the need to spamm canni4 so often. My gnecro and mage on the other hand live by the mount, and even my wizard put one to good use for quite awhile. Basically, like everybody said, get the cheap one to find out if it is for you. You can always upgrade later.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Gunny</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Fyrol, I play just like you.  Although now in my 50's, I'm starting to group, but I mostly soloed.  I love the horse though.  It just makes things flow better with less med time, due to canni while on the horse.  As a player that mostly solos, I can recomend getting the cheap horse.  And people talk about the horse's head getting in the way.  I don't know about you, but when I solo, I zoom the camera out and play in 3rd person mode, so I had no issues with the horses head.  I would've melee on the horse either.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Fyrol</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I appreciate all of the feedback thus far.  It has been very illuminating.<br />
<br />
I think I may wait on the horse for a little bit, only due to my active playstyle.<br />
<br />
I have done a lot of practicing with Root and Rot so when the time comes I will be ready for it.<br />
<br />
***My additional question is when should I dump the Fungi Tunic?  It has been amazing thus far in making my life easy but is there a time when I should get rid of it and get something else?***<br />
<br />
I hit 39 last night and the XP is just rolling in.  I am hunting in the Overthere purely out of convienience.  I am an Ogre, evil outpost and sarnak whip quest is right there, can't beat free XP.  I can beat the hell out of anything there and plenty of mobs to pull.  I will probably move to Gulf of Gunthak at 44 to get my Stoicism spell.  <br />
<br />
I will also be checking the hunting guides to see if there are other places to go XP.  I know I can just do OT and DL solo until 50 if I need to pretty easy but I will need a change of scenery, heh.<br />
(I am a big Kunark fan...)<br />
<br />
I have enough for the horse though and I will continue to save my cash.<br />

<br />
<br />
I think it's actually closer to FT20.  At level 65 I regen about 20 more mana per tick when I'm on a horse or sitting, according to the mana numbers on my health bar now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Purdypog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">If I'm not mistaken the formula for medding is skill/10 so FT25 at level 65 or whenever you max your medding.  So it is significant.<br />
<br />
Personally, I resisted getting a mount for a long time but I did find it useful enough to buy eventually since there are a few occasions where the mount is golden.<br />
<br />
1) Boring and safe outdoor experience camps like in BOT etc.<br />
2) Recovering mana after rez.<br />
3) Vxed and up groups where you really need additional dps or extra spam healing.  Although the lack of ducking out of the spell is risky if your group doesn't have CC or a good puller.<br />
4) Root rot soloing (if you are so inclined).<br />
<br />

PS: It really is good for #1 above.  Really good.  If you are soloing like you mentioned in your post it is pretty much worthless but there will come a time when you want to root rot without puppy.</div></div><hr />

1. I can't imagine someone doing so and staying sane.  It can be done but it's hard for afew reasons.  One, knockback.   As you all know, no matter what horse you have, it's slow to START moving.  So mob will get pushed and you miss a bunch of hits as you are trying to place the mob inside of you(see my next point).  Two, vision.  You won't see the mob as he has to be almost inside of you for you to hit.  It sucks.  Three, no swing action, so if you miss and have them turned off, you don't see it.<br />
<br />
2. I got my mount for afew reasons in particular.  I had JBB well before I hit the level to use it, so I knew a mount + jbb would be nice (8 second cast time for 263dd isn't bad).  My strategy as it stands, is to slow mob, sick dogdog on it, then sit on my mount and bombard the mob with JBB and mabye a small DoT.  This of course, will most likely change in the near future (currently level 51).  A mount is also good in groups if you will be doing stuff like healing and slowing where there isn't alot of movement required.<br />
<br />
3. I don't know about you, but I myself love to move around when I'm playing.  With a mount it becomes a tedious task.  No matter if it's the 9k or the 100k mount (nice for travel), being on one sucks when you like to bounce around and melee the mob occasionally.  For that reason alone, I avoid using the mount when I can, but it does come in handy.  The fact you are always medding, even when casting, makes a significant and visual difference on mana regeneration.<br />
<br />
I dunno.  Alot of people like em, others don't, some are in the middle.  I'm one the latter.  If you have 9k to spare, go for it.  I bought mine early enough and even though I'm not always using it, when I do use it I'm happy to have one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">I'd get one as soon as possible, and get either a horse or drogmor based on aesthetics, they both are fine.

<br />
1. Summon scoobie and buff the crap out of him..prior to this make sure you have donated some loot to your tribute guy, flowing thought three is a nice perk to have when soloing.<br />
2. Park your but on the horse scout out a good mob.<br />
3. Pull the mob while mounted using slow..(Hint)..get the ceramic sword of war!..Ext Range 4!<br />
4. Park the mob using immobalize...<br />
5. Back waaaay up...hit em with your first DoT.<br />
6. A. Hit em with a second DoT..I like to stack BoK and PoB.<br />
    B. Re-root if the first dot broke root.<br />
7. Cripple his butt ie debuff em.<br />
8. Send in scoobie to finish him off and start to canni.<br />
9. While Scoob is killing the mob off go get another..<br />
     These are the steps i use all the time..I mostly solo ME and try to get the Tribal Gatherers or Scouts and hunters..I can saftely handle three at a time..One parked and DoT'd, One Dot'd and melee'd, and scoobie smackig the last one.. I know its terribly boring but hell, its worth it..<br />
     One of the best reasons to have a horse is to avoid the sitting agro..Exspecially if you have to swap out a spell..Nothing says &quot;Hey! your on the menu!&quot; like sitting on your butt in a fight!..<br />
     So, after all my rambling and raving, I would really buy a drog, there are well worth having..Good luck to you..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>phatteydump</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Ok ill chime in my thoughts,<br />
<br />
I got my mount at about lvl 50ish.  I got the cheapo 9k one.  I loved the mana regen/no sit agro stuff.  Evetually i traded in that one for the sow speed horse.  I found myself using him more often then not and i wanted to be able to keep up with a grp if i had to move with him.  On that note, i also didnt want to outrun my grp, i like to stick nearby in case im needed to help out.  I never really meleed while on my mount.  Not that it was too hard but if i was on a mount that usually meant that the grp was moving fast and i needed all the mana i could get to keep up.  <br />
<br />
One suggestion i have is if you get a horse, learn strafing moves.  The horse for some reason will move a little faster starting off if you strafe instead of just run.  It helps if you get summoned and need to get out of the melees way quikly.  <br />
<br />
I dont know why people dont use shrink, but when im grping with anyone, i shrink at least my self.  Yes im a troll, but even if i was a frog i would shrink myself.  Shrinking will get rid of the horse head if you have one, also i heard that invising and clicking it off right away will get rid of it, but i just stick to shrink cause i shrink all the time.<br />
<br />
As for the interupts, i would have to agree that there needs to be a way to &quot;duck&quot; out while on a mount.  I was really hopeing that /stop casting command was gonna do that, but as we all know it doesnt.  I just tend to be really sure on what i am casting before i push the button, and if im on a raid/tuff exp grp i dont bring out the horse.  You just need to know your own limits really i think.<br />
<br />
That all being said, i would agree with those that say to get one.<br />
1) Mana regen/no sit agro<br />
2) It goes into the ammo slot which i never have anything in anyway.  Just hotkey that onto a random page and you never really have to worry about it taking up space, with a shaman at least.  I never use the throw potions, just make em  and sell em.<br />
3) If you dont like it you can sell him back for a good chunk of change, or you can upgrade if you like it and want to get a faster one.<br />

<br />
nm on most of my bs..<br />
<br />
what you do in KT, standing instead of sitting is beyond my imagination.. <br />
<br />
Having a horse/lizzy is one of the most useful tools a shaman can have at any level. <br />
<br />
There is no good reason to not have horse on while outdoors for a shaman.<br />
<br />
OK, so you're in potime fighting whatever god it is, lets say RZ.. don't you think the benefit of having sit down regen mana while trying to heal or whatever it is that you do is important? lets say the regen amounts to 2000mana that's about 4 extra heals you can do.. I am usually oom near the end of the fights and I personally love the horse for whatever extra it gave me..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">Khozik, I guarantee you that's not what Grizlor actually wears.  <br />
<br />
I rarely use my horse.  I don't like the inability to duck out of spells, and I hate the movement feel of it.  People don't actually play with that margin of efficiency.  <br />
<br />
Efficiency is a vastly overrated thing sometimes.<br />
<br />
That said, if soloing outdoors is your thing, a horse is a smart buy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">I erased my stupid comment :) what I'm talking about is not necessarily efficiency but at the least convenience and extra mana for those tough times.. <br />
<br />
The reason we don't canni dance is because we have a horse.. basically with a horse I can out canni dance anyone w/o one outdoors =b</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>Jovec</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">***My additional question is when should I dump the Fungi Tunic?  It has been amazing thus far in making my life easy but is there a time when I should get rid of it and get something else?***<br />
<br />
Never.<br />
<br />
There is a time when a better chest item with outway the 15/tick regen when it comes to countering mob damage, whether you are meleeing and it's due to higher AC, or maybe resists for countering raid/boss AE. As I see it, though, the fungi has a hidden stat of FT8, because at a majority of EXP grind zones you will rarely get hit, and under those circumstances, the 150/min regened by the fungi will let you canni IV once per minute &quot;for free,&quot; essentially giving you an extra FT8, which is a nice deal.<br />
<br />
I suppose though, you will need to consider what you can get in potential upgrades with the PP of the fungi if you were to sell it, however, FT8 is hard to come by for most people.<br />

p.s. Buy the cheapest horse/drogmar.  You may not use it all the time, but I consider it a required tool for casters, about on the level of the key spells.  When I play my SK, I get annoyed when a caster doesn't have one, because I have to pull more aggro to let them sit.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with this statement the most out of the pros/cons mentioned on the thread so far. In todays EQ world of bigger +mana items, bigger mana regen spells, tribute FT, items with FT easier to obtain, etc etc, Mana pools RARELY play as big a role in the normal course of the game. However, in those situations where you need that extra mana or need to avoid sit aggro, its nice to have that option available. Canni Danceing blows. I never did it, even during Kunark (ok I did it some, but not a lot). Shaman rarely sit for anything anyway, straight standing, canning, with regen and the occasional HoT will usually be sufficient &quot;extra&quot; mana regen. However, that sit aggro for popping spells in and out of the spellbar CAN be lethal. The fact that you can buy this &quot;tool&quot; fairly cheaply at any level makes it MASSIVELY valuable, especially at those lower levels, since Clarity doesnt last long enough to take a good piss heh.</div></div><hr />
