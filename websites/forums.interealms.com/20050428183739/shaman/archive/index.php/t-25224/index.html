<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My 36 shaman has 210 blacksmithing now.<br />
I'm soon to be at the point that I choose if I want to be a weaponsmith or armor smith.<br />
Anyone got any feedback what's better to work on?<br />
I'm thinking armorsmith is more useful.<br />
You can only wield 1 weapon at a time if you are a weaponsmith.<br />
You can wear your own boots, bracer, chest, shoulder, legs, and helm though, and everyone else has the same need for armor too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It's been my experience that weapons through quests are a heck of a lot more common than leggings, boots, gauntlets et. al.<br />
<br />
Gratz btw on 210.  I'm at 192 (or so) on my guy (Casual smither here) with a bank vault full of Mithril. (Mining 247 iirc).<br />
<br />
Plus, with the armorsmithing you can sell complete sets to vain people like me who want to wear matching Mithril.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Keep in mind that weapons are a much more defining item and thus people will pay a lot more for them.  People will spend tons on a good weapon because a great weapon can make all the difference, whereas one piece of armor is not a big deal.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">any pointers guys? smithing 243, mining 277, level 40, but stil no qust for weaponsmith according to the websites I should get it, ideas?<br />
