<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Sardak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello everyone, I really enjoy playing the shaman class, my first character was a shaman who reached level 30 before I decided to switch to a pvp server and made a 51 shaman, then decided to switch back to a blue server with a high population and am now working on a shaman again... currently level 28. Ive always just liked them becuase of all the options available and really didnt think much about balance until lately. <br />
<br />
I tried getting into a group (there was a warrior, cleric, monk, and enchanter), the enchanter (leader of the group) said that even though they had room they wanted to save the spot for a more useful class. Well I was kinda shocked because I figured shamans were pretty uber (didnt one shaman solo a dragon or something? maybe just a rumor lol). When I mentioned I could slow the mobs for them, the enchanter laughed and said he could basically do the same just aswell. So after checking the spell lists on lucy.. (might have missed some spells..)<br />
<br />
Enchanters best slow is for 70% and shamans is for 75%, even a beastlord can slow 65%. I suppose the enchanter was right in a way, what does that 5% really matter? that probably equals such a small dps in an xp group where mobs arent lasting as long as a raid boss mob. I thought slow was suppose to be THE shamans thing, with a 5% difference who cares? thats like a cleric complete healing and a shaman complete healing -5% and thinking that doesnt step on the clerics toes :P<br />
<br />
With slow mitigation that 5% advantage we have would be even smaller.. probably like a 1% or 2% difference (which is nothing). I think they should have made enchanters clearly better at hasteing, and shamans clearly better at slowing.. and the beastlord inbetween.  something like<br />
<br />
Shaman slow 75% haste 50%<br />
Enchanter slow 50% haste 75%<br />
Beastlord slow 50% haste 50%</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Shaman slow is very nice in terms of speed, duration, and flexibility (can use MR based Turgur or DR based Cloud of Grummus)...<br />
<br />
But we have other amazing powers.  Malos (which I still don't have damnit) is an unresistable -55 MR -55 CR -55 FR -55 PR debuff which will help us slow but will also help others land their spells.  Malicious Decay is an unresistable -52 DR debuff.  Enchanters only have Howl of Tashan, a -50 MR debuff (there may be a bigger one, I'm not sure).<br />
<br />
We're able to take hits well, especially with slow.. although Enchanters with decent AAs and other types of runes can also tank pretty darn well-- we don't need as much work to survive so well.<br />
<br />
Our dots are extremely good -- our poison dots are very quick and powerful.<br />
<br />
Our heals suck but are very nice still-- especially Tnarg's mending, a long range quick 1300 heal.  We have a very very nice and efficient heal, Torpor/Quiescence.<br />
<br />
Our nukes suck but with what I mention below, we're able to add consistent decent dps with our Tears of Saryrn (poison rains of 650 per wave).  We're able to nuke fast with our poison DDs and nuke well with our slow cold DDs.<br />
<br />
But what makes us shine is our ability to accelerate mana very very quickly.  Sacrifice 148 hitpoints for 82 mana per cast.  Sacrifice 1924 hitpoints for 1066 mana EVERY THREE MINUTES.  Chanters have an AA ability, Gather Mana, for 5000 mana.. but that is only once per hour or something like that.  They can mana-tap but that only works on caster mobs.  Of course, they have KEI as well, but we can use KEI too although it's totally and completely unnecessary.<br />
<br />
We have sow.  We have incredible buffs.  Our doggy is better than their animations.<br />
<br />
...they have Charm...<br />
<br />
Ok, enchanters win. haha.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Mozeley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I read somewhere the other day, on this very same board, that the 5 percent difference actually proves to be a 20 percent reduction in DPS. <br />
<br />
For the life of me though, I can't remember which post it was - it had all the figures and everything.<br />
<br />
But yeah, that group that said that to you was a very strange group.<br />
<br />
I've never ever been told that by a group, and if they said that to me, then I would wish myself lucky that I had realised what a bunch of A-Holes they were before I started grouping with them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Schpleef</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Trust me, in PoP enchanters' lack of ac/hp really shows when they try to slow... If you bounce a slow in valor for instance, you get pasted lol, that stuff hits HARD!!!  Also... I dunno, this may be a faulty observation, but... in a valor group the other day I was healing while we looked for a cleric or druid, and so our enchanter was slowing.  This was during the 'no slow aggro' couple of days we had before the recent fix patch ;)  She was still getting massive aggro from tash, but like us, not from slows.. so rather than tash and have an angry unslowed mob beat her up, she was just slowing without the tash.. and at level 65, I'll be damned if she didn't bounce the first slow or even the first 2 slows on virtually every mob... Regardless of what Lucy says, I've seen it firsthand, their slow really seems to be resisted more than ours.  Furthermore, as another poster mentioned, our slows are more versatile and last longer.  Might not seem like a big deal, but the fact that turgurs lasts 6 minutes is HUGE.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Every POP group needs a healer, a slower, and some DPS.  Some crowd control is highly desireable.  Pre-POP you can skimp on some of these roles, depending on your camp.<br />
<br />
Enchanters can handle the slows if they are good and if the group is on their toes.  They can also mez adds for the crowd control and if high enough level add DPS with a dire charmed pet.  Since this group had a cleric, you're not that useful in the healing department, and most of your slowing job has been taken over by the enchanter.  You wouldn't add a lot to that group, frankly, and they probably made the right decision.<br />
<br />
The next group might have only a druid for heals, though, or a lower level cleric, and might need some assistance with spot healing.  They might not have the enchanter for mez and might need root-parking.  <br />
<br />
As a shaman you have a large toolbox and can fill many roles, but not EVERY group needs you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sciek Spellbottler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You mentioned that you are only level 28, so in that case I can see an enchanter saying they can slow just as well as a shaman.  At lower levels the importance of slow isn't as great and it wouldn't surprise me to see many groups skip on a shaman if they already have an enchanter.  Likewise, it wasn't uncommon for groups at that level to skip a cleric if they already had a shaman or druid and so on...  As you level up having both a shaman and enchanter in group becomes more useful.  Enchanters typically shy away from slowing later in levels because mobs hit hard enough to tear through their robes and kill them in a matter of seconds if slow is resisted.<br />
<br />
Basically, at level 28... yeah, I can see why a group would skip a shaman and can't really fault them.  ENC and SHM in group at that level, one of you is going to be really bored most likely.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">The 20% is fuzzy math, it's the difference in 70 and 75, not the difference in DPS really and is used to ooh and ahh people.<br />
<br />
If you slow 75%, it's 5% slower than if you slowed 70%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Jaeden, for the love of god, don't get this discussion started again. My head still hurts from the last one.<br />

Shamans best slow higher than enchanters best slow. Nuff said.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Nytmare</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Level 60 has little to do with level 28. If you want details, the enchanter's slow is actually slightly better around those levels. But shamans can heal and sow.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that what I just said?!?!?<br />
<br />
 :p  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">for a few lvl's shaman and chanter slows overlap on who's the best.<br />
<br />
reading these boards you would think every shaman spawned out of a druids head at lvl 60 =P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">As a player of both classes, I have some insight on this topic.<br />
<br />
Enchanters have it rough when it comes to slowing -- they lack ac/hp, so resists usually end with a dead or seriously wounded enchanter (which in the case of wounding is a serious drain on cleric mana and overall group performance).  <br />
<br />
While you can use Tash to minimize resists, the unfortunate fact of Tash is that it is very high agro.  In order to use it without getting agro, you need to typically wait until the MT has solid agro before casting.  This delay, combined with the much slower casting time of enchanter slows, usually results in the mob being slowed much later than the same mob being slowed by a shaman.<br />
<br />
When viewed in perspective, the actual DPS output of a mob is going to be much lower with a shaman slowing than with an enchanter (despite the negligible 5 percent difference).<br />
<br />
It is also important to realize that a shaman has the luxury of not actually *requiring* malo/malos to land a slow safely.  If the slow bounces, you can malos and slow again without any real fear of dying.  An enchanter doesn't really have that luxury.<br />
<br />
Beastlords, on the other hand, are much better situated than enchanters for slowing.  If they had a reliable way to proc tash (or some variant of malo) than Shaman would indeed be in trouble group wise.  :)<br />
<br />
The bottom line, though, is that there is no reason to worry much about this.  <br />
<br />
A shaman is a superb slower, a decent healer, a decent nuker, a decent buffer, and a barely acceptable crowd controller.  <br />
<br />
An enchanter is a superb crowd controller, a decent slower, a decent buffer, a barely acceptable nuker, and a frighteningly bad healer (go go gadget-rune).  An enchanter can also (at tremendous risk) send overall group DPS through the roof.<br />
<br />
A beastlord is...  well, lets just say that he could cast Spiritual Vigor and Spiritual Purity and call it a day.  (Ok, they do more, I know.)  I actally really enjoy grouping with beastlords, *especially* beastlords that slow.  A 50 precent (or 65 percent) slowed mob means that I can be more aggressive in landing my own slow, especially in situations where it is normally hard to do so (like ToV for example).  With the beastlord slowing, I not only know that Turgurs *can* land, but I can chain cast it until it DOES land.<br />
<br />
(That being said, I swear Beastlords  have an easier time landing their slow than shaman do.  They shouldn't, according to lucy, but it just seems to often work out that way.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">You're missing the point here.  Neither BL's or Enchanters have the rest of the slowing package.  Enchanters can't heal themselves when they get massive aggro from a tash/slow try and BL's don't have the magic debuffing spell to make their slow (level 65 spell) stick.  <br />
<br />
Bears can still juggle several mobs at the same time and I've NEVER been denied a group because someone had a BL or a Chanter in the group and therefore didnt' need me!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Brohg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The 20% difference isn't fuzzy math, it's very real, and is the reason Turgur's didn't gain power from level 60-&gt;65.  It did, during PoP beta, and was rightly seen to be insanely overpowered.  Read and understand:<br />
<br />
If you take for granted that a mob WILL be slowed if players are really fighting it (a very valid assumption in PoP, no one fights mobs unslowed. just not done), then you see the real difference.  So you don't compare a mob slowed with Turgur's and a mob slowed with Forlorn Deeds (FD) against unslowed mobs; unslowed mobs don't exist.  You compare them to each other (and to mobs slowed with Sha's Revenge or Requiem of Time).<br />
<br />
So a mob that normally attacks at &quot;100&quot; attacks at 30 with FD, 25 with Turgur's.  The difference between 30 and 25 isn't 5%.  30 is 20% more than 25.  A mob will do 20% more damage if you use FD instead of Turgur's for your slows.  <br />
<br />
Did you follow that? Middle school math. 30 is 120% of 25.<br />
<br />
*20%*.  That's like a difference of FOUR HUNDRED AC on the MT.  Casting Turgur's instead of Forlorn Deeds on a mob has the same effect as equipping a Velious tank in full Raex's Armor of Destruction! (blah blah, same level/aa's, just change gear)  This on top of the huge advantages Turgur's has as a spell in general (cast/recast time), and in specific as a spell that shamans have, to go with their other spells and abilities (Malos, Quiescence, melee mitigation an order of magnitude above chanters, and a hitpoint advantage).<br />
<br />
At level 28, you're **** outta luck. The chanter really can do as well as you, slowing mobs.  The things you're fighting don't hit for crap, your strength in that arena just isn't needed.  You have to get a group spot as healer at that level, if you want to group.  Even better, take the spot of both healer, and slower, and just get 5 damage dealers (petcasters, btw, &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; melee, especially at that level) to hang out with.  You'll get way better exp than that cle/enc/whatever.  And sleep soundly at night, your role later on is unthreatened. Any slow less effective than shaman slow is both measurably and visibly worse. ;) <br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. - For those not math challenged, go ahead and do the simple comparison if Turgur's had gone live scaling to 80% at 65.  I dare you</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The best way to make examples more understandable is going to the bounds:<br />
imagine a 100% slow... Yes! mobs dont hit a single hit ever!<br />
Is it &quot;only&quot; 25% slower than the 75% ?<br />
<br />
NO!<br />
<br />
it is infinitely slower!<br />
<br />
thats why 75% is 20% slower than 70%... what you have to compare is the final speed of the mob...<br />
<br />
with 75% slow, mobs are at 25 speed<br />
with 70% slow, mobs are at 30 speed<br />
<br />
compare 30 with 25, not 30 with 100 and then 25 with 100.</div></div><hr />
