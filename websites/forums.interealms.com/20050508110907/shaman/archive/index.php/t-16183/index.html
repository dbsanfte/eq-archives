<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Voodoodoc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Have no clue how this happened, but Shalae will have nothing to do with me.  Anyone know how to improve faction with her?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Hmm..if I remember correctly the barbarian vendors in FV are on Halas merchant faction.  Halas faction is tough to get.  There are quests you can do that gan generate good faction with Halas, but if you cant go quests you are stuck killing things.<br />
<br />
You can kill gnolls in Everfrost for faction.  BB also gives positive hits if I remember corectly.<br />
<br />
If you go to East Freeport, between about 9pm and 5am game time you'll see Giz Dinree, a dark elf who stands where Bait Masterson stands in the daytime. She's about level 16. She'll spawn about 9pm, if she's been killed, she'll respawn about 2am.  Killing her gives good faction with Wolves of the North (Halas warrior faction) and some other assorted faction hits (Bad DE rogue faction too).  Once you kill her enough so that the Halas guards and guild masters wont make you into a snowcone, you can turn in gnoll teeth to warrior GM for good faction with most of Halas.<br />
<br />
I say most because the rogue faction in Halas is really screwey, and many factions that raise other factions in Halas will lower Rogue factions.  Not usually a problem except that the Halas banker isnt on Normal Banker faction, but on Halas Rogue faction.  So good factions with all of Halas except rogue= shopping/training but no banking.<br />
<br />
Halas factions are almost harder than Neriak factions.....<br />
<br />
Heres a list of quests to raise faction (http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=49) too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">They removed all the negitive rogue faction hits from halas quests. You can now safley do all quests in halas without fear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Killing gnolls in no way gives any positive Halas hits whatsoever.  Never have.  You can't just slaughter anything wholesale, it's pure quest.  The gnoll TEETH (which are now stackable, thank tribunal...) are a good way to do it.<br />
<br />
If you want ALL the options, the link you want is this one:<br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/faction.html?faction=49<br />
<br />
Gnoll teeth is probably the easiest way to do it, and they'll probably kiss your feet in Qeynos, to boot, by the time you're done.  Of course, you'll need to be in good enough with wolves of the north to turn the teeth in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How did you lose FV faction? Maybe you killed too many Firiona Drixies, or maybe you were never liked there to begin with. What race are you?<br />
<br />
You can raise FV faction by slaughtering goblins at the fort in Warslik Woods.<br />
<br />
Or you can get around the faction problem by having a friend by your spells, or by creating a handsome (HE Enc) mule to buy them -- shared bank slots make this pretty easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
 :confused: I have no clue how i lost FV faction.  I'm a Barbarian Shaman, Tribunal, and have been able to purchase spells from the vendors in the hut on the docks up until the other day.  What further puzzles me is the fact that Shalae is the only one who won't deal with me, because of &quot;my beliefs and the things I've done&quot;.<br />
<br />
Anyway, going to try turning in Gnoll Teeth and Warsliks tonight to see if I can get back on her good side.  <br />
<br />
Thank you Nytmare, and everyone else who offered their advice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>icebain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Sounds like they changed her faction, probably a bug</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Wulfson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Can you not find your spells in PoP?  I thought PoK had a spell vendor that was pretty complete?  Havent bout a spell except in bazaar in 5 lvls but.....its been awhile ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I know when Kunark first came out, the Barbarians in the hut on the dock were on Halas Merchant faction since they conned higher to me than any other merchant in the pain in the arse outpost.  <br />
<br />
1.  Double check your faction with some Halas Merchants to see if that has changed.  If it's the same, either there is a bug in the FV zone or they changed the faction on the npcs in FV.<br />
<br />
2.  If they did change the faction, start killing goblins in Lake of Ill Omen or Warsilk Woods.<br />
<br />
Beastiary for Lake of Ill Omen is <br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=73<br />
<br />
Beastiary for Warsilk Woods is <br />
http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=95<br />
<br />
Hit whichever zone is easier for your level.  The more kills, the more faction.<br />
<br />
This is if you want to do the faction.  Personally, after switching factions 3 times and maxing them out in SoV, I couldn't care less about faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Can you not find your spells in PoP?  I thought PoK had a spell vendor that was pretty complete?  Havent bout a spell except in bazaar in 5 lvls but.....its been awhile ;)<br />
<br />
Not everybody has PoP.  And there is at least one spell (scale of wolf) that I haven't seen anywhere else.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Caelum</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I encountered the same problem actually.  All of a sudden the FV spell merchant wants nothing to do with me (Barb myself).<br />
<br />
So what I did with the new shared banking is stick a couple 10 slot containers into the shared banking slots along with some plat and a pair of star ruby encrusted steins.  Before the shared platnium slot was installed I would put sellable loot in the shared banking slots to effectively transfer 'cash' to another character when they sold them.  Now with shared plat I just put plats in there instead.<br />
<br />
Then I made a Level 1 DE Enchanter and pumped as many points into CHA as possible.  Using PoK I shipped him over to Overthere.  Buy your spells off the evil vendor instead, stick them in your shared banking boxes, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

My apologies for not including my character's information in my initial post.<br />
