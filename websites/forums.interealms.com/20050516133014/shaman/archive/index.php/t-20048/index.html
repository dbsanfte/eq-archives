<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Haneb Bobanen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think they got rid of the &quot;hell&quot; levels some time ago.  May be wrong though... I know some are harder then others (lvl 59 anyone?) but I think I remember a patch talking about no more hell levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Is ther enot racial hell levels though?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">There are racial experience penalties. In essences over a good many levels you'll have amassed enough to extra exp due to the penalty to &quot;ding&quot; another level on top of your current one had you been a race without a penalty.<br />
<br />
But they took out the literal hell levels some time ago - be glad, they sucked hardcore.</div></div><hr />

They didnt get rid of the hell levels, they just reduced the hellishness of them.<br />
<br />
Notice how 59 is still 'hell', and 60 is cake? Notice when you die at 59 you lose maybe 5% exp, but when you die at 60 you lose about 15%? <br />
<br />
Hell levels do exist, they're just not as bad :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Adonnisninaste</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I believe 59 is the only &quot;hell level&quot; left.  I am yet to see any in the 40s or 50s with my last 3 toons.  But then again, you can get better XP these days which make even 59 trivial.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Shamad, I remember 59 being pretty bad and 60 feeling like half a level, so I guess you're right.<br />
<br />
However, to the orignal poster, trolls and iksars will have a harder time with the hell levels due to their innate exp penalty. IMHO with the sick amount of exp you pull down now as opposed to, say, the Velious era, racial penalties shouldn't keep you from playing the race you want to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I was about halfway through 59 when they removed the hell levels. Level 59 is significantly easier now than it was. Level 60 is such an easy level because its only a half level.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">hell levels are gone, you now just require more exp to level by each level you go up.  Used to be that at level 35, you'd need twice the exp as you needed at lvl 36 to level, and at 40, and at 45, and at 54, and 59.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">59 isn't that bad now, and the rest are all the same since they patched. Pretty sure hell levels are completely gone from the game.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Rehunh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I remember some of those hell levels from when I used to play my ranger and they just plain sucked! None of the leveling I ahve done on my shaman has come close to those old levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Toppo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Hell levels are not completely gone. The experience to get through a hell level is no longer completely insane; the &quot;death penalty&quot; remains. At 60 I could lose more than a full bub of exp on a death; not even close to that at 61. The way it used to work was &quot;hell level&quot; followed by a level of insane exp loss IF you died; the insane loss remains...just don't die :) <br />
<br />
As far as I know racial penalties still apply. I know the Halfling &quot;bonus&quot; still exists :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Petras</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Well, I don't know hah :)  Last night I died *sob lol* and I only lost about 1 blue.  Where as when my friend died (level 52) he lost well over 1 1/2 he said.  He is a human, and I am a troll, so really I think the racial penalty SUCKS :P hah.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Kirisula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I was in late 30s early 40s when Hell Levels were removed. So I experiened both the before and after.  Hell levels are certainly gone for the trip to 50th.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>illitian icerage</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Hell levels have been eased out. But they are NOT gone, despite what SOE says.<br />
<br />
If hell levels were gone, why would you lose 5% of your level when you die at one level, then back to 10% as soon as you ding?<br />
<br />
Hell levels exist, although they may be a bit easier now.<br />
<br />
If you don't believe me, try dying once per level. It'll show you if it's a &quot;normal&quot; level or a &quot;hell&quot; level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They never said hell levels were outright gone, just that they had smoothed out the XP curve a bit. Level 30 used to take longer than 27-29 combined, and that's just not the case anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never claimed what SOE (or Verant) said about hell levels.<br />
<br />
I simply stated that no matter what they say, some levels are hell, and some aren't. Some are even easy.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Level 60 is only a half level. The flip side is that when you die, the xp loss looks more significant as its a greater proportion of level 60 than 59 or 61.<br />
<br />
As others have said, they smoothed out the xp curve ages ago and hell levels no longer exist in the way they used to. Sure, 59 is still a drag and sure, some levels are harder than others but its not what it used to be. <br />
<br />
All in all though - you still need the same xp from 1-60 as you always did.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Here is what I think happened. They eliminated the Hell levels, yes, but, its not like they could spread the XP required for 55 and 59 over the previous 50+ levels, so what happened is the levels NEAR those got increased. I have found, when leveling twinks, that 51 and 52 are still fairly OK, but 53-59 all basically suck. I have the feeling the &quot;super hellness&quot; of 55 and 59 were spread over these 6 levels, making them all a bit suckier. Same for the other Hell areas, 43-49 are slower than 40, 41, and 42, etc etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, unless they change something, 65-66 is going to be bad.  I sometimes go full regular xp to just get it up there so when they do up the cap, I'll be ready.  It moves slow adn you only lose like 2%-4% on a death, not bad, but it means it took LOTS of xp to get it.</div></div><hr />

They removed all hell levels. genius move because no one would start playing EQ now when it would take ages to get to 60. Heck i remember beeing 45 for weeks, living at the frenzied camp in lower guk...when fbss was 20 k ;)<br />
55 and 59 were pretty bad too but 45 without kunark etc was absolute HELL. Even i was planar equipped...from lv 1 on ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heh, you shoulda tried it as a Paladin, or even worse, a Troll SK. My Wiz-Cleric-Rogue-Bard-Warrior group of friends that I started the game with stopped grouping with me because the XP was so horrible with Hybrids.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>sharookan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">errr exp penaltys never affected the grp just the player :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Shummn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">errr exp penaltys never affected the grp just the player :)<br />
Incorrect, the hybrid penalty was distributed over the group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Daekar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">The xp per level curve was smothed out, it still requires the same xp to gain from 30-60 as it did before just got smoothed out (at least as far as I was aware, I'm to lazy to dig up the patch message from that far back).  <br />
As per up to 30 that has a slight xp bonus they added not long ago.<br />
Hell levels or not 50-60 sucks any way you look at it lol.</div></div><hr />
