<br />
ranger have bow dmage, mellee damage and now can almost match us in dd damage. we are so badly out classed. (i not sure we can get close with dot and nuke damage? can we?) (not that i think rangers are overpowered just we underpowered in a group)</div></div><hr />

Recast time on ranger nuke is 30 seconds.<br />
Recast time on beastlord nuke is 30 seconds.<br />
Recast time on shadowknight nuke is 45 seconds.<br />
Recast time on our nuke is 2.25 seconds.<br />

Hybrids do not nuke better than us, not even close.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Where is our disease nuke :(<br />
<br />
If they changed the disease dot to a disease nuke that did like 1250 damage, I'd be pretty happy.  If they made it a fast cast-time with a small but respectable recast (2 second cast time, 10 second recast) I'd die a happy man.  If they also made an easy to get right-click malicious decay item..... oh boy that'd be great :)</div></div><hr />

Well I do have time for 1 nuke at best on a typical LDoN mob.<br />
Do you really think recast time matters in that case?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to mix up your group make up then. I find myself, if im not the main healer, raining and nuking alot and making a noticeable difference, even if its not a huge difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thing that caught my eye was the -500 check on it too. Now that would be sweet. But as im playing a SK alot now, i can see why they have such a modifier. Mana is very very important to them as they need it for their serious aggro control and believe me, when some uber BST or monk in the gorup is slinging around something like a copper hammer or something, you end up casting Terror of Shadows and Dooming Darkness and stacking 2 quick nukes just to keep solid aggro. God help me if in im a group with good aggro weapons and i got no KEI.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Ciele</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I was looking through lucy and I noticed every other class is getting 4 new spells, 3 regular 1 ancient, while it looks like we're getting 2 regular, 1 ancient.  <br />
<br />
Am I missing something?  Did the purported Quiescence upgrade disappear?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>JaedenAvengarious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Still there:<br />
<br />

<br />
Just no class on it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm never in a group that pulls singles.  We always have at least 2 mobs in camp.  Everyone jumps on one mob, and then I get the second.  I hit it with bane, slow it, then start chain nuking it.  I typically get it to around 60% before the group gets to it.  I'd say that recast time definately matters for me, because I am usually chain nuking spear of torment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Will there be new spells for existing classes?<br />
<br />
Yes there's several new spells for each of the existing classes.  Gates <br />
is actually signaling the return of Ancient type spells if you haven't heard it <br />
around the messagebaords already.<br />
<br />
From the GoD chat.<br />
<br />
This, to me, implies that they'll be as rare as the old ancient spells.<br />
<br />
****!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, if I understand you correct, I need to make groups that kill slower so I can nuke 2 times?<br />
Stupid me that I did not realise that the problem was the DPS done by the other group members and that I simply should invite another shaman or 2 to bring down DPS   :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Perhaps I'm not seeing what you're talking about here. You linked the Ranger spell, not the shaman spell.<br />
<br />
It looks as if we're getting an upgraded Canni, not a nuke.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>bara cudar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Jinheim, i never said they had better, i said they where close, which they are. you also forgot they have serval reasonable nukes they can stack, (ie load up to use at same time, and they probably have enough spell gems free to do this)<br />

<br />
same with beast, no they cant nuke quite as good as us if we chain cast,but there are alot closer than you think and how often are we able to chain nuke? diffinately not in ldon, one nuke per mob usually, which is the same for a ranger or beast with 30 sec recast.<br />
<br />
if the mobs is up for long enough for you to chain nuke your better doting the thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Well not quite fair to count say ranger or bst as 30 seconds recast when i keep two nukes on my ranger up so casting twice in those 30 seconds. Very easy to keep two loaded and maybe even 3 with this new spell.</div></div><hr />
