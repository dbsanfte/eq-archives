<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey All!!<br />
OK, I,ve come to the conclusion that the hardest monster in the game to beat is the FIZZLE MONSTER!!  I have a 120+ skill in Abjuration (?), and a 120+ skill in Divination, and I routinely fizzle about 15(!!) times before I succesfully cast Rage, but Invisibility is not a problem.  What is up with that??  Anyone have any advise? (my wisdom is around 175, if that matters) I also have both Specialties at 50.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Beliael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Some spells have a very high fizzle rate. Cannabalize 3, rage/VoTB come to mind. They like to fizzle regardless of what your skills are like.<br />
<br />
Beliael</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yes, get them to 235.  You're level 50, you should really work on maxxing those skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Guntar Ghostdancer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Few quick questions:<br />
<br />
What level are you?<br />
<br />
What spell are you casting? You said Rage? Is that in the Frenzy line (self only buff Abjuration based) or Raging Strength (Strength buff Alteration based).  Been a while since Ive casted those.<br />
<br />
Even at 65 with 285 WIS routinely, I fail 10-15% of the time.<br />
<br />
I think once they added the AA that reduces fizzles, they increased the fizzle rate to make you take it (i.e. more time sink), just a theory though.  I never used to fizzle as much, but that was when I was 60 and casting mostly 55-58 spells.  Now at 65 casting 65 spells I do fizzle more</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kajer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well from my experience Rage is a higher level spell, and the higher level the spell, the higher level the corosponding skill needs to be. For Rage if you are under 200 skill in Abjuration you will fizzle alot. When i learned rage i was at 150 abjuration and the<br />
fizzles were horrible. I decided to sit around one evening for 2 hours and cast my quickest casting abjuration spell i had. I think it was something like poison resist. In 2 hours i had taken it from 150 up to 205, which reduced my fizzle rate from 10 times per cast to about 2-3. Its slowly increased from 205 to 217 since then over the course of a month from just hunting and normal use.<br />
As for the invis not fizzling with 125 divination, invis is a lower level spell, meaning it doesnt require high<br />
level divination to use it. I just got my div to 201 last night and i got acumen the night before. I noticed that i started to fizzle on acumen some. Same thing applies there. Acumen is a higher level divination spell so it will require higher level skill.<br />
Basically just work your skills up as high as you can. Cast as much as you can and you'll notice a difference with improved skill points.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Anyone have any advise?<br />
First, decide what spell skill you want to specialize.  They all can go to 50 but only one can go over that to 200, and that one will only go over 50 when you have at least one point in all of them.  Because of that, people generally only say you've &quot;specialized&quot; in the one that you take above 50.  I would strongly recommend Alteration, but feel free to research and decide for yourself.  Do not go on to step two until you are ready to immediately do step three.  <br />
<br />
Second, go to a shaman trainer.  Put 1 point into each of the specializations that doesn't already have one.  <br />
<br />
(Optional step: Get KEI.)<br />
<br />
Third, go to a quiet corner in a small, quiet zone.  Whatever you do, be certain that you are far enough away from popular hang-outs that people with spell casting messages on will not get spammed. (My favorite spot is behind the waterfall in Rivervale.)  Mem the lowest mana and fastest cast time spell in the skill that you wish to be your primary specialization.  For alteration, Minor Healing has the fastest cast time + lowest mana cost.  Cast it repeatedly on yourself until your chosen specialization hits 51.<br />
<br />
Fourth, either in the same session or at another time finish getting your chosen specialization and it's spell skill to 200.  (Meaning get both &quot;Alteration&quot; and &quot;Specialize: Alteration&quot; to 200, or if not alteration whichever skill you choose.)<br />
<br />
Fifth through eighth, do the same for the remaining spell skills.  Find low mana, fast casting spell and chain cast till maxxed.  Because those specializations can only go to 50, and skill improves much more quickly at lower abilities, the specializations for those will max much more quickly than the main skills.  <br />
<br />
Voilà, dramatically reduced fizzle rates.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hey All,<br />
OK, thanks for all the advise.  I will just go ahead and kill a night doing the skill up in abjuration, I knew about the process, but wasn't sure if that was the problem, Thanks.<br />
Dandi, I didn't say this, but all my spec's are 50 except Alteration, which is about 190 right now.  I did know about the 50 limit on spec's, but I do appreciate your taking the time for the imput, Thanks.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I have the same problem with fizzles, mostly when trying to cast Rage. What I do to fix this is while I am hunting I have Fleeting Fury up and running. I've set up a training hotkey with five lines of &quot;/pause 35,/cast 6&quot; (where ever I have Fleeting Fury mem'd). I target Poochie (my pet) and hit the training key every once and while. With KEI and Pot9 I actually regen mana back while doing this all be it a little more slowly then usual. All this without taking time out of leveling. Oh and the fleeting fury helps out for the few seconds it's up while me and Poochie are fighting the next mob. ^_^</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Ahh okie.  <br />
I also have both Specialties at 50.<br />
...is what threw me off.  My bad for assuming that was the whole story. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thevolcanogod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I have noticed a much lower fizzle rate with Tears of Saryn as I did with Torrent of Poison. I have my Evocation at like 217 and it's going up painfully slow - probably due to low INT on my part. But I did notice a much more reliable cast rate with Tears than I did Torrent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Instead of Alchemy Mastery and Hastened Rabidity, wouldn't have been nice if they had given us a hefty (maybe 6 levels per) AA that would allow you to have 2+ specialities at 200?  I think there are a few peeps who'd like Evoke up there as well as Alter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Kaenil Darkwolf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Man that reminds me - all my casting skills are over 200, except abjuration. And I'm just now realizing our HP buffs seem to be alteration, which may be why my abjur sucks. I can't cast rage or an AC buff or anything unless its many level below me, I'll go OOM trying. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>paragon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">we have skills other than alteration?<br />
<br />
/boggle</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">And here I thought the lag monster was the hardest mob to beat. Well, some days. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I always thought it was divin in north ro :-p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Heyas,<br />
Well, I couldn't handle chain casting fleeting fury for 2 hrs, but I did do it for about 40 min, and raised my Abjuration to 153.  I did notice a lessened amount of fizzles (thank god), Thanks for the advice, and I'll keep chain casting for a little while each day till its about 200.</div></div><hr />

<br />
INT has nothing to do with raising of casting skills for a shaman, our casting skill increases are based off WIS.</div></div><hr />
