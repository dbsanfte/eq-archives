<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Danrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Howdy folks,<br />
I never used to bow kite before simply because my experience was a lack of efficiency of damage and the cost of arrows.  Now I am glad to say I think I am at a point where I think I can do this somewhat efficiently but I lack the experience in bow kiting.  I was curious if there was a difference in damage dealt due to range, i.e. within range but 50 ft as opposed to 100ft, etc..  I was also wondering about height differentials, such as being level with the mob will maximize dmg as opposed to being slightly higher or lower.  Not sure if any of this makes a difference, I was just curious.  If anyone has any information regarding the ins and outs of bow hunting I would be extremely grateful.  I also apologize in advance if this has been addressed here already I couldnt seem to find what I was looking for, probably my search criteria.<br />
Take care all and be safe,<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Aenedor Trueblades</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Damage is constant regardless of Range.<br />
<br />
Constantly low that is unless you have AM1/2/3 ;)<br />
<br />
It would help to know how old your Ranger is?  I bowkited the late thirties in SK.  Root, dot, plink with 2/150 arrows from a trueshot bow.  Repeat until mob is 2-3 bubs of health then melee.  They will turn to run pretty quick.  I got on best with high dark blue cons, i.e. the ones I couldn't solo without dying often.<br />
<br />
I made good money off aviaks.  Paid for my FBSS eventually.<br />
<br />
I don't have an orc shovel so will a /SMACK from my big ol' two hander do?.<br />

<br />
What is the most efficient way to raise archery?  I'm lev 22, with an archery skill of 56.  I'm using a Rough Elm Recurve (13/61) currently, with a mix of arrows - most of what I fletch (current skill 90 and rising SLOWLY) is DMG 3, but sometimes I do a buttload of cheap arrows, just for archery training.  When the opportunity arises, I root dark blue cons and plink away - but it usually takes 2 mobs and a crap load of arrows just to get one skill point.  I've tried 5 times for my Trueshot, still no success - will the skill increase faster once I get this bow?<br />
Am I doing something wrong, or is this just the normal rate of increase given my 13/61 bow?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Daeric</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, if you're bow kiting, 2 things are going to affect your skillup rate (that I've seen experienced and read around here).<br />
<br />
#1) Delay on the bow: less delay = more arrows in the air in less time. You'll go through the same amount or more in arrows, but it'll take less time. (Delay on a Trueshot I think is 45 so you're looking at getting 3 arrows out in the time you were shooting 2 before)<br />
<br />
#2) DEX: Higher dex = more chance of skillups in most if not all weapon catergories including archery. If you have the extra cash, grab a GBS and a JBoM for your weapons when bow plinking. That's +30 dex just in those 2.<br />
<br />
Of course this is all my opinion, It wouldn't be the first time I was wrong!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">OK, GBS=Glowing Black Stone?  What's a JBoM??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Filson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">GBS = Glowing Black SWORD. +20 dex, procs dispell magic on YOU at 46 (or so). Really cheap since the proc really sucks in combat. If you're bow kiting, 300pp for 20 dex.<br />
<br />
JBoM = Jagged Blade of Mourning. +10 dex, nice offhad dmg/dly ratio (13/25). Amazingly these go for about 700pp on my server. It also has 10mr and 3ac.</div></div><hr />

If you can spare the cash I would try and make a Carved Elm with silk string.  The basic elm bow is 13/51 but after the addition of the silk sting and knife it becomes 10/39.  You have a good chance of getting two arrows off with this before the mob reaches you, with 1/150 arrows.<br />
<br />
EDIT: more if you snare the mob and run backwards.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: silk STRING even...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samanthie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Well just a few notes on a couple questions<br />
<br />
1.  On raising your archery skill.  If your goal and endatate is only archery (and not worrig about your fletching skill)  then continue to make the cheapest arrow available (personally I used the 1 damage 150 range ones ....). <br />
<br />
a. There are a couple of items listed above to improve your dex (rate of skillgain)  Tailor your outfit to maximize your dex when you are working skill ups.<br />
<br />
b.   Save up the cash dear and buy 2 items.  One is a fleetiing quiver The quiver is tailored -- best bet is to collect up the items and find a GM tailor to hit the combine key for you or be prepared to spend 2k on one in the Drinal Bazaar.  Do not know the prices on your server .... The quiver offers the best bow haste that you can get -- increasing the number of shots you can get off while pulling before the mob comes into melee range.  At lower level it is then best to go melee for damage at that point<br />
<br />
c.  The other item dear is a faster bow.  At lower levels, you are more concerned about the speed of your bow to keep up your archery as you level.  Remember is it level x 5 + 5 = max skill level for most of the haul to 240.  Select a bow with a very low delay-- there are several no drop bows that you my be able to get, or another ption is to go to Trak Teeth and wait for someone to do the hunter forager cycle so they can get their Seblis key.  If I recall that bow is a 19 50 bow with 3 dex.  Anything is better &quot;speedwise&quot; as compared to the 61 delay that you are currently using.  If you have the funds to purchase a Raincaller you get a 45 delay bow with 6 STR &amp; DEX.  Older rangers are selling their old ones for about 2000pp these days on my server.<br />
<br />
d.  Another technique is while waiting for a group, ask them to plunk away at their mobs for skill gain.  This is especially nice if there is a higher level tolan bracer wearing ranger or a mage who can summon some arrows for you.  Most older rangers will happily summon arrows, if they are not the designated puller (1 cast between pulls was common for me before I got EQuiver)  If not craft your arrows as you go, having placed stacks of supplies or arrows in your bag before you go LFG.   Most people realize that archery should not mess up the aggro too much on the lower level hunting groups.<br />
<br />
e.  Lastly do not forget the people in your group, or friends whose buffies (haste, Boon (255dex) or a host of the shammy stat buffie lines) can help you out.<br />
<br />
2.  I was advised as a young ranger to buy my Trueshot bow and then, over time, slowly build up my fletching skill, crafting only skill gaining arrows for when I pull -- or crafting cheap arrows for those power rchery sessions.  Then when I hit level 50, then speand the time and energy, and most important to a broke ranger, the MONEY to raise the fletching skill to where you want it to be.  Just one rangers point of view, but I liked it so I took it. (/em credits Ranger Kodiakjak on Drinal)<br />
<br />
3.  As for Damage increases based on range-- well I do not see any differance really.  However having a good clean LOS is always nice.  If you can find that grassy knoll (gnoll) from which to fire from, pun intended, you can more often hit the target, without worring about melees jumping in your LOS.<br />
<br />
4.  At level 40 you will be fear kiting some of the wildlife in Eastern Wastes for a portion of your exp.   On those hunting days, another technique is to ffear kite the animal to low health to the point where he is snared and running slow.  Then sheath your high damge weapon back off, and equip your orc shovel, or your bow and work on skill gains.  Just a technique, and it is your call.<br />
<br />
5.  Persoanlly, I did most of my gaining while smacking on other peoples msb, waiting for my spot to open up in a group.  Took my 2HB from (3) to (Max) while waiting on spider groups in Velks Lab.  Although I never use a 2HB these days since tossing my Goranga 2HB, it is nice to know that if you need to use that skill, then you have it available to you.<br />
<br />
6.  /bonk and welcome to the glade dear.  Hope your travels are safe and profitable</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aethien</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks, Filson.  The GBSword actually sounds like it could come in handy in PvP, so long as it takes off the top slot.  But I'm sure it would be random, so of course it would take off my SoW (when I get it).<br />
<br />
But the JBoM does sound nice. Will have to keep an eye out for that.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, on the topic:<br />
<br />
Another technique is while waiting for a group, ask them to plunk away at their mobs for skill gain. <br />
<br />
I've been lucky with this in Everfrost - the Druids Root-Rotting the Ice Giants have been nice and said sure, go ahead. Twice,  I got a skill-up with one arrow.  Makes me wonder if it's because the mob was very red to my mid-20s Ranger. Isn't there also the danger of unrooting a mob if you do damage to it, however?<br />
<br />
And yes, I guess a /bonk is in order, if someone with less than 100 posts can do that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jalim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">/BONK Danrin :)  Welcome to the Glade my friend. <br />
<br />
Yeah, pretty much like everyone else stated, no change in damage etc from a distance, height difference seems to be a big enemy, also when a mob has a corner of itself stuck in a wall, you will see a lot of arrows never hit, and never get a missed message either, known as arrows &quot;poofing&quot;. You also will get the same thing when there is an object/character inbetween you and your mob. <br />
<br />
Glad to see you here Danrin, see you in game :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Mikkyo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Ahhh no... *sigh* I am such a noob.. <br />
<br />
So, does Haste affect archery?  (spells, songs, permahaste?)<br />
<br />
or is it just Quiver haste?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Sarkaukar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Archery is affected by spell haste/item haste/bard break cap haste/quiver.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Taloun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Hello Everyone<br />
 As far as my experience goes with Bow Tactics. I have never seen my Skill improve on a green con, only on blue cons and higher . I am still working on my skill sense I have not maxed out it out at 200. You will be spending a lot on Arrows to raise the two most important one is your Achery and the other is your Fletching . I have done the Rain Caller quest so now I have more STR and DEX which is very useful. When I am in my higher lvls i want to get more wis items so it will help mith my Fletching. Some say this is a mith but I have seen this really improve the speed of your skill going up at this time my Archery is at 197 and Fletching is 187 :cool:<br />
As far as soloing I have Tolans gloves so I have free snare and Tolans vambracers so I have free swarm and I keep my root spell up when I make arrows I make at least 500 or more so that how i have built up my archery hope this helps<br />
 GOOD LUCK ON YOUR QUEST:)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Danrin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Thank you all for your responses.  Raising skill wasnt an issue, I was more interested in some of the subtle mechanics and tricks to maximizing damage, as opposed to the basics(I have kited before, but not a lot ).  I guess I knew more than I thought I did :)<br />
I do appreciate all your advice though folks, there was some good stuff in here for me.  Thanks again :)<br />
