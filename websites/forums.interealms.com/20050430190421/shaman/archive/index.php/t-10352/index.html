lets just hope its not all point and click ... Hope it requires some of the existing tradeskills</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be surprised if the color is only visible to you, and not to the world (ala chat colors and such).  Nice idea with terrible implentation.  GJ SOE.</div></div><hr />

Until we see that nothing is used for the reagents, there is no need to cry.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hmm, I've had a bunch of every color of dye and extract on my sale mule for 3 months (stuff I'd had in the bank for literally 2 1/2 years, since I first ran my smithing skill up and toyed with dying FP before I discovered nobody really wanted a full visible set of bright yellow FP armor :)<br />
<br />
I think I may just withdraw those from sale (at their current 5pp each rate) and wait to see how dying is done. My price may suddenly jump by an order of magnitude or two hehe<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Cali</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The fine plate dyes were a good idea, it was just introduced at the wrong time.   When it did come to be people had discovered better then fine plate armor was cheaper (ie: FREE LOOT).  So it was only a fashion thing.  Which as most people know is a very small part of the community.<br />
<br />
I do remember UO introducing the hair dyes and those &quot;pure black&quot; tubs.  Was lots of fun to be able to pick and choose colors to wear on a daily basis.  But then again, UO was much more materialistic then EQ.   *says the woman who made her fortune into a 2story beach house from the leather bustier and escort business*<br />
<br />
This could just be a little perk to try to keep interest or inspire us.  I honestly cant wait to see what fun things will be colorable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>kiteless</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">actually i kind of hope it doesnt require GM in any tradeskill cause id really like to dye some of my no drop armour and having everyone a GM ust to do that is kind of silly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Tinting might be fun for a toon or two.  I just hope I don't have to invest a ton of cash or pay anyone else to do it for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Duurg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The day EQ turns to be more like UO, I'll quit! :D<br />
<br />
oh, Cali, matter of fact, those UO &quot;pure black&quot; dyes were actually a hack. UO never intended to use pure black, just mostly a dark grey, but by the time they decided to do anything about it, mostly everyone had a pure black dye tub, and it would have caused too much a headache to patch it all gone, so all they did was make it so you couldn't create any pure black dye tubs. So then the smart people never modified the color of the pure black dye tub, and buy another for any other color they wanted to color items with. Also, don't forget, even though UO was easy to dye, you could only dye generic cloth items freely, to dye armor required GM smithing, at the time of making the armor to get the desired color, even then you had about 3 colors for your full plate (dark grey, rose and some other one like gold). Also note that full magic plate was looted off mobs, and even then you couldn't modify the color, so full magic plate was always silver, and not colored.<br />
<br />
Even though VI has an old UO person on the team now, I'd be surprized if it didn't require some master, or GM Smith only to modify their colors on their armor. Unless they add the ability to wear cloaks etc over your armor like UO did, thus giving you the added illusion of full color outfits.<br />
