<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">you know what I would love to see for the shaman to become king of slows again? (beyond slows that do damage, or lower AC, or debuff resists, or an unresistable slow, or anything that would be fair, but would never happen) A Shaman only casting time slow line.  I think the coding is in the game, just reverse the focus effects from spell haste.  At the highest level this would be 4X slower (a 300% addition to casting times - i.e. Complete heal would have a 40 sec cast time instead of a 10sec).  this would allow us to mitigate spell damage more effectively and let us be king of slowing again.  Just an idea.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We are the kings of slowing.  The next best slow out there allows the mob to swing 20% more often than Turgurs.  Whether slowing itself is no longer king of debuffs is another question.<br />
<br />
Spell slow would be a neat tool to have, though.  Might be a better fit with necros than shamans since clerics get spell haste, but I wouldn't turn it down.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kriel Darkbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think that'd be a mostly useless ability. OK, I take that back.  It'd be nice against CH'rs and gaters. REALLY nice against them. But against most everything else it'd be pretty useless. Most mobs, even caster mobs, do more damage with melee than with casting. When they stop hitting someone to cast they are ALREADY lowering their DPS. In a lot of cases, this is true even though they're slowed already. This is of course especially true in PoP. <br />
<br />
I sure wouldn't complain about the ability, but other than a utility spell for ch/gate situations, I don't think it'd be used much. And that's not really what you meant it for (which was dps reduction).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Glimugs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">In essence, changing the mobs perception of time and how fast it can act in that time bubble. BRACY WILL BE VINDICATED!!!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Zatriz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Even if they add a spell casting slow spell, the mobs will still channel better than we do.  :)  they'll get that CH off no matter what.  If they give us that spell, then they have to increase the channel ability on the mobs.<br />
<br />
Doubtful anything other than a mob will have this ability.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It would be a phenomenally useful spell.  I think putting a 4x mod on cast times is ridiculously powerful, but anything up to 2x (20 sec CH) is remotely possible.  I've been hoping to see SOME class get this spell for the last couple of expansions, as it's one of the few ideas left to put in (that I can think of).  Of course I'd like to see it on shamans, since we're one of the few casters with nothing but VP and pooch(es) to use against casters.<br />
<br />
Now that Glimugs has brought it up, I'm doubly anxious to see this spell put into the game.  If only for the vindication of Bracy, so the world can see the genius behind that idiot facade.  She's kind of our own little shaman rainman.  &quot;Faymart sucks&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Demisius</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">For the comment on mobs doing more dmg meleing, thats what would make this spell so nice.   If they take 4x's as long to cast spells they will be casting 4x's as much and do much less mele dmg.   That and it would really help our solo ability working around our need for stuns quite well.<br />

I cant think of anything I want LESS then another way to handhold the melees and waste a spell slot/mana. I dont want some ******* tank calling me a slackass cause Im not slowing the mobs casting time =p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flufy wrote &quot;The next best slow out there allows the mob to swing 20% more often than Turgurs.&quot;<br />
<br />
With Turgurs the mob is attacking at 25% of its normal attack speed.  Swinging &quot;20% faster&quot; would mean that the mob is attacking at 30% of its attack speed (.20 *.25 = .05 more + .25 = .3).  And with enc slow the mob is attacking at 30% of its attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Roxxanne</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Unslowed Mob:  100 dps<br />

5dps difference / 25 dps = 20% more dps with chanter slow, using shaman slowed mob as the baseline.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Lies, dam lies and statistics =)<br />
But yeah 20% is an accurate statistic and just goes to show you can make thing seem what ever way you want by changing how you look at things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
when was the last time you saw a mob fizzle? &gt;&lt;<br />
<br />
i agree it would be fun to have a spell casting slow though..i believe there are already some AoEs certain mobs have to do this.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BattleAxe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">when was the last time you saw a mob fizzle? &gt;&lt;<br />
Mobs don't fizzle - that's why we need a spell to increase the chance for them :cool:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kireiina</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Considering slow is one of the fundamentally broken parts of EQ I don't think they'll be in a hurry to replicate it. I'd like to see them reduce the importance of slow (Fix CH and /defensive while you're at it), rebalance the EQ world to allow for this and then give the shaman some new and varied abilities to re-invigorate the class.... but I don't think i'll wait up for this to happen.<br />
<br />
And that 20% difference between shaman slows and chanter slows is dodgy as. In most cases they're equivalent, once the mob is slowed by either it's toast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Porunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">That math on the DPS just doesn't seem right to me, you're applying the 5 damage difference to the wrong number.  Yes, 5 is 1/5 of 25 and that is 20%, but 5 is also 1/6 of 30 and that's 16%.  The 5 difference is out of 100, that's 5/100 and that's 5%.  The mob is not doing 20% more damage, its doing 5% more.<br />
So if a mob hits normally 100 times at 1 point a hit,after slowing, the shaman is hit for 25 and the chanter is hit for 30.  There is no interaction between the 25, 30, and the 5 points difference between them, those numbers are the results after affecting 100.  The difference is 5 points out of what would have been 100 which is 5%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so as you see, this post makes no sense..and , if i may Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Chewbacca. Chewbacca is a Wookiee from the planet Kashyyyk who carried a gun and ran from the mob. But Chewbacca lives on the planet Endor. Now think about it. That does not make sense.  Why would a Wookiee, an eight-foot-tall Wookiee, want to live on Endor<br />
with a bunch of two-foot-tall Ewoks. That does not make sense.<br />
<br />
But more important, you have to ask yourself what does this have to do<br />
with this case. Nothing. Ladies and Gentlemen, it has nothing to do with<br />
this case. It does not make sense. Look at me. I'm a lawyer defending a<br />
major record company producer and entertainer and I'm talkin' about<br />
Chewbacca. Does that make sense? Ladies and Gentlemen I am not making any sense. None of this makes sense.<br />
<br />
And so you have to remember when you're in that jury room deliberating and conjugating the Emancipation Proclamation, does it make sense? No. Ladies and Gentlemen of this supposed jury it does not make sense. If Chewbacca lives on Endor you must acquit.<br />
<br />
I know he seems guilty. But ladies and gentlemen this is Chewbacca. Now think about that for one minute. That does not make sense. Why am I talking about Chewbacca when a man's life is on the line? Why? I'll tell you why. I don't know. It doesn't make sense. If Chewbacca does not make sense you must acquit. Here look at the monkey , look at the silly monkey.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Bah %, spell casting slow wouldn't just be for MoBs heh heh heh, great for PKs too.  However...<br />
<br />
difference between a chanter slow and shaman slow is 20%<br />
<br />
That is to say, If a shaman and a chanter slowed clones of the same mob, then the chanters mob would deal 20% more damage than the shaman's mob.<br />
<br />
however, compared to an unslowed mob, that mob would only deal 5% more damage.<br />
<br />
20% of 25% is NOT a huge amount of damage. in fact, it is 5% damage.  which is 1/20.  or 0.05.<br />

Thank you.<br />

Seriously.. are you at all familiar with the concept of numbers or are you just pressing random buttons on your keyboard, cuz the above made.. absolutely no sense.<br />
<br />
Look.<br />
<br />
Unslowed Mob:  Hits 100 times in given time period<br />
Shammy Slowed Mob:  Hits 25 times in same time period<br />
Enchanter Slowed Mob:  Hits 30 times in same time period<br />
<br />
&quot;30 is what percent of 25&quot; can be written algebraically (why am I even bothering?):  &quot;30 = 25x&quot;<br />
<br />
Then you isolate &quot;x&quot;:  30/25 = x<br />
<br />
x = 1.2 .. which in this instance is the same as saying 120% (1 = 100%, .8 = 80%, etc.. I'm probably incorrectly assuming you're familiar with decimal/percentage notation).  SO :<br />
<br />
30 is 120% of 25<br />
 <br />
OR<br />
<br />
30 is 20% more than 25!!<br />
<br />
Please.. PLEASE don't ever make me use the chewbacca defense again.<br />

Ok, Johnny's mom owns a grocery store, and in the grocery store they have 100 apples.<br />

A woman comes in on Tuesday that needs to bake a lot of pies for a bake sale, and to bake these pies she needs 75 apples.  This leave's Johnny's mom with 25 apples.<br />
<br />
Then on Thursday, the truck comes with enough apples to make it so Johnny's mom has 100 apples again.<br />
<br />

When you can't mezz or stun them in a group.  40 sec cast time on their Cheal means it never goes off.  It also means things they try and Cheal would prolly die before it went off.

Johnny's mom is selling apples to two customers, one from her store in Wisconsin, another from her store in Maryland.  She has 100 apples in each store.  One customer(a) ordered 75 apples in Wisconsin.  Another customer(b) ordered 70 apples in Maryland.  Customer B left his stock with 20% more apples than customer a, however, customer a(#edited for correctness, but still should not have lacked in point) ONLY BOUGHT 5 MORE APPLES.<br />
<br />
*edit* or using algebra if you really like...<br />
<br />
100 - (.75*100) = 25<br />
100 - (.70*100) = 30<br />
<br />
25/100 = .25<br />
30/100 = .30<br />
<br />
30/100 - 25/100 = 5/100<br />
<br />
5/100 = .05 or 5%<br />
<br />
That is the difference (subtraction) of a shaman's slow and an enchanter's slow<br />
<br />
however, *comparing* the two slows, you would indeed divide.  30/100 * 100/25 = 3000/2500 = 1.2 = 120% which means when you compare there is a difference of 20%.<br />

Upon consulting the oracle at delphi, I believe after a couple of edits I have deciphered your garbled example.  Customer b actually ordered 5 FEWER apples... according to your example.. you said he ordered 70 apples, while customer a ordered 75.

Enchanter's slow reduces it by 70%<br />
<br />
The actual difference in a shaman's slow when compared to an enchanters slow is 6.66666% <br />
<br />
Shaman slows it, it does 25 dps.<br />
Enchanter slows it, it does 30 dps.<br />
<br />
The difference in damage when comparing a shaman-slowed-mob and an enchanter-slowed-mob is 20%.  or 5 dps.<br />
<br />
The difference in the damage that a shaman-slowed-mob deals or an enchanter-slowed-mob deals vs. its normal dps is 5%.  or 5 dps.<br />
<br />
no matter how you look at actual dps reduction, when dealing with a 100dps mob its 5dps difference.<br />
<br />
My brain hurts.<br />
<br />
If you're comparing in relation to the original DPS Shaman and enchanter slows, then it is indeed a 5% difference.<br />
<br />
If you're comparing shaman and enchanter slows to each other, then there is a 20% difference.<br />

The baseline isn't fixed. It's whatever you establish it to be. The poster (Flufy) who initiated the comparative analysis clearly stated:<br />
<br />
The next best slow out there allows the mob to swing 20% more often than Turgurs.<br />
<br />
Thus, the baseline is a mob slowed with Turgur's, and a mob slowed with Forlorn Deeds will indeed swing 20% more often than a mob slowed with Turger's Insects. There's really no room for contention on this one.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">the real thing of it is, that when you claim that an enchanters slow is 20% greater DPS than a shaman slow (when compared to the shaman's slowed mob) That makes it *sound* like its a WHOLE lot of extra reduction when its not.  I mean you could comparatively say that an enchanter hasted deals 16% more damage than a shaman hasted melee too.  however, the enchanter is only increasing their haste 10% over ours (I don't know actual number on haste spells, just was an example).  5% of a MoBs dps, while greater, is not significant.  Which, in the original point of the post, is why I think it would be nice to have another thing to be able to slow, like spell cast times.<br />
<br />
Word meanings are dangerous things.  And so are numbers heh</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Porunga</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">If you want to go back to Flufy's statement that a mob with Forlorn Deeds swings 20% more than a mob with Tugur's, the formula you SHOULD get is (z - yz) = (z - xz) + (additional % of dmg)z<br />
<br />
Where:    Turgur's = 75% = .75 = x<br />
        Forlorn Deeds = 70% = .7 = y<br />
        Damage done = 100% = 1 = z<br />
<br />
And: yz = damage negated with Forlorn Deeds <br />
       xz = damage negated with Tugur's<br />
   (z - yz) = damage of mob affected with Forlorn Deeds<br />
   (z - xz) = damage of mob affected with Tugur's<br />
  <br />
        (z - yz) = (z - xz) + 20%z<br />
        z(1 - y) = z(1 - x + .2)<br />
           1 - y = 1.2 - x<br />
           y - 1 = x - 1.2<br />
                y = x - .2<br />
          y + .2 = x<br />
         .7 + .2 = .75<br />
               .9 = .75<br />
<br />
<br />
of course it dosen't work at 20% because the mob only does 5% more damage.<br />
<br />
       (z - yz) = (z - xz) + 5%z<br />
       z(1 - y) = z(1 - x +.05)<br />
           1 - y = 1.05 - x<br />
          y - 1 = x - 1.05<br />
               y = x - .05<br />
       y + .05 = x<br />
      .7 + .05 = .75<br />
            . 75 = .75<br />

<br />
You might notice, however, in his calculations the line that says &quot;y = x -.20&quot;...enchanter slows equal shaman slows minus 20% damage.  Hehe.<br />
<br />
Also note that .9 does not equal .75...but if you divide .9 by .75, you get 1.2...or 120%.  Whee<br />

As for your second set of calculations in your last post.  Yes, .75 does equal .7 if you add .05 to the .7...very insightful.<br />

<br />
If a shaman slows a mob fully, it does 20% less damage than if an enchanter slows the same mob fully.<br />
<br />
That means if a mob is doing 30k per minute when chanter slowed, the same mob will do 25k per minute when shaman slowed.<br />
<br />
I don't know what game you people who think a 20% reduction in damage is trivial/inconsequential are playing, but in EQ, 20% is a significant fraction.<br />
<br />
And if you're going to keep on with that &quot;it's only a 5% difference&quot; noise, try this:<br />
<br />
Go out and grab a mob.  Any mob that doesn't mitigate slow will do.  Now slow that mob and tank it for 5 minutes.  Add up all the heals you needed during that time period.  Now grab the same mob and chanter slow it, and try increasing the amount of heals by only 5% and see how long you live.  Here's a hint:  You won't last the 5 minutes.  Because the mob is doing 20% more damage.  *****.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>Porgy Beastmaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">You're not comparing the damage dealt by the mob when you quote a 20% difference.  you're comparing the damage dealt after its being slowed.  if you're gonna quote the 20% difference number finish it off say &quot;20% of 25% of the mobs base damage&quot;  Of course you wouldn't say it like that, because that's like leaving an imperfect fraction as an answer... you have to finish it out.  In word problems, of is an indicator for multiplication.  0.2 * .25 = 0.05.  Finish it out, don't stop half way and say &quot;I'm done, look we make it do 20% less damage.&quot;<br />
<br />
Look at it this way.<br />
<br />
An Enchanter slows the mob.  its now doing 30% of its original DPS.  then the shaman goes and overwrites it with his slow.  Now its doing 25% of its original DPS.  SURE, you've had a 20% reduction in damage since from the time the enchanter slowed it... however its 20% OF 25%, not 20% of 100%.  20% OF the remaining 25% damage its dealing.  You've still only actually reduced the mobs damage by 5%.<br />
<br />
Your math teacher would be upset if you left the problem unfinished by saying the mob was doing 20% less damage.<br />
<br />
in the reality of the situation you don't care the difference in the mobs DPS per shaman or enchanter, you care about the difference in damage based on it not getting slowed at all.  I mean SERIOUSLY<br />
<br />
75 - 70 = FIVE<br />

doesn't get a lot simpler than that.</div></div><hr />

Tek<br />
<br />
Sorry, Tek, your analogy is invalid because you're applying the logic incorrectly. You're actually using an unslowed frame of reference in your Mez argument and a shaman-slowed frame of reference in your Forlorn argument. I'll run through both comparisons (turgur's/forlorn and turgur's/mez) in an analogous fashion.<br />
<br />
Turgur's vs. Forlorn<br />
For a given DPS value X:<br />
A shaman slows the mobs 75%, so the mob deals (X - .75 * X) = .25X DPS<br />
<br />
An enchanter slows the mob 70%, so the mob deals (X - .70 * X) = .30X DPS<br />
<br />
It's quite clear that (.30X - .25X) / .25X = .20, so the mob deals 20% more damage if the enchanter slows it, than if the shaman slows it.<br />
<br />
Mez vs. Turgur's<br />
For a given DPS value X:<br />
A shaman slows the mobs 75%, so the mob deals (X - .75 * X) = .25X DPS<br />
<br />
Mez cuts the mobs DPS to 0, or 0X to remain notationally consistent.<br />
<br />
It's equally clear that (0X - .25X) / .25X = -1, which is to say that a mezzed mob does 100% less damage than a mob slowed with Turgur's. <br />
<br />
If, on the other hand, you consider both events from an unslowed frame of reference, then Turgur's is 5% better than Forlorn Deeds (75% - 70%), and Mez is 25% better than Turgur's (100% - 75%).<br />
<br />
This whole discussion is just a frame of reference issue: either 5% or 20% is a correct value in the appropriate frame of reference. I really pity those who can't adjust for that: basic physics classes are going to be painful.<br />
<br />
I'm not even going to address Porunga's &quot;math&quot;. Wow...</div></div><hr />

It is incorrect ot say that a chanter-slowed mob does 20% more damage than a shaman-slowed mob.  <br />
Why?<br />
Because the comparison is between slowed mobs, mobs that have had their base damage affected.   By dividing one result by the other and ignoring your starting point, which is the unslowed mob, you ignoring half of the equation.<br />
<br />
Doesn't that make sense?  Look at it this way, a shaman LEAVES 25% of a mobs damage.  A chanter LEAVES 30% of a mobs damage.  The DIFFERENCE between the damage that is left is 5%.  If you want the differnce between them, you must subtract.<br />
<br />
I go out and grab an orc pawn. In five minutes he hits for 100 points of damage, so i need 100 points of healing.  I slow the mob with Turgur's.  Now in five minutes he hits me for 25 points, and I need 25 points of healing (25% of original heal).  Now a chanter slows it with FD.  In five minutes it hits me for 30 points, and I need 30 points of healing (30% of original heal).  I increased the heal by 5%.<br />

There isn't one mythical 'correct' equation. It all boils down to your frame of reference.<br />
<br />
It is incorrect ot say that a chanter-slowed mob does 20% more damage than a shaman-slowed mob.<br />
<br />
No, no it's not, provided that you establish your baseline as the shaman-slowed mob.<br />
<br />
  <br />
Why?<br />
Because the comparison is between slowed mobs, mobs that have had their base damage affected.   By dividing one result by the other and ignoring your starting point, which is the unslowed mob, you ignoring half of the equation.<br />
<br />
Starting point is all relative. If I say, as a pedestrian standing on a sidewalk, that a car is traveling 40 mph, while a motorist says that the car is traveling at 15 mph, and a Bug Eyed Monster in a heliocentric orbit says that the car is travelling at several thousand miles per hour, we can all be right. There's no absolute frame of reference.<br />
<br />
Doesn't that make sense?  Look at it this way, a shaman LEAVES 25% of a mobs damage.  A chanter LEAVES 30% of a mobs damage.  The DIFFERENCE between the damage that is left is 5%.  If you want the differnce between them, you must subtract.<br />
<br />
Of course, you have to subtract... the issue is what you divide by. And the final result can give you 20% just as validly as it can give you 5%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I go out and grab an orc pawn. In five minutes he hits for 100 points of damage, so i need 100 points of healing.  I slow the mob with Turgur's.  Now in five minutes he hits me for 25 points, and I need 25 points of healing (25% of original heal).  Now a chanter slows it with FD.  In five minutes it hits me for 30 points, and I need 30 points of healing (30% of original heal).  I increased the heal by 5%.<br />
<br />
But the orc pawn died 20% more damage to you when his Deeds became Forlorn than he did while being plagues with Turgur's creepy crawlies. <br />

<br />
Does this make sense for class balance discussion purposes?  Sure, IMO.  Since we are all quite used to what it feels like to fight a shaman slowed mob, this calculation tells us that letting the chanter slow instead of the shaman would cause the mob to do 20% more dps than we are used to after the mob is slowed.  This would require 20% more healing than we are used to, which would be significant but no biggie in most exp groups, and would be a big deal on raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the post that started the 20% vs 5% debate in this thread.  The frame of reference is enchanter slowed dps vs shaman slowed dps, with original dps not a part of the end of the equations.  In this problem, a mob does 100 dps unslowed.  This, however, is not what you've been asked to solve.  You were asked the % difference between a 30 dps mob and a 25 dps mob.<br />

BUT ALSO:<br />
Did you know the method beastlords solo mobs (such as in BoT) causes them take *MORE* damage than a shaman.  <br />
- Yes the entire issue about slowing revolves around a random_beastlord_01 soloing in insert_random_zone01 here. Game balance should be only done with soloing in mind.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
While the shaman stands in front of the mob busily casting Damaging dots.<br />
- Again, game balance revolves around a random_shaman_01 soloing. You forget that (1) VI is pushing everyone to groups (LDoN) AND there is a new raid expansion in the works plus PoP is a raid expansion. In both group (well many group situations) and raids BST owns a shaman.<br />
<br />
The Beastlord's melee causing him to take up to 300 to 500+ additional damage for *EACH* successful reposte the mob performs.<br />
- Totally irrelevant in raids. No one gives a $hit if BST takes a few extra hits from riposte when this fellow is soloing. Same thing applies to groups. Again the main focus of the game: raids and groups.<br />
<br />
How does the beastlord handle all this hp lose?  What with his Discipline that heals like Torpor for every *12 MINUTES*?   :rolleyes: <br />
- You know how guilds beat many encounters easy? MGB Paragon. Of course, your entire EQ game is centered around soloing... And don't tell me Paragon is useless in groups also ...<br />

Please don't make me laugh.  A lot of Beastlords just don't get it still, go back to your shaman already. :cool:<br />

*tsk *tsk You hate to hear how much a waste of time the BST class is.<br />
<br />
The public in EQ knows especially in BoT when slow comes to mind get a shaman.  They not only slow the best but give the best buffs to each individual in the group.  This makes the individuals of the group feel they are doing their best.  Remmeber it is human nature to want to better ones self.  What is BST?  Oh yeah, Second best.  <br />
<br />
BSTs do blow at soloing compared to shamans!  And if, your going to worry about getting into groups all day well then you need to focus on making friends not the performance of your class.<br />
<br />
So if I solo better than a BST and get exp groups and into raids because I am social and friendly.  What do I have over a BST everything.<br />
<br />
Paragon is JOKE any skill that heals like torpor an takes 12 mins to refresh, I got news for you, ain't no raid winning ability.  If we are going to talk about hybrid healing why don't we talk about how a hybrid like a Paladin heals better than a hybrid like a Beastlord? :cool:</div></div><hr />

- Let's name the insane number of mobs who had mana drain AE during Velious: Aaryonar. You also forget that in NToV you can easily avoid AE by being behind a wall or around the corner. Not to mention that Aaryonar is also FULLY slowable. Maybe Vulak or Lady Mirinella had some mana drain, but it's all irrelevant, casters will not get hit by AE because they can dodge it, &quot;hide&quot; from it.<br />
<br />
Here is some leet beta infoz for you: quite a few mobs have mana drain AE today! Quite a few encounters last very LONG time (45 min Xegony CH rot anyone?). How about pumping mana to AEers during Coirnav run? Paragon is more than a usefull gimick. Not to mention mobs like TT/Saryrn (time version) are also immune to slow and pump out some nice melee damage + insane AEs including mana tap. When you are actually done with Velious, and maybe get into the tougher mob selection, you'll change your tune.<br />
<br />
But keep telling yourself that Paragon sucks and that for game balance only BoT and soloing matters.<br />
<br />

Right from the bat Beastlords are taking 40% more damage from a slowed mob than Shamans.<br />

Next, I don't think you solo all that often.  What upper level shamans do you know after casting dots sits infront of the mob.  This means we take even less damage than the idiot beastlord meleeing.<br />

Zorlac Sabboth<br />
<br />
I was pointing out that Guilds have been fighting mobs that mana drain even before beastlords were about.  Velious days was one of these points.  And by the way if you want to get so picky about raid knowledge you missed some mobs that mana drain from Velious, such as Yelinak (sp?).  Mana draining mobs are nothing new.<br />
<br />
The point is that a torpor like heal and mana recovery ability from a beastlord is no raid winning ability.  Come to think of it last time killing Xegony we didn't even have a beastlord there.<br />
<br />
Besides, there are other classes that have fast/huge mana recovery.  Mana replenishment ain't nothing new.  Infact, I can quickly think of 3 other classes that can get at least 1000+ mana in seconds if they need it.  <br />
<br />
I am still waiting to hear why beastlords are better than shamans.</div></div><hr />

Your getting so rialed up and your throwing new spells in the mix this is great.  And hilarious.  Seriously!<br />

Hey Zorlac your trying to argue that Paragon is dead necessary to take Any PoP Boss with quote 'Badass AEs.'  Paragon which refreshes every 12 mins and heals at most only 2K is Dead necessary for any PoP raid. LOL...<br />
<br />
I just told you the last time we took Xegony we didn't have a Beastlord for that matter.   Wizards and Clerics were more than enough.<br />
<br />
In EQ now adays there are few events where at least one class of one kind is dead necessary.  Maybe a very good MA Tank...  Or in some cases maybe the best slow.... oh but that comes a shaman  :D  not a beastlord.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u74"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p74">If you want to go back to Flufy's statement that a mob with Forlorn Deeds swings 20% more than a mob with Tugur's, the formula you SHOULD get is (z - yz) = (z - xz) + (additional % of dmg)z<br />
<br />
Where:    Turgur's = 75% = .75 = x<br />
        Forlorn Deeds = 70% = .7 = y<br />
        Damage done = 100% = 1 = z<br />
<br />
And: yz = damage negated with Forlorn Deeds <br />
       xz = damage negated with Tugur's<br />
   (z - yz) = damage of mob affected with Forlorn Deeds<br />
   (z - xz) = damage of mob affected with Tugur's<br />
  <br />
        (z - yz) = (z - xz) + 20%z<br />
        z(1 - y) = z(1 - x + .2)<br />
           1 - y = 1.2 - x<br />
           y - 1 = x - 1.2<br />
                y = x - .2<br />
          y + .2 = x<br />
         .7 + .2 = .75<br />
               .9 = .75<br />
<br />
<br />
of course it dosen't work at 20% because the mob only does 5% more damage.<br />
<br />
       (z - yz) = (z - xz) + 5%z<br />
       z(1 - y) = z(1 - x +.05)<br />
           1 - y = 1.05 - x<br />
          y - 1 = x - 1.05<br />
               y = x - .05<br />
       y + .05 = x<br />
      .7 + .05 = .75<br />
            . 75 = .75<br />
<br />
I hope that was clearer than my original post,.. I'm gonna go watch South Park now.<br />
<br />
Now put the first formula like:<br />
&lt;pre&gt;<br />
     dmg W/FORL = dmg W/TURG + 20% &lt;b&gt;dmg W/TURG&lt;/b&gt;<br />
           (z - yz) = (z - xz) + 20%&lt;b&gt;(z - xz)&lt;/b&gt;<br />
           z(1 - y) = z (1 - x + .20(1-x))<br />
              1 - y = 1 - x + .20 -.20x <br />
          1 - y = 1 - 1.20x + .20<br />
          -y = -1.20x +.20<br />
          y = 1.20x -.20<br />
          0.7 = 1.20*0.75 - .20<br />
          0.7 = 0.9 - 0.2<br />
          0.7 = 0.7                   <br />
&lt;/pre&gt;<br />
<br />
Thats what it means that mobs slowed w/forl make 20% more dmg &lt;b&gt;than mobs slowed w/turg&lt;/b&gt;<br />

<br />
let see, when both shaman and chanter cast slow on an unslowed mob(100dps -&gt; 30dps or 25dps), the difference is only 5% when compare to unslowed mob's dps; now if look at bias way, like chanter cast on an unslowed mob(100dps -&gt; 30dps), and shaman cast slow to overwrite chanter's slowed mob(30dps-&gt;25dps), our slow spell will make chanter's slowed mob do 20% less damage compare to chanter's slowed mob;<br />
<br />
how about you have $100 and a chanter steal $50 off you so you have $50 left then a shaman take $25 of you so you have $25 left ; now at the end of day you try tell your mother that a shaman steal 50% off you, it is only 25% not 50% !<br />

<br />
The game is timed in tenths of second.  That's why Delay is expressed in tenths of a second.  That's why there's a difference in the number swings between someone who is 80% hasted and one who is 100% hasted.  Slow is nothing more or less than inverse haste.  That's how my bard can swing mainhand multiple times a second when hasted 126%, but can't when hasted 90%.... yet he has no double attack AAs.<br />
<br />
Some math... say a mob attacks twice every 2 seconds.  His delay is 20.  He is slowed 75% by Turgur's.  This affects his delay as follows:<br />
<br />
Actual Delay: 100/(100+A) * weapon delay<br />
<br />
Where A is haste %.  Turgur's is effectively -75 haste.  This makes the mob delay 80, swinging once every 8 seconds.  Forlorn Deeds is effectively -70 haste.  This makes the mob delay 67, swinging every 6.7 seconds.<br />
<br />
Log it, parse it, check it....you'll see I am right.<br />

Actually Barm, if you want to be analagous to the original argument, then you would say that 2% is one percent slower than 1%, or that a chanter slowed mob does 1.02% more damage than a shaman, depending which side of the discussion you come down on.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I was trying to point out just how silly it is to fixate on the differences with examples where you had a whopping 100% improvement while dieing 99% and 98% as fast.<br />

exactly, the slow is only 5% better, but:<br />
A mob that does 400 DMG/tick to you unslowed, will do:<br />
 120 DMG/tick when slowed 70%<br />
 100 DMG/tick when slowed 75% <br />

<br />
Spell slow would be a neat tool to have, though.  Might be a better fit with necros than shamans since clerics get spell haste, but I wouldn't turn it down.<br />
<br />
Necros already have every skill in the game. They don't need more. <br />
<br />
Personally I would like to see shaman be the kings of curses. NO SOUP FOR YOU! Boom, %T is now casting 300% slower for 90 seconds. NO SOUP FOR YOU! Boom, %T is now taking 150dmg per tick and is 50% melee slowed for 30 seconds. NO SOUP FOR YOU! Boom, %T is now taking 278dmg per tick and is MR, CR, PR, debuffed by 40 points for 30 seconds. <br />
<br />
There is a casting slow curse in the game. I have been hit with it by traps in LDoN dungeons. After cursing my misfortune and wishing I had less remove curse, I really really wished I could cast it myself.<br />
<br />
Curses seem to fit the shaman class IMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The difference between slows is only important when it has a significant impact on the risks of killing the mob. On a raid mob where the tolerance is tight every percentage of slow can count. Alternatively there's probably only a tiny number of XP groups that depend on the difference. Heck, for the vast majority of XP groups beastlord slow is probably more than sufficient.</div></div><hr />

Ok, let s get THIS one !<br />
yummy spell (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3852&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
And while we are here, let's feedback to get this (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4015&amp;source=Live)  curse</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u94"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p94">exactly, the slow is only 5% better, but:<br />
A mob that does 400 DMG/tick to you unslowed, will do:<br />

<br />
Not fake numbers, just simple maths: the mob did to you 20% more dmg when slowed 70% than when slowed 75%<br />
- So ... if a warrior comes around with a Willsapper and slows mob before shaman, it will actually be hasted right? Because mob then does over 100% damage compared to shaman slow right? Or a mob unslowed (0% slow) does infinite damage?<br />
<br />
Why don't we stop this politician talk bullcrap and do damage over time.<br />
<br />
400 / tick = 4000/minute.<br />
100 / tick = 1000/minute.<br />
120 / tick = 1200/minute.<br />
<br />
In my book, 200 damage difference over 4000 total possible is NOT 20%. It's 5%. Yes I am aware that if you take 1000 as base, then 1200 is 20% more. That's IRRELEVANT. That's not comparing apples to apples.<br />
<br />
Skew with statistics all you want, in the end, damage over time will give the clear picture: 5% difference. 10% for BST slow.<br />
<br />
So let's stop this bullcrap and have idiots come out of the woods proclaiming that shaman slow is God's gift to humanity when in fact is barely better than enchanter and a bit better than beastlord slow (in theory). In practice, if Viscerator's tests can be confirmed than it's even worse. Then there is no difference.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u95"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p95">It is NOT IRRELEVANT. <br />
The dmg you take is 1000 or 1200. If you put 4000 in the formula you ar not comparing the slows between them, &quot;you're not comparing apples to apples&quot;.<br />
<br />
And by the way, an unslowed mob will do 400% more DMG than a slowed mob. that's not infinite.<br />
And a mob slowed with the Willsapper (35%) will do 260/tick, so it will do 160% more dmg than a mob 75% slowed. It will not be hasted, just less slowed.<br />
<br />
AND, with your formula, a 100% slowed mob (never hits, 0dmg / tick) is only 25% better slow than ours? I say there is a problem with your formula.<br />
I say a 100% slow is infinitely better than our slow, am I wrongh?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u96"><b>trolebus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p96">Self-correction, <br />
an unslowed mob will do 400% the DMG of  a slowed mob.<br />
or<br />
an unslowed mob will do 300% more DMG than a slowed mob</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u97"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p97">So are you saying that in my example, that 200 damage that the shaman prevented out of 4000 possible is 20%? Again, I am aware if you put shaman slow as base over in my example that the 200 damage will be 20%. However, wherever you are trying to put higher numbers  for shaman slow efficiency OR if you are trying to portray enchanter slow as being 20% inferior as shaman slow, in the end, the damage done by mob is barely 5% of the unslowed damage. And that 5% is what counts. That's the extra damage the tank is going to have to absorb. If you continue to proclaim that enchanter slow is 20% worse than shaman slow, then people will come out and tell you that Willsapper actually gives the mob HASTE.</div></div><hr />

Mingh, would that be 100 percent of the base content of that thread or 100 percent of the content, you didn't skip already to begin with?  :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u100"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p100">Because it sure as hell, looks like he is trying to say the 5% difference between enchanter and shaman slow is equal to 5% of the total damage done by the &quot;unslowed mob&quot; to the tank.<br />
<br />
- Taking trolebus' example:<br />
<br />
exactly, the slow is only 5% better, but:<br />
A mob that does 400 DMG/tick to you unslowed, will do:<br />
 120 DMG/tick when slowed 70%<br />
 100 DMG/tick when slowed 75% <br />
<br />
Over a one minute fight<br />
Unslowed = 4000 damage.<br />
Tugured = 1000 damage.<br />
Forlorned = 1200 damage.<br />
<br />
Difference between Forlorned and Tugured is 200 damage. Wich is 5% of the total unslowed damage.<br />
<br />
You don't have to remind me that 1200 is 20% more than 1000. Thus from that point of view chanter slow is 20% worse than shaman slow.<br />
<br />
20% or 5% are both valid answers depending from your perspective.<br />
<br />
Does that make more sense now?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u103"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p103">Three less average attacks could be the diffences between the tank taking as little as 480 damage extra to 690 damage extra.<br />
- Over a long period of time it will be 5%. Parse it. Sure over one minute that extra attacks could ALL land or could NONE land, hell with probability you could run a 100000000 hour test and the mob will all miss. If you run a test for 20+ minute parses I am willing to bet the difference is 5%. <br />
<br />
No cover up. No conspiracy.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
I ran a few tests his morning, basically 6 tankings of the mist panther in WL, 2 x Togored, 2 x Tugured and 2 x Unslowed. Level 61 or 62 mob, hits like a sissie.  Had no AC buffs whatsoever, no AGI either. Each test lasted 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
The average of the two tests were as follows:<br />
<br />
Unslowed damage: 38278, DPS: 31.98, AVG Dam: 77.64, Accuracy: 53.41% <br />
Tugured(75%) damage: 9916, DPS: 8.25, AVG Dam: 78.80, Accuracy: 54.15%<br />
Togored(70%) damage: 12162,  DPS: 10.19, AVG Dam: 79.49, Accuracy: 54.24%<br />
<br />
The difference between Togor and Tugur is 2246 damage. This 2246 damage is 5.8676% of the total 38278 damage. Now that's pretty close to 5%. And if I wouldn't lose my sanity of pure boredom or if I would install a macro program, I could do parses over hours of time and that will also show the same endresult. PS: No I won't do that.<br />
<br />
Of course, if you take 8.25 DPS as baseline for comparison, 10.19 DPS is 23.15% more. Now that's pretty close to 20%. So, again, both ways of looking at slow are correct. BUT, at the end of the day, I only had to soak an extra 5% damage compared to unslowed total damage. Don't forget the DPS values are perfectly inline with % that many posters pointed out in this thread. 8.25/31.98 does give the DPS % people were poiting out: 25.7973% and Togor: 10.19/31.98 is 31.8626%. Both values extremely close to 25% and 30%, shaman slow and enchanter slow.<br />
<br />
If you still don't beleive it, go parse it yourself.<br />
<br />
Now, back to your regulary scheduled conspiracy theory or South Park, wichever you prefer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Folks. I hit a critter. It dies. You hit a critter it dies. We both hit a critter it dies. <br />
<br />
Is a shaman slow the best i the game. Yes. Does that best in the game really mean a whole hell of a lot in the long haul? Not really.<br />
<br />
Some critters will do a bit more damage with an enchanters slow. But guess what When the tanks are hasted by the enchanter they do more damage too so the critter is dying slightly faster. So gets less swings. So is in fact better than the shamans slow.<br />
<br />
But we throw in FA and hey our tanks are doing more damage too. Yay us. Then the chanter charms a pet and does more damage than Gloriana in a choclete bunny factory. Hmm point enchanter. <br />
<br />
Then we add in dots and pulling and heals and Mutt and cannabalize. And all the other things and we get a point.  Then the chanter comes in and adds up all thier crap. And they get a point.<br />
<br />
Then a beastlord comes in and pees all over the carpet. (Sigh)<br />
<br />
It really doesnt matter all that much. Yes the slow is 5% better Or 20% more mob DPS. Or some such. But considering all of the variables involved Like lag and your wife nibbling on your ear and distracting you at a key point, and the kids hitting each other with a rolling pin. and afk's and ghosting and all the other things. Well. 5% is a drop in the bucket.<br />

Argue all this crap all you like. But in the end You are like the old guys griping in a barber shop. Noone really cares but you gripe just the same because it is more fun to gripe about inconsiquintal ****. than realize that all the time invested in something was not tangible in the least.<br />

<br />
Baseline: Unslowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 60 seconds (1 minute) in a 60 minute fight for total of (100 * 61 hits) 6100 total damage. (NOTE: each hit total increased by 1 for first initial hit.)<br />
<br />
Shaman 75% Slowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 105 seconds (1.75 minutes) in a 60 minute fight for total of (100 * 35.2856 hits) ~ 3529 total damage.<br />
<br />
Enchanter 70% Slowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 102 seconds (1.70 minutes) in a 60 minute fight for total of (100 * 36.294 hits) ~ 3629 total damage.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Unslowed DPS = 1.666..<br />
75% Slowed DPS = 0.98 (58.8% of unslowed dps)<br />
70% Slowed DPS = 1.008 (60.72% of unslowed dps)<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Mitigated Damage:<br />
<br />
Shaman 75%: 6100 - 3529 = 2571 damage not taken or ~42% less damage<br />
<br />
Enchanter 70%: 6100 - 3629 = 2471 damage not taken or ~40% less damage<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Slowing a mob does not reduce dps by the factor of the slow; 70% or 75% slow does not reduce mob damage output by 70% or 75%. It only reduces the speed at which the mob attacks by the given percentage. It takes the mob 70/75% longer to perform a swing/hit/attack.<br />
<br />
Slowed mob goes from hitting every cycle of its attack rate to every 1.75 (or 1.7) times its cycle when slowed.<br />
<br />
The misunderstanding, it seems to me (or this is where I am totally out in space by myself!!!), is the assumption that slowing 75% reduces the total damage output by 75%. Not true. In the above example the mob hits (unslowed) 61 times in a minute. When slowed 75% the mob hits ~35 times ... once every 105 seconds (36 times, once every 102 seconds for 70%). Actual damage reduction is shown in &quot;Mitigated Damage&quot; and is more along the lines of ~40-42%.<br />
<br />
(Ignore the fact the mob is still living (as are the players) an hour later, but hey, they knew it was for testing and somehow made it all work out. Pretty sure they went out for beers afterward ... but, I digress.)<br />
 <br />
While dmg output of the mob is reduced, over X amount of time that reduction will not be equal to the % of the slow. It is a respectable reduction though. Depending upon the actual dps of the mob the range seems approximately 36 to 44% damage reduction and all inbetween with the 75% slow running an average of 1.5-2% better reduction.<br />
<br />
So, unless and until someone can explain how fogged in I am, as I understand slowing itself it definitely reduces damage output of the mob but not by the factor of the slow %. Also, the difference in damage mitigation between Shaman and Enchanter slow is minimal at best. Same can be said for Beastlord slow at 65.<br />
<br />
------<br />
Same thing with different numbers:<br />
<br />
Baseline: Unslowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 3 seconds in a 1 minute fight for total of (100 * 21 hits) 2100 total damage. (NOTE: each hit total increased by 1 for first initial hit.)<br />
<br />
Shaman 75% Slowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 5.25 seconds  in a 60 second fight for total of 12.429 hits ~ 1243 total damage.<br />
<br />
Enchanter 70% Slowed Mob hits for 100 dmg every 5.1 seconds  in a 60 second fight for total of 12.765 hits ~ 1277 total damage.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Unslowed DPS = 35<br />
75% Slowed DPS = 20.72 (59.2% of unslowed dps)<br />
70% Slowed DPS = 21.28 (60.8% of unslowed dps)<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
Mitigated Damage:<br />
<br />
Shaman 75%: 2100 - 1243 = 857 damage not taken or 40.8% less damage<br />
<br />
Enchanter 70%: 2100 - 1277 = 823 damage not taken or 39.2% less damage</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u106"><b>Ordrek</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p106">^^^Thats how I have always understood it.<br />
<br />
Slow is expressed as a multiplier for swing time, not a reduction in DPS.  IE a 75% slow means it take the mob 175% as long to perform the same number of swings.  If it were a reduction of 75% from 100% the mob would swing 25% as often and would take FOUR times as long to swing as normal.  Now I havn't played EQ for a long time, but that doesn't sound right.<br />
<br />
Do mobs really take 4 times as long to swing when shaman slowed?<br />
<br />
The bottom line is if shaman slow is expressed as an increase to swing time, then shamans are only marginally better slowers than others (just under 3% more damage taken by a chanter slowed mob or 1.75/1.70).  If shaman slow is expressed as a reduction in DPS, shaman slow is clearly better (the 20% damage difference is accurate).<br />
<br />
For the math impaired, consider a more extreme example:<br />
<br />
Assume enchanters slowed for 98% and shamans for 99%.  When you subtract 98 from 100 you get 2%.  When you subtract 99 form 100 you get 1%.  2% is clearly double 1%.  If slows were set up like this a mob slowed by an enchanter would dish out twice as much damage as an mob slowed by a shaman.  IE the chanter slowed mob would do 100% more damage than the shaman slowed mob.<br />
<br />
Its not mathemagic guys, its simple arithmatic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u107"><b>Zorlac Sabboth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p107">The way I understand it: 1 swing every 60 sec unslowed results in 0.25 swings every 60 seconds if the mob is Turgured. Parses confirm it.<br />
<br />
Slow does not &quot;slow&quot; time, it slows the rate at wich a mob swings. 1 swing/sec = 0.25 swing/sec for tugur, 0.30 swing/sec  for togor/enchanter or 0.35 swing/sec for beastlord, 0.5 swings/sec for Tigir ... and so on.<br />
<br />
Check out Thott's assesement: http://www.afterlifeguild.org/Thott/priest_mitigation.php<br />
<br />
 I.e. if a mob could do 400 dps normally, then slowed it will only do 100 dps<br />
<br />
Now I don't agree with his conclusion of the priest tests globaly, but even a bard understands that a 400 DPS mob slowed by Turgur will only put out 100 DPS. This has been confirmed by countless parses and even by Thott himself.<br />
 <br />
FFS it's not hard, parse it.<br />
<br />
Now back to another conspiracy theory.</div></div><hr />
