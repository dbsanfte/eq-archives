<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Strikethrough, gives you the ability to circumvent any defensive abilities a mob has. So say you're attacking from the front (since strikethrough is worthless from behind), and the mob Dodges one of your attacks.  This bracer would give you a 4% chance to ignore the dodge and hit the mob anyway. Strikethrough also stacks, so potentially, you could be totally immune to any defensive moves a mob throws at you. Potentially, of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Im not sure about the others and to be honest the above was copied from a unoffical scource.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">afaik, there is no guide.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shielding is a percentage decrease in the mob's Damage Bonus.<br />
<br />
say you have 10% shielding, and you're fighting Vindi. his damage bonus is 200, and his DI is 25. thus his minimum hit is 225 and his max is 700.<br />
<br />
10% shielding would cut 20 damage off of every hit, so his minimum would be 205 and his max would be 680.<br />
<br />
that doesn't sound too impressive, but when you're fighting a mob like Fennin Ro whose damage bonus is like 950, that takes 95 damage off every hit, so it's quite significant.<br />
<br />
Avoidance is a bit trickier, do a search for Plane of Time mods, and there's a thread that explains it. I'll find it later.<br />
