<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">OK, finally found a store in my area selling the EQ collection, so I have my 3rd account. I am running a war and a mage on one account, shaman on the other. What I am wondering is if I should run a cleric or dr00d on the new account. I know I want a cHealer for trioing stuff like UP, ToV, BoT, and Tactics named where the war is tanking, (or maybe the higher level mage pet when he gets it?) but I am not sure which to go with. Anyone have any experience with this?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">cleric would be more capable of just healing (larger cheal and faster direct heals), and you get free 96% rezzes...so if all you want is someone to heal, cleric wins.<br />
<br />
druid has the utility like snare and evac and heals nearly the same as a cleric, and when you arent in need of healing, can add quite a bit with nukes.  Also you can get places faster with ports (especially useful for your warrior getting in and out)<br />
<br />
so..do you want the better healing + rezzes<br />
or the ~5k heals and snare/evac/ports/nukes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Druids also have charm which helps quite a bit in tactics :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Icebreaker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Aye... have been looking at it some more and now I am contemplating adding a pal / nek or sk / mag... not sure who well this would work though... probably need to just close my eyes and pick lol !</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">What level is the warrior?  Could pay to have him transferred to your 3rd account.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Einnod</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">imo, do the druid. I randomly 3 box a druid, ench, and shaman in BoT to kill minis, and it works great. the snare is something that you just can't pass up for the pet. gives ya a few secs to mez the pet if charm breaks, then recharm at will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Suddail</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Utility and pets are overrated. DPS is what you need... and pulling. Your xp / hour is really only what mattes when making a new bot class.<br />
<br />
Sure you can make an enc, and arguably do the best dps/hour. But do you know how stressful it is to box 3 chars with an enc to charm? Also, do you know how much you would die?<br />
<br />
If you made a wizard, how would you pull mobs? Double mobs are impossible in POP, and any non harmo/fd class cant pull.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make a necro. EEs are 75 PP nowadays. 75pp is not much at all when you think about it, you can get 2 rezzes per a raw diamond or whatever. You shouldn't be dying alot.<br />
<br />
Necros are awesome AFK dps, topped only by wizards. Stick pet on a mob, stack 2 dots then FD. Feed mana to your shaman if hes LOM. Necros are also in my opinion the second best pullers in the game behind bard, because they get both root and FD and snare also. Pull a mob, root it, fd, other mob goes back to spawn. You can do the same thing with snare, and it work everywhere even in ldon, the only case is unrotable mobs.<br />
<br />
Necros also get 2 HS which is really helpful in pulling.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this in one class seems really overpowered to me, but whatever, it means you can benefit from it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">a necro mage shammy trio is really nice. Mage summons toys for all the pets, necro snares and dots, shammy slows and dots and can tank, got decent mana regen with necro lich, shammy canni and mage mod rods. Necro's get semi decent lifetap nukes and they can heal and rezz, shammy can heal and buff, mage can coth etc etc. The only utility ya lack is port and track. Ports not needed for PoP and track isn't needed alot. Most PoP named spawn in the same place everytime as well as many old world dungeon named.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I play in a Shaman, Necro, Druid trio and it works well. We were going to use a Mage instead of the Druid but the person two boxing didn't like the Mage (personal preference) and decided it would be more rewarding in the end to be sac'ing the Druid for EEs :)<br />
<br />
We're still at the point where having me (the Shaman part of the trio) tank works. When we get to the point where that isn't viable we'll just switch to agro kiting or root/rot, whichever. <br />
<br />
The trio won't be able to go against everything but what we can fight dies fast.</div></div><hr />
