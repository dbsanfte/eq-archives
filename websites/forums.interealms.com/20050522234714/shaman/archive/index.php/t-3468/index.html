<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm a n00bie shammy and im just wondering, whats torpor? all i know is that its a skill</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Rathin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">umm, no.  It's a heal over time spell that snares and reduces the targets attack speed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">meant spell he, im thinkin one thing writing another, so its a slow, y does it heal the target snare and slow it then, isnt the heal bit pointless</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Not a skill, it's a spell.<br />
<br />
Level 60, friggin rare drop (not vendor) spell.<br />
<br />
It heals 1200 hit points over 24 seconds for 200 mana (hope I got that right, or the anal retentive army will just tear me up).  It has two negative side effects, snare and slow.  Thus, melee types tend not to like it during a fight, but it is one of the most mana-efficient healing spells in the game (beaten only by Complete Heal).<br />
<br />
The AA skills can work to improve it by making it cast faster and/or last longer.  If you make it last longer, you can get an extra 'tick' (6 seconds), which is worth another 200 hit points.  While I haven't gotten there yet myself, I think you can get Torpor to heal up to 1800 hit points by maxing out the AA skills related to duration.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">telosk,<br />
<br />
Torpor is a great heal (good for melee downtime healing or healing casters and priests anytime but particularly with AOE damage) but its power in the high end game is related to mana regeneration.  The shaman cannabalize line takes 148 hitpoints at level 58 and 1924 hitpoints with the AA skill.   Torpor makes the AA cannabalize skill that takes 1924 hitpoints and returns 1000 mana (or something like that) an extremely viable method of self mana regen.<br />
<br />
A shaman using a combination of Can IV, Can V and torpor can make obscene amounts of mana.  Add mages with their mod rod 2 spell (900 hitpoints for an amount of mana I can never remember) and you can set up a mana factory that gives clerics and casters enough mana to fight effectively in battles that last 30+ minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Shamam</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Torpor = Level 60 shaman spell. 200mana heal 1200hp in 6 tick; also all type of haste and Sow will 'pause' for 6 tick and snare and slow you for 6 tick too<br />
<br />
with torpor, you can regen your mana ubber fast<br />
with torpor, you don't have to med anymore<br />
with torpor, you don't feel suck anymore<br />
with torpor, you are 2x more powerful, you are a lvl70 Oracle !!!!</div></div><hr />

Well if im only healer in the group they either get torpor or  they die, and DPS is even lower when they are dead :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Telosk, the slow and snare for 24 seconds sounds bad, and it IS annoying, but outside of certain staple spells like cannabalize and slow, I'd say that torpor is the single most important spell in the shaman arsenal at 60.  It's that good.<br />

<br />
3 hours of 26 a tick mana regen</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">With the appropiate AA skills though you can turn it into an 1800 pt heal with a 3 sec cast time for 200 - effects - SCM - specialise mana</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Yep!! That's the plan...I'll let you know how it ends up sometime in late 2003.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Fulaq</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">OK Glori, I'm well on schedule for it early 2004.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The slow effect is 30%, hardly crippling.  The snare effect is about 65%, which is a pretty serious snare.  You won't be going anywhere fast, and you won't be backpedaling at all while Torpor is working.  <br />
The strength is that 300 hps/6 seconds is a lot of constant healing and a shaman can keep that up for hours using just Canni4, let alone canni5 which can mean the shaman can keep himself in Torpor, cast right click effects, keep an expensive DoT on the critter or two, and GAIN mana over time.  All while tanking something that hits for over 200 a whack.  <br />
<br />
Without Torpor shamans would be rather sad at lvl 60 relative to other classes.  <br />
<br />
Sorry to those of you out there in that position, I'm sure it sucks.  Fortunately I didn't have to experience that.  I finally got my copy off a rare lvl 58 jugg about two blues pre-60.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Irksome</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">On the slow portion, it may be only 30%, but for a high level raid melee, that will be a drop from 210% base speed to 70% base speed.  That is a very significant slow.<br />
<br />
A 1% slow will over-write all haste effects.  So, if you have a warrior with a 41% haste item, SoTS, and the bard song that stacks (110% haste or so), a 1% slow is a reduction of DPS by 50%.  A 30% slow is reduction of DPS by 66%.  Ouch.<br />
<br />
However, if there is not cleric or druid around to do healing, I don't hesitate on Torporing.  As someone above said, Torpor does not reduce the DPS as much as death does.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kellaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">The slow is devastating to a melee's dps as listed above. Any slow spells in effect on the user negate all haste the person has, drop them to naked speed and then apply the slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">And how does death affect a melee's dps?  It's not like they are slowed permanently, and the duration of slow isn't that great compared to the length of some of the fights I've been in lately.<br />
<br />
It definitely is my heal of last resort on melees (and never for the main tank during a fight), but if we're fighting a big fight with a CH rotation (clerics to busy to heal anyone else) and a grouped melee needs a heal, torpor it is.    Chloro is just too pathetic to heal a buffed melee type.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I think Irksome means that a tanks DPS is 0 when they are dead and that although torpor drops DPS in a big way, that them sitting at their bind spot allows them to do even less damage.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Agrik - unless you have AA Spell Casting Reinforcement (like level 3) or other effects, torpor is 300hp in 4 ticks for 1200hp total.<br />

There is the entry on Torpor.<br />
<br />
regarding melees, slows and torpor.  I use chloroblast whenever possible to keep group kill speed up.   When I am in mana-conserve mode I use torpor.<br />
<br />
I was once in a disco group in seb with 2 60 monks, 2 60 rogues and a 60 ranger.  I was obviously busy.  Plus I was pulling.  I torpor'd the monk that was taking the most beats.  He absolutely flipped out, stating several times that he would rather die than have &quot;that stupid spell&quot; cast on him.   So I said fine, I would let him die next time and not heal him anymore.  So he said fine...<br />
<br />
He got lower and lower in health, used his mend...finally he had to FD and I was out on a pull.  He started going off in grp chat about how much I suck.   Look buddy, I use torpor to keep you all at full health so I don't have to worry about you while I am out pulling stuff for you to kill.   You went on a rampage about how much it sucked and you would rather die than get healed!  Then he asked the ranger to heal him, the ranger laughed and said no.   I brought the frogs back, torpor'd him while he was FD and removed him from the group.  <br />
<br />
People who can't deal with being slowed for 24 seconds need to get a grip.  I've never seen anyone go that nuts over getting slowed by a frog in sebilis or by bane of thule in Cazic, and its a bigger slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Actually, Sabiniz, KEI (or Kodiak's Endless Intellect) is 14 mana a tic, not 26.  Actual numbers for KEI are:<br />
<br />
Mana regen: 14 a tic (that's 6 seconds for Telosk)<br />
adds 250 mana<br />
adds 25 intelligence<br />
addes 25 wisdom<br />
duration: 2 hours 30 minutes<br />
costs 900 mana to cast<br />
<br />
Btw, Telosk, it's only castable by enchanters, so don't be looking for it in the shaman spell list.  It's a group buff that only level 60 enchanters can cast.<br />
