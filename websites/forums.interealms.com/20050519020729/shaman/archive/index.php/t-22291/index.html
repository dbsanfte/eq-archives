<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hobart is posting on EQLive almost daily on the changes to test, the latest:<br />
Friday July 3rd Update 3:00pm<br />
<br />
- Pets should now remain with you when camping and going LD.<br />
<br />
- (Test Only) Weapon graphics should now display properly.<br />
<br />
- Augment Buy Back System:<br />
<br />
Players can now sell LDoN items back to adventure merchants and receive half of the points they spent (rounded up). <br />
<br />
The Adventure Merchant Window now contains a &quot;Sell&quot; button, which is used similarly to the Sell button with regular merchants -- <br />
<br />
click the item in your inventory or bag and the Sell button will enable. Only items with an adventure point cost, and that were bought from an adventure merchant can be sold back.<br />
<br />
EQUI_AdventureMerchantWnd.xml has changed.<br />

I can't play with out a least one chest comment a night.  When I got my Tak LDoN BP for my alt I was asked if I was sure I didn't require 'extra points'.<br />

Some swedish friends gave me a nick name on VZ, they started calling me (ill englishify it for you): Titsy.<br />
<br />
Noone has called me that for a long time now, i kind of miss those guys since they all went back to FPS and WoW betas and whatnot...</div></div><hr />

Actually I like to refer to it as &quot;2 puppies in a death struggle under your tunic&quot;, more dramatic that way.</div></div><hr />

Can't you just get a smaller monitor?</div></div><hr />

I cannot stop laughing. Youre my hero Gloriana. <br />

That's how my commando (underwearless for the uninitiated ... and yes, I know it's not a real word) barby action toon with the kung fu grip stayed PG13.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think I shrink fully and click off levi on raids? Certainly isnt so the tanks can get around my fat ass to the mob, heh, its to ninja-sneak under the hotties and look up!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Blazz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I think Half Elves have it the worst though. Some models have the most amazing Brazilian string-bikini high-hipped thongs on when naked. We have &quot;modified&quot; screenshots of some of our members in a special &quot;R-Rated&quot; section on our private message board.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I think on cats tho, you have to refer to them as &quot;dugs.&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Nuttasaurus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Boobs are great and all...<br />
<br />
but no one seems to like the idea of selling back augs?  I know it's at half cost but that's a damn site better than getting nothing back.  I like it.</div></div><hr />

Hrm, I must be missing something. I just get redirected to the homepage of the quarm kill with Sluggy. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">Yep. If you look at the top, on the left there is the guild logo (with the four Elemental God shields). Right next to it, it says: Affliction Home of the Rack.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started on Flappy vs. Sluggy - I'm a Flappy fan forever!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>GhostofRommel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">Ah, nothing like two midgits wrestling under a blanket...sigh....Anyways, quick question..Once I summon my pet, he will stay with me when I zone, and when I camp or go LD?</div></div><hr />
