<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Banuddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have always enjoyed seeing what people can do with a small force (let's say 2 groups or less).  I haven't seen one of these topics for a while though, and I am sure new PoP abilities / spells made a lot of new encounters possible.<br />
<br />
So anyway, here is the thread to brag about your amazing 1-2 group kills! (I am sure at least Miser will have some nice stories to tell).<br />
<br />
Post away~</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">We did one of the tower BoT named (the things you need enchanter ring of torden to get to) with 11......</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I know it's not that uber now, but some friends of mine trying to get some faction in kael tried Dlammez Stormslayer. Warrior, Cleric, Me, 2 rogues, and a mage.<br />
<br />
So we engage, I malo him.<br />
<br />
&quot;Dlammez Stormslayer goes on a RAMPAGE!&quot;<br />
<br />
Ouch. Then Slow resists. no problem, Start trying malosini while it refreshes.<br />
<br />
He rampages again, and again, and I bite it somehow (cleric is trying to heal the tank because the mob's unslowed)<br />
<br />
So anyways, I get battleressed, loot my stuff, and the tank dies because the cleric is out of mana. Now a rogue is tanking him, but the cleric is able to eat a rod. Then I manage to slow him :P The cleric clicks the warrior back in, we recover and win the fight.<br />
<br />
It's situations like these where you turn the tide that are so memorable :D<br />
<br />
Edit: Did Eejag for my monk's epic with just me, a cleric, a warrior, and my (51) monk, and Gwan and Trunt with a monk friend of mine, his fiance's cleric, myself, and my monk.<br />
<br />
Edit Edit: ResZerging Yael with 6 people was fun too :p</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>garguren</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">aint nothing real big but have done talendor with 7 or 8 people a couple times..<br />
<br />
it's allways fun to do with such small amounts when you can sit and watch entire raids drop to mobs that really aint all that diffcult</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Graskulis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">- Vindi with 12<br />
- Kaloek'dar (that dragon in CS) with 6 (could have been three, I think)<br />
- Master Yael with 6, and only one death (me as the shammer, I took the DT on the pull)<br />
<br />
That's all I can think of.<br />
Just look up the KLA on AB :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Sunbur</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">A guardian of Zek with 6 - 62 bard, 61 druid bot, 65 warrior, 53 cleric bot, 61 shaman, 58 mage :)  Only death that night was when the Idol of Rallos Zek got loose from its raid party and pounded the bard into the ground OUTSIDE the arena.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Barliman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I was in a group of 6 in the Kael arena a few weeks back.  Me (61 shaman at the time), 61 druid, 61 druid, 60 wizard, 59 paladin.  We had cleared pretty much everything but the Protectors of Zek.  The paladin really wanted to try them but the druids didn't think we could handle one becase their old, semi high end guild wiped on 2 PoZ's.  So being a shaman I pulled them :)<br />
<br />
I pulled with slow and it stuck but got the othe PoZ next to him though I had expected it.  Rooted one, brought the other back to the group but my pet had got the rooted one down below 98% so he was summoning.  So I soloed one with the pet tanking while the rest of the group took the other PoZ and a spawn add.  It was a blast and it was fun showing the druids what a good shaman can do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Shakula</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">In Chardok with 2 groups, had a bad pull and ended up with King and about 6 other mobs. It was mayhem, luckily enchanter (we had 1 enc!) was able to mezz most of them and I casted AE slow. Killed everything and was able to gain control again with only a few deaths.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Me and some friends like takeing out Trahe (sp) the trent in PoG that summons the goat men. The first time was a while back 9 people and it took 26 min. Now we are down to 6 people in 15 min. Last group we did her with was 59 SK, 60 Brd, 54 Clr, 63 Shm, 65 War, 65 mag. Droped the Bst tunic to Grats rot:P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I've heard of 18-person Aary kills. I've seen 12 kill the Ring of Slime. I've seen fewer than two groups kill Dozekar. I think that Tormax has also been two-grouped. Innorruuk has been one-grouped. Tunare could probably be three-grouped if you didn't need a ton of people to clear the plane in decent time.</div></div><hr />

The actual tower named (i.e. use a key from the courtyard with the bees and the gargoyle things) or the chanter soloable ones?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">theres lots of nameds in the towers.  All but the bosses con blue at 65.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm more impressed by people that do things with small groups that aren't gimping the encounter.  So if a single group of people in VT or elemental planes gear kills Klandicar to get ST keys for their twinks that's not really impressive to me.<br />
<br />
If 2.5 groups of people who are in the natural progression for ST kill Klandicar that's impressive to me.<br />
<br />
It's all a matter of perspective.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I soloed the sleeper<br />
<br />
yeah it was a little hard at first but then I tanked it in teh FACE!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I used to think I'd done some pretty cool stuff with small forces.  But PoP kinda makes everyone scoff at what used to be a decent challenge for folks.  Now those challenges are trivial and we're left wondering what's left to try?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I just heard of Grieg with six people. That's impressive too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rathelon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">My guild is small, so we've always had to use a small force tactic. Probably our best was killing Overking and about 6 respawns in his chamber with 17 people for our first guild noodle. Most of those were under 60 at the time...think we only had about 4 or 5 level 60's back then. Had 1 death.<br />
<br />
We used to kill the spawned Faydedar with 12 to 15 people when we were doing our druid epics, and usually had a monk as MT because we didnt have any real high level warriors (still only have 1 Warlord). I think our personal best was 11 people and no deaths.<br />
<br />
We do regular HoT raids with 3 groups, and we've done it with as little as 2 groups. With 2 groups we stayed at the door, but we did the cubby hole with 3 before. Used a 60 paladin for a MT there back before people realized that hybrids arent useless. Most people dont even know what can be done, cause they're too afraid to try it.<br />
<br />
Nothing really impressive to all the uber types out there. But considering we are no where near uber and most of these things we did long before Planes of Power (or Luclin and Velious in some cases), I think my little clan does pretty well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
:D<br />
<br />
Yeah, once upon a time I was maybe uber...back when Kunark came out and I was full RE and soon to be one of the first epic'ed shamans on my server. I'm so non-uber now, it's not funny. Course, I dont play as much or care about getting to all the high end content either. /agree Henora and Landragon</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">1 group Lcea katta.<br />
<br />
Zland at 3am with about 15 characters, but only 6 living people.  This was a long time ago when we didnt have enough ST keys in the guild to mount a successful raid, and were desperate for more.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I agree with Henora that most of these comparisons are irrellevant with the vast difference in equipment between players.</div></div><hr />

No I dont have logs, forgot to turn it on.  Fight was basically, torpor, velium strike, velium strike, canni5, repeat and add debuffs.<br />
<br />
HoT mobs are pretty weak to todays standards anyways, they just have a truckload of HP.<br />

As for the loot, I was fortunate enough to get some Wurm Meat... yay.<br />

But, as people have said, what's impressive to some is totally noob to others.</div></div><hr />

Back on track, most enjoyable single group encounters I've done were The Vadyn in Akr (Was a good 20+ minute fight, very much a test of mana efficiency) and the one of the PoS mini bosses which was a real case of using every single trick in the book to get the win (took us 3 attempts and 6 yaks for dogdog to finally beat it =)</div></div><hr />
