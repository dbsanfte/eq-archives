<br />
Am I missing something or has OoW been live for almost 24 hours without serverwide crashes, emergency patches or character levels and AAs going MIA?<br />
<br />
What's wrong with SoE?!?  They released an expansion without (relatively speaking of course) any MAJOR mistakes that were caught within the first 30 seconds of logged in time?  How dare they ruin my image of them.  :p<br />

PoF needs an adjustment... people getting way way too much exp there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Our entire server crashed last night (BB) .  There was definitely a rollback of some type from the crash because some items that had been made in my trader bags on my mule were back in the bag they were originally in.

Quit asking for silly things like that. If anything adjust the level of exp for hardness UP in zones of Kod Taz + or higher.<br />

On top of that, I'm finding that EQ runs much smoother than previously, even on my secondary system that I usually have my trader account on.  I've found zone times much shorter also.<br />
<br />
All in all I'm pleased so far.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Percent</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Being a jaded consumer of SoE products, I normally don't buy anything until at least a week or two has gone by on an expansion release (remember LoY and the loss of levels and AAs?).  I've been impressed at how smoothly the game has been running and the lack of extreme issues (the rollback to exploiters to me isn't so much an OoW issue, but a corrective action to those exploiting) I may actually pick up 2 copies on the way home from work today.<br />
<br />
All kidding and sarcasm aside, SoE congratulations.  It appears that you are learning from prior mistakes and are truly attempting to rebuild the lost confidence in many of your subscribers.  Actions speak louder than words, and this release of OoW is speaking volumes, at least to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tsuyoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Things have been good server-side.  But, many users are having significant issues with the game causing reboots.  Seems to be related to the ATI Radeon chipset.  Go to the tech support area of eqlive to see how many people are having the problems.<br />

Personally I have a desktop that is fine and a laptop that is having the crashing issue.  Hopefully they will have a patch for this soon.  Hard to believe that in all the testing they could have missed something as big as an incompatibility with a very popular video chipset.<br />

Bugs been out there for a month. Basically the new ATI/NVidia cards are being driven to software mode which sux. The fix was supposed to go in with the update and now my x800 rocks. Much closer to what I expected when I paid $350 to upgrade. I load faster and lag less then I did only 24 hrs before. This one gets a A for technical, just gotta see if the content gets anywhere near that.<br />
<br />
As far as nerfing PoFire, maybe not all the people who dont bother to find any other zones other than BoT will have to work. Hell of alot harder to kill a PoFire mob than a PoV/BoT mob, maybe not on a relative basis (equip vs mob) but definitely on an absolute basis.<br />

Heh, Bristlebane is the red headed step child of the server farm.  If we were to visit SOE and look inside the Bristlebane server box, I wouldn't be surprised to see some amalgamation of parts from an Atari 2600 and the original Nintendo, powered by by five hamsters running inside wheels.  So only crashing once is pretty good I think :D .</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Halamdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">So far I am pretty happy with OoW expansion so far :) and best of all no emergency patch /bug and what so ever :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I believe experience in Kod'Taz+ has already been adjusted, but adjusted DOWN. Pre-OOW (Sunday night) I was getting 1-2% regular experience per kill. Tonight (Wednesday), I earned 1% per every 2-3 mobs, and red-cons were the only ones earning 1% all by themselves. I'm still grinding my way through 65, if that makes any difference, 100% to regular experience. I wish they'd left KT experience alone. I sincerely hope Vxed experience remains untouched. That is one of my favorite solo haunts.<br />

<br />
You obviously don't play on AB, the sever were taken down after less than 90 minutes, on release day, as the PoDs weren't tranporting people to the OoW zones.<br />
<br />
Seems like the normal SoE snafu to me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">Patch at 11am GMT (3am pacific -7 UDT) on Thursday, just had serverwide message.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>weissblau</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Have had a couple of guildmates with the expansion have problems using some of the features - i.e. one could not access the AA menu, even when dropping back to the default UI.  The guild tribute thing is somewhat buggy - it listed my tribute contribution as someone else's until I told it to list the offline people and then reverted to just online people.  There are also some funny behaviors to the guild tribute that I'm not sure are intentional.<br />
<br />
The graphics are significantly laggier in the default setting than before, but it's fixable with options.  Shadows suck graphics bandwidth like crazy.<br />
<br />
I have NOT seen massive LD/server outages, people logging in to find themselves level 50, lost items, etc.<br />
<br />
All in all, a very good rollout.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>The Hyena Shaman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Some content appears to be unfinished, but not so badly as we're used to. (My guild hasn't looted any cloth caps, thankfully). Mostly just things that can be polished up.<br />
<br />
I expect some sort of fiasco coming out of attunable objects, however. I also expect a Kunark-style loot adjustment. Because people are getting things, and it's not all from the &quot;end zone&quot; amd I don't know how SoE overlooked that.</div></div><hr />
