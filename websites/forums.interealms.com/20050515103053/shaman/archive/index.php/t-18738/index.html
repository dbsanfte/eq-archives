<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>gurgul_povar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I hope you don't think I am a crappy shammy but I don't even have malo memmed in LDoN groups anymore. I mem Turgur's and Togor's. I cast Turgur's and if it bounces I cast Togor's. It seems extremely rare that both will bounce.<br />
<br />
So if Turgur's sticks then I have the mob slowed much sooner than if I maloed then slowed. If turgur's bounces then I cast Togor's and I think it is about the same time to cast both slows as it is to cast malo then slow.<br />
<br />
The advantage is that I have the mob slowed faster about 70% of the time and I save that 400 mana from Malo. The only disadvantage is when both slows bounce and I have to cast a third time (doesn't happen that much).<br />
<br />
Am I missing something?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Nope your not a crappy shaman; I have been doing the exact same thing since day 1 of LDoN, keeping Tigirs up as well for huge pulls; not only is it a practical approach to resists, it helps with multi pulls (or when using Tigirs might set off a trap mob). The difference in mana savings isnt huge but with a 3-5 mob pull having to malo/s all of them, that quickly adds up.<br />
Use the tools were given. Adapt, improvise, overcome.....our flexability is all we really have as shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>telosk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I usually just slow, no malos at all, but on some occasions i keep malaise memmed which only costs 50 mana or so. The reason being rarely does any spell bounce twice in a row, so i use this as a buffer to land slow, and if it does land, well that good too. However in many istuations the spell slot is too valuable to use up.<br />
<br />
I do use malos in LDoN hard though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I use malos for the nameds in normal missions, but that is it.<br />
<br />
In hard mission, I try to malos every mob.  I do this more for my own personal safety than anything else, though.  The resist rate in hards is really only a little worse than normals, but a hard mission mob can kill me if slow bounces, whereas there's no way a normal mob can.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Vigdis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">The bounce frequency is just enough to annoy me everytime it happens. I usually Malos when i have mana. It also helps my pet paladins and other group members to land spells.<br />
<br />
Also depends on who im grouping with. If i am with friends i can trust to heal me if i get beat on a lot by resisting mobs i can sometimes skip Malos.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I think it really depends on the level of the group.  If everyone in the group is 65 then I often have multiple slow resists even in easy dungeons.  <br />
<br />
I use Tigir's, Togor's, Malos(inia) all depending on how the first few mobs seem to be going.  The one other advantage of using MalX debuff is that it helps the other casters with their spells but I have no idea if it is worth the mana for that use.<br />
<br />
But to answer your question. No, you are doing just fine if you are winning adventures.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">What Jin said.<br />
<br />
I'll always have normal and ae slow memmed, just for speed and ease more than anything else. Don't think I've ever debuffed a non-named mob in normal and quite often not bothered with the named ones either. Just drop the slow on and move on to the next job, it's not like normal mission mobs hit that hard anyway.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The only dungeon that I have to use malo in is Takish.  I dont know what it is, but something about that dungeon and my slow just dont go together. I ran a mission there 2 days ago and bounced almost half the slows I cast (no joke).  Simmilar things happen every time I go there.  So I really try not to anymore.<br />
<br />
Other dungoens, no I dont usually malo.  Big named maybe, depending on group makeup.  But its not a regular thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Aruman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Usually not needed on Normal level missions, but I keep Malo memmed just in case. I have run into a few mobs with seemingly high MR.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">*shrug* I don't slow any more.  Our SK doesnt need the mobs slowed to stand up to the mobs.  It all depends on how the pull goes and what mobs came but typically if there is 1 mob pulled I'll Q the SK and nuke since dots take too long.  If 2 are pulled I might VP one into the corner and then Q the Sk and nuke the one he's on.  If 3 are pulled I VP one, Q the SK, slow the second mob beating on him and while folks are taking care of the first and second one rooted in the corner, I'll be dotting and nuking my mob beating on me.  Once again it depends on the mobs but that's typically how I do it.  OH and if it's 4 or more it's not worth the mana to cc and heal up misc folks getting hit (mainly the druid :) ) so we just have our monk FD and have the SK pet pull a single.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Thurdar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">LDoN (normal) is about the only place I don't keep Malo(s) memmed. Either Tigir's or a damage spell will go into that slot, depending on the group. I'll mem it before taking on the boss on an assassinate but that's about it. Unless it's an add, I'll cast one slow, if it doesn't stick I won't bother trying again, just switch to DPS (usually a rain). My rule in LDON is that I won't slow a mob that's under 80%, it just isn't worth the mana. It's about the only place that I'm not a fanatical slower, every mob usually gets one slow attempt and one ToS or Bane.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I'll drop a malosini on a mob using my Pendant of Malosini but only to help the nukers.  The groups I'm in it normally doesn't matter if I even slow at all.  In fact in some groups I'll not even bother slowing because they die faster unslowed because of the DS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are lots of enchanter mobs that cast resist magic on the entire room.  Try making your puller pull with dispell, if possible.  This also takes care of their haste, as well as the DS (lots of druids in there, too).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I don't have ldon, I was away for a while and haven't got around to getting it just yet.......anyway, I am seeing a common strategy of using Togor's....is there something I missed?

<br />
Kozul,<br />
<br />
Basically trying to find a way around the 1 - 2 second lag between your spell gems refreshing and Turgur's refreshing.  Its quicker to immediatly cast a second spell (either slow or debuff).<br />
<br />
Could be used anywhere, but LDON is like EQ on Meth, and normally a mob wont be alive long enough for 3 spells - i.e.  Turgurs   -&gt; Malo -&gt; Turgurs.  So quicker to Turgurs -&gt; Togors.  If both slows bounce, the mobs at 20% health anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">ah ok i see....jeez thats fast for mobs to go down, reminds me of farming greenies hehe.<br />
<br />
I really need to get ldon if it's that easy taking down mobs...seems like even if you fail, you can still rack up some decent xp for easy mobs</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">You have to wait 3.75 seconds longer to recast turgur's than you do to cast another spell.  Togors is pretty much just as good as turgur's when you are doing ldon (70% vs 75% means absolutely nothing), so its better to chain cast a slow than have to wait for turgur's to refresh.  Typically, using just turgur's, if it isn't slowed on the second try I just move on because the mob is almost dead anyways.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Kozul</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">ugh ok flame away im a moron.....didnt realize togors was 70%, thought it was less, but havent memmed anything in other than turgers in so long I forgot about it lol</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Baz4</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Add me to the list - <br />
Turgur's first.  <br />
If it bounces, togor's.  <br />
If that bounces, target next mob<br />
<br />
<br />
I do need to remember to stop and mem Malos before we pull the named on an assasination.  died yesterday on one of those - Turgur's bounced and the guy quadded and tripled (not sure in which order even, but it was three hits, proc, 4 hits) and I died.  I was sitting in PoT memming spells with two group members showing that they were also in PoT when I got the message that we had won.  Cleric, rogue and beast killed the mob.  Beast said it took him 4 tries to land his slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">What Jinheim said, but the 2 slows I mem are Turgur's and Tigir's in normal missions.  I like having Tigir's for swarm pulls.  Getting 2-3 mobs 50% slowed on one cast is huge when you're in a DPS grp and CC is a secondary function, usually done with VP, especially when you're also the main healer.<br />
<br />
In hard missions I VP an add, malos then slow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Clawmarks</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">No. Hell half the time if you get a slow resist the mob is dead before you can recast it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Clawmarks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Poguk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I get resisted more than I care to in LDoN, so I Malo every pull.  Rarely is slow resisted now.  I usually have it slowed within 10% health.  Seems like when we get a bad pull and I ditch Malo and try to out-right slow all of them... half of them resist and I've got multiple unslowed mobs beating on me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">I normally have malos up simply because I've been too lazy to unmem it.  The only time I ever actually cast it in an LDON (easy) adventure though is on a boss.  I'm glad this topic was brought up, and will most likely put togors in the place of malos since I just cast slow until it lands anyway. And I always have tigirs up...always.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Zeddgara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">I don't malo but after my first slow attempt I cast malosinia. Mostly because I have to wait for gem refresh anyways and by the time I'm casting slow again I've fitted a debuff in there. Besides making it easier to land a bounced slow debuffing the mob makes it easier to snare, more damage for wizard nukes, less mob resist to the multiple procs everyone uses and lets my rains hit for less resists should I choose to throw one in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">I wouldn't use Togor's as a &quot;bounce slow&quot;, I always have Tigir's up for large pulls anyway, so it's not worth giving a spell gem to Togor's for me.  50% slow is more than adequate for LDoN normal, they have the same cast time, and the -hate factor on Tigir's keeps the mob on the tank.  The mana cost difference is trivial.  If Turgur's and Tigir's are resisted, I just drop a Q on the tank and Velium Strike or Tears of Saryrn (ToS if no mezzer in group).<br />
<br />
For that matter, if there's a bard in the group, let them slow with Requiem of Time and skip Turgur's altogether. :p  Half the time bard damage shields are worth using a lower % of slow anyway.  Then the only slow you need to cast is Tigir's, and only on the overpulls.  I've done LDoNs on my bard with no other slower in the group, I didn't even bother slowing at all, I just let the mobs chew themselves up on the DS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u26"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p26">Inside 10%?!  And you finish Adventures with that group?  I dont want to be a jag off but how is that even slightly possible?  Let's just say that you are slowing as they are incoming:<br />
<br />
Cast Malos as you see the mob<br />
Malos lands as the mob is at the group<br />
2 sec Refresh<br />
Cast Turgurs<br />
Mob has been beaten on for 5+ seconds now and you have him down 10%?<br />
<br />
So it takes 40 seconds (Yes the math doesnt work I'm going to assume casters are speeding up the nukes in the middle and at the end instead of the first 10 seconds) to kill each mob?<br />
<br />
Pretty sure we are avg ~15 seconds a mob.  After I Q the Sk I get one Nuke and the mob is dead so I cant get a second in :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u27"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p27">So it takes 40 seconds (Yes the math doesnt work I'm going to assume casters are speeding up the nukes in the middle and at the end instead of the first 10 seconds) to kill each mob?<br />
<br />
You can win LDoN's killing a mob every 40 seconds easily.  Let's say a slaughter mission of 54 mobs, that's 2160 seconds, or 36 minutes.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u28"><b>Slqmdooley</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p28">I'm rarely ever resisited more than once on a slow in LDoN.  Two slows costs less mana than a malos and slow and on the majority of mobs its just one slow so I save twic the mana.  I do cast malos on every named I see though.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u29"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p29">Gorgos, if you're dropping mobs in 15 secs, then you need to be doing hard missions instead ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Ronax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">Can't say I have ever had togors memmed in LDON, but I do normally have tirgirs up for the bigger pulls.  I Malo every mob in normal risk, but only turgur multipulls.  Single pull is really not worth the mana to slow at all.  <br />
<br />
I use Malos in high risk.  Tried just Malo in high risk, but there was still an odd resist sometimes.<br />
<br />
To me its just not worth it to have a slow bounce at all.  Nor is it worth it to have a other classes nuke or stun bounce because I don't cast malo.<br />
<br />
Malo is not just for slow if there are other casters in your group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Gorgos Gookrusher</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">I see where you are going with that line of reason Harwel but that doesn't include Getting in (Mysteriously the clock is always missing a couple minutes when I zone in even if I'm the first one in it says we lost 3 minutes), Prepping (Pets and what not), Bio breaks, Moving to the mobs, Rebuffing (killing at 40 seconds per kill you will have to rebuff before the end of the Adventure at least the shaman buffs since we have about the shortest line of buffs around as the &quot;Kings of Buffing!&quot;), Killing at 40 seconds doesnt leave you with any time for someone dying.  God forbid you should get a bad break and pull a big arse train and get wiped or have to evac or something.<br />
<br />
40 seconds is an eternity in LDoN<br />
<br />
*Edit*<br />
I agree we should be doing Hard.  My friends are sissys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Harwel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">Still, you have 90 minutes from the time you zone in to finish an adventure, if your puller is good at moving the group around and keeping a mob in camp, it should be very easy to succeed with that kind of kill rate.  You can even withstand several deaths and evacs, and it should still take a maximum for 60 minutes.  I should know, because that exact scenario seems to be the norm for my group, lol. :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Daltara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">I tend to have really bad luck with resists on slows. Ive tried the Turgurs and Togors rotation, chain casting Turgurs, and doing Malo before slowing. Doing Malo before the slow seems to work best for me by far. Fewer resists on nukes is also a plus. I also keep Tigirs up as a backup for when Turgurs is resisted.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u34"><b>Sariss</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p34">I've found that slow resists are very very streaky.   Sometimes I get none on an adventure, and sometimes I keep a count (18 resists in one quick mission is my highest... yeah, I get bored sometimes).<br />
<br />
I keep Malos memmed for the named, either the loot named or the assassinate named.   I suppose I don't NEED to... even on these named, slow seems to land well... but I figure it's safer to Malos then virtually guarentee a slow, than to start pingponging on resists and maybe even die and leave the mob unslowed (note: not that most groups couldn't handle it unslowed, it's just my job to make it slowed).<br />
<br />
I think the most single resists on a normal mob I've had is 3... and if guys are fighting that mob, it's nearly dead by that time, so frick it.  In those occasional uber ldon groups, a first resist and it may not be worth it to slow the 2nd time... if a mob is down to 40% hp or so... why slow now after the resist?<br />
<br />
I haven't done the load two slows (Tur/Tog)... but I may start doing that, thank's for the idea.    <br />
<br />
I have loaded Tigir's situationally, but eventually gave up on it.   If we have an enchanter/bard we can handle it, and lull pulling makes for rare big pulls.   Even with myself pulling, 3 is generally the max I get, and 1 common (1 rooted).<br />
<br />
Anyhow, I find resist streaky, but generally okay.  Using Malo/Malos all the time means you're taking about 6-7 seconds longer to slow, using 350-400 mana more, and is mostly not needed.<br />
<br />
I'm tough enough to take the smacks on a resist, and if it's slow, I could tank it if they want me to.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u35"><b>Abividad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p35">Tak kills me on slow resists so bad that I finally started elading with malo. But I'm only 61 usually with a group of 65s, so that's part of my problem. In Tak I've even bounced 2 slows in a row after malo. g/f does get a charge when she hears me growl into the phone after bounce bounce though *LOL* Don't have too much trouble at all in other themes though.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u36"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p36">I usually have malo up, but only use it on named.  I also havent used togors or tigirs in adventures, but thinking about trying possibly both of them out, one at a time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
And if you have Malos, my god ppl use it, for haven sakes its unresistable:<br />
1.  The fact it could help your group casters (and hybrid tanks to aggro better could save your life or others lives.)<br />
<br />
2.  It helps to prevent a scenario in which you have to cast slow a third time.<br />
<br />
3.  It helps your ability in crowd control and other classes in your group.  <br />
(I have slowed a mezzed mob for an enchanter's safety only to hear them then ask, &quot;Yeah, but have you malosed it.&quot;)  <br />
<br />
After all why not you malos all the time, enchanters have an unresistable magic debuff they use all the time...<br />
<br />
<br />
I use malos for the nameds in normal missions, but that is it.<br />
<br />
In hard mission, I try to malos every mob.  I do this more for my own personal safety than anything else, though.  The resist rate in hards is really only a little worse than normals, but a hard mission mob can kill me if slow bounces, whereas there's no way a normal mob can.<br />
<br />
Agreed.<br />
Based on the level of group make up.  On normal LDON dungeons just 'Turgur's Insects' without Malos can even be necessary.  <br />
Preventing damage to a group that can't handle damage well can make a difference.<br />
<br />
I seriously agree with Jinheim on Hard missions in LDON.<br />
<br />
When the group first comes in contact with the mob.<br />
1.  Malos on a Hard LDON dungeons, as a side effect, can give the tank the seconds needed to hold aggro.  <br />
2.  Malos will prevent a second, third, fourth and fifth chance at slow.  (Yes, Hard LDON resist on slow are horrible for all classes.)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u39"><b>Shismar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p39">I have not found any significant difference between resists in a normal vs. a hard adventure. But anyways, only nameds get Malos in normal and all mobs in hard. simply because I don t want the mobs beating on me more than necessary.<br />
<br />
Tigirs on the other hand just makes my live easier. Gotta love those 4x X yawns messages :)  (and hate it when one of 4 mobs with the same name resists ...)<br />

What I wonder about, btw., I found Tak to be the dungeon with the least resists. Did a couple Rujark and almost pulled my hair out.</div></div><hr />

for some reason i've never used ae slow in ldon; its just not that hard to slow trains 1 by 1 and on pvp server, slowing your groupmates isn't so good.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u44"><b>Chairman Meow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p44">For me, it really depends on group make-up.  If I'm in a group with nukers, I malos most mobs.  My wizzy friends seem to think it helps tremendously with partial resists.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>sgc316</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">I only Malo named mobs in LDoN.<br />
<br />
Not enough time or mana for the rest.  Mob is usually 20% down before i get it slowed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u46"><b>ssylva</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p46">Ok in HARD Ldon with no enchanter pet:<br />
<br />
1 pull...<br />
<br />
Malos<br />
Tugurs<br />
Patch tank<br />
Vellium Strike<br />
<br />
On a 2-pull it usually goes:<br />
<br />
Tugurs first mob -- VP if it fails or charges<br />
Malos second mob<br />
patch tank<br />
Tugurs second mob<br />
<br />
On a three pull it is:<br />
<br />
Tugurs mob that is headed for the tank<br />
Virulent Paralysis one of the other mobs<br />
Patch tank<br />
Tugurs third mob<br />
Malos the VPed mob<br />
Tugurs the VPed mob<br />
Patch tank<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
IF there is an enchanter pet then I usually dont bother with malosing first on a 1 pull.  The pet rips through the mob fast enough that malos+tugurs takes too long.<br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
In Ldon normal I typically do not have malos loaded.<br />
<br />
On a 5 pull it is usually tigirs the 5, Tugurs the one that charges, VP it off, Tigirs again if 2 or more resisted then tugurs the rest of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
Note VP has saved my life in Hard Ldon at least 20 times.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u47"><b>Kaeth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p47">you simply don't have time to malos AND slow most stuff in regular mode. They die too fast. Malos is like a 4 second cast then you have 2 second recast before you can slow so you're looking at like 8.5 seconds before the mob is slowed. Tigirs is the spell I use most. <br />
Hasted mr-buffed mobs really really suck though. I'd say it's a weakness or the shaman class how we can't deal with them without some 8+ second long series of spells during which they are probably interrupting the hell out of us. Maybe it's good game balance, it keeps us from being reliable as both main healer and cc at the same time I suppose.<br />
<br />
Yeah in hard-mode malos everything. Actually I think the common behavior among shamans is to malos anything you don't want beating on you unslowed if you get a resist :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>Walknot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">I agree, Malo is way to slow, even with 18% spell haste. I may malo if there is a Chanter who has several locked down, or if we have a Wizard nuking.  But in that case, I wont bother to slow the mobs at all really.<br />
<br />
I never timed how fast the kill goes, but normally, even with a pickup group, kill times are quite fast.  Figure 8.5 sec to malo and slow a mob and most times they are under half life by that time anyway.  So figure with Nukes landing at the end, most fights last less then 20 sec.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u49"><b>Zhahz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p49">I only use malo for the rare assassination boss in LDoN (rare because few groups I'm in ever want to do assassination).<br />
<br />
I used to keep two slows up at lower levels for LDoNs, but since about the mid 50's I've only have Turgirs up, because even if it's resisted it has a faster casting time and I'd rather canni and recast after a resist then have a 2nd slow memmed.</div></div><hr />
