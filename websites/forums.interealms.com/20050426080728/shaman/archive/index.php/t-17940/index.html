<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kittybuffs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day i was bored and figured i would try and Solo the spirits... testing my luck i went after Twaro Icequake. I have had my best luck with Torporing my Pet(snares pet) send to attack and while he is walking towards twaro cast malos. Because malos has low aggro he grabbs onto pet very quickly slow him fast or ur pet will be dead. Make sure ur pet has mage weps and is fully buffed. (this helps a lot) I would say you need to be fairly well equiped.. He is a great Farm because no one ever kills him and because he is an 8 hour spawn it is easy to corner the market. Since i had such good luck with Twaro... I tried Radir.. Radir is not to be triffled with solo.. he Quads and flurries and is rather resistant needs to be malosina b4 slow will stick(i think) this is for the spirit. I suggest having a tank with you. The Loot from Twaro is Normally.<br />
(Braclet of Quickness, Sense, or Beauty) then, Hoarforst, burning dirk or flamming, Rod of Virtue, Wand of Cursed souls and another one.<br />
The named Gantru's are easy after u are done with Twaro.. <br />
My tip of the day- if u see Twaro duel wielding Let him depop and come back later<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">have you tried malos run to camp root the bugar, slow him, send in pet and let pet build aggro that way so you won't get summoned? (assuming that's why you send pet?).. dunno if he's rootable..</div></div><hr />

He is immune to changes in run speed... If Pet Has mage equip he will hold Aggro well because of the Herculean amounts of Hps on this Guy you have to use Pox+Ultors + epic because if use Posion dots the dmg isnt as effcient. And if Pet doesnt have mage equip i normally just tank it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>afreeman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Radir can be particularly hard if he is weilding the 1H swords, because they have +25MR on them.  We took him out one time when he had 2 of them, and getting him slowed was a bitch.</div></div><hr />

  Indeed hehe ow</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Always wondered if this was possible. Did you use invis and IVU potion to get to him quickly?<br />
<br />
Perhaps opening the main fight with spirit call would be an idea, gives you a bit more time, then send in your &quot;real&quot; pet a little after that with mage toys. That should buy a little more time to land malo and then slow I'd think, particularly when those puppies hit the enrage speed bump.<br />
<br />
Any idea what Tawro's dps is like (slowed or unslowed)?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not Know what his Dps is but he can hit for 350... but once he is slowed he hits like once or twice in 6 seconds or so<br />
Torpor Pretty much Mitigates all his Dps... And Me personally I bound up outside his Lair but... U can use invis almost all the way UP to him but Swarmcaller and The Blue Ice guys right b4 him can see thru invis</div></div><hr />
