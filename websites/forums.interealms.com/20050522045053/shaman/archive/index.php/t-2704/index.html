<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Junder</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have two big ones that drive me a little nuts sometimes. My hope is that I am missing an obvious solution that you can pass on to me.<br />
<br />
1. When in groups that have pets that want to get buffed I have to use the mouse to target the pet. I have emailed VI and asked that having the same key that targets the player also target the pet owner if pressed a second time. No response of course. Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
2. I hate memming and un memming spells. I know it's lazy but it bugs me. I use different sets for different situations but what bugs me is this. SoW. I have it on my boots but I can't target someone else. I have to keep SoW memmed for the beggars. I don't mind casting it at all but I hate to have to mem it when I will never use it on myself. Am I missing something?<br />
<br />
I don't mind asking dumb questions so I can learn. I hope you don't mind reading them :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1.  You can ask the pet owners to target their pets (easy for them to do by tapping F1 twice) and then assist the pet owners .  (you have an /assist key, right? not /assist tank, but just /assist?) You can also type /target Goner<br />
2.  Say no.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I always use /target Pet_01<br />
<br />
If the names  are different enough, you don't need to type more than the first 3 letters.<br />
<br />
/target job<br />
/target gon<br />
<br />
And as far as buff-beggars go, it depends on the zone I'm in and what I'm doing.  In bazaar, GFay, etc, I actually dispense with most of my combat spells, and pop in mid-range heal, Chloro, SoW, etc.<br />
<br />
If I'm busy, it's &quot;sorry, busy&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's too funny. <br />
<br />
I can assure you that with only 8 spell slots for *ME* to use playing the game *I* am paying for there is no chance that I am reserving one to make it easy on beggars.<br />
<br />
I don't even say no I just continue on with my business. <br />
<br />
When I look for a port I don't just go up and ask a Druid or Wizard, I /auction that I am paying for a port to wherever, which leaves them a choice as to whether to respond.<br />
<br />
If they persist, I pop a 1-shot SoW potion in trade and tell them it's 10pp.</div></div><hr />
