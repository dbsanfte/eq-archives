<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gothlips</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone have any info on snare effect? Would be great for soloing. Any items with this etc.?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">amen to that. <br />
<br />
the only one i know of is in the warrens . kill the prince and if your lucky he will loot a bag of dice . take that dice to the kitty town in Stonebrunt and give to one of the lil kitties by the tree in the cat town. its not a dependable quest so far. its worked 1 out of 3 times. my GF has a druid leveling there so i pass through the warrens to get to her. I just bind myself in nexus and gate there then take the odus spires. gate back and take a spire to where i wanna go . poor mans port ;)<br />
<br />
anyway good luck friend <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">oh and on top of all that it is a lore item :(<br />
<br />
but hey , when your in RM that snare item is just about worth the trip when you loot 44pp of that HG :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Sap Encrusted Branch and Spear of Constriction both proc Ensnare.<br />
<br />
Though the first is from Tunare and the second comes from Veeshan's Peak and they're both No Drop so actually acquiring them is another matter entirely. (And for the Branch, I don't see this being awarded to a Shaman under most circumstances.)<br />
<br />
Of course there is the Inny worshippers snare necklace too, but you have to be a Trollie Shaman (worshipping Inny) to get one.<br />
<br />
There are a few items that are expendable, like the ball of yarn alreayd mentioned or a Fungus Beast Gland from FG too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There's some hammer from CT wtih an effect named Granite Crash or something like that... I think it's a snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Serepi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The spiders in CC also drop some crystalline nets, which is a 2 or 3 charge expendable item.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I hate those nets. I swear, everytime I tried to use one the damn things it was resisted. By green cons no less :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
on a side note , not one of the HGs resisted the snare from the dice quest</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fungus Beast Gland<br />
<br />
where can you get this ? is it lore? can you have more then 1 ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Grantie Crush snare lsats only for 3 ticks. Not effective for kiting, but useful for a short while none the less.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Ghanimaa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">the nets are actually a druid root with dd, not snare...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">The item from Stonebrunt Mountains is called Ball of Burlap Yarn, the quest giver is Miranda.  The ball has 4 charges of snare.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>humburto</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I believe there is something you can get from Fungus Grove or some high level place that I should go to but haven't. It has like 5 charges and is droppable. Don't know if its lore or not. I think it is the fungus beast gland. BTW goes in range slot<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Umgrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">The fungus beast glands come from the caller quest in fungus grove.  They are not lore, and we always seem to get several of them when we do the quest.</div></div><hr />
