<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>howler</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Tried installing EQ2 onto my computer but it crashed when I started installing the second disk.  Unfortunately, it now reads that I fully installed the game and I can't uninstall it through control panel and the like.  If I delete the folder I installed it in, I realize that my computer will still read it as being installed.<br />
<br />
My question is what is the command I type into the RUN prompt that will take me to the folder which holds all this information.  I forget everytime something like this happens.  I know that this folder holds a lot of sensitive information and that if I mess around with it, it can mess up my system.  But by getting rid of EQ2 in that folder, I should be able to reinstall.  Can anybody please help?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">1. It's not a folder, it's registry entries for installed programs.<br />
2. You do NOT want to muck around in this.<br />
3. You REALLY do NOT want to muck around in this.<br />
4. If it installed eq2.exe, run that, and see if it will download the content.  Easier than the format and reinstall you'd be facing by screwing up your registry. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Wulf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">regedit<br />
<br />
search for anything related to eq2 and delete it.</div></div><hr />

Unless you know what you are doing you can and probably will turn your PC into a piece of desk art.  Good luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will want to go to:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Software/<br />
<br />
And delete the entire &quot;Sony Online Entertainment&quot; key..<br />
<br />
then delete the folder from your harddrive, and reinstall...</div></div><hr />
