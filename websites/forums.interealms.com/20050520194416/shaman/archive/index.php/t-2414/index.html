<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>flinx_21</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all!<br />
I recently hit 50(my first char to do so!!) and I have been raiding with a large guild.<br />
I have raided hate and a few others.  :D <br />
<br />
happy happy! joy joy!<br />
<br />
anywhos the question is<br />
What planes does a barbarian Shaman start out non KOS??<br />
<br />
hhmm lets ask another question while we are at it<br />
<br />
What plane can a barbbarian shaman do faction work on to be able to do quests there?<br />
<br />
it is my understanding that there are quests on each plane and I was wondering which ones I can do quests on!!<br />
<br />
anyone out there wanna edumacate this newbie?<br />
<br />
thanks!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">There's only quest NPCs in Air and Growth (and Mischief, but you won't be going there soon, and you wouldn't want to anyway.)  You're forever kos in Hate and Fear.<br />
<br />
You're not kos in Growth, but there's no quests for you anyway.<br />
<br />
There are several quests you can do in Air, but they require a raid to get the pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">PoF, everyone KOS to all mobs except CT worshiping lizards to Caz only or chanters in Iksar illusion.<br />
<br />
PoH - everyone KOS<br />
<br />
PoG - Diety alligned all mobs if you worship..Tunare non kos.. friendly god.. non-kos....Not sure about barbs and tribunal. Just remember 4 faction hits and you kos either way. Also nothing to quest for sham in there anyway Ranger/Druids have quests there.<br />
<br />
PoM.. you won't see this for a long time. Everyone is non-KOS except for a few mobs who are KOS to everyone. This is a quest zone where you get cards and make items etc.. big pain in the ass but great exp zone. No faction hits except on 1 mob. <br />
<br />
PoA - KOS to everything, quest guys are under isle 1.. you get drops through out the zone and turn them in for quest rewards. If you raid sky every day for the next year you might have the drops to make 1 item this time next year if you are lucky. i.e. no one goes there unless it is to get epic item pieces.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uh, there's an assload of things in PoA that aren't kos to anyone.<br />
<br />
&quot;If you raid sky every day for the next year you might have the drops to make 1 item this time next year if you are lucky&quot;<br />
<br />
Er, not really.  I was able to get fairy hide mantle in a 2 day raid a long time ago.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Yes you are correct Morbad, was not thinking...<br />
<br />
Ok let me be a bit more specific hehe.<br />
<br />
Island 1.. Non-KOS<br />
Island 2..KOS<br />
Island 3..Non-KOS<br />
Island 4...Non-KOS<br />
Island 5...KOS<br />
Island 6..KOS<br />
Island 7...Been do long don't remember..Every sphinx DT's<br />
Island 8 - Don't remember..<br />
<br />
Ok that should clear that up hehe :).<br />
<br />
You were damn lucky then Morbad,<br />
<br />
We killed Lord 20 times one day farming Warrior epics and not one mantle dropped. Total personal kills on Lord 100+ Zero mantles. =\<br />
<br />
General comment:<br />
But hey if ya going after that nifty beer mug then PoA is the zone for you ! hahaha</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">The sphinxes on island 7 only DT if you attack them, you can run up and look at them if you want to.<br />
<br />
As far as the mantle goes, I bet we've killed the Spiroc Lord 30+ times for warrior epics, total mantles = 1.  Sometimes the random number generator is your friend, sometimes it's not.  <br />
<br />
It would be a grave disservice to imply that any Sky quest is &quot;easy&quot; to accomplish, sometimes you get lucky.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>morbad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Ah ha! But I DO have the Stein of Flowing Ichor!  Actually, I think I deleted it.<br />
<br />
Sad thing is, the day I got fairy hide mantle, I either got IGS later that same day, or a few days later, and I never used the damn thing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Samuqan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">My question is, why is there a faction for Plane of Hate mobs when you're apparently KOS to start and there does not appear a way to raise this faction?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Actually, I got a fairy hide mantle too (or sphinx hide back in the day).  I always regretted not thinking through my choice and randoming on the hide when I had troll and ogre guildmates who could have benefited more.  (of course, this was one of our first Sky trips, I had no idea the darned thing would be so rare and I would get the only one that ever dropped for us).  I eventually moved on to an IGS and my sky quest mantle remains banked. <br />
<br />
Ah well, hind sight is always 20/20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Targar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">&quot;why is there a faction for Plane of Hate mobs when you're apparently KOS to start&quot;<br />
<br />
Sam,<br />
<br />
Enchanters have all sorts of disguises and and tricks they can do, for example. Mobs are put on factions so that there is no way to circumvent how VI wants the encounter to go. <br />
<br />
Actually in Elemental form you used to be non-KOS up in hate. Was changed when they revamped it some time ago. <br />
<br />
Well anyway thats why everything has faction, or one reason...it is a dynamic world and you have consquences for your actions.<br />
<br />
As for raising hate faction? There is no reason to.</div></div><hr />
