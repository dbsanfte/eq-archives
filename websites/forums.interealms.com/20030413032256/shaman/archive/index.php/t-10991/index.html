<br />
And for those who can't get to the Allakhazams site:<br />
<br />
This quest begins in the Plane of Knowledge on the ‘good’ side. At one of the pools you will find Tratlan Jowyr and Wicas Adaolath. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tratlan Jowyr' <br />
<br />
Tratlan Jowyr looks deeply into the pool in front of him, 'Well darn it! I still can't see anything in this blasted [pool], can you Wicas?' <br />
<br />
Wicas Adaolath says 'Nothing at all. Do you think that he led us astray?' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What pool?' <br />
<br />
Tratlan Jowyr glances up at you like he just noticed your presence, 'This pool. There is supposed to be strong [magic] in it.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What magic?' <br />
<br />
Tratlan Jowyr says 'Scrying magic. These pools can supposedly glance into all of the knowledge past, present, and future.' <br />
<br />
Wicas Adaolath says 'I think we should just do what [Tarerd] wants us to do.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Who is Tarerd?' <br />
<br />
Wicas Adaolath says 'Tarerd is the one who told us about these pools. He wanted us to kill some sort of lizards for him, but we have neither the time nor energy for such adventures. Perhaps you can get some information about the pools from him.' <br />
<br />
Tarerd Gahar is at another nearby pool. <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Tarerd Gahar' <br />
<br />
Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sorry, I have neither the time nor the patience to chat right now.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'Tell me about the pool' <br />
<br />
Tarerd Gahar says 'Oh Tatlan and Wicas sent you did they? I'll tell you what I told them, nothing is free. If you want to know about the pools then I need something [from you] first.' <br />
<br />
You say, 'What do you want from me?' <br />
<br />
Tarerd Gahar says 'I'm sure it'll be easy for an adventurer as you. I am working on a potion, and I cannot currently travel to gather my last component. If you could bring me the blood of a Sarnak I'd be willing to share what I know.' <br />
<br />
Sarnak Blood is of course a random drop from nearly any Sarnak. You can probably find one at a merchant for sale. <br />
<br />
When you have it give it to Tarerd Gahar. <br />
<br />
Tarerd Gahar says 'Ahh this is exactly what I was looking for. All the information I've gathered from these pools has come from Myrist. Thiran will give you the book I used as a reference. Give him this note so he knows I sent you' <br />
<br />
Thiran is a Vicar he's on the first basement floor of the basement (go down one lvl when you enter.) <br />
<br />
You say, 'Hail, Vicar Thiran' <br />
<br />
Vicar Thiran says 'A dark day to you. New Tanaan has opened its arms to all of Norrath's travelers and scholars alike -- though still I doubt most are worthy of our infinite and unsurpassed knowledge. In any case, we all must uphold the laws of our city, else we become as debased and pathetic as the secular, warring cultures of the material universe. You will find that, despite the medium of our birth or the shadow of faith in our hearts, we are all equally tolerant of each being to approach us. Though I myself am no stranger to the duties of a mentor, I do not think that at this juncture, I would provide any useful assistance to any not of the many clergies associated with the pantheon. If you do indeed serve one of the gods of Nature and Influence, then my services may not prove a waste of our collective time. Search my inventory at your will, and purchase what you wish should you find anything of use to you at this point in your life of service.' <br />
<br />
Give him the note: <br />
<br />
Vicar Thiran quickly reads the note, and says 'Tarerd wants me to give you that book? I thought he wanted me to keep it secret. Well no matter.' Thiran rummages through the books in front of him. 'Well this is unfortunate. It looks like I loaned my friend the incorrect book. I'm not sure where he's gone off to, here is the book he was looking for. If you happen to run into Jeren Manri anywhere, he'll probably exchange this book for the book on the scrying pools.' <br />
<br />
Thiran gives you a book “Goblins and their religion”. This is the only clue as to where Jeren Manri is: In the Temple of Droga. His loc is +473.95, +1747.91, -252.16. It’s a very tiny room really a tunnel with fake walls on each end. <br />
<br />
Hail, Jeren Manri' <br />
<br />
Jeren Manri says 'Shhh, be quiet! The goblins may hear you.' <br />
<br />
Give him the book that Thiran gave you: <br />
<br />
Jeren Manri says 'Oh! Thank you, I assume this means that Thiran sent you. I ran off with the incorrect book without thinking to check. Would you be kind enough to return this to him?' <br />
<br />
You actually do not return it to Thiran, the book has 5 charges of bind sight, but don’t panic, that’s not the end. Go back to the very first guy you talked to, Tratlan Jowyr back in Plane of Knowledge, Good Side. Give him the book: <br />
<br />
Tratlan Jowyr leafs quickly through the book. 'Thank you, it will take quite some time to go through all the information here. Here is a little something for your troubles.' <br />
<br />
You gain party experience!! <br />
<br />
And your reward is the: <br />
<br />
Fine Cut, Diamond Inlaid Mask.<br />

 <br />
Certainly not uber but decent for the amount of effort involved. Any 30+ shammy can do this in no time, all you need is invis. Really helps when you're trying to get a reroot off or gate out of a bad situation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Feradach</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did this myself at about lvl32 or so after stumbling across it on allakhazam.  It took less than 30 minutes to do the turn-ins and running around, and yes...with invis there is little to no danger involved.<br />
<br />
The only semi-tricky part was finding Jeren Manri in Droga.  I did have to click off invis before he would respond to my hails, so just be sure to do the turn-in quick and gate out.  The goblins will agro through the fake walls.  <br />
<br />
The faster gate has already saved my barbarian butt a couple of times, so the effort was well worth it.</div></div><hr />
