<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Yeah yeah i know another gear post but bear with me. I know I'm already well equiped and i'm sure somepeople will probably end up flaming but o well.<br />
<br />
With a combination of, luck and hard work I was able to get my smithing skill up before the trival change and since then between cultural armor and sickles for the PotC quest I've made alot of money.<br />
<br />
I've been looking to spend some of this money to improve my gear the problem is it's hard to find things that are upgrades for me that are buyable. Currently looking to buy mithril gloves and boots, and skyshrine chain legs MQ but not surprisingly I haven't been able to find anyone selling these items.<br />
<br />
What i'm looking for is some sugguestion on other upgrades I could possibly buy. I don't care how rare or unusual they would be, price really isn't an issue I just want more things to be looking for. I figure the more things i'm looking for the better the odds someone might actually sell me something =).<br />
<br />
Main things i'm looking for are hps and resists. Ac is nice but as long as the peice has reasonable ac i'm happy. Wis and mana never hurt but not really a major consideration. Main slots i'm looking to upgrade are the cultural parts and boots/gloves. I am close to finishing my 8th shawl but open to ideas there still.<br />
<br />
So anyone out there have any sugguestions for me?<br />
<br />
Incase it wasn't obvious click on my name in my sig for my profile.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I think you might have reached that interesting stage where you just can't buy anything better than what you have.  When I look at your gear, the big upgrades I see would be raid stuff.<br />
<br />
Maybe a shawl of perception for shoulders? Or a choker of the wretched?</div></div><hr />

Haven't seen you on much recently, must keep missing you. :)<br />
<br />
Waist: Bone clasped girdle would be good, Bad AC but good HP/Mana also has the added advantage of 7 Sta and that extend dot effect.<br />
<br />
Arms: Although not buyable they are questable, Spirit Wracked cord from Chardok would be good.  Quest is currently broken but hopefully will be fixed next patch.<br />
<br />
Bracers: No way you are going to get better without going no-drop<br />
<br />
Shoulders: Perhaps a Matchless (Peerless would be almost as good) Dragonwing mantle would be good here. Might also consider Obulus Death Shroud mana conservation III which will work out as about 400 extra mana for you buffed.<br />
<br />
Boots: Mithril Boots are about the best tradable ones<br />
<br />
Hands: Mithril Gaunts are best tradable.<br />
<br />
There really isn't much you could get without going for no-dop stuff.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hiero Cloak<br />
Matchless Dragonwing Mantle<br />
<br />
<br />
Not much else you can really buy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah thought about that. Actually have one on my enchanter. The ac is pretty low and I guess i just still think of it as a caster peice because of the ac.<br />
<br />
Arms: Although not buyable they are questable, Spirit Wracked cord from Chardok would be good.  Quest is currently broken but hopefully will be fixed next patch.<br />
<br />
Definitely a nice peice and i've been thinking about doing it for a while but the hours and hours of killing greens just isn't very appealing.<br />
<br />

ODS is nice but with cann v and torpor I rarely find myself lacking for mana so not too big on the effect. The mantles are nice but I think i'll just finish my 8th shawl rather than buy one of those.<br />
<br />
Boots: Mithril Boots are about the best tradable ones<br />
<br />
Hands: Mithril Gaunts are best tradable.<br />

Yeah mithril would be nice just can't find anyone selling at all grr.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">It depends on your role in a raid. if all you do is MGB and debuffs, mana isnt your big concern..<br />
<br />
If your job is  debuffs, MGB, keeping 5 rodding cler/mages constantly torpored, doing 40k in torrent blasts and rebuffing all fallen dead in a 30+ minute fight  you will need as much mana as possible. I do all that junk in a single fight and even with 4400 mana i get low on mana.<br />
<br />
Yep buy a heiro cloak, that lodi shield is just trash really, sell it before the bottom drops out on its value.  Buy a dragonwing mantle or start working on your 8th coldain shawl quest. Buy a BCG if you see one even for sale. You got a few other weaker spots but those are basically raid upgrades.<br />
<br />
Just make a list of your weaknesses and when an item drops that is a considerable upgrade over that weak spot go for it. When all your weakest spots are covered make a list of your second most weakest sposts and do the same.</div></div><hr />

Been there done that. It's more about mana regen than mana pool in those cases. Thats where cann v, torpor and MC/FT come in.<br />

Almost done with the 8th shawl. Need to just do the hand in and the iceclad warrior. Waiting for a chance to trigger the dain for the guild tho before I finish it up.<br />
<br />
As far as the BCG and the heiro cloak I could have those any time i want them. I've got both on my enchanter. I dislike the low ac on the BCG and i like the resists and Eb on the lod shell. I could definitely gain some quick hps there and some mana but i'm not sure I want to do that right now.<br />

<br />
Thats basically the way I work but it takes time to get drops. Can't get everything you want and even if you could you can't make the things your looking for drop.<br />
<br />
I'm looking for ways to improve my gear outside of raid drops from the guild.</div></div><hr />
