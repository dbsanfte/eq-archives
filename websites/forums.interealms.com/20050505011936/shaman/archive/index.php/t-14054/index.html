<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Peonthis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I want to do the merchant recharge trick on it. But I don't know if it's worth it, since I don't know what the buy back price of the item is. So if anyone know how much merchants charge to buy back a staff of forbidden rites plz reply here. Thanks in advance.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Im hearing its 500k PP a pop.<br />
There was some exploit though where if you put it in a bag and sold it to the vendor you could buy it back for just the price of a bag.  not sure if it would have recharged though and that exploit has been fixed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I think the exploit was fixed when they added all those extra slots to the merchants...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Peonthis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">ack 500k pp? OMG lol ok I guess it goes to the destroy button =(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Chukzombi Astrocreep</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Dont destroy it, ya never know maybe somebody will buy it used or you may be able to buy it back charged for less somehow. When i use the 6 charges on mine i probably will just throw it in the bank, ive had it since Kunark.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Turmoiltoad</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Aye, merchant won't recharge anymore.  Even SoE stated that a while back.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">merchant recharge trick still works, I recharged stalking probes today (too lazy to find a tinkerer, cheap anyways), you'll just pay an arm and a leg for rez stick....</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">It still works, but it costs several hundred K.  Don't destroy it, there just might be someone rich/eccentric enough that will want it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Grimrod Spirithammer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Higher end guilds have that kind of pp if the trick still works.  Just ask around on your server.  There are still some spots where that staff is a very good option.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Pumyr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">My understanding was that the Staff costs some 2 Million to buy back, the recharge trick requires you to have 2 of course so that's 4 million PP. Kinda a lot for even the most extreme guild emergency.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Can't imagine that any guild would pay that for the Staff.  I'd expect that if they really needed it, they'd PL some Monk twinks up and attack Vox.  I still think that it'd be possible to heal/rebuff a FD'd monk and not get on Vox's bad side, for a quick trip to the zoneline.  Plus, I think it'd be fun for them  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Tulurean</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Buyback with high Cha is right at around 257k a stick..so 500k a pop counting both sticks. <br />
And i have seen folks WTB sticks still..even with no charges and the increased buy back rate</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>HermanaCruzadas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes, Tulurean is right, the cost to buy it back recharged was pushed way up.  I believe it had something to do with high level guilds using the charges to res Magicians who were being dragged in high level zones by monks/rogues to camp sites, then summoning the other mag's who would summon the rest of the guild.  This was to avoid massive clearing and use less time to get to the named NPC's and uber loot.</div></div><hr />
