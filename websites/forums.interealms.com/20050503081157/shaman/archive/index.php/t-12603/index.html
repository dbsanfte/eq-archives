<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Just thought I'd see if you all were having the disappearing MuttMutt Problems I've been having.  I have taken to callin' him MuttMutt cause i decided my pet is mad stupid lol so MuttMutt=DogDog :lol<br />
<br />
Okay I'm in Dulak alot latly upping my DEF as was sugested in numerous threads in here.  First great Idea good pp and good skill ups :) BUT MuttMutt can't be anywhere near a wall a bridge a house or hut. . a boat umm a lightpost . . um  acorner or he will get lost I asume due to wacky pathing and despawn.  I might score MuttMutt keepeing me company for a steady 5 minutes it seems.  So I have taken to never using MuttMutt in Dulak.  Have any of you noticed that prob? I try to /guard here to keep him in a spot and not poofing.  but he doesn't listen so well I guess cause after the fight he'll run off to charge the wall regardless of what I say and despawn himself. . maybe hes mad about his nickname? lol<br />
<br />
I have also noticed a simular problem when in the warrens farming up faction.  Not nearly as severe but same prob regardless.  Any feedback appreciated.  <br />
<br />
Laters :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">My pet back when solo'ing in CC for exp was called Speedbump.  I mess up, run to gaurds, and speedbump helps slow down mobs 2 or less seconds as they run over him.<br />
<br />
61 now so pet is very very very nice addition.  One thing I noticed recently is that your pet will not come back to the exact spot that you have him /gaurd at anymore,  he tends to inch along now after everykill.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I have noticed this on my doggie. I have him sitting until he aggros on mob. When the mob dies, that is where he stays. I either leave him there, or have him follow me, then have him sit where I want him. Works for me, don't have to worry about pathing. Worked great when I was killing drunken pirates in Dulak, and when I solo on the boats now...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Thlayli of Xev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I've had problems with my dog in CT. I solo'd a bit right outside 4C (4 corners....big pyramid...not sure what it's called on other servers :p) in the hall right before the archway.  Dog just would not stay up. I tried summoning him in tons of different places, but every time I did, he would stay for about 5 seconds then just die. <br />
Might have something to do with pathing /shrug.<br />
<br />
I hope it gets fixed as they continue to fuss with pathing issues</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shandrillar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I had problems in Dulak also, on boats only though.<br />
It got better, when I made sure I &quot;parked&quot; him with the guard command, and never used follow.  I would pull the mob back to us with slow, and then sick puppy.  Worked alot better for me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">aaaahh that might be my problem. . when i try to get him to backoff to avoid adds n' such and relocate I hit follow and than backoff. . . from prior expsierences i found he listened to /backoff alot better if i hit /follow first.  I'll try not hitting follow and see what happens eheheh :)<br />
<br />
Glad to see I'm not alone with the MuttMutt stuffages btw :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Yea, muttmutt has long been second in stupidy only to the chanter animations which don't listen at all.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Smellious Oderous</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you had him guarding or sitting, and he's on a mob, from my experience he'll stay there by the mob when you tell him to backoff. Of course, if he has any aggro, the mob will thump him and he'll hit back. I actually haven't had any pathing problems in Dulak on the boats. He sits, and attacks when I tell him to. Then he follows to where I want him, when I hit follow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Summon companion is your friend.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Chazic</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I've not had any noticable problems yet in Dulak.  Most times I have him on follow as I walk the spawn points.  If I ever notice dogdog on vaction some where I sit and summon compaion right away as he's not allow to have a lookie see about the zone with out me.  One thing I have noticed with the follow command and Guard command though is that its best to order the command several times in order to get silly pet to listen.  If you only issue it once after the next fight the darn pup is back to doing what ever he darn well thinks best.  Best way to get dog dog off a mob is tell him to follow you several times and then spam the back off command till he get to where you want him.  Darn dog just dont know when to high tell it back to a safe spot.  Sow Also works well to get him out of harms way quick.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Asyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">well I started using guard without hitting follow and its workin' out great.  so that lil' flubber is fixed up now :) But I haven't had the opportunity to try out how to make him not despawn in Dulak as of yet. . hopefully this weekend I can get over there ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>greyfish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I've been duoing with a necro and both of us are having the same problems with the pet.  Pets are set to follow till we get to camp.  Pets then instructed to sit.  Necro pulls back to us and pets are sent in to attack.  When mob goes down, both pets just stay right at that spot unless told to follow.  back off doesn't bring them back.  You can sit them there or have them attack the next mob but they will continue to stay at the spot they are fighting which causes us to have to pull them back to us.  I'm fairly new to having a pet so i'm not sure if it's intended to work that way or not, but from the above posts it seems to have recently changed.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Jeones</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I have been spending a lot of time in Dulak as well.   Beyond the pet getting lost and taking the &quot;long&quot; way back to me, I have not had it despawn.  I keep him in follow mode.  But I just kill wondering guards and critters inside Armory.<br />
<br />
In the mines however he despawned on me last night when I went over the bridge.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jenguran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">/pet sit down<br />
The pet will sit at that spot, when it attacks something it will get up and move, once done attacking it will sit back down, where ever it is.<br />
<br />
/pet guard here<br />
pet will stay at that spot, when it kills something it moves to it and kills it, then gets back to spot it was told to guard.<br />
<br />
Although I think he's been inching around, think he's got worms.</div></div><hr />
