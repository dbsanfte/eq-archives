<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">My mage has been my amin as i level up my shaman.  Both have reached 65 mage has 30ish AA and shaman just 6 aa.  My guild has merged with an eplanes level guild and i have to choose one main only and seconds will get almost no loot per say.  Now i know everyone is going to say play the one you have the most fun with but honestly i love playing them both because they are so different.  I joy the pure DPS, not having to worry about anything but nuking but i always love the things a shaman can do that a mage can not.  I enjoy buffing, slowing or Dotting jsut not as exciting as those crits =).  It is exciting to take on multiple blues with my shaman that would killed my mage in secs.  My mage is in full ornate and shaman just pretty much bazaar shaman with 2500 HP unbuffed.  My new guild has 3 active mages, 5 total and has 3-4 active shaman and 6 being the most on at once include both my guys.  <br />
<br />
My heart tells me go with the shaman because they have so much more to give to the guild and is fun as hell to play with.  A eplane geared shaman is night and day better then a bazaar geared one but a eplanes mages really isnt much beter then a onrate geared one because u are still depend on your pet.  Yes both classes have issues but a shaman will grow in power but a mage will always be suck with the suckass pets we have now.  If i had a level 65 in every class my main would be a rogue or ranger or wizzie but i dont have those options right now only mage or shaman.<br />
<br />
So guys and gals if you were in my shoes which way to go.  LOL i know this is our shaman boards but try to open-minded =).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well besides the obvious choice of going with the one that you prefer, I'd try to figure out which one your new guild is going to need the most.<br />
<br />
With 3-4 active shamans, I'd say you have enough for most raid situations already.  Will an additional shaman be needed over an additional mage?  Shamans have stacking issues in raids, where dps classes like Mages have less of a problem, so I would think that in most situations, if your guild already has 3 or 4 shamans along for guild events, but 3 active mages, an additional mage would be of more benefit to the guild that a shaman is.<br />
<br />
I understand the issues that mages are having with their pet not scaling to the damage output of mobs in PoP and God situations (a rl friend is a mage, and we share complaints about our mains over beer often).  I want to warn you that shaman have a similar situation as they come into harder content.<br />
<br />
Over all though ask your self in a given night with your guild, do we need an additional slower, or an additional DPS class.  If guild does not have groups in need of slowers I'd make the mage the main.  But if your guild has a shortage of slowers, then the shaman would be the first choice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Megara</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Now i know everyone is going to say play the one you have the most fun with but honestly i love playing them both because they are so different.<br />
Keman<br />
<br />
Find a guild that will let you play them both, if you truly love playing both chars.  Otherwise, just play the shaman.  It's more versatile than the mage so it won't get as old.  On a raid, a mage just summons stuff.  At least shamans get to buff and debuff :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I iwll be 2 boxing both toons no matter what but i spend more time on the shaman then i do the mage caus i can hotkey the mage real easy just to nuke.  But still only one is allowed to get loot.  DPS isnt not any issue or slowing/buffing and i did notice there is a stacking issue with our dots which sucks.  With the merging there is not a need for any one class, we have to have some sit out on raids because we have well over 72, more like 80-90 on at a time so there isnt an issue of which class is needed.  The only time my mage has been NEEDED is for CotH and summoning arrows for range only fights other than that i nuke.  Like i said if i had my way i would 2 box rogue/wizzie =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">the only issues that you'd have with stacking dots is if the mob has all of his spots taken up by other dotting classes/debuffs.. meaning everyone of the shaman can stack the same dots on the same mob and until he runs out of buff slots you won't have a problem with that.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'd say seriously I would go with the shaman.  I'm a bit biased of course, but even if some think we have stacking issues on raid, I still think that a shaman gives so much more versatility than a mage would.  Who cares about a little bit more dps, your shaman will be wanted/needed alot more in groups than the mage will ever be.  Personally, i never get tired of playing the shaman and even on raids with five others we always found things to do.  Although, now that it's mainly just me raiding it tends to be a burden at times :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
In that case make the shaman the main. If you feel he is more lewt dependant than the Mage. This is coming from someone whos shaman is the same level of gear aa's as you. I can certainly understand everything you are saying.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tormac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If you're 2-boxing the mage and the shaman a lot, and not worried about which one is needed in a guild raid, I think I would make the shaman the main.  <br />
<br />
If you're two boxing there may be some times when the mage pet can't tank, and then the obvious chioce is your shaman.  You'll want the best hp/ac on your shaman for that.  If you've already got nice focus effects from ornate armor for your mage, equipment should not be as big a factor, and hopefuly your mage will stay out of combat :).<br />
<br />
Since the shaman is the more likely of the two to take hits get his hp/ac up as high as you can.  Make the shaman your main.<br />
<br />
I think shamans and mages make a realy good pair.  Although because of the mage's root/snare issue, the shaman has a better time soloing, but together they make a very nice team.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Fozy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would go with a shaman as your main for the reason that the difference between a well geared shaman and a poor one is huge compared to the difference between a well geared mage and a poorly geared one.  I would continue to two box both of them because together they are a very good combination.  I am currently working on getting a mage to two box.  <br />
I also say go with the shaman as your main because a mage on a whole is much easier to box than a shaman is.  The utility that a shaman can bring is pretty much unmatched by any class, with the exception of a bard I believe.  You will start to notice it more and more when you really get into the swing of playing a shaman.  Though I find that playing the fourth or fifth shaman on a raid is quite boring and pop out my rogue in those cases heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Qatrixaro</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Gear up the shaman first.  <br />
<br />
Believe it or not, the time will come when no one would want to waste DKP on some items that might be an upgrade for your non-main character, so don't worry about the non-main not getting loot.  Raid enough and they will.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Pick the mage.  There is nothing like having 3-4 &quot;Active&quot; raiding shaman with 4-6 &quot;back up/random&quot; shaman in the ranks to make things &quot;exciting&quot;.<br />
<br />
And we don't use DKP, although it would make a lot more sense than the way things are done now. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Stolastorv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Nm didn't read the post correctly.<br />
I'd go with shaman, sounds like your mage is geared up pretty decent, although i would dou them.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Grafsha McDaughts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Shaman for gear for the reasons you already listed: mage is in better/ornate gear and that will last just fine while shaman is likely at a point where the limitations are based on limited gear.<br />
<br />
Toss in you are 2-boxing raids when you can bring both. After this guild has raided the higher end enough that loot drops are rotting you will pick up drops for mage for &quot;free.&quot; <br />
<br />
Gearing up the shaman first will help you tons more for those 2-box solo times when it is just you and the mage than gearing up the mage first would.<br />
<br />
Just remember before you raid to have the mage summon all the weaps/pet toys you may need on the raid!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">besides, if you guys are anything like my guild.. there comes a point in the elementals/time that all silk/leather stuff is rotting for the most part.

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>veeshanMurtak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">If you truly enjoy playing both classes, ask what your guild needs more and play that character. As a bonus, either will be fairly effective without much gear (although the shaman will be a little squishy I guess).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">People come and go from this game, and any given guild.  Don't look at the current numbers as &quot;hard&quot; numbers.  Remember, people don't log on some nights.  You may be required on one char or the other if a raid is going to happen in certain cases.  I'd hang on to both chars, choose a &quot;main&quot; for propriety's sake, and flag both equally.  Maybe gear the shaman first.  shamans with great gear are lightyears better than shamans with not-so-great gear.  Mages . . . well FT helps and focus items help, but ornate pretty much fills in the focus needs and FT can be had in various other capacities.  I'd upgrade the shaman first if it's a class you plan to play.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Forget what your guild needs.  You're playing for yourself; it's a game after all.  If you don't do what you want to do, you'll tire of the game and the guild grind much more quickly than if you're doing what you want to do.  Make yourself happy and you'll have a much better chance of making the people around you happy too.<br />
<br />
I think you might want to ask yourself how much time you'll be raiding.  Shamans have a lot of responsibility, and even when they don't, they spend a lot of time clicking canni instead of talking to their friends, popping out of their seat to grab a soda, etc.  Every time someone dies, it's time to rebuff.  If you can't find someone who needs healing, you're probably not trying hard enough.  There's always something to do.  And chances are, there will always be someone who says you should have dropped whatever it was you were doing and instantly fixated on them, their buffs, their health, whatever.  <br />
<br />
Being a shaman can be aggravating and tiring.  There is some small chance for glory sometimes, and appreciation too.  If you want to be busy all the time, whether you like it or not, be a shaman.  Sometimes you'll feel you're doing something pretty vital, as one of your pay-offs.<br />
<br />
If you want to kick back more, have a chance to leap up and take a pee without people much noticing, and generally feel like the game is a bit less of a grind, be a mage.  There's a lot to be said for having a little time to relax and enjoy yourself -- this being a game and all -- without feeling that you'll be letting people down if you pet the dog or exchange a few tells with friends.<br />
<br />
If you want to gear up quickly, silk rots like crazy from what I see.  You will be able to get your mage geared up very quickly compared to your shaman, so if the idea of having a very powerful toon very quickly appeals to you, you won't have to wait for it near as long with a mage as you do with a shaman.  And when you do wait, it won't be as frustrating.  People won't bug you and moan and groan if your DS doesn't last extra long, if they even want it at all, but they will pester your shamans if your many buffs wear out quick, and the shaman will notice if someone gets off debuffs far faster than he does.  A mage critting for a little less isn't going to draw much attention or pressure for it, and it will fix itself soon enough when you upgrade quickly.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I've found silk stuff to drop very quick compared to chain, from HOT in Velious days to the elemental planes where I'm at now.<br />
<br />
When I was maximum crazy for this game, shaman would have been the only choice I'd even consider.  After a number of years though, kicking back sounds better and better.  Unless you have a serious preference for the shaman, I think the mage actually has quite a bit to recommend it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you could only play one or the other I'd go with the mage. Playing the 3rd or 4th shaman on a raid is rather dull and it doesn't look like your shaman has either the gear or the AA to be the &quot;main&quot; shaman for the raid. Others with SCRM etc. are going to be doing the buffing, those with LR5 doing slows etc. and shaman at the high end are becoming less and less relevant.<br />
<br />
However, if its just a case of boxing both and deciding who's going to get the loot - I'd go shaman. The shaman is further behind so will benefit more from the gear, plus I think they are more gear dependant than mages. Besides, mage can summon nuking focus items anyway :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Juventus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Neither class is terribly loot dependent.  If you had a melee, I would say go with them as the main. Casters and priests function just fine with marginal loot.  Some FT gear is about all that will make a huge difference.  Hit point pool on the shaman helps a decent amount for canny fodder, so of the two I would say the shaman needs a wider variety of gear based upgrades.  Go with the shaman.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Goldark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">Neither class is terribly loot dependent<br />
<br />
Not dependent, nope. Not like most melee classes are and I'd agree with you that if one of the two was a melee, go with that.<br />
<br />
Given the other char is a mage, the shaman will benefit an awful lot more from:<br />
1) HP items (surviving slow aggro when clearing, more hp post canni V)<br />
2) Focus items, as they have a much wider range of roles for which there are different focus items (healing, buffing, debuffing, plus DoT focus if soloing vs. mage is pretty much just nuking based focus items)<br />
<br />
Give a mage improved damage, spell haste and mana preservation for their nukes and they are pretty well set. Their pet dps is not gear dependent at all. <br />
<br />
The list of useful shaman focus items that can make a signifcant difference just goes on and on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>kEMAN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">I have played a mage for along time so i understand the go afk and no one really notices, which is a nice thing =).  Last night i did Bertox for my shaman and i had a blast.  There was only 2 shaman in the raid so we were very busy.  Slowing everyhtig that moves and buffing the dead was alot of work.  I have done Bertox 3 times with my mage and let me tell you last night seemed like time just flew by because i was busy the whole time.  Of the shamans in the guild myself and one other have been to every raid since we merged well for that matter my mage is the only mage to make all raids so i dont think it will be a problem about being in the top 3 shaman in the guild once i get MGB and SCRM and for that matter my mage would be the number one mage but we have casters out the butt.  Most raids we have 10 or so wizzies, 4-6 chanters, and 3 necros.  My shaman is only TT and RZ from eplanes and mage only RZ so they are both about equal, i hope to get Tt this weekend so he can group up in sol ro.  All in all i think shaman is the way to go still wish i had a level 65 rogue and wizzie to 2 box =).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">I wouldn't worry too much about flowing thought on the shaman, either.  It's nice of course, but I generally worry about my hitpoints much more than my mana regeneration, since getting hit is so much a part of a shaman's game.  <br />
<br />
I just dropped a FT2 bracer(ornate) for a bracer from a LDON that has 40 HP more.  Maybe not all would agree, but I'd rather have the hitpoints.<br />
<br />
I only have FT5 without it, compared to the FT7 I would have, but it doesn't really bug me.  FT is not too hard to max or just get pretty high when you get elemental level upgrades -- in Earth you can get a FT7 shield, for instance -- and it's just not as big a priority for us as it is for others.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't be too carried away about discounting how much we need equipment though.  My shadowknight can function fine in LDON and some of PoP in just cultural armor, very few AA, and a store bought weapon; my shaman, if similarly geared and AA'd, would have a great deal of trouble doing the same level of mobs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Blarg, you and your group of adventurers should really start working on the GoD trials.  You can accomplish everything you have always been thwarted on in these trials.  The loot on the first 4 trials is kind of not so great, however we did see several items drop from trash mobs that were 100+hp items.  Not bad really.  However, the real loot starts happening during the Tier2 of trials.  You say you'd like a little FT but don't wanna sacrifice any hps?  There's this nice little aug (Bauble of rejuvenation) that adds 2FT/2regen and goes in any slot.  The best part, it drops from the easiest named in tipt trial, also the first named, so it's easy enuf to get to.  There's alternate loot from cragmom too, but that's also good, for melees.  Anyway, if you're still with that group you used to run with where you'd do those 1 group missions, try out GoD.  You can get elemental quality gear there with one group.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">Been doing it a little here and there; do fine when the tank and cleric are really good well geared and well AA'd, hopelessly badly when they're not.<br />
<br />
All in all, the expansion is beyond the capability of most of the people I run with, so I have to luck into the right crowd at the right time.  <br />
<br />
When more people I know have at least some fiew pieces of elemental gear, then it will more worth doing.<br />
<br />
Right now, I'm spending most of my time raiding elementals anyway, so GoD and other things are only an option on weekends.  Kind of a real quick chance on getting them, or else have to wait till the next weekend.  When everyone I know is geared up better, at least those opportunities I do get to jump in on will have a better rate of succeeding.<br />
<br />
Frankly, at this point I would just as soon skip doing GoD with most people I know.  Trying to things that are beyond them just chews up time voraciously that I could spend on better outcomes -- like some LDON armor, heck, reading a book or watching a video heheh.  <br />
<br />
Oh well, I'm not too rushed for it -- I've done Tipt and Vxed but still need a couple of sewers, but most of the stuff beyond that I would guess is simply beyond the ability of the people I run with anyway, so there's not much point worrying about for a good long while.  If ever, heheh.</div></div><hr />
