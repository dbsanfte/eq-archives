Extra damage, resist modifier and cheaper to cast.  I know we have canni and malo, but malo still takes time to cast as well as mana, and necros have good mana regen as well without any effort (no casting constantly to get mana back).<br />

Not getting class envy here, just was disappointed to see these spells were not equal and interested to see what other people have to say.</div></div><hr />

NERF NECROS!!!<br />
<br />
/silly off<br />
<br />
we just need to whine more and have some sit-in/stand-out/stand-up/sit-on/sit-out/stand-sit something and maybe something will be done about the unbalanced post 60 shaman world.<br />
<br />
I mean we can heal nearly as well as a druid? AND we can DoT nearly as good as a necro??!?!<br />
<br />
NERF SHAMAN!<br />
<br />
I mean<br />
<br />
KILL DRUIDZ!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Namurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I don't think it's imbalanced, necros are supposed to do more damage than us.  We're a priest class with chain armor, slows that work on everything, live or dead, and heals.  Malo/s having a cast time and mana cost is irrelevant.. any spell has those.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Why do people always look at what the other guys has and say... Iwantiwantiwantiwant. Yes the necro one dose a little bit more damage for a little less mana. (shrug) no big deal if you ask me and if you figure in malos ours is actully easier to land.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Probably didnt make it exactly the same because people would complain about sharing spells. So made them slightly different. See now we arent sharing dots!<br />
 <br />
 As for the resist mod.....dunno dont play other casters enough but sure if they didnt have a debuff sure be frustrating not having anyway to debuff a mob. I can debuff whatever i need to disease, poison etc etc.....Suppose would of made alittle sense to make spells with a built in mod to cost more mana than one without?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Aselus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Want to dot like a Necro? Play one. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Ancere</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Oh nos! Necros get snare and can fd and have a lich pet and us Shaman can't what a rip off.... <br />
<br />
On the other hand, Let them heal the group (in a pinch) or tank a 400+ mob for any amount of time :)<br />
<br />
Necros and shamen have different abilities, it is like comparing Apples to Oranges if you ask me.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Hey, remember when we got more powerful dots (though not the ignite or darkness lines) than necros did?  Like...envenomed bolt and plague at 49, while they had to wait til 51 to get them?  Kunark, anyone?   :rolleyes: <br />
<br />
That's why our nukes are so craptacular, because back in the day, our dots packed a lot of punch.  Now we're one of the lowest DPS classes, period.  Whee.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">lol before this gets fullblown he wasnt comparing necro's and shaman as a whole. Just one 64 lvl dot that are similiar. I think the point ( i of course can be wrong) is the spell cost slighty less mana , does a little more damage and has a built in debuff and still less mana than ours and we might still have to debuff resists on the side for it to land. <br />
<br />
   Comparing similiar dots is more apples to apples...Is it so wrong to talk about it? Dont think anyone is looking for a nef. Does it make sense a spell with built in debuff costs less mana? Think its possible to have a discussion on this without turning into a flame/nerf fest. (not saying anyone is yet)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>thRover</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">This game has never been balanced and it never will be. I hate that my spells get bounced so often but oh well. Really I hate that I have to jump through hoops just to get the spells that are just going to be resisted anyway.  :( <br />
As for having a discussion without it turning into a flamefest, it sure seems to get harder and harder for someone to post any kind of opinion without someone feeling inclined to be insulting. Too bad really, I used to look forward to reading this board.<br />
Anyway, we are not supposed to be good at dealing damage. Thats why our pets are subpar, our nukes are weak and our dots are less appealing than some of the things others can use. The supposed payoff is that we are wanted for our ability to slow. I guess its hard to ask people to be happy doing just one thing all the time. Its in our nature to want to be able to do more. I know I sometimes feel useless after I've gotten a big mob slowed and there is nothing left to do that I can do really well (healing, nuking, etc).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Piglet</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Yes the necro one dose a little bit more damage for a little less mana. (shrug) no big deal if you ask me and if you figure in malos ours is actully easier to land.<br />
If you figure in malos then the cast time and mana cost for the shaman one goes up quite a bit too...  ;) <br />
<br />
Just an interesting coincidence imo Dmuscat. I'd be interested in sating my perverse curiosity if I could by finding out if the figures were pure coincidence or if they deliberately tilted the same spell slightly in the favour of necros (I suspect the latter but morbid fascination means I want to know :p), but I'm not worried any which way about who has the better deal etc. We share enough of the same spells anyway and by the time we get to 64 the two classes are so different in so many ways that it's really not much of a comparison. Makes for a good discussion but tbh I think it matters very little in practice.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I am pretty sure they did the magic resist mod on purpose. For the reason of mal(x) they must think none of our spells need (-) mods on it, but frankly I am tired of being resisted so much AFTER Malos that I dont think it would be wrong to give us a little (-) modifier on our spells. I am not asking for much, but I just hate resisting spells after I spend all the mana to Malos while I watch a druid hardly get resisted on his dots without a MR debuff (off subject).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Necros also get a debuff line that affects some of their dots, but the last one they recieve (unless I'm mistaken) is Scent of Terris (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=1716&amp;source=Live).  Its a PR check, so its easier to land than a magic check debuff, but seeing as the last level is so low its effectiveness against any mob that the Necro could use the lvl 64 dot on is questionable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Just be glad the disparity isn't as great between Necro/Shaman DOTs as it is between Druid/Shaman healing. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">LoL no kidding. I won't even start beating that dead horse. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>JESTER</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I have played a nec alt, but would never leave emy shaman to play nec full time.  Although the nec is fun I like the jack of trades ability of the shaman</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Well, what can't a necro do? They can almost do it all. Granted some of the stuff they can do is feeble, like healing other people, but they can do it. They are as much a jack of all trades as a Shaman if not broader but perhaps not as deep if you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Nerun Starblade</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">I remember when we had the best dots - but then I remember when CH chains were the only way to do anything.<br />

Not everyone can be happy.<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
but, I wouldn't argue if they lowered the mana cost on bane :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>dmuscat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Thanks for all the comments, it's interesting to see what people have to say.  After reading all these posts I am actually more gratefull for having this spell at all then it being slightly inferior to the necro version.<br />
<br />
But then again, it seems we have got this culture in EQ to never rest on being satisfied with your class, because if you do, you can expect the nerf bat to swing your way, or to miss out on better stuff in the future.<br />
<br />
We are all protective of our class, thats why I guess these discussions become so heated.  When you put so much time and effort in to your character you want it to be as powerful and as fun to play as possible (remember we play for the fun of it right?) and sometimes we are at the mercy of the EQ developers with their changes and class balance fixes.<br />
<br />
As a closing comment I will leave you all with these thoughts:<br />
<br />
1.  We are a great class to play.<br />
2.  We don't need changes as much as Warriors or Monks do.<br />
3.  It's only a game.</div></div><hr />
