<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I was hoping someone here might know of a page with info on each of the named mobs and the Minis in SolRo.  I want to start doing these on a regular basis with guild/friends but wanted to know the strengths and weakness of each mob before we try em so I know what we need.  Any help would be greatly appreciated</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Well, here is a map.  http://eqatlas.com/planes/solusekrostowermap.html<br />
<br />
This will help you with the mobs http://eqbeastiary.allakhazam.com/search.shtml?zone=164<br />
<br />
Dont have a map showing where the named are, you might have to poke around for a better map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That map has the minis labled, just not the key:<br />
<br />
X=Xuzl<br />
A=Arlyxir<br />
R=Rizlona<br />
D=Dresolik<br />
J=Jiva<br />
<br />
None of them are particuarly hard, just take a raid force, can do most of them with 2-3 groups (take more the first time), I listed them in order of what I think their difficulty is.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Just go try em without spoilers, they are not difficult at all. They have a few fun suprises but nothing particularly nasty.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Xuxl = 4 sword pets that hit for like 1600.  They come in two's when you pull and are slowable, rootable, mezzable, snareable, etc... Xuxl is fully slowable and a huge *****.<br />
<br />
Arylixir = A pov golem with lots of HP and a DS.  Huge *****.<br />
<br />
Rizlona = ***** bard npc that turns in to a huge ***** dragon.  Has some weak fire AE.<br />
<br />
Dresolik = Long clear.  4 boss mobs at the top of tower and a 5th that spawns when the other 4 dies.  All are huge pussies.<br />
<br />
Jiva = Huge ***** that spawns adds that cast AE's and need to be mezzed.  Take a decent CC team with healing support.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Careful on Rizlona and maybe one more mob i forget to get the heck out of the hall that leads to her. Deathtouch mobs spawn there once you engage the named.  <br />
<br />
Xuzl has a very nice detrimental haste shield -- perfect shaman item!  Speeds up slows and malos remarkably.  Did it one time with 14 very average people and one or two ubers; only me and cleric as healer.  (I wasn't even full ornate back then.)  Nice thing about sol ro zone raids is anything can drop ornate molds.  This often serves as a great motivator, and it means you can sometimes get a great haul even if you don't get just the right drops on the nameds that you want.  These guys are worth farming a lot for guilds working on the VT and even early elemental stages; chances are there's always someone with a slot that could really use something of at least ornate quality.  <br />
<br />
Protector of Dresolik also drops a very nice primary that shamans can equip.  <br />
<br />
I think Riz, forget, drops shoulders commonly with a nice shaman focus.<br />
<br />
Sol Ro zone is basically the reward zone for all of the elemental flagging you had to do while watching endless melee drops happen and almost nothing drop for the healers.  It's loot heaven for shamans; I'd suggest you go do it as much as you can.</div></div><hr />
