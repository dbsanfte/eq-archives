<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bearknukl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">He felt he was tearing apart, as pain wracked his body, and with it a pulsing throb filled his mind. Traitor, Traitor, Traitor… Throwing his head back he screamed in anguish, in pain, and in betrayal… <br />
<br />
The sun was bright for a day so cold. The cold didn't matter much however for the Halas Heaters seemed to be living up to their names. Strewn about in the grass were empty flasks. Picking up each in turn Bearknukl checked for any few drops remaining. Finding one half empty, he sloshed it around happily and returned to lounging against the hard stone surface of the spire. <br />
<br />
“Get up you lazy ass. We’re going to port up soon.” <br />
<br />
Bear squinted in the sun, as he looked up at his tall dark companion. Getting up he wiped a few crumbs and leaves of grass off his kilt. <br />
<br />
“Azriel, my friend, come join me in some refreshment,” he said offering a half finished flask with a crooked smile, “we can travel to Luclin tomorrow, if I wanted to be surrounded by smelly cats and short people with large heads, I’d visit your mothers house.” <br />
<br />
Laughing the Erudite patted his friend on the back. “Don’t worry friend, I hear there are many more sites to see, women to carouse, and bars to attend. And I hear Shadow haven provides quite a selection of new brews.” Hearing this perked Bears ears. And with that he grabbed Azriel, lifted him, and spun him around with a little bit of stumbling and a brief crash into the Runed Wall surface. “Put me down you drunken oaf. You drink more than a Dwarf, and for the last time stop that hideous maneuver you call dancing.” All the time as he admonished Bear, a smile of warm friendship crossed his face. <br />
<br />
A buzzing sounded, and the Scion began to cast her spell. Bear scrambled through his many belt pockets for the jagged little stone, finding it; he displayed it happily to his friend. Azriel’s smile then changed. It turned into something unholy evil. And that’s when Bear noticed that Azriel was silently casting as well… <br />
<br />
Infinity seemed to stretch out in front of him. Although eternally black he could feel his size within the universe. The sheer size of Infinity racked his mind, and fear caused him to retch. Tearing, tearing, tearing… his body felt as if it were being pulled into every different direction imaginable. It was as if his substance was foreign and must be destroyed in this world of pain and suffering. Yet the pulsing continued, and in his hand he felt stabilization, something was holding him there. Yet just at that point the wind was knocked out of him. It was as if a sea of black had flooded him and was crushing his now withered body…. <br />
<br />
to be continued so long as people don’t think it sucks.</div></div><hr />
