<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">One might think that the description of an LDON raid would be perfect for a guild like mine.  We field about 21 including a couple bots on our strong raid nights.  We work very well together and are well equipped for our level in the game.  We struggle with being a late night pacific time guild, everything is dead by the time we have raid strength, and being able to muster a large number of people based on erratic mob times.  A solid group of any of my guildies can pass a &quot;hard&quot; level adventure without too terribly many problems or at least make a credible attempt.<br />
<br />
Tonight we tried our first LDON raid.  We took 19 people.  We did normal level, what sounded like a type of &quot;slaughter&quot; mission in the Mistmoore theme.  We had a warrior, 2 pallies, 2 chanters, 3 clerics, 3 shamans, 3 bards, 1 ranger, 1 rogue, 1 wizard, 1 necro and 3 monks.  We had plenty of tanking, CC and healing.  We're all level 65.<br />
<br />
We zoned in and wiped to a train of 4 mobs.  They have large agro range.  They are red and yellow to 65.  Some see invis, some do not.  Most, since they are red and yellow, are unlullable/pacifiable.  Some are mezzable, some are not.  Mobs with the exact same name are sometimes mezzable, sometimes not.   The mobs are tightly packed and very social.<br />
<br />
The gargoyle types were unslowable with grummus(decay) and turgurs(malos/tash/hos), but no immune message - they quad for over 1000.  The one mob we could slow and mez, a spider, mitigated slow to mostly.  No matter how hard we tried, our pallies just couldn't take the hits.  Not to mention the fact that our clerics were forced to use Supernal Light, (they have haste of mithaniel and full max healing aa) and that heal couldnt keep the pallies or even a defensive warrior standing for long.   Not to mention the warrior couldn't keep agro off his healers, when they are pouring that much into him.  <br />
<br />
After 5 attempts, working through which mobs can be lulled, mezzed, slowed, which need to be offtanked, where we need to stand to avoid adds, etc and nothing looking better for our chances of success, we gave up.  We didn't even manage to kill 1 mob.  <br />
<br />
Personally I think this is bull****.  The LDON raids really could have helped guilds like mine that dont have the desire to bulk up to 100+ members and just want to raid together twice a week.  I don't understand why a &quot;normal difficulty&quot; raid, with 18 people would be so impossibly hard.  <br />
<br />
Looks like you have to be plane of time equipped if you wanna do a raid with under 36 of your friendly neighborhood zergs.... on normal level.<br />
<br />
What a sad disappointment... though I guess I shouldn't be surprised after watching them advertising in beta for weeks that they are testing raid content for only &quot;time&quot; equipped guilds.<br />
<br />
Does anyone have raid experiences in any of the other themes, other than mistmoore, that would seem to be of a lower degree of difficulty?<br />
<br />

Sounds almost like they actually picked hard and not normal, because mobs hitting for 1k on &quot;easy&quot; is a bit off...</div></div><hr />

<br />
  Nope, not at all.  Actually we did NORMAL on the Guk raid, had more people (4 full groups) and we had it even worse.  Some mobs quadding for 1350, I'm not making this up.  Unmezzable, took me 4 tries to land slow on ONE of the 4 mobs in camp, and this was after it was malos'd/malosoniad, then tashed...<br />
<br />
  Not to mention, the raid quest SPLIT our raid in half, so we were supposed to deal with 3 Avatar of War hitting mobs at once, with 2 groups???  Its a bit unbalanced at the moment for casual guilds, especially if you do not have the maximum allowed raid force.  Be safe!</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are only 2 levels to LDON adventures and raids.  Normal and Hard.  We chose Normal, I am 100% certain.<br />
<br />
Before you flame, be aware that I wouldn't expect the same quality of loot from a raid that was tuned for 18 people at a pre-elemental level as I would from one tuned for 36 people who have killed Quarm.<br />
<br />
A fairly straight forward way for the system to judge what difficulty of a raid mission we should do would be by the number of players in raid and taking an average of our POP flags.  I enjoy challenging content 100% ... it's a big reason why I am in the guild I am in.  I don't want something easy and dumbed down, but I do want something appropriately hard and challenging to the level of my raid.<br />
<br />
I've seen people on other boards saying, shutup whiners, people were complaining about how hard Grummus(for example) was on teh first days of POP too.  I can recognize that.  However, on the first days of POP when people were first trying Grummus, they still had levels to obtain, lots of new AA to get and a bunch of new spells that would help them with the encounter.  In LDON we have neither additional levels, nor AA's nor spells that would make any difference to our abilities in these sorts of encounters.  OMG GRP SHREW!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal mode for group adventures is incredibly easy.<br />
I haven't seen a hard adventure yet.<br />
<br />
I've been on 1 normal raid on Mistmoore assassination kill.<br />
We were lucky enough to be able to zone in invis and move to a safe spot to begin pulls.<br />
We had pulls of 2-4 mobs every time.<br />
The mobs are rather magic resistant.<br />
After malos, it took an average of about 2-3 slows to land one, though we didn't have hos or tash landing I don't think.<br />
Our CC tanks would either die due to not enough heals, or the healers got too much aggro and died first, then we'd wipe.<br />
We wiped about 3 times, or so, then the mission ended with 2 hours left basicly cuz we died too often.<br />
The worst was a shade that split into 2 shades when killed, and when we killed one of the splits, it split again.  That was out last wipe.<br />
<br />
I know with more practice we'll do ok, but as it is right now, I kind of wonder if they mixed up the normal and hard settings?<br />
Like, maybe if you pick &quot;hard&quot; you get mobs that hit for 700s and have low resists and stuff and only double attack instead of quad?  :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually, you have a full expansion worth of Augments &amp; other upgrades to invest in still, similar to when PoP first came out w/ the Grummus wipes as you mentioned in your analogy.  I would imagine that after a few months of gearing up (&amp; I think the Bane DoT will matter for dps) that the increase in hp &amp; such will make these raids easier.  Figure you can get an extra ~50hp per piece (or regen/vengeance, FT, etc) of gear that you are wearing, but that is going to take alot of time.  We all know how Sony wants you to spend your time...<br />
<br />
The leaderboard on E. Marr (not me by a long shot) has a few with 35 successful adventures right now - after LESS THAN A WEEK.  That's close to 1800 points (using only normal settings) in just a few days, which would be enough for all your spells and a few decent augments.  Figure most of the high end of the leaderboard have about half that right now.  At this rate, it will only be a month or two before guilds who are already geared (Luclin or better) that concentrate on LDoN will have significantly improved their average hp/mana levels to a level that these raids (even smaller ones like yours) will be attainable in my opinion.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry your raid went badly, and I can sympathize with your small guild # problems for fielding 3+ groups.  Honestly though, my last guild wouldn't even consider it a raid unless we had 3 groups, and those were marginal raids at best to hit small stuff we wanted.  When I think raid, I think of 5-6 groups OR MORE.  Maybe the developers think of a raid as being the same or bigger.  Consider most of your Tier3 gods are encounters for 40+ people, and that's where most of the competition for spawns is.<br />
<br />
The roadblock for most medium to large guilds simply isn't content that can be killed with 3 groups or so.  Those are snacks for them.  Spawn content that takes 5-6 groups or more is highly competitive, and those are what I personally think the LDoN raids are designed for.  Due to the nature of the LDoN raids though, your small guild can now EASILY plan alliance raids with other like-sized guilds and I think you will have much better luck with 6 groups than with 3.<br />
<br />
I really think this was an extremely well designed expansion, and it has something for the small group exp'er as well as the medium+ sized raiding guild.  It isn't flawless, but they carefully took into account what we as players were complaining about the most...Based on feedback from people like us on those cheesy surveys, that's where the most of their energy went into with LDoN.  <br />
<br />
Good luck on your next raid!<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

I haven't seen a hard adventure yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG, could you people PLEASE quit saying this!! That is why they have 2 modes. If normal is SO easy for you, then dont do them... Do hard mode! I am only 50% on my win/loss because I am doing mosly pickup groups and a lot of people can't handle normal as it is. As a shaman, it may be easy if you are supporting a good group, but you aren't winning these by yourself, and are either lucky or have a solid group every time.<br />
<br />
Normal is good for a &quot;normal&quot; i.e over 50% of the population group, you can't be sure you will win every time. Some adventures are just harder than others also, call it luck or whatever.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't pick and choose the &quot;perfect&quot; group every time, and have been in groups with 60-65 members of all classes, and the difficulty of these mixed level adventures is no different than an all 65 group. Try winning these &quot;easy&quot; adventures with a random 61 Pally tank, and 60 Druid healer in bazaar equipment and see how easy they are.</div></div><hr />

Normal is just plain boring. Hard is a lot of fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Used Car</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It's easy to get a solid group, and it's even easier to turn a solid group into an excellent group: Primary healer, a good tank, you and any random dps (mage/rogue/ranger/druid/wizard)x3 and you are gtg.<br />

And if you are wanting to just farm points and ensure a victory, just pick assassination and use the ldon maps...then you know exactly where to go and you won't have to worry about the time limit, especially since the time limit is generally what causes a failure and not because of deaths.  Even a cleric can pull (65 pacify) if you are lacking &quot;good&quot; CC, and as a shaman, parking is second nature.  And if you can't find a cleric or a bard, a shaman is capable of pulling specific themes pretty well.<br />

I agree, if I put a group together, and choose the adventure I can be sure of a win. But if I am lfg and I get invited to a 3 Ranger (although well equipped), Wizzy, Chanter group for a Deepest Guk collection adventure like I did yesterday, I will make the best of it and have fun even if we didn't win.

Easy for you might be challenging for others.<br />
<br />
I enjoy trying to do whatever I can with my guildmates and so far I am 0 - 4 on adventures on NORMAL. At this stage they are definately challenging to us because most of us are not min max players that play 10 hours a day.<br />
<br />
Do the Hard ones instead - they are made for you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">My experience with &quot;normal mode&quot; GROUP adventures has been exclusively in MIR, and I would not call them easy by any stretch of the imagination.  There is quite a variance between the types of missions, so I would rank them in terms of difficulty (easiest to hardest):<br />
<br />
1. exterminate X mobs<br />
2. collect X items<br />
3. assassinate Mr. X<br />
4. rescue Mr. X<br />
<br />
The assassinate and rescue ones would be easier if the the guy to assassinate/rescue was always in the same spot, but that would be pretty boring (only done one of each, so I have no idea if that is the case or not).<br />
<br />
My standard group (which is equiped in gear similar to my own, if you look at my magelo) almost always wins our encounters, but they are often VERY close and we work VERY hard to do it.  Its funny how an expansion can change how you play; our cleric has never nuked so much in his life, and I've actually been using quiessence all the time on the puller and MT (literally all the time -- we never stop moving).  I was also somewhat surprised at the amount of DPS me and dogdog can put out during an adventure if we really work at it.  In a normal group, I hover around 70 percent mana with some lulls and some spikes.  In a LDoN raid, I hover at 0 -- and as soon as I get mana, its used either slowing or nuking.  I don't even bother with malos at all -- I just cast and hope.<br />
<br />
EDIT:<br />
<br />
For those finding these group adventures too difficult, try these suggestions:<br />
<br />
1. ignore all chests and/or &quot;injured mob&quot; traps<br />
2. move in small jumps with your puller<br />
3. pull multipes -- its why you have an enchanter<br />
4. dps &gt; all -- the mobs dont hit that hard, so dont kill yourself trying to slow them; if they resist twice, just nuke them down<br />
5. dont stop -- if the cleric goes afk, you heal.  if the tank goes afk, you tank (or someone else tanks).<br />
6. never let them see you swea...  oh, wrong advice<br />
7. use dogdog -- he sucks alot less than you might think<br />
8. use mage gear -- the cast time ring, damage bracer, and that earrring they summon are all good focus items<br />
9. get your bane spell (i haven't yet; you know you want it though) -- that spell seems custom geared to doing alot of damage in a s hort amount of time during which you can canni for mana instead of just sit there waiting for your nukes to finish casting<br />
10. canni-dance on the move -- my group thinks im insane, im sure, but I sit down for every tick that i can, even if we're moving from one location to another<br />
<br />
The most important thing is to move like lightning.  If you have someone pulling mobs to you over ANY distance, thats wasted time.  If they pull singles, thats MULTIPLIED wasted time.  If they try to counteract that by leaving early to pull the next mob, thats wasted DPS which translates to wasted time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shavedman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I think the reason they made LDoN raids sooooo hard is so that the guilds that beat PoP can work on Ldon instead of them all just quiting. They need to keep all the high end guilds Hooked still, with something to do. The way some people explain these Normal raids it seems that hard raids will probally be harder then PoP content. Just my opition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Henora- it just sounds like your gonna need 36 people to do those raids, i doubt the raid scales to lower difficulty with less people</div></div><hr />

I would argue that no number of augments or small gear upgrades will ever equal what 5 levels, a new high level spell set, including new debuffs, hp buffs and heals, and an entire new set of AA's did for us.  The Bane dot means nothing for me, I doubt I will even buy it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Naagruz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">I would bet solidly on the LDoN &quot;raid&quot; level encounters being designed for elemental+ guilds simply because people at that level are crowding into the extremely limited top-end content of PoP.  PoP was NOT designed for 10+ guilds of 70-100 people each roaming the Elementals/Time and in order to hold onto these players SOE needs some sort of out to keep them entertained.<br />
<br />
It sounds like Sony needs to throw another level onto raid encounters so that everyone can get a little more enjoyment out of LDoN.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, why should I have to explain that your reply has nothing to do with my point. He is saying how easy normal is, and I am saying they aren't easy for a good share of us.<br />
<br />
You keep powering through on normal, racking up points. I have no problem with that so I won't comment.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Shabura Naarteban</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">They announced before launch that the LDoN raids were intended for people doing the current &quot;raid content&quot;.  That doesn't mean guilds that are raiding Velious or Luclin stuff ... it means folks in Tier 4+.  In fact the normal raids are a pretty solid challenge for an Elemental guild on normal (although some of these raids are MUCH easier than others, it seems), and the hard raids ... provide something exciting for the PoTime crews to do.<br />
<br />
If you aren't in one of these groups of people, the raids probably aren't going to be a lot of fun for you.  Normal mode adventures are intended for &quot;most&quot; of the population, with hard for folks who could do raids or who are in for a serious challenge.  Contrary to what some people have said, I *do* think a substantially pre-Elemental group can do okay in Hard, although the mobs do tend to remind me of crawling around in PoEarth. =)  The loot off the random rares on Hard is good enough to be worth it for non-Elemental equipped people, especially if you forego trying to win in favor of hunting them down.  I've seem 90 hp/mana leather sleeves, a 100 hp ring, and an 85 hp melee earring with a 2 pt innate damage shield off loot rares on Hard.  Even if you die some and really rack up the losses getting them ... those kind of items go a long way towards making people in a lower-tier guild (to which I mean no offense ... I was one for a loooong time, and remember it fondly) gear up towards higher level stuff.<br />
<br />
LDoN isn't easy.  But there's a lot of real gems to be had.</div></div><hr />

I missed this announcement.  Do you have a link?<br />
<br />
In regards to your other comments - we've seen some of the items off Hard adventures, Gwain, another shaman in my guild has the ring you mention...and they are nice and I would be happy if we could raid together to get items like that as well, alas they are for single group only.  There are lots of threads about single group adventures but I am interested in hearing about others experiences in LDON raids.  :)</div></div><hr />

I've not tried Ldon raid content yet, but atm I'm definately stuck in a wedge between hard and easy mode,  Today we finished a Tak easy assasination adventure in 30 minutes, but we still can't beat hard mode, we simply don't have the dps for it.</div></div><hr />

We used a full 36 man crew and It did not seemed overly difficult, just standard work.<br />
Mobs allmost all slowable, almost always single pullable and no really nasty hitters (max was tripple for 2K i think)<br />
<br />
Bosses had a nice trick to them.<br />
<br />
Seems to me you just had a one of the Harder normal settings raids.<br />
But I have my doubts these will be beaten by less then 30 anytime soon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u24"><b>Kianor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p24">My guild tried a raid last night, for the first time. We tried a Mistmoore one on normal. 35 people, elemental guild. Our experiences were similar to Juujuu's<br />
<br />
We zoned in and right off there were 2-3 mobs hitting us, and several people (including myself) went splat.<br />
<br />
We tried FD split pulling a few, one pull got 7 mobs, someone was too close, they have large agro range, more people went splat.<br />
<br />
Our guild's main tank (over 9khp buffed) had 3 mobs on him at one point and went down very fast. As he put it, he was owned.<br />
<br />
In short, we had quite a few deaths, and one full wipe (though quite a few people managed to zone), before we even managed to move past the zone in area. We were getting the hang of it though, somewhat, when it failed on us.<br />
<br />
The time given for the raid was 180 minutes, but we were around 30-40 minutes in when it said we failed, and we had 30 minutes if we wanted a lesser reward. There was some message about the boss (the one we were supposed to kill) moving to another place.<br />
<br />
I don't know if that was a bug, but it seemed like a bug to me. No-one quit the adventure, and there was no warning about only being allowed a certain number of deaths. As far as we knew, there was only the time limit. It was somewhat disappointing.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know if the difficulty of raids is tailored to the number of people in the raid at the time - I have heard both yes and no. However, if it isn't, I wouldn't recommend taking only 18 people in.<br />
<br />
Overall, it did seem very tough. Maybe we were unlucky and had a more difficult raid than average, but it's quite possible with a little practice and getting used to it, we could do much better, just like learning a new encounter.<br />
<br />
I would certainly not recommend it for a casual guild though.</div></div><hr />

Did you have a bard use HoS with thund. drum of karana (easy to obtain for 5k)? A bard with decent AA (42) using HoS debuffs MR by 50. And with the new LDoN chant, it debuffs MR by 55. That's very significant. There are some mobs pre-LDoN that require the full set of debuffs for slow to land reliably (like BoT nameds), these may be like that. <br />
<br />
Also are you sure you can't split the mobs? Got a real good monk/bard pull team? Maybe some others can give feedback on if they could split the mobs. If you only use a monk and then say mobs are unsplittable then I dont beleive you. Many 'unsplittable' mobs can be split by a bard, or a duo of monk/bard.<br />
<br />
As for the 'zoned into a train', thats very easy to avoid. Have a DA-ed monk (via bard or clr) zone in, train away and FD.</div></div><hr />

If you take 85% of raids that fail and just do extremely minor tactical things, they would be successes. Alot of what separates uber guilds from lowers is not number of members, levels, gear - it's tactics. I remember back in the day when people said how impossible it was to break into fear and my guild found it a total breeze - due to tactics.</div></div><hr />

ya LDoN raids are hard. I tried to lead one and it didnt go so well neither heh. some of my guildies are mad that their leaderboard positions went down :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Rorgg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">I'm also caught in the middle of medium/hard.  I'm 65 with 68 AAs, I have 2 pieces of ornate, 2 pieces of VT, and some really mediocre stuff like Silver Hammer Earring and Tae Ew BP.  Our guild is SolRo flagged, but hasn't taken down Rallos Zek.<br />
<br />
At this point, I'd say medium adventures aren't difficult in a guild group.  I've come close on time a few times, but apart from the one time I grouped with a total yahoo tank I got off /who lfg, the tight ones were due to bad luck in dungeon layout or drop rate on collections, not inability to handle the dungeons.<br />
<br />
However, I have no illusions that perhaps apart from being grouped with the best and best-equipped players in my guild, doing hard mode would be a failure.  So, I'll keep doing and winning normal mode... I'm having a lot of fun.  My record?  13-1.<br />
<br />
The one loss was the raid we tried.  Great googlymoogly, it was Mistmoore, similar to the other stories... 4 aggro, up to 6 or 8 on zone in wiped us.  We rezzed in, killed the first 4, and that wiped half of us, and during this (maybe 45 minutes into the raid) we got a failure message.  Not sure why, it just said we hadn't completed it in time (maybe it was psychic?)<br />
<br />
So we're going back to LDoN for grouping and PoP and Luclin for raiding I think.</div></div><hr />

Cept you can get 4-6 mobs at once if you are relying on lull/pacify pulling.  All of them have a slow reduction as well and naturally more hit points.  Zone layouts and mob placement all seem to be the same as normal levels.  Raids are carbon copies of exp grind zones too, with mobs in same spots and everything....can you say old after a month?</div></div><hr />

I can ... &quot;Experience grinding in BoT was old after a month.&quot;<br />
<br />
Of course, I'm exaggerating here for humorous effect.  In reality, it was more like ten days.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u33"><b>Tugela</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p33">We tried the MM raid last night. My guild is in the elementals, but mostly our equipment is tier3/VT grade. We took 24 people in, about a third of them apps and alts. 3 clerics, a druid and 2 shaman as healers, 3 chanters and 4 paladins as tanks. No warriors.<br />
<br />
We had one mob agro on us zoning in, we lost two people. The monks were able to single pull most stuff, with the odd 2/3 pulls. Apparently mob density was fairly high, but the monks seemed to be enjoying themselves because of the challenge. The skill of your pullers seems to be critical here.<br />
<br />
I was playing my shaman on the raid. Everything slowed except the mummies. Malos was needed for it to stick though. Most stuff slowed for full, with the odd partials.<br />
<br />
The biggest challenge we had was with a random named on the way to the bosses. He was hitting for about 1800 or so. Without a defensive warrior, he slowly went through our pallies, but we killed him in the end.<br />
<br />
We cleared to one of the bosses, a werewolf, and engaged him. He was slowable, didnt hit too hard (~1k apparently), but had a very fast regen. Apparently he was gaining power from somewhere - we think from the other two bosses who were up. He was tethered in his room. We withdrew to the previous room to mull over what to do next when the timer ran out. Our next step is to mull over what we learned, and go in again in a few days with a full raid and a strat in hand.<br />
<br />
The bottom line is that the raids are not insane. They are tough, but they are supposed to be that way I guess. Social guilds are not going to be able to do them IMO, since they lack the equipment, dps and raiding skills.</div></div><hr />

Even if the boss mob dropped some super duper spectacular item, it wouldn't have been worth awarding 1 piece of loot for wasting 3 hours of dieing/rezzing over and over and every pull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that was never announced, I'll eat crow if I see otherwise. The point is raid content it LACKING for smaller guilds. They can't beat the 24/7 &quot;no life&quot; players to mobs of opportunity and such. This was an expansion hoped to fix that problem and let smaller guilds and alliances schedule some raids rather than never find a mob up when they have full strength. People really want to try and earn their crap, not get left overs that are in the bazaar 2 expansions old. Their only crime is having a job, family and responsibilities. Is it so bad that a group of 40 such people could have a chance at a raid, once per week?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u41"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p41">Hail,<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure that was never announced, I'll eat crow if I see otherwise. <br />
I'm not asking you to eat crow  :p , but I found this on a website.  I apologize for not being able to link the original sourcing document (my second hand source is in a restricted guild-only area) because it wasn't given.  I believe it to be true though I cannot personally guarantee its authenticity.  I am also unaware if this interview (which I have only a part of) took place before or after LDoN release.  Here is the pertinent section:<br />
<br />
Q: How would you guys compare the raid level content in Lost Dungeons, to The Planes of Power. I understand that this expansion is focused more on dungeon crawls, but what can hardcore raiders expect to find in the new expansion?<br />
<br />
A: We've worked to provide raids that cater to players of a variety of raid power levels. Some raids are aimed at VT quality guilds, while others are tuned for players of elemental and even Time capability- The raids were primarily aimed at the highest end of the spectrum, since those players are most in need of additional content.<br />
 <br />
That agreed with my personal viewpoint of LDoN raiding from what I'd read on these and other boards (and this was before reading the italicized text I found today and pasted here).<br />
I would argue that no number of augments or small gear upgrades will ever equal what 5 levels, a new high level spell set, including new debuffs, hp buffs and heals, and an entire new set of AA's did for us. The Bane dot means nothing for me, I doubt I will even buy it. <br />
I still think that in several months of hard work a guild that almost exclusively geared up on LDoN gear &amp; augments (and could field 6 fully LDoN geared groups) would be capable of tackling a Normal level raid.  I never said that those LDoN upgrades would equal 5 levels, etc, but they will allow guilds to tackle LDoN raid content previously impassable to them. That is why I think the Grummus analogy at PoP release mentioned in your second post is accurate and holds true for LDoN.  Give it some time.  Social or smaller family guilds will have a hard time getting 6 groups properly geared up, but in my opinion this expansion makes it EASIER than any other for such organizations to make steady progress.  No competition for upgrades because they are driven by adventure points and not spawns the smaller guilds can't get a crack at.<br />
<br />
The comment that a new high level dot means nothing to one of our (great) moderators is distressing to me because it reveals such a pessimistic attitude so early on.  This is a great expansion &amp; whining about content being too challenging (not broken!) rubs me the wrong way, though I respect your opinion even though I do not agree with it.<br />
<br />
These raids don't need to be dumbed down.  We have seen enough of that lately in my opinion.  <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u42"><b>Helter Skelter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p42">Well, I had the opportunity to go on an 18 person raid just after our guild sliced through Rallos Zek the Warrior like a hot knife in butter.  And we had our arses handed to use in no time flat.<br />
<br />
First, mobs seem to be teathered together.  Debuffing the first mob seemed to generate aggro from the second.  We tried a number of things including rooting mobs, etc. but we never made it past the entrance.  I have 5000 hp and 1200 ac when fully buffed.  I could slow them, if I lived that long, after landing a malosinia.  Malos was not necessary to land malosinia and slow went in without resists after that.  However, once slow landed, I had aggro and I went down so fast to these mobs it made our clerics blink twice.<br />
<br />
Say what you want.  I'm with Henora on this one.  I had hoped for an expansion that I could enjoy without putting another arse load of time into.  Frankly, it was presented as an expansion for the not so serious player.  One that an individual could do a crawl in an hour or two and accomplish something.  If I now have to get geared up with augmentation crap, you have just negated the benefit of a short dungeon crawl.<br />
<br />
Oh and btw, you people have an annoying habit of accusing people of whining when they are simply expressing their opinions.   Not all opinions are positive, so at least respect them enough not to belittle those that hold them.<br />
<br />
That's my 2 cps, flame away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These raids don't need to be dumbed down.  We have seen enough of that lately in my opinion.<br />
<br />
My moderator status here has little to do with my opinion on the Bane dot.  I am as entitled as anyone to my opinion, I didn't say it was useless for all, I said it meant nothing to me.  This opinion is based on my experiences with the Bane dot in beta.  <br />
<br />
I found it to be incompatible with my playstyle.  I do a lot of spell switching and I find that a resistable dot, with a long recast time is not a good use of my spell gem slots.  Mem bane, wait for 30 seconds, oops, now the mob is dead...cast it on the next mob, oops resisted now I have to wait 30 seconds to try again.  Not very efficient for me and would do nothing to increase my power in the majority of situations I find myself in.  Certainly I understand there are other ways to use it but it's not worth 100s of points for a spell I would rarely use.  At any rate, discussions of the Bane dot belong elsewhere.    <br />
<br />
Here is a nice thread about the difference between Bane and Velium Strike in DPS.  If you care to discuss it further I would be happy to do so in that thread.   http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=16470<br />
<br />
I specifically asked for the raids not to be dumbed down.  I enjoy a challenge and I enjoy the idea behind LDON, though the ideas about &quot;an adventure customized for you&quot; do not appear to have been implemented in LDON raids.  I think it is BROKEN(!) that raids do not matter if you choose NORMAL OR HIGH RISK.  I think it is BROKEN that raids do not change in difficulty if have 18 people or 36 people.  <br />
<br />
Finally, I find it offensive that you target my moderator status and expect that I should not be able to express my opinion because of it.  I was not made a moderator here because I was a SOE fanboy(girl) or that I meet every change and addition to the shaman class with glowing praise and open arms. <br />
<br />
You say you like this expansion, thats great, you've said it multiple times.  I'm glad you like it.  I like others to be happy and have fun.  I haven't said anywhere that I do not like it.  I have simply said that I believe the raid technology needs some work, that right now it is a nightmare for guilds like mine.  You do understand that unlike past expansions things do not have to be mutually exclusive in LDON right?  The WHOLE IDEA is that you can make level/gear/numbers appropriate challenges on demand.   I will continue to complain and offer suggestions about things I think could be better and you can continue to somewhat politely call me a whiner.  <br />

I'm sorry some of you don't understand how someone can have a difference of opinion, or even be 'rubbed the wrong way' by something someone says and can still respect their opinion.  It happens all the time.  I don't like everything my boss, the President, or even my parents say at various times, yet I still respect all of them and their opinions regardless of the differences we might have on various subjects.  Sometimes what any of these people say really ticks me off, yet I still respect them.  If you can't comprehend that concept, I'm sorry for your lack of understanding.<br />
<br />
Also, as to Henora's moderator status, I never said she couldn't or shouldn't have an opinion.  I said it was distressing for me to see a moderator who was so pessimistic about a brand new spell and so publicly negative about parts of a new expansion.  Not that Henora didn't have a right to feel that way, nor that she shouldn't be expressing her views because of her mod status.  I didn't call Henora names or 'flame' her.  MY personal feeling is that negative comments (like &quot;Personally I think this is bull****.&quot;) written by a moderator are not in line with the &quot;we all want to have fun and learn from each other&quot; atmosphere we are all trying to sustain.  I didn't bash her.  I took an opposing stance &amp; I still feel that way.<br />
<br />
The original post came across to me as someone from a small guild whining about not being able to succeed on brand new content in the first week.  (btw more definitions: Whine - A complaint uttered in a plaintive tone. Respect - Willingness to show consideration or appreciation.)  Someone posting their story about raiding and being unable to kill a single mob, calling it BS that they failed so horribly sounds like whining to me.  The original post by Henora was not characteristic of what I normally see from her.<br />
<br />
I have no problem with Henora not liking the Bane dot based on the information she just gave.  But in the original mention there was no explanation, the Bane dot comment came after an earlier sarcastic comment about a different spell &quot;OMG Pack shrew&quot;.  Do you see the pattern?  Can you see why I might be disappointed that someone so respected would be so down on LDoN?  You don't have to be a fanboy, but several of the comments by Henora in this thread are caustically  negative and/or sarcastic.<br />
<br />
Henora's guild can put together a group to succeed on Hard Adventures.<br />
If they gear up ALL their people to that level, join w/ another similarly geared small guild for an alliance raid, I think they could do a Normal raid with 36 people after some work.  Just because a small guild that can't win w/ three groups of people in the first WEEK OF AN EXPANSION is no reason to call setting that level of difficulty BS.  To me that's similar to complaining about not being able to kill the Sleeper the first week Velioius came out.<br />
<br />
The ADVENTURES scale in difficulty for single groups.  That's what was advertised &amp; was requested by those who like to group.  The RAIDING is geared towards the high end, where the biggest need for additional content is &amp; what the high-end guilds were clamoring for.  LDoN meets both of those needs.  SMALLER guilds can and WILL be able to work their way up in gear, augments, &amp; AA's by using adventures to improve themselves to a point Normal level raids are doable.  But it isn't going to happen overnight or even likely in the first month.<br />
<br />
For the record, I don't think Henora is a &quot;whiner&quot; though I do think she was whining in this thread.  If she had removed the editorial comments (which are certainly her right to include), the post would have read much better &amp; I wouldn't have said anything.  Something like this:<br />
Tonight we tried our first LDON raid. We took 19 people. We did normal level, what sounded like a type of &quot;slaughter&quot; mission in the Mistmoore theme. We had a warrior, 2 pallies, 2 chanters, 3 clerics, 3 shamans, 3 bards, 1 ranger, 1 rogue, 1 wizard, 1 necro and 3 monks. We had plenty of tanking, CC and healing. We're all level 65. We zoned in and wiped to a train of 4 mobs. They have large agro range. They are red and yellow to 65. Some see invis, some do not. Most, since they are red and yellow, are unlullable/pacifiable. Some are mezzable, some are not. Mobs with the exact same name are sometimes mezzable, sometimes not. The mobs are tightly packed and very social.<br />
<br />
The gargoyle types were unslowable with grummus(decay) and turgurs(malos/tash/hos), but no immune message - they quad for over 1000. The one mob we could slow and mez, a spider, mitigated slow to mostly. No matter how hard we tried, our pallies just couldn't take the hits. Not to mention the fact that our clerics were forced to use Supernal Light, (they have haste of mithaniel and full max healing aa) and that heal couldnt keep the pallies or even a defensive warrior standing for long. Not to mention the warrior couldn't keep agro off his healers, when they are pouring that much into him. <br />
<br />
After 5 attempts, working through which mobs can be lulled, mezzed, slowed, which need to be offtanked, where we need to stand to avoid adds, etc and nothing looking better for our chances of success, we gave up. We didn't even manage to kill 1 mob. <br />
<br />
Does anyone have raid experiences in any of the other themes, other than mistmoore, that would seem to be of a lower degree of difficulty?<br />
 <br />
Big difference from the tone displayed in the original post huh?<br />
As to the Bane discussion, I'll throw in my 2cp once I actually have it scribed, as I don't have any personal experience with it yet.  <br />
<br />
Henora, I'm sorry you were so offended.  You do a great job as moderator.  We have philosophical differences of opinion on what the whole idea of what LDoN raiding is for &amp; I'll just leave it at that.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u48"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p48">Henora,<br />
<br />
I think you may be overlooking the primary use of the BANE line of spells.  <br />
<br />
Have you ever hunted in BoT east?  Or the BoT SW tower?  Or any number of places where the mobs resist cold/poison heavily?  In some places you could use the disease line of DoTs, but those are just WAY too slow to be useful.  You can also use the epic, but it has the same problem.  I think those are the areas where this new spell line is useful.  <br />
<br />
Right now if I want to hunt in BoT East I can slow, heal, use my epic, and cast BURST OF FLAME.  How pathetic is that?  (The really pathetic part is that I'll do it -- those ten point crits are UBER!)<br />
<br />
I see your point about it being resistable, but thats what malosinia/tash is for.  I also see your point about the long recast time, but when you get down to brass tacks the bottom line is that there are some places where I am completely incapable of contributing DPS.  I'd rather contribute some DPS via a not-quite-as-good-as-it-could-be spell than no DPS.</div></div><hr />
