<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I know it&#8217;s only a name, but I&#8217;ve had it on my warrior for the last 2+ years.  He was one of my early toons that I got to mid-level (46) before I stopped playing him.  He&#8217;s been sitting collecting dust so I decided to start him over as a Shadow Knight so that I can solo with him every now and then&#8230; I scrapped the Crafted Armor (it was in fashion 2 years ago!) and put any decent stuff in the shared bank space.  Hit delete on the character screen and started him up again&#8230; except the name was rejected.  /boggle&#8230;. ***?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kkrush</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Wait 24 hours, then try the name again.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">my friend tried that to reserve a name for a froglok she said that the gm said that the names dont get deleted right then and there when you delete the toon  it takes a day or a month it depends from what the gm told my friend<br />
<br />

<br />
but on the bright side you can spend the 50 dollars to get it changed  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Zyphun</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">That's very very wierd, maybe between the time you first made the character and now that name was added to the auto reject filter? I say that because I recently swapped a character from one account to another. He was a level 17 rogue and I deleted him then created him again on a second account, I did it fine. =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Luclin's Arriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">There might be a level basis for it. I recently remade my level 7 warrior twink/storage mule (made her originally a rallos zek worshipper right after SoV came out for faction in Kael but wanted her to wear the Tribunal-only armor that I can smith), and despite having that character for the better part of 2 years, I was able to make a new character with the same name 15 seconds after deleting the old one.<br />
<br />
Might have been because she was only level 7, and not level 46.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Steelbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesnt. I tend to make tons of characters and I reuse names often, and most of the time I can get the name back right away after I delete the old character - only occasionally will it not let me have it back. You could try deleting the the configuration file for that character...they are named 'charactername_##', with the ## referring to the server (I assume). It doesnt seem to help, but if you're deleting the character you might as well get rid of the excess files for him in your EQ directory. There will also be a second file in the same area with that characters' UI settings. You can delete those too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Aislyth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Name was still being rejected so I petitioned to a GM.  He said that my old name was still listed in the database.  Whatever he did worked and I was able to keep my warrior's name.  :) <br />
