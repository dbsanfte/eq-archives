<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">For those of you who don't know how this skill works I'll explain it briefly:<br />
<br />
Persistant casting has 3 levels(AA costs are 3/6/9). Each rank gives you a higher chance to keep casting while you are stunned. This skill only allows you to cast through a stun, if you started the cast before the stun happens. You will not be able to cast a spell while stunned and you will not be able to perform any other action while being stunned.<br />
<br />
Basically, it's a waste of 18 AA's. Most of you know that the most critical time for an interrupt is when the mob is incoming. Mobs ALWAYS bash(or kick) on their first attack round. Bash and kick are the only melee skills that can(and they will in 99.9% of the cases unless the mob is of very very low level) interrupt your casting immediately from the front.<br />
<br />
Bash and kick interrupt your casting immediately, yet only about 20% of those interrupts happen due to getting stunned. The only difference is that stun will not allow you to cast or do anything else for about 2 seconds.<br />
Now Ogres, as you know, have a racial advantage which makes them immune to stunning melee attacks from the front. In theory this should give them a nice advantage for the 20% of the times bash and kick result in a stun. In practice, though, the frontal stun immunity from Ogres gives them a BASH and KICK immunity as well. In other words, Ogres can NEVER be interrupted immediately by a bash or kick from the front(as long as they have a Channeling skill of 1 and higher) and instead get a unmodified channeling roll to regain their concentration. Other races don't get this channeling roll(99.9% of the time) which is a substantial advantage. An advantage that I would pay 500+ AAs for as a Shaman.<br />
<br />
Anyway, this isn't a rant about Ogres as much as it is a rant about the Persistant Casting AA. Persistant Casting does NOT work for bash and kick attacks! You will not have the slightiest chance to cast through a bash or kick(not any more than without it anyway), but you do get a chance to cast through a stun...<br />
<br />
Doesn't that strike you as odd?<br />
<br />
A stunning hit in most of the cases is a critical bash or kick.<br />
Ogres are immune to stuns from the front whch makes them immune to BASHES and KICKS from the front as well<br />
Persistant Casting is supposed to give you a chance to cast through a stunning blow, then why doesn't it at least give you the same chance for a bash or a kick, when it should actually grant you a total immunity to these attacks?<br />
<br />
As it stands, you spend 18 AAs on a skill that allows you to keep casting when you started your cast BEFORE a stun occurs, which is roughly 20% of all stunning blows. So basically you get a 15% chance(Just guessing here) to cast through 20% of all hits that WILL interrupt you *immediately*(all other attacks that lead to interrupts are based on how much you got moved by the attacks).<br />
<br />
I have Persistant Casting 3 and I have logged every damn fight since I purchased this the first day. This skill needs to be fixed and I'll add something that I have no proof for yet, but I don't seem able to regain any of the spells I actually cast through a stun. I keep casting but when the spell has done its final channeling check, it has been failing EVERY DAMN TIME for me. <br />
<br />
Please change this ability to either make you completely bash and kick immune much like the Ogre's innate ability(Ogres would still have an advantage since every other race could still be stunned and Persistant Casting only works like 15% of the time with stuns) or up the chance for this skill to fire and make it work for BASH and KICK as well. Why the hell would I be able to cast through a stun, which should be harder to mitigate than a normal hit, and not through a normal bash or kick?<br />
<br />
Please do a feedback for this in game so this gets fixed asap.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The sense I have from GoD AA is just sheer sloppiness, lack of insight and disregard for game mechanics.  <br />
<br />
I don't know about the expansion as a whole, but this is the worst display of game design in one aspect I've seen yet.  <br />
<br />
I'm still having fun after 5 years, so I don't want to be viewed as just negative drum-beater, but honestly, the design of GoD AA just seems slapdash and slovenly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">hey, as an added benfit of PC3 you can channel through ducking.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Brrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">500+ AA's and you could roll a high level Ogre Shaman....since they are the bestest race of all time!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I am well aware of that. I'd rather do 500 AA's with my character, though(and it's not even a gear thing).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Gwain Buffmonkey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">hey, as an added benfit of PC3 you can channel through ducking.<br />
<br />
No way, really?  If this is true, that's terrible for the people who already go this.   :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tuffy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">As an ogre I gotta say I have not worried much about getting stunned. Only time I ever seem to get stunned is when i'm running like heck for the zone with a huge train on my butt.<br />
<br />
As for channeling thru ducking that is just wrong wrong wrong. When I'm not on my mount that is how I interrupt a bad cast (I'm sure it's same for everyone). Why the heck would i wanna screw that up?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">You can't interrupt a spell when you are stunned and this skill kicked in. Whenever you aren't stunned you can duck out of spells as usual however.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Brrakk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">completely understandable, but that still makes ogre teh bestest!<br />
<br />
I would be more than upset at getting that AA if I had to find out it was worthless...not only the time i spent getting the aa's but the not being able to hit the &quot;undo&quot; button.</div></div><hr />
