The catch is that we both like the idea of playing Rangers.<br />
<br />
My question is, how bad an idea is a ranger duo. I don't expect us to be as efficient as a tank healer team of whatever variety, but then neither of us really want to play a healer as we both played healers (Shaman &amp; Druid) last time round.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about being uber or anything, I would just like some reassurance that we will be able to take down blues without excessive downtime. I'm hoping that if we can bandage outselves up to 1/2 health after a fight, our relatively weak healing will be good enough to avoid having to sit around for ever watching the health bar fill up.<br />
<br />
Any comments would be much appreciated.<br />

We outpulled and outkilled for 2 hours straight a group from 49-56 with a warrior, enchanter, bard, rogue, shaman and Cleric.  Warrior was 56.  <br />
<br />
Rangers make great duos, but mostly after both ofyou have Earthcallers.  Fungis help.</div></div><hr />

At higher levels you will start to feel the need for some better healing, but you can cruise up through late 40's with no problem. Aggro control, fear kiting, root, and high damage can do wonders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you level up, and as more spells becomes available, you can split duties. Example: one of you Damage shields the both of you, while the other one DOT's the mob. <br />
<br />
Fear kiting will go very fast with two capable damage dealers so the lack of great healing is not noticed. <br />
<br />
If you fight mobs without fear kiting, or even arrow kiting; let's say you both want to (or are forced to) fight toe to toe; nothing beats ping-ponging aggro like two skilled rangers. :)  At least you end up splitting the damage.<br />
<br />
Oh and yes, bind wounds is great skill that will help heal if you end up taking that much damage. hehe Then you will fill the screen up much less with the ranger healing spam. :)</div></div><hr />

You can also pet kite with two rangers.  One ranger keeps the target snared and angry with arrows and spells and the other follers them around and chews up the target.  Target gets to running away from low health, the taunter grabs another while the hacker finishes it.</div></div><hr />

We really did quite well, as long as we stuck to things we could fear, or that don't hit very hard. The great thing is that as fast as you can damage the creatures you can have them dead before they get a chance to do you much harm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and at the lower levels, 9hp is all you really need. Unless you're hardcore twinked out you wont have over 400hp at level10, so just dont take TOO mcuh damage.<br />
 remember to train every level, i didnt get *any* skills or activate my spell abilities until about my 18th level. Man my ranger kicked ass when he could .. kick!</div></div><hr />

<br />
We tend to take turns playing the caster role and the melee role, then switching when low on mana/health respectively. The added bonus is that once the melee Ranger has agro the Caster can then do some damage as well.<br />
<br />
This was really effective on Hill Giants. One reverse kiting using low mana dots and dds to hold agro. The other hitting from behind. We could take one down in a fraction of the time either could do one solo. With a lot less downtime.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tarmor</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In general the ranger duo in the late 50's is impressive.  The combo relies on a couple of concepts, mainly damage sharing and passive regeneration.  The combination of two 60 rangers normally works as follows for simple exp grinds:<br />
<br />
Both use Earthcaller or another weapon with moderate damage and a slow effect.  One ranger acts as primary for the fight and absorbs the damage with an agro switch to the other ranger if needed.  Normally a slow is landed rather quickly between the two and total damage taken during the fight is low.<br />
<br />
In the second fight the rolls are reversed with the former primary tank acting as damage dealer in regen mode using fungi + chrolo + AA, etc... With standard standing regen of approx 35hp/tick and a random heal here and there the ranger is back to full by the end of this fight.  Swap rolls, rinse, repeat....<br />
<br />
Down time tends to be confined to medding when blue runs out but KEI + PoTG normally eliminates this and can ussually be bumbed from someone after a raid.<br />
<br />
In terms of exp -- Duoing beats soloing hands down if spawns are available owing to the virtually non-existent down time.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Taldaas</div><div class="date">05-14-2002, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ive done this a lot before in IC.  one ranger pulls and while he/she is pulling the other snares and they bow kit til you lead the cougar to the safe section of the island near the pirates.  then the ranger who didn't snare casts a fear.  the 2nd ranger can also cast a fear half way between teh other rangers fear incase his doesn't land, if it does land just duck or jump to save yourself a  little mana.  after that you proceed to beat the poo out of the cougar.  loot (besided the earings maybe) is not a problaem because there is none.<br />
<br />
another time i had a group in FM of 3 Rangers, Rogue, Chanter, and a shaman.  one ranger would pull and the others would snare and then all three of us would shoot it til it got to our group.  we could probally take 18/-1/6 of its life that way.  it was also way to raise archery for later levels when it will become way more effective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Plus there is the added bonus of inviting other classes then annoying them with constant talk of ranger stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ranger/shaman<br />
ranger/cleric<br />
ranger/druid<br />
<br />
ranger/enchanter<br />
ranger/beastlord<br />
<br />
Both would have your rangers, but if a need pops up for a caster, you are set.  Heck, you could even buff each other with casters, slow/speed, log ranger back on and away you go.<br />
<br />
Playing 2 rangers is fun, tis for sure.  Root/alternate dots/pincushion away (after lvl 45 for tolan bracer).</div></div><hr />

We probably duo'd 65-70% of the time.   Also if you can buy a KEI you have 2.5hrs of the best duoing for melee types you'll see.</div></div><hr />

hmmmmmmm<br />
dont expect to kill ~with decent downtimes~ what a ranger-shaman or ranger-cleric duo would do<br />
but its fun ;)</div></div><hr />

You can do a lot of stuff people wouldn't expect. We started around 40 and he's gonna ding 60 soon and I won't be far behind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really like Ranger/Enchanter combo though...at higher levels, the chanter can charm a tank (Undying Iksar or Shimmering Rockfiend in The Grey for example) and ranger can do a lot of damage using bow with almost no risk.  Just gotta keep chanter SoW'd and charmed pet ensnared.  Those fiends regen at a sick rate and hit fast and hard!  I was pulling 4 to 6 Golems at a time with no downtime...just snare and park em till the pet is done with previous.</div></div><hr />
