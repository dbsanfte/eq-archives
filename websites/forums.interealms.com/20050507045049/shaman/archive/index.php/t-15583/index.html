<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ssiky the Ikky</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Anyone play with our new curse yet?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Valgoth Ulv'Sagart</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I thought they were part of LDoN? I didn't realize they were in game yet. Just because they're in the spell file doesn't mean they're available to use by PC's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Caanus Grey</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Beta for LDoN is out, and you can play with them there.   Not really sure how much we are supposed to keep quiet about though... I have only counted ticks on the spell while the bard in group was playing his booster song... All I can say is that I am VERY dang pleased with the spell... but pissed with beta.<br />
<br />
 Do to a couple factors it is not really practical to play with the new dots much atm, but I loaded them up once. With Bane, Blood of Saryn, and Ancient: Bane of Nife, our DPS is HUGE (and you can keep these 3 up for a fair amount of time with just canni 5)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">How'd ya get in on the beta?</div></div><hr />

Be careful not to violate your NDA bro.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">How'd ya get in on the beta?<br />
<br />
It was posted for a short amount of time on the everquest live website but they only took a certain amount of applicants and you can imagine that went fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">they also announced it in game in a couple servers. I dont have the time to beta so I didn't apply.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Warador</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Good deal, hope it's a good expansion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jahvah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Wait...you mean SOE is actually testing and expansion before release?  Naaah yer lyin' :p</div></div><hr />
