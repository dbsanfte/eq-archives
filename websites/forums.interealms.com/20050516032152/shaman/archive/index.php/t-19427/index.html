<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cannidance is the habit of trying to maximize mana regeneration by sitting down, waiting for the &quot;tick&quot; to hit (at which point you recieve the medding bonus to mana regeneration).  After the tick you stand up, cast cannibalize, and sit down fast.<br />
This is usually done via a hotkey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok...getting a little clearer, but I'm still not entirely sure why it's beneficial.  Aren't you losing hps when you use cannibalize?  I'm thinking it's a spell for when you need a little extra mana to finish the fight and you have some hps to spare, but I've been reading that shamans cannidance whenever they can in their downtime.  Why??</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Klemydia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Because it's efficient mana regen.  That's why most shamans focus on HP and Stamina rather than wisdom.  Reduces downtime significantly.  After all, we get HP regen spells and HP buffs, rather than a passive mana regen line of spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Jalelin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ignoring natural mana regen, hit point regen and spells that increase either, cannibalizing hit points to mana and then casting a heal spell on yourself will leave you with more mana than you started with (at least, it's the case if the healing spell is Torpor, Quiessance or the mini-CH).<br />
<br />
When meditating, you get your mana increase with each six second &quot;tick&quot;.  The server only checks to see if you are sitting at the point of the tick.  It does not check to make sure that you have been sitting for the entire six seconds.  This means that as long as you are sitting at the instant of the tick, you can have been standing and doing something else for the majority of the time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Weyalan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">1. you regain mana faster sitting than standing. Cant remember the exact ficures, but it is like 1 mana per 6 seconds standing and 10 mana per 6 seconds sitting<br />
<br />
2. The mana regained while sitting is not continuous. You gain zero mana for 5.9999 seconds and then get the whole 10 mana in the 0.0001 seconds of the &quot;tick&quot;<br />
<br />
3. You can tell when the &quot;tick&quot; occurs by watching your hp in your inventory, because like mana regain, hp regain also happens at the tick.<br />
<br />
4. As a result of the fact that mana (and hp) being given back at 6 second intervals, rather than continuously, in order to get the full benefits from sitting down, you only actually have to be sitting down when the tick takes place. The other 5.999 seconds you can do whatever you want.<br />
<br />
5. Provided you can time things right, you can move, run, cast, eat, drink, play the piano, and provided you sit down for a brief period over every tick, you can regain hp and mana as if you were sitting the whole time. In particular, because canni doesn't take 6 seconds to cast, you can stand up, cast cannibalise and sit doen again in time for the next pulse of mana and hp - thus getting the sitting benefits, while cannibalising. Repeat this process every 6 seconds and you are &quot;cannidancing&quot;<br />
<br />
6. You can automate the cannidance with a hotkey. A typical cannidance hotkey looks like this:<br />
/sit off<br />
/cast 7 (or whatever spell slot you use for canni)<br />
/pause 18 (this is the length of pause while spell is casting - typically 15 - 25, depending on your computer and connection, lower is better, but whatever works)<br />
/sit on<br />
<br />
So, by watching you hp on your inventory bar, you just have to sit until you see your hp go up (you have regen on all the time, right?) and then hit your Cannidance hotkey, and you will automatically stand, canni and sit down in time for the next tick</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yeah, cannidance in it's state has always seemed to be a much better way of increasing ones mana quicker and faster than just sitting would, or by just chain casting canni while standing.  Explaining it different, it's called cannidancing cause your character looks like he's dancing while doing it.  Take the role of someone else looking at you while doing it.  You see the person stand up, cast a spell, then sit back down, repeating this stuff every six secs.  Now, as the person doing it, what you are doing is what is explained above.  You watch for the second that you gain mana/hps (it's referred to as the tick, every six seconds you gain so much mana/hp while either standing or sitting, sitting down you regen more of both, so that's why you are sitting when this tick occurs).  It's characterized by seeing your hps/mana go up at that tick.  At that time you immediately stand up, cast canniXX then immediately sit back down until the next tick comes.  If you time this right, you regain the mana from the canni and from sitting at the tick, thus increasing your mana back at an advanced rapid pace.  <br />
<br />
Now, like you said, when you canni you lose hps.  The heal over time spells are great to get those hps back, cause they do not cost barely any mana to cast, and you get alot of hps back from it when it's duration is finished.  <br />
<br />
This step will take a little bit to get used to, but it's very effective in getting your mana back quickly after a fight.  You can also check these threads out if any of us have confused you at all.<br />

When you get used to doing the sit down stand up timing technique, you can do others things with it.  Sometimes after fights, if I had to run somewhere, I would run for 5 secs, sit down for the tick, and then get up and run again, repeating that process.<br />
<br />
Oh, and note that if you get a mount, you get mana back as if you were sitting down the whole time even while casting a spell (oh, but not if you are meleeing), so if you are up on a mount you can just chain cast canni and it would be as effective as if you were cannidancing.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>jdthomas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">One thing to mention, constant canni is for levels 44+.  At 24-43 only canni off your regen, canni and heal is inefficient at those levels.  Once you get stoicism at 44 (do it!), you can efficiently convert hp to mana constantly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Gnofr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">And if you ever wondered why the Shaman that you're grouped with, bouncing up and down all the time, is so rudely quiet, please give him or her the benefit of the doubt.  Odds are that, if they're anything like me, they rarely have time to type or they won't have mana for the next pull when it comes.    Though I've met some who were so lazy they just slowed and sat down.<br />
<br />
Therein is one of the problems with active mana regeneration.  At least until you're all grown up with your final spells (Quiescence and the Canni5 AA which takes 23 points if I remember correctly), if you don't have full mana or time to slowly med, you have to be constantly clicking, clicking, clicking.  On the positive side, there's something we can do to decrease dead time.  On the negative side, doing it is mind-numbingly boring, annoying, pain inducing and apparently rude.<br />
<br />
I'd take canned crack (a mythical potion) over canni-dancing in a tick.  A mount that worked indoors would be one of the best GoDsends I could wish for...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Badko</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Great community here!!  Thanks for all that wonderful info.  I'm only level 28 right now, so I guess I've got a few levels to learn the fine points of cannidancing.  <br />
<br />
Much appreciated!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>rookz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Badko, also at the lower levels canni-dancing has the added benefit of giving you a little more time to regenerate your hps as you eat them away.  Since healing yourself with your blast heals (greater heal) is taking about as much mana as you gained, it's not worth it....  Instead, just canni some (around 65% or more of your hps left) and then let your regen (when you get it) make up for the lost hps.  Also, a cleric can heal you kind of effeciently, so it's sometimes a way for you to transfer their mana to yours (though later on when you get stoicism you'll be nagging the buggers to quit healing you).<br />
<br />
seriously, cannidancing is pretty simple when you just make a hotkey.<br />
<br />
/stand<br />
/cast 8 (or whatever number spell slot you have canni in)<br />
/pause x (x being the cast time of canni, mine for canni II is 18)<br />
/sit<br />
<br />
so basically, your sitting and staring at you mana/hp bar.  When they go up a tige, hit your canni dance button.  you'll stand, cast, and sit.  Wait to see the hps go up again, click the button... rinse and repeat.<br />
<br />
something to make not of...  Sometimes, if you cast regen on yourself, you're hps will go up twice in one tick (once for natural regen, and once for the spells regen).  In these cases, either you could try and watch for the larger tick, or just watch your mana bar to find wich tick is the *real* one.<br />
<br />
If you get a horse though, and are in an outside zone, throw all this advice out the window.  Just click your little heart away.  you'll get the tick regardless.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">man, it's been so long since I really cannidanced that I can't remember exactly what else I did to get the hps back.  I think what I did was always try to match the hps to mana.. meaning if I was at 85% hps, I would like to keep myself at 85m.  I think that this worked out great cause while doing anything I always kept regen on me.  I don't remember if I actually healed myself or not.  man, it's only been a year, but it feels so long ago :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Ranguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">As described above, Canni-Dancing becomes second nature to you after a while and you'll catch yourself doing it at FM. My method varies a bit in that I like to keep my hotkeys free for other things. I have mapped Sit/Stand to the END key on my keyboard and use the bard style casting arrangement (all spell gems on the numpad 1 = spell 1, 2 = spell 2, etc.) Also, I mapped Hotkey #2 (Heal) to numpad 0. This seems most efficient to me as I don't enjoy reaching for two keys to do one thing. So, Canni-dancing for me is a couple easy keypresses: END, 2, END. <br />
  <br />
  The best thing you can do for yourself would be to decide how you like your keys set up and how you'll be able to hit them fast. Move all the complex keypresses to something you find easily accessible (open spell book = M, Target mob = ], Attack = \, etc.) With this setup, I can control every one of my alts and not scramble around the keyboard looking for buttons. It also helps to memorize where each spell is and to be able to fire it without looking. My spell set looks like this:<br />
Gem 1 = Chloroblast (Heal)<br />
Gem 2 = Cannibalize III<br />
Gem 3 = Root<br />
Gem 4 = Turgur's<br />
Gem 5 = Celerity (Swap)<br />
Gem 6 = Regrowth of Dar`Khura (Swap)<br />
Gem 7 = Malosini<br />
Gem 8 = Stoicism<br />
<br />
Hotkeys:<br />
1 = Assist, 2 = Heal<br />
3 = Resist Msg., 4 = Malosini Msg.<br />
5 = Slowed Msg., 6 = Slowing Msg.<br />
7 = Reserved, 8 = Pet Attack<br />
9 = Blank, 10 = Stoicism Msg.<br />
Although I have messages set up, I hardly use them other than the resist message. The message keys are only used for adds. The blank is there because it is mapped to the Left Arrow (from Sense Heading) <br />
I hope some of this information helps you and some of the others we have here at the Crucible. Trying to be as informative as possible as I don't post too much, but tonight I'm happy as a clam...Just got my Child's Tear from PoFear WOOOT!!! Tomorrow I'll have epic at approximately 6PM PST. Anyway, GL and enjoy your Shaman =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Tamariz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Sitting isn´t 10 mana per tick , is meditate skill/10 , so if your meditate skill is maxed at 252 you get 25 mana/tick while sitting or in horse/drogmor.<br />
And no , you don´t have to canni in downtime only, you have to canni always that you are not doing anything else and your mana bar is not maxed 8).All the time that you lose without canni is time that you are losing to regen mana fast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>krindaria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">I will say tho, that after you get canniv &amp; lvl 65, you'll rarely dance. At least, I don't...and I don't see any raid shaman that do. Shrug. Heck, I rarely sit down anymore period.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>deria</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">The canni-dance is very useful and beneficial in early levels, but by the time you reach 65 you will probably not be doing it.  <br />
<br />
The only time I sit down is to change spells.  Normally I just chain cast c4 any time that I'm not actively casting a different spell, and when canni5 is eventually available I'll hammer that and then Quiessence myself.<br />
<br />
Still, until you reach that point, your best bet is to canni-dance as much as you possibly can since more mana = good.   If you have full mana, then you're not working hard enough.  Cast one of our ineffecient nukes and that should take care of the problem right there.</div></div><hr />

Can you link one hot button to trigger another hotbutton.

I would assume not but there is always hope.</div></div><hr />

The other day we had a lull in the pulls, and I was canni'ing away.  I looked up finaly and noticed I was fm *likely been so for a while* and was at 30% life.<br />
Force of habit is not a good thing sometimes.  2-3 stoicisms *to poor for torpor* and I was back on top of my game.  Of course now I was down about 10% mana, so had to canni back some  ;)</div></div><hr />

63rd.  RD.  (!!!!!)<br />

Along the same line, why is each level a season?  Why not a winter or a summer?   I guess the point is to say the &quot;age&quot; of your shaman, but wouldn't that mean your shaman is 16ish (four seasons in a year, after all)?<br />
