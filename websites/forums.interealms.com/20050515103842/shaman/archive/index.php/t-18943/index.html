<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Ggrugnuuk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey, this is my first caster over lvl 30, so I have my spec's.  Heres the problem. I can't get em over 50.... I have all of the different specs, but the one i want(alt) wont go over =/ do they all have to be at 50 b4 1 goes above?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Helfdane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">No just keep casting it will eventualy go over, my other specialties didnt reach 50 till I was near 35; just chain cast minor healing or something till it goes over, it will, just sometimes takes a bit of work.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Ceno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">its been a long time, but didnt you need to use points at the old home town guild leaders to get one over 50?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As of about mid-2001 (when I went thru that), I don't believe so.<br />
<br />
As I recall, I only trained 1 point into each of them, and then just left them alone, on the theory that the most important one would rise the fastest, and that worked out pretty well.</div></div><hr />
