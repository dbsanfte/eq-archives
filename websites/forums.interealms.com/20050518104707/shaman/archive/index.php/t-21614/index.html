------------------- <br />
 <br />
Headlines! <br />
------------------- <br />
New Tutorial now live! <br />
CS Assist allows use of Knowledge Base in-game <br />
 <br />
Tutorial <br />
------------------- <br />
- Does your significant other find EQ too hard to learn?  Our new Tutorial is Live and ready to teach them to play.  Creating a new character will give you the option to go through the new tutorial.  You can choose to leave the tutorial at anytime and can return until your character reaches level 5.  The tutorial will walk you through gameplay with easy to follow instructions in text and voice.       <br />
- Hybrids will now receive mana at level 1 as they now receive a spell in the tutorial. <br />
 <br />
CS Assist <br />
------------------- <br />
A new CS tool is available for use and should provide you with a better interface when petitioning. You can also access our self help option through the knowledge base.  You can bring up the new window by pressing the 'P' key, typing /petition, or clicking the &quot;Customer Service&quot; button from the help window. <br />
 <br />
Cabalis Quests <br />
------------------- <br />
Iksar Warriors and Necromancers have some quests to finish! <br />
Iksar Beastlords have a new quest. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
UI Changes <br />
------------------- <br />
- There's a new button in the Options-&gt;Display tab to toggle between full screen and windowed mode. <br />
- Presto Change-O!  There's a new button on the bazaar window to hide all traders.  Clicking a trader in the search window will make them appear (limited to the last trader you clicked) <br />
- New text filters have been added for Pet Crits, Pet Rampage/Flurry, System Messages, Focus Effects, Exp Messages, and Who list. <br />
- The Guild Management window should be better organized. <br />
- There's a new /outputfile command to allow creation of text-file dumps of your Guild, Raid, Inventory and spell books. <br />
 <br />
 <br />
Improved Collisions <br />
------------------- <br />
- There have been numerous collision system fixes and improvements. <br />
- Collision system improvements have made elevators much safer.<br />
- Getting out of water should be a little easier for short races.  We wouldn't want all those Halflings to drown, now would we?<br />
- Rogues should be able to more easily exit water while sneaking, although I think it would be hard to sneak with wet trousers.<br />
<br />
Misc.<br />
-------------------<br />
- You now have the ability to &quot;AutoBank&quot; in the Bank Window.<br />
- Casting a spell while sitting will stand you up.<br />
- Camping while standing will sit you down automatically.<br />
- NPC's will not begin regenerating immediately if fleeing or combat ends.<br />
- Improved the Iqthinxa Karnkvi event in Qvic<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

1. Autobank is active right now on Test. New button on the bank window (Big bank only) that will find an open spot for any item on your cursor when you press the button or, if the item stacks, it will first try to find a stack to match it. If there's no room for the item anywhere in your REGULAR bank (no shared, sorry), then the button does nothing but notify you that your bank is full. Coins work too, but do not change denomination in the process (so click Change when you're done).<br />
<br />
<br />
Now this is seriously cool for anyone who does a lot of tradeskills.<br />
<br />

Anybody with more knowledge in game mechanics can elaborate on that?<br />
<br />
I can understand, why a mob shouldn't regenerate while fleeing (hm, i wasn't aware that was so big of an issue), but why should a mob NOT regenerate immediately after 'end of combat'? And does 'end of combat' mean empty hate list or also mobs gating back to spawn point or what exactly?<br />

That will be great for my enchanter. I often have to deliver an extra nuke to finish off a previously charmed pet because from the time when I break charm til the time I get to re-engage it, the mob has regened so much health. On the downside, I wonder if charmed mobs will regen as fast after a fight?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- New text filters have been added for Pet Crits, Pet Rampage/Flurry, System Messages, Focus Effects, Exp Messages, and Who list.  <br />
Less spam=good. :cool:   The damn &quot;Your Burning Affliction IV tribute effect twinkles giddily&quot; coupled with &quot;Your Affliction Efficiency IV tribute ability spams you madly&quot; messages were very annoying.  Will be great to shunt these over to a minimized window forever without losing other stuff I DO want to see.<br />
On the downside, I wonder if charmed mobs will regen as fast after a fight?<br />
I'm sure that was probably the driving reason behind this change, not to save groups from gating mobs coming back w/ full health.  Skilled enchanters could break their charm with a pet at 5% and have him fully healed (talking 20-30khp) in under a minute before.  I'm sure the enchies will be bummed, but I think it is a good change overall.  Hopefully it also means when you zone w/ a mob at 2% you can pop back and find him at 10% instead of full health. :D <br />
<br />
I'm interested in seeing how the new CS utility functions, but I honestly don't hold out much hope for it.  I think it will be a way to defer your petition to the Knowledge Base instead of replying.  I really hope I'm wrong on that though.<br />
<br />
Other than that, Autobank will save me a few minutes per week at least when I'm shuffling stuff around mules, so that looks good.<br />
<br />
Doesn't seem to be a bad patch so far from reading the message, but I won't see how buggy it is for real until I get home from work. ;) <br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />

* Bazaar = Thank god, maybe not have to turn the clip plane all the way down in Nexus in order to zone in now, and make people MOVE AWAY FROM THE BANKS since it definitely won't matter where they are anyway (but I digress)<br />
* Cabalis quests = Where's Cabalis? That near Cabilis?<br />
* &quot;New text filters added for System Messages&quot; = Ok, so we can turn off &quot;All servers are going down notifications&quot; (bad), but can we turn off the mid to late July &quot;Order Omens of War now!&quot; spam too (good)? It's almost like crying wolf, the systemwide messages should be used for important messages not advertising. If you advertise using it, people WILL ignore it when something truly important (like a server/zone going down) happens. I could go from there, but I won't.</div></div><hr />

I saw a writeup on this somewhere - you can drop something into the bank window and it will go stack with existing items or go to the first empty slot.  - great idea.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>Fibonacci</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">Autobank.<br />

Yes, it is similar to autoinventory.  Pick something up and click it on the autobank button will put it into the first available slot in your bank or the first open pack slot in your bankthat can hold the item.</div></div><hr />

Isn't there a fix going on, in Test?  If so, I hope it comes live soon.  If it did go live, it's kind of a big issue that shouldn't have been missed in the patch message.   Last week my guild was doing backflagging and did Rathe.  It was horrid and unbearable with all the constant LD's.  But we did manage to ge to 11th.   So close...</div></div><hr />

<br />
some? A friend of mine just picked up a REAL nice system maybe 2 weeks ago and lagged in Bazaar... on Maelin! (which has maybe half the trader population all other servers do). Everybody will have less lag in the Bazaar as a result, at least due to framerate.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u30"><b>Gunderson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p30">But won't the hide trader things just encourage more people to go to the bazaar? I predict less lag but more bazaar crashes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That sounds like an interesting idea.  Will be a little weird in the Bazzar though, imagine this:<br />
<br />
Entering the Bazaar<br />
/who<br />
There are 358 traders online and 10548 items available to purchase.<br />
You look around and see a few people standing at the bank.<br />
You hear a lot of shouting/auctioning of goods to purchase but see no one infront of you to buy from.<br />
You go and look up your friendly trader and magically they pop up down the way waveing at you to come buy stuff.<br />
But you still wonder to yourself where is everyone else hiding and why they would be hiding if they have stuff to sell?? :)<br />
<br />
I think it will make things seem rather empty.  I'll admit its a good temp fix, as I always hate having to turn my clip plane right down so I can move around the zone.  (always forget before I log my mule on)  Hopefully they'll come up with a better solution eventually (not holding my breath though)..</div></div><hr />

Sometimes when botting my ranger or something else using eqw, the mob is under the ground for the 2nd account, but not the first.  Little things like this aren't going to be expressed in every message, although it's prob all just a part of the &quot;collision bugs&quot; problems that they are improving/fixing.</div></div><hr />

1) bazaar trader visible filter, huge for people with lag issues there.<br />
2) Filter added for Focus effects.  Gawd, with all the effects I've accumulated, my screen gets filled up with those really fast!  I've wanted a filter for those for quite a while.  I really don't need to see my hat flicker or my bracers sparkle or my goddam boots twinkle to know that I'm using their focus effects!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u45"><b>KumoeSpearbear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p45">A guildie of mine is reporting that the spell casting changes are really bad for FDers, like necros and SKs. <br />
<br />
I had a GoD mob chasing me, I tried to FD, got &quot;Spell Recovery Error&quot;, near half health just in that amount of time because GoD mobs hit so hard so I start trying to FD faster. Interrupted, interrupted, and got it off. Oh no, apparently I was hitting button too fast because right after it went off it instantly stood me back up just in time to get killed. I can't seem to find anything in options to turn that off, so until they fix it you will have to time feign death perfectly. Just late enough so it won't give spell recovery error, but before your health is too low where you can't sit, wait, if interrupted cast one more time, and watch to make sure you don't hit button one too many times. <br />
<br />
Are other people getting this problem? Its a pretty big one.</div></div><hr />

Overdue, but very awesome!  Now if they can just put out an option to hide KEI and Temp sellers/buyers in PoK, I'll have it made in the shade!<br />
<br />
And yeah, sort of annoying having to hear my burning affliction focus proc every single line of DoT damage.<br />
<br />
And when are they actually going to PUBLICLY list that they removed Drogmors' leaping gait?  Part of the reason I purchased him (the 100k model, and, while not my first mount, my first Drogmor) over a horse was the leaping, and I definitely didn't mind the bobbing up and down.  Two days later, they remove it, without even listing it in the patch messages :(<br />
<br />
And about the regen thing, it's one of the reasons that so long ago I stopped hunting in Marus Seru.  My DoT's would wear with the mob running at a few percent, and its regen would outdo my melee for a good 30 seconds until I got lucky and hit a few nice solid pokes.  I remember being like, forget this, I'm goin back to KFC.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u50"><b>Sharok</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p50">You can filter out focus messages, and MOST of mine filtered out.  But both of my spell haste items (beneficial and detrimental) both emote still through the filter.  Not sure why just that one type of effect, but it might be due to having a spell haste item on as well (which is being overrode by the stronger 2 focus effects)<br />

Had the same issue with my Cog Encrusted Epaulets (sp?) (Ben. Haste IV). /bugged it.</div></div><hr />
