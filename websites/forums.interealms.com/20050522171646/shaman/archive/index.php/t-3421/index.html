<br />
I was hunting black panthers for skins for our guilds GM Tailor and saw this panther. I had no clue he was for a Tunare following Paladins Quest. He conned blue and I decided to pull him.<br />
<br />
I pulled him with a Malo as even the Haze panthers are fairly MR. I ran back to the wall where my pet was parked and cast slow on him and sicked pet. Typically I will cast a few dots on a mob while it is rooted and the pet is tanking. Then I will check pet HP's. Well, by the time I got a Pox, Bane and EPic on him my pet was dead! So the fun begins.<br />
<br />
Pet dies, Panther turns on me and I root him to back off and Canni/Torpor. I then get the message 'You have been summoned.'<br />
So here I am standing toe to toe with a level 55 undercon that is hitting me for 150-200 per hit.<br />
<br />
I just kept Torporing, canning and reapplying Pox, Bane and Epic Dots between his attacks. Interrupts definitely didnt help things, but about 8 Poxx, 10 or so Banes. 8 or more epics and a countless number of JBB blasts he finally dropped. Had to reslow him 4 times total, may have had a bit of overlap on the reslow, but better safe than sorry.<br />
<br />
Warning: Do not try this without Torpor :p<br />
<br />
He dropped a NO DROP quest item for Tunare Paladins and that was it.<br />

<br />
Does anyone have a &quot;Test your solo skills&quot; progression list?<br />
<br />
If I ever get to 60 (heh- with NWN taking more of my time, less likely every day) I'd love to have a list of mobs to try out.<br />
<br />
Corrupted Panther &lt; Yeldema &lt; Lodizal &lt; Stomples ??<br />
<br />
Who has others?  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Try the coterie vampires in Maidens Eye some time. The higher level ones double for 150, flurry, and have a 200hp lifetap proc that goes off quite alot. Its not uncommon to take 400 damage or more in a single round with the harder ones. They have a shedload of hp, are fairly magic resistant, dont run, and are immune to poison and disease:) Beware trying this without malo/torpor/epic/jbb.<br />
<br />
Druids kill them by kiting and using magic/fire. <br />
<br />
Shamans are the only class I know of that can solo tank them. Unslowed/Uncrippled these things are pure evil.<br />
<br />
Self buffed I have 1010ac, 2203hp.<br />
<br />
They are a nice hard mob to work on your solo skills.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>mormegil</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Shimmering Rockfiends are (grey) fun since you can't JBB (immune cold it would seem) 'em and they move fast and hit faster. If slow is resisted you have a tall glassof beatdown to drink.<br />
<br />
Sun Revenants (grey) have a lot of HP and hit pretty hard, but pretty much everything spellwise hits. You have plenty of time to malo and then slow them as they have this Fred Sanford pimp-limp.<br />
<br />
Deep Cavern Lotus (fg). Pray they do anything but chain that lure-like DD they have. Their attack selection determines win or lose.<br />
<br />
Warden Bruke (ew) actually was my favorite solos of late. Unslowable plus I couldn't land Bane, cold DDs or the epic dot. It was melee, send in dogdog and chain torpor yourself. The only DS I had was the 3 points from JBBP. I was sure I was dead 3-4 times, but just pulled it out. Kiva's is highly recomended, but probably would make it less fun. :)<br />
<br />
I'm like 1100 AC, 2500 hp self buffed fyi, so if you're end-game equipped your milage may vary.<br />
<br />
edit: added zones</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Bozarkia</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm working on killing veltar in dreadlands currently.  Lvl 62 monk.  I got him to 50 my first attempt and got a stupid spider add that killed my pet and I couldn't stop concentrating on veltar to control the spider.  I will try again, and get the pull right and prevail!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Asraguard</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hey Guys/Gals,<br />
<br />
Don't you think that Verant specifically wanted to remove some of the shaman's soloing ability with the release of Luclin? I have tried soloing in most zones in Luclin and one thing that becomes increasingly apparent is the number of mobs immune to poison and disease based attacks. <br />
<br />
In The Grey I think only the Golems can be poison/disease dotted which really sucks since we could mint the EXP in this zone otherwise. In ME the vampires and a few other mobs (I forget but mainly the undead ones) cannot be poison/disease dotted. A lot of the other mobs have high PR like the ones in Scarlet Desert, Ssra and Fungus Grove. I don't bother with poison dots on these mobs til after Malosini is on. Luckily disease usually goes on without a hitch however. Thank Verant for shrooms though as they seem to be the only shaman designed mobs in Luclin but they get sooo boring to keel :p .<br />
<br />
With Velious our crappy cold based nukes were worthless and now with Luclin our awesome dots have been weakened... further evidence Verants hates shamans!<br />
<br />
Cheers,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tannus Vidar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Luclin came with alot of undead mobs...inhierantly being high DR/PR. This is nice for the Paly though who got thier slay undead to go with it...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Ronfar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Gantru Dralknr(sp?) is a named mob in Umbral Plains that I found to be a nice solo challenge. Only hits around the 180-190 range, but took a very long time to kill. The fight lasted roughly 45 minutes for me, my guess is had between 80 and 100k hps. He's guaranteed to drop one of the luclin stat bracelets though (bracelet of fortitude, might, etc.) so you'll get a little more than bragging rights out of it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Mercuratrayin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fought quite a few vampires in Tenebours Mountains, Namely Otto and his pal.<br />
<br />
They are definatly weak against fire based spells.<br />
Not that we have many(any)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Come on now!<br />
Burst of Flame is 00ber!<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I am sarcastic and have nothing to add to the thread. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Spiritblood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">45 minutes for one fight is pretty darn impressive :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Baldrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Gantru Dralknr in Umbrals is pretty tough.  I am suprised that you could solo him.  I was there with a group of friends and we had a rough time taking him down.  I had to recast slow like 4 times and went through about 8 Banes.<br />
<br />
Group consisted at that time of:<br />
56 Shaman<br />
54 Monk<br />
58 Ranger<br />
55 Cleric<br />
51 War<br />
51 Druid</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Conas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Zone into Umbral plains and pull a Moktor to the zone line and fight it in a corner. The one I fought doubled for 195 and interupted me alot...even backed into a corner. They summon so either have gate loaded or be prepared to go the distance because you cannot root and get distance or run. They are a long fight. I dont think they have as many hp as the named one mentioned above though. And the pathing can be really screwy pulling them. Be careful.<br />
<br />
The hardest ME vampire I fought (to date) was hitting for 153 and proced alot....but still wasnt this hard because the vamps dont summon. <br />
<br />
Do NOT forget to reslow. Let me repeat that....DONT FORGET to reslow. <br />
<br />
I watched a competent and well equipped oracle die soloing one because he forgot to reslow. <br />
<br />
Torpor is required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He IS unslowable, I landed slow on him after malosini (of course I figured this out when I had him to 20% and decided I would check and make sure he really was 100% MR, as someone told me he was just very resistant).  Also then landed 1 JBB shot as well.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Shilzah</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Ive fought a bit in umbral but never solo. Not 60 yet and no torpor. Pulled the regular mok's (57 bard pulls) 57 shaman (me) and my 56 warrior. One fight depending on which weapon i'm using can last up to the first slow coming off. I almost killed my warrior by not reslowing so yes alot of hps remember to reslow. I went to turn my attack off do some of them enraging when they get low and wouldnt you know it when i was on the warrior i was thinking sure is hitting fast. Had to go spam sup heal a bunch of times to get warriors health high enough to reslow.Oh will be easier for you with epic and jbb. I wasnt adding any dot damage or nuke damage to these fights was all melee. <br />
<br />
The named moks dont seem lot tougher just alot more hps really. They rampage a bit and enrage usually once at the end. We took em out with a 56sk , 56war, 57shammy 53 chanter and 48 shammy. Took awhile but with how long the fight was going i was 80 mana canning , reslowed 3 or 4 times and 2 bon's. So anyway if your want to try and solo any of this dont forget to reslow it. They dont hit superhard but seem to hit pretty fast when they arent slowed. Have an once in a blue moon slow bounce (without debuff) on the regular and maybe been lucky but hadnt had a bounce on the named mok's yet.</div></div><hr />
