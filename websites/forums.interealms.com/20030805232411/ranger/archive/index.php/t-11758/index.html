<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>quana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Sorry, just had to get this off my chest.  I guess I should first establish that I don't usually have /role or /anon on because it makes it for difficult for our guild leaders to make groups on raids.  That said...<br />
<br />
Why on earth is everyone under the sun asking me for ports?!<br />
<br />
I can understand the newbie level 10 player who doesn't yet know about porting classes sending me a tell, but what is up with all these people 40+ sending me tells to &quot;Plz prt me 2 zone X, kk thx&quot;.  I mean, they can just look at my name and see that I'm a ranger.  Do they think Pathfinder = druid or something?  Are they just on some form of narcotic that I need to investigate and report to the police?  Did they succumb to the ultimate evil and buy their character off of Ebay?I swear I usually get up to 5 tells an hour from these crazed people.  I think I just became more understanding of why some druids can get rude on their afk messages.  Maybe I should trying going anon or something.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Eolair Strongbo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Most people don't bother to /who you if they come across what they &quot;think&quot; is a druid, especially if you're in wolf form.  It really is annoying though.  I learned a long time ago to just simply type /who druid/wizard to see if there are any even there, then use /shout or /ooc.  If that fails, start /t'ing friends.  I try not to send direct /tells to people in the zone, since they're not obligated to port me in the first place.  I know I really hate it when people send me direct tells asking for sows and arrows and such.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I mention to them that although I am the worlds only Dual Wielding Druid, I have not purchased my port spells, so I can't port them unless they go get me a copy of the spell.  :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I'm sorry, but, I find myself getting rude with those people. I don't know why, and not the level 10 people who don't know about ports, but those same level 40 people. I state one time &quot;You know Druids Can't Dual Wield, right?&quot; If they boggle at me, I trea them like a child. It goes something like this.<br />
<br />
&quot;Come here Mister (Or Madam) &lt;Insert class here&gt; and let me tell you the fundamentals about Everquest Porting. You see, only Druids and Wizards get spells that can Teleport,. or Translocate, other people to other areas, and I'm not a Druid or a Wizard. Druids don't get Dual Wield like a Ranger, because Druids don't melee as often as a Ranger, and I'm a Ranger. You see the level 40 Ranger in front of my name on the list of people who is in the zone? Good. Now we're getting somewhere.&quot;</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Monk</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">And god forbie you are wearing Treeweave because then everyone thinks your a druid.<br />
<br />
Can you port me?<br />
<br />
I'm not a druid<br />
<br />
You look like a druid<br />
<br />
You ever seen a druid carrying 2 lammys?<br />
<br />
I thought maybe it was a held item like Woe that only looked like a lammy<br />
<br />
Well didn't you see me hitting with it?<br />
<br />
I wasn't paying attention<br />
<br />
Didn't you see the Ranger in front of my name?<br />
<br />
I didn't look you up I just saw you and asked<br />
<br />
Well when you saw chain and plate on the rest of my armor, and the lammys in my hand ... didn't this seem a little odd for a druid to be wearing?<br />
<br />
Some druids wear chain and plate<br />
<br />
<br />
GRRRRRR.... but the sad thing is... I can't reall fault his logic. Only thing he did wrong was not doing a /who all. Some druids do wear armor that looks like chain.... some druids do wear armor that looks like plate.... there are some held items that look like weapons. I generally try not to loose my temper in front of them but there was one instance when I couldn't help it. I was playing my smurf necro.... this guy had just watched me summon my skeletal pet. I wasn't anon or roleplaying. I sit down to med and this guy comes begging me for a port. I say I can't port. He says sure you can. I say no I really can't. So then this guy does /rude and calls me a ****er. So I just had to go off on him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">That's the reason I get rude with them. I hate to be rude to people, usually, but this warrants it. Before I even THINK about asking for a port, I do a /who in the zone to see if there is anyone capable of porting. If there is, then I ask if they are porting. If they are, then cool, if not, cool too. Everyone just needs common sense, and those that don't have it? Well, the sick Zebras are pushed out of the herd so the strongest can survive, why can't humans take a lesson from the mammals?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>derfrain</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">I can tell from this thread, everyone here is a mature player.  Mature players try hard NOT to look stupid.  A mature player will take the time to do a /who and figure out who the porters are.<br />
<br />
I think for some people, why work, when someone else can do it for me.  In other words, why take the time to do a /who or anaylize the player to see if they're a porter or not.  Just ask, and let them explain it to you.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Malevant Faeshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I think I may have one that takes the cake...<br />
<br />
Running through Qeynos hills, I get a &quot;c3 plz&quot; tell from someone.  I'm obviously a little confused, because no one is near me, and I am NOT an Enchanter.  I am not 60 either.<br />
<br />
So I think to myself &quot;Maybe I am still role from last night&quot; and check.  Nope, shows me as a 56 Outrider...<br />
<br />
I tell the person that I can't cast C3, and ask why they would send a tell to me.  The answer was &quot;you are high level&quot;.  I told her to go bug a phantasmist.<br />
<br />
The real kicker was, however, when I did a /who of the person begging for the tells.  It was a level 6 (as in, six) Paladin... a class which doesn't get *mana* until level 9!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Dalwood</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I'm all for helping newbies. you ask me for sow sure i'll give it. Buffing is another story. The other day i was in gfay in greater Wolf Form (mistake #1) noob #1 come up to me asks for a port. So I drop wolf form and inform them that I'm a ranger and I can sow you but i can't port you to BB (One zone over don't be lazy) Accepting the sow off they went. Noticing i'm at half life from killing Equestrille in Lfay (one of my hobbies. She got me at lvl 16 once since then she's a fav target) I cast cloro on me. Well Noob #2 come up to me and askes for a regen. I oblige with force of nature. he says &quot;why did you give me that I want cloro&quot; This point I figure he's not a real noob and he's rude to boot. I explain that rangers cannot cast cloro on anything thats not blue to them or less then 40. &quot;but druids can&quot; do I look like a druid? &quot;No you don't&quot; there ya go. &quot;Rangers Suck!&quot; was his reply then he left. Sigh Siftwind in hand Wurmy in the other how long would he have lasted muhaha. Wait not supposed to thing like that. These will be the future players fighting with us on raids and stuff...........Ok thats it I quit........Ranger gear for sale on Karana ....................j/k lol<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Colphax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I got ya all beat.  When I was doing the rush to 55, I got a group in Velks.  I ws the onle on ein the group without an AA title.  I started off ensnaring every mob with a nice &quot;ENSNaring %T&quot; macro before finally realizing it was pointless, and I was constantly casting See Invisible on the group's puller.  After several hours of EXping, the group fell apart round about 2am.  As everyone is saying their &quot;you guys were fun, see ya around&quot; speech, the level 60 SK asks me for a port!  I responded by saying &quot;I'm a ranger, I'm overqualified for Druid School&quot;, to which he said OK.  Then I used my Thurg gate potion since I was being lazy.  As soon as i land in thurg, i get a tell from the SK: &quot;***? You piece of crap, I'm not good enough for a port from you?&quot; and a bunch of other crap.  I just about died from laughing.  He absolutely refused to belive me telling him about Thurg Potions.<br />

E-bay is evil :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Melosa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Normally when I get asked for a port I explain why I can't, tell them who can, and try and find someone in the zone who might be able to. Usually, this is more than enough for most people, but on more than a few occasions people have gotten rude and beligerent. Now when that happens, I just smile at them sweetly and say, &quot;Sure, I'll TL you to bind. Just type /d&quot;</div></div><hr />

I submitted to the xp grind in OT finally and I got it twice in one night from random group memebers. <br />
random group member_01 tells the group &quot;I need to go to the nexus....&quot;<br />
No one says anything<br />

-Buddy, I'm a Ranjah!<br />
-Oh... sorry. Heh.<br />
Yeah really bloody funny.<br />
<br />
<br />
And then again, and this was the worst! Some Shammy is in the group and he says &quot;Does everyone know their roles? .....(insert rant about what everyone has already been doing since long before this dude was in our group)... and Mez you nuke, and heal when the cleric gets low.&quot;<br />
I'm going, &quot;You realize that I'm lvl 31 and my heal does exactly 33, right? And my nuke... yeah that does 35 dmg.&quot;<br />
&quot;Aren't U {note-- sorry but that drives me up the wall... &quot;u&quot;... sorry} a Druid?&quot;<br />
Hell no! I'm a Ranger...<br />
Oh... well then you just beat stuff up.<br />
Yeah, mate thanks for the information. <br />
<br />
And you know the whole thing was aimed at me, cause he thought he had a melee mad druid on his hands. I shoulda pulled out my Trueshot and shot him in the eye. Guess he didn't notice I was pulling with a BOW and DUAL WEILDING... <br />
<br />
Sorry, stupid people make me bitter. Anyhow, it's a little insulting to be mistaken for a Dr00d, really. Don't ask me why. I am just bitter, like I said before. Heh.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>Evenshadow</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">....my logic is that if they are a semi-intelligent person having a bad day, they will think about it and realize that they made a mistake, which is fine, and understandable.<br />
<br />
The flip side of this is that if they blow their top and start freaking out, they have proven themselves idiots, and deserve more stress in their lives.  I generally let them carry on for a while and then calmly point out that I am a ranger, incapable of ports.  Most of the time, they shut up and never bother me again.<br />

but your right some ppl do get rude when you cant port them .. IF I wanted to port I would have been a druid ...</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I'm even in wolf form which confuses people even more. I usually try to be gracious about minor mistakes because one time I asked a high level warrior to cast something on me thinking he was a shammy(can't remember what it is now). Heck I didn't know what a myrmiddyon was (as you can see I can't spell it either). Whew was he steamed. Later he asked me to give him a sow which I did in spite of his earlier rudeness.  I think sometimes it's the titles like Pathfinder, or Outrider that confuse people.</div></div><hr />

I guess he must have been in /tell hell and not noticed a couple things, like CoP, CoE, and SoN.<br />

I haven't been asked for ports in quite some time though, but when I did, it clearly said Ranger beside my name, and I was wearing chain, and duel wielding.  I was always pretty nice to the people though, because they were rather pleasant themselves.<br />
