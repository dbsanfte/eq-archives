<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Dornin23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">ok all who have done this<br />
if i keep up EB Lev SOW and invis to animals can i do this part solo at lvl 47 with out worrying about killer sharks and if i can can you please leave some hints and tips on what to and what not to do</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I did it at Level 45 solo, and people have reported completing the Test at much earlier levels. SoW won't help you once you're underwater. Just make sure you keep Invisibility to Animals up, and don't panic if you are attacked by a Killer Shark, as they should be blue to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Did it at 35 or 36.  Kept Invis to Animals up, and even the (yellow and red!) Killer Sharks conned indifferent to me.  Kept the extended view camera on me at all times, and basically swam (stood) on the bottom listening to the drowned folks jabber.  Refreshed EB and ITU when I was certain nothing sharky was in visual range.  Probably wasted more mana than needed, but I was content.  Gated out as sooon as I was done chatting with Mr Spirit.<br />
<br />
Wish I'd thought of Invis to Animals when I was talking to the spirit Sentinel in EJ.  Jumped by tigers while turning in Black Dire's pelt.  I got my boots but he (and I!) died before I could get the book for the next stage of the quest.  His replacement won't talk to me.  Shouldn't be a faction prob, I've done everything needed (and no more) for teh quest to this point.  <br />
<br />
Guess I'll have to go nab another Dire pelt. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Well, the sharks should be blue to you. They were to me when I did the test of patience at level 44. I did keep invis to animals up, but I was attacked by a killer shark. Maybe I refreshed it when a shark was near. I'm not sure, but in any case, be careful. Levitation will help somewhat I guess, but it's up to you. I just swam in place for the most part and waited for all the spirits. If you can talk some friends into going with you, that would be helpful (if only for the company), but they're not necessary. Anyways, good luck to you! :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Several patches ago (but after Luclin) there was a line buried in the patch message that settled the argument of 'Does Invis to Animals help?'<br />
<br />
-- Killer Sharks are now animals.<br />
<br />
If you did it before that patch, you probably got aggroed by the (very red to 40) killer sharks.  after that no probs.</div></div><hr />
