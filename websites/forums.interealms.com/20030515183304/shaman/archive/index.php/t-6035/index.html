<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Racs34</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hello all,<br />
I am still searching for the class that suits my playing style the best. After months of playing other chars I have decided to start lvling up my shammy. He is lvl 10 atm and has the following gear.<br />
http://www.magelo.com/eq_view_profile.html?num=403735 <br />
<br />
My gear is stripped from various characters but mainly from my lvl 54 Ranger. As you can see it is meele focused with some wisdom items. <br />
With my wisdom so low I was wondering when I should start focusing on wis/mana items. <br />
I figure at lvl 34 I should probably start looking into more mana/wisdom/hp/AC in that order since I will have a pet. <br />
AM I correct in my thinking?<br />
Any and all help would be appreciated. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>reaper23</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">If u do a search kinda hard not sure what to look for but some ppl go w/ wis &gt; all and some ppl go for a mix. Personal i went w/ most ppl and go for hp/ac&gt; wis so u can take the hits from the mobs  and have hp to eat with.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Some easy (not too expensive upgrades)<br />
<br />
* coldain skin gloves, tons of wis AND 50 hitpoints<br />
* the OTHER SBS (Sarnak Battle Shield) <br />
* Crystal Spider Eyes</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Baz3</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">don't worry about the WIS.  (mainly because it won't help ya much for a long time.  WIS*level/10 = mana  therefore at level 10 one point of WIS only  equals one point of mana.  At level 50 it equals 10 pts of mana.)<br />
<br />
for a long time in your career, ac will be most valuable, as you do not have spells to avoid damage (slows are not very useful until Tagar's, imo), deal damage (Dot's and DD's are expensive and inefficient), or heal (Inner Fire is you most mana efficient heal - it is just too little after a while).  You will be a melee until at least 24 and probably longer.  and you will always want to max out def at each level, which means meleeing)  that haste sash is a great item for you.<br />
<br />
hp is always good, and becomes even more important as you get regen and cannibalize lines of spells.  Your rings will work for you &quot;forever&quot; - many oracles are wearing those same rings!  as you approach level 60, hp&gt; all is a common opinion.<br />
<br />
The only spot I thought was weak, was the shoulders.  But I would have been dang glad to have those shoulders at level 10, so what do I know?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Elder wolf hide is a very nice shoulder choice. Wore it until I got an ODS. Might consider a regen bp, less stats/ac but the regen aspect is awesome 24+. I'd say ditch the centi and get a piercing weapon. Hollowing Harpoon (I think thats it) is pretty nice early on, rune etched ice worm fang if you've got the cash is sweet.<br />
<br />
Edit: Tribal war boots would be a nice upgrade too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Naala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hobbez,<br />

I have a lev 34 vah shir shammy I started a month ago (twink, my main is a 56 sk) and have always been curious about kitty shammy gear and noticed the spiffy cloak in your magelo profile.<br />
<br />
Where did you get (quest?) that awesome cloak?  Any info greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Naala</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>darkpaw</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Naala, <br />
<br />
Hopefully I answered your question in your other post.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>cattywumpus</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">you might want to replace that necklace with a Black alloy medallion.  +5 wis and Mana preservation II will really stretch the mana.<br />
<br />
and get rid of that shield,  it really looks low rent next to the rest of your equipment.  The sarnak battle shield as suggested earlier would be a major upgrade.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Racs34</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Thanks so much for the help. <br />
Will get the sarnak shield and hopefully I can find a REIF. <br />
Been eyeballing my Necro for his grey flesh gloves, plat tiara etc etc. <br />
Dang here is my Necro's profile. Anything I should plunder for my Shammy? <br />

Thanks again for the help!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">From your Necro, I would take the eyepatch and the gloves in a heartbeat... The platinum Tiara is not bad either!<br />
