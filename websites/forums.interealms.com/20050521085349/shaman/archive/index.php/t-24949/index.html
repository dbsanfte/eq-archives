<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Foramorm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">What route did you take?<br />
<br />
I stayed in the newbie zone until level 7, doing all of the quests and stuff.<br />
<br />
Then I went and messed around in the Bog until 10, then messed around in Antonica until 13.  After that I headed to Black Burrow.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Toktuk Wartalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I've found that completing quests is a much faster way to level than grinding, myself.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gojirax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Yep. Quests rock, plus you get outfitted in decent gear at the same time! (And make good cash too)<br />
<br />
When mobs drop books and stuff, be sure and put your name in to loot them. Many books that drop will start you on quests with great rewards. (Including a 10 slot backpack!)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>LaughingWoman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Qeynos.  PFFT.  Buncha goodie goodies.  *grin*<br />
<br />
I've never been happier about my Alla's subscription.  Pull up quests by zone, check out the rewards to see if it's worth the time... and hey, it's almost as good a quest system as WoW.  *grin*<br />
<br />
Tho the best PL'ing tip is, of course, to make a priest.  Holy crap, talk about power.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Haagen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Another reason why I didn't stick with EQ2 -- too many former EQ players stuck in the mindset that the best way to get exp is to find a spot and grind on experience critters.</div></div><hr />

I guess it depends on the server or maybe you just had bad luck with people you came across (sorta like in EQL). Whenever we fill out a group we generally send a few tells to people prior to invites asking what they would like to do, if they have any quests they would like to run around aod finish, etc (or we /ooc &quot;looking for a few more people interested in doing XXX&quot;). Sure, we're killing critters but we're also completing quests/tasks so it's a bonus on top of just grinding. <br />
<br />
Just running around Antonica is fun in and of itself.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>throxis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I did most of 1-10 with quests. Spent a bit of that time doing bears in Oakmyst. At 10-11 I started going to Blackburrow then at 12 moved to Vermin's Snye. The quests in VS are a fantastic boost to the already good XP in that zone. At 17 VS begins to really slow down. I'll probably start heading to Stormhold for a couple levels now and rely on some quest XP to help get to 20.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Sudedor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">EQ 2 definitely put the &quot;quest&quot; back in Everquest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Thyrm Jarlson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Questing really does make a difference. So far, I've gone to just about every NPC in Freeport and have gotten a quest from the ones that will give them. Many resulted in going to the same areas and delivering items to the same NPC, or talking to the same NPC, or killing the same monsters. At one point, I completed 7 quests by killing the same monsters. I haven't done the XP grind at all (except for tradeskills...ugh). I'm geared nicely and have gotten familiar with most of the low end zones in and around Freeport, all from quests.<br />

Here's my character:<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Jeis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Have to say its great having 30+ quests in your book at once, then running to a zone killing 20monsters too find you have completed 3-4 quests at same time. Great way to build up a few extra bits cash too</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Kromnik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Definitely quests are the way to go.  Xp'ing with quests is way better xp than straight mob killing.  For lvl 10-13, do the mites for some decent armor (to wear or sell), and then hit the Knight Lt. for his quest killing snakes, rats, and mites for sp and xp.  <br />
<br />
Allakhazam's is definitely worth it for quests and equipment in the lower levels.  Surf through all the zones and pick out the ones you want to equip your character.  That way, you'll have a decently equipped shammy.  So far from the looks of it, Shamans are going to be a good solo and group class.  No BL's to steal our thunder.</div></div><hr />
