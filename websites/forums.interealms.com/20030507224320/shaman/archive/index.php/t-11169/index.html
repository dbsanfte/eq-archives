<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kaytlin Snowstalker</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I jus came back from an 8 month break.  Been playin for like 3 weeks now.  And seeing other fellow shammies on emarr i kinda feel well, like a newb =)  A lot have way better hp and overall stats than me(hell, my lvl 55 ogre shaman friend has better stats minus ac than me...sheet!).  So i'd like to ask you guys for help.  I'm kinda poor atm(like, 1k in bank) and savin up for a horse, but would LOVE any advice on gear that'd be low cost and would be good upgrades to my ac/hp/saves mostly, wis mebbe.  Magelo link is in da sig.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any and all help =)</div></div><hr />
