<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tailz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Drawing on how I did it as a vah shir, I zoned into Field of Bone through the PoP book and ran straight to the pit area....<br />
<br />
Starting at 6 or 7 the best things to pull are spiders, large scorpions (NOT giant yet), iksar footpads and scarabs.<br />
<br />
Keep /con ing everything, the newbie areas have gotten quiet on most servers recently as everyone's off grabbing that extra AA for their main or whatnot...<br />
<br />
As you level go for giant scorpions, scaled wolves, iksar bandits, scalebone skeletons...<br />
<br />
When you get to 12 it's time to move further along the pit...to your left if you're looking from the newbie ramp (where the path to the city leads).<br />
<br />
It gets slightly more tricky, but greater skeletons are good, some giant scorpions will still be dark blue and again just keep up with the /con and never pull any yellows or reds.<br />
<br />
At 15-16 you can handle pretty much anything in the pit area, burynai burrowers/excavators (aka furbies), greater scalebones, carrion shredders, scaled wolf stalkers...<br />
<br />
It can be done solo, just keep healing yourself, there'll always be some downtime...and at 16 or so you can move to the magical land of Paludal Caverns, where exp will fly by if you're at the bandit camps in a good group, and that place is good until 23-24. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Bailie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Don't forget Kurn's is an extension of the newbie area with a ton of greater skellies and burynai.  I think there is also an xp bonus in that dungeon.  Either that or it was just me being excited about finding some other place to hunt for a change.</div></div><hr />
