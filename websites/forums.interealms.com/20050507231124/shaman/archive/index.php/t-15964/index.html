<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>PennyAntics</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">So my guild assembled to kill Dain Frostreaver yesterday. We had more than enough healing and firepower so I decided to have a little fun. I memmed Bane of Nife, and Blood of Saryrn, and chain cast them, and used EQ companion to get the exact numbers on what happened.<br />
<br />
~11,000 damage over 3:05 fight<br />
averages to about 60 DPS<br />
Many resists - very rarely had both dots running at once<br />
Got summoned at least 3 times, banished once (dain proc)<br />
<br />
So today we killed him again (triggered with shawl) and I decide on a new strategy. I mem Tears of Saryrn and Torrent of Poison, our two best DD poison rains. Because of the long reset time chain casting one rain isn't the best or highest damage way of doing it, and you need 2 memmed. During the fight I was very impressed with the difference over DoTs even though I still got a very substantial amount of resists.<br />
<br />
~19,000 damage over 2:45 fight<br />
averages to 115 DPS<br />
.25 hits per second, meaning every 4 seconds on average I would land a wave from one of my rains<br />
average hit of 487 damage<br />
<br />
the last two lines show how dain really is pretty resistant to poison, and yet twisting these rains together still puts out far better DPS than the DoTs. However what impressed me the most was the lack of aggro. I was constantly hitting this mob for around 500 damage every few seconds; boom, boom, boom, boom, boom and yet I got no aggro. zero. I didn't get summoned once and on top of that, I sat down near the end of the fight just to test and I didn't get an ounce of aggro. It was great.<br />
<br />
I really think that putting these two rains together might be a much faster -albiet less mana efficient - way of doing damage when compared to dots. Feel free to draw your own conclusions though. I would guess that on a non-poison resistant mob 200+dps would be average.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Thorzion</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Untill recently my Evo was too low to allow me to cast Torrent very often (combination of JBB and horrid efficency of out nukes); I would fizzle 4 or 5 times in row.  Went to the trainer and spent a K or two to get evo over 200 and the difference is amazing.  Torrent is quicky moving into a &quot;Mem whenever I can&quot; category.  Provided that all 3 waves hit they arent to terrible in terms of efficency (Torrent is 1 mana/4ish damage).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Xev_Grammar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Aye, I even use torrent when I solo (requires dogdog to hold daggers and be hasted so he can hold agro-- still doable without that but a lot more convenient)... and use it as much as possible when I group.<br />
<br />
Tis why I have Spellcasting fury 3 and Fury of magic 1.  I decided to stop improving it though-- waiting for the verdict on Bane.  Bane may obsolete tears of saryrn and thus make all those points I spent obsolete as well :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">One useful means of using tears/torrent on a mob thats hitting you is to have your pet hitting on its back, position yourself on the opposite side at max range and cast your rains on your pet, the mob will eat all 3 waves, and as long as its not tiny, you won't take a scratch.<br />
<br />
Another thing to note though is that I belive that Torrent with mana pres 3 but no 4 is actually more efficient than Tears of Saryn, although I havent actually done the maths to be sure admittedly.  With 18% mp4 and a 23% ice dd mod I generally twist cast tears then immediately follow with velium strike, its quite a nice combo and reasonably efficient =)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">With some AA's into crits you almost feel useful in the dps department using them. <br />
<br />
Best usage of the rains so far was when guild was prepping for Rathe. Everyone was assembled just inside EarthA zone waiting for the slackers. Most everyone was getting gnome illusion for kicks, and lined up in a crouching conga line. Argh, there be nomes everywhere! Get off me you dirty buggers. 'You begin casting tears of saryrn'. Course I got seven full pages of resist messages, but seeing the occassional crit and all those gnomes cringing from the poison was hilarious.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Lohknar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I have FoM1 and let me tell you, with the added crits, you can be very useful in the DPS department.  In exp groups, after slow is landed I chain cast Velium Strike.  On raid bosses, our nukes do very well also.  I've tried landing DoT's on raids, but the aggro is just insane, and it usually ends up in a summon and death.  It's really not worth it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Journy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Hmm. Not sure how Bane will make nuking obsolete Grammar. If it's low aggro, then there should be room to nuke as well. If it's high aggro, then I know most of us won't ever cast it.<br />
<br />
I got no insider info, but I'm thinking Bane will be much lower aggro then our crappy poison dots. Which will still leave room for at least &quot;some&quot; nuking. <br />
<br />
That is of course, with the mindset you will have enough mana to nuke as well. But all this coming from a Shaman with FoM3, so trying to convince myself a little as well :p</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Gmork</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I've always used rains aswell. They're good DPS on short fights when you're not fizzlin or resisting</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Other than when soloing, I haven't memmed a DoT in many, many months. Until DoT AA's become available, direct damage is superior in a group/raid setting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Yes, i made this point about 8 months ago that combining tears and torrent = the best DPS a shaman can realistically do on a boss fight.  Realistically means without getting summoned and killed quickly.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Valsuvious</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Do the Warlord Gintolaken fight in PoEb.  Up to that fight, I feel almost useless minus the slowing of the trash stuff cause all of the mobs there are highly resistant to most poison/ice spell.  Even dis dots land seldom, and you are hard pressed to get even dis slow to land 10% of the time.  However, what we lack in those fights, we can make up against the Warlord.  Basically, with up to 7 shamans in my guild doing this, we can effectively chain cast our two AE rains and even keep BoS on the guy.  With right around a 5600 - 5700 mana pool and only FT11 (with MC3 of course) I manage to chain cast these and get around near oom near the end of the fight.  However, using a mod rob and chaining that canni5 button whenever possible helps too.  I don't have a parser for dmg so I'm not sure how much I'm doing, but I know with all 7 of us doing this, the shamans actually put out alot of dmg.  <br />
<br />
A good place (not for the average shaman of course) to put out alot of dmg is to do the earth trial in PoTime.  In that trial, we have even gotten to the point of letting us shamans tank, since we do so much dmg in that trial on every mob that we end up tanking a bit no matter what.  I tend to keep at least every mob with Pox and Ultor, and even add in a plague and BoS depending on which mob.  Right now I'm switching in and out my mage dot bracer with my bracelot of Darkness to save mana on the dots as well as extending the dmg done to them.  <br />
<br />
Oh, and in the rain example above, after chain casting on the mob from 97% down, I have never ever been summoned using the rains, but once while doting him (to holy hell and back).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Walruss Touth</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">This is nothing new.<br />
DoTs are seriously lame.  Super agro, dont work fast enough, and really too mana intensive if you think about it.<br />
Since I've gotten Tears of Saryrn its pretty much all I use in exp and on raids.  If AE spells arent apropriate I just break out Velium Strike and Spear of Torment.<br />
Only time I use DoTs is to solo and on boss mobs with massive HP's like Cursed and even then poison DoT's are often too risky to cast.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Interesting new way of putting out DPS<br />
...ya, if you consider stuff found back in 2002 &quot;new&quot;.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>MekuDeku</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Must be nice to be on a blue server. DoT rains get me yelled at every time, even when I buff the group with Tribunal. Back to searching for a BA 4 item.  :/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>mcroc</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Yeah its ok damage, I combine the 2 sometimes in exp groups. Or sometimes do ancient scourge of nife and chain nuking velium strike. WIth fury of magic its ok dps. Btw if you don't have any mana preservation items get a earring from mages, it wasn't till late on in the game that I realized that those earrings are pretty nice to have.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Aaellyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">I use the two rains often .. in  water they hit pretty well .. they even land in earth pretty well after malos .. i've stuck to ice in fire .. since i have never been resisted even on red cons. Oh. and rains are good for the agnarr encounter too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Isevenl</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">whats this bane spell people are talking about...link anyone?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Vorkreider</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">the wizards did some testing.  The results are here:<br />

The pertinant part reads:<br />
&quot;The first hit of a rain works normally as a DD would, though the next two waves produce 3 times less aggro per wave than the first wave.&quot;</div></div><hr />
