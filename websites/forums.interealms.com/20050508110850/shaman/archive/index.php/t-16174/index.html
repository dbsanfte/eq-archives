<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>mitor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hey i'll try to make this quick. My guild is a pure dark guild, pvp purposes.. for all who dont know which races are apart of the dark team .. DE's trolls ogres and iksars. W/ that we dont have tracking capabilities.. and everyone keeps tellin us we need the use of bards for some of the harder places.<br />
<br />
Just want to know what kind of places we might be able to do, we're lookin for a challenge.. we normally have a raid force of 3-4 groups mostly with a few 65's and scattered lvls through 55.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Asta Khaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I was never very much into the raiding bit, but some stuff right off the top of my mind that could probably suit you is ToV and NToV once you get the experience of it. Work on clearing PoGrowth. While this is an extremely long and boring thing to do, it's good raid technique practice. Plow on into Ssra. Do Rhag1/2. The loot kind of sucks but its good raiding experience.<br />
<br />
The point at which you will start running into lack of bard problems is Cursed cycle in Ssra. I'm pretty sure this was the final straw that made AD (on VZ) turn 4team.<br />
<br />
Tracking is really nothing more than a luxury that saves you a little bit of time when you want to know what raid targets are up in a zone. Level a ranger up to lvl10 and park him in Ssra for example to check on nameds.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Alright, correct me if I am wrong here.  Your guild does not have access to:  Druids, Paladins, Rangers, and Bards?<br />
<br />
No druids and paladins isn't too bad of a loss.  No rangers can be a serious hit on your dps, obviously.  No bards truly sucks and is what will really limit you.<br />
<br />
Here's some things you guys could probably do:<br />
<br />
Itraer Vius in Akheva.<br />
Vindicator in Kael.<br />
Tormax in Kael.<br />
Dain in Thurg.<br />
Yelinak in Skyshrine (no bards will make it harder, but velious content is really trivial with level 60+)<br />
NToV &amp; WToV nameds (AEs are trivial even without bards..<br />
XTC in Ssra (Need RGCs though, which you get from: )<br />
Rhags 1 and 2 in Ssra (total wuss mobs).<br />
POI dragon.<br />
Various minis in PoN.<br />
Tower Bosses in BoT. (If you can handle it, these are an awesome way for small guilds to upgrade and get runes.  They are always up and fairly easy clears/kills, except for the wing where mobs have the 1.5k AE stun.)<br />
<br />
The only mob I can think of that would be damn near impossible without bards is cursed.  You NEED to have a bard singing resist song in the MT group in order to keep him from getting charmed.  Maybe the massive amounts of MR gear than PvP people generally wear can offset this?  I am not sure.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Cursed charm is disease resist based.<br />
<br />
Without a bard your tank WILL get charmed at some point. You'll probably max out around 200DR which just isn't enough to make you immune. 300-ish is.<br />
<br />
If you had 3-4 tanks and some kind of &quot;force sense&quot; on your clerics so they knew exactly when to switch you might be able to do it and just hope they don't ALL get charmed.</div></div><hr />
