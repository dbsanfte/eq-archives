<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">The other day, i had the chance of getting a swiftclaw sash. Not sure the haste percentage, the guy said 15%, but ive read 21 like FBSS. The stats are 2ac, 2 agi and haste. I was going to pay 500 and a Flayed Turmoil Skin belt(1k on my server) Should i have done this? Not sure if i need haste, but when soloing, i use Blight, Hammer of Scouge. So it would lower it to about 40, and with quickness, it would be like 30ish. <br />
<br />
So should shaman get haste items? Or just use spells and use something better in that slot. Thanks</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Azzikai</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">According to the info at Steel Warrior it's 15%, not 21%.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Borkan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you mellee any when solo'ing, then by all means use haste, especially since haste items and haste spells stack, it's all good  =)<br />
<br />
<br />
If ya can ever get to Kael arena, grab a Silvery belt of contention, 10ac +some wis and haste, a good item for shaman  (don't let mellee say they need haste more! =P)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Magelo says 15% for Swiftclaw too.<br />
<br />
Personally I wouldn't give up 1.5k for 15%, but the prices on my server seem a tad off the norm. A FBSS runs about 2.5k on Innoruuk.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Batalon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Ok thanks<br />
<br />
I'm on innoruuk too, and i could just try my luck and get into a frenzygroup, No one has been camping it all last week, so i could probably get in one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">FBSS is bottom of the barrel haste. Zero stats. Get Silver Chitin Handwraps -- not a whole lot more expensive...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>philni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I got lucky.  No melees wanted the Cloak so the guild let me loot it.  For a while we were hitting Trak often for VP keys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Beeg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">SCHW are much MUCH better than a FBSS, but in Inny they'll set you back double what a FBSS will (4.5 - 5k), and you can't set up to go camp them in your 40's.<br />
<br />
I don't think shaman have a REAL need for haste anyway. You're just stealing it from hard working melees! :(</div></div><hr />

For the un-initiated, Borkan was being  facetious.<br />
<br />
Unless you're in some Uber guild where every melee has Dragon Haste, Shaman have no business rolling on this belt.<br />
<br />
Camp Frenzy in Lguk with friends. Try and buy a FRSS.<br />
<br />
21% is better than nothing if you're looking straight haste no stats.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Taladaen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">FBSS is 17%, has been for a while.   Used to be 21% but got hit with the nerf bat.<br />

<br />
Guantlets of Dragonslaying  AC 30, STR 9, WIS 9, INT 9, Sv vs all 9, hp and mana +75 and 41% haste.<br />
<br />
Can anyone explain to me why d0rf heads are an uncommon drop?  Do you normally see d0rfs without heads running around?  :p<br />

<br />
Dwarf + guud smaking = dead dwarf + squished head.<br />
<br />
Mez bet if you be a sward swinger and cut da head off instead of turning it into puding den da drop a lot more.<br />
