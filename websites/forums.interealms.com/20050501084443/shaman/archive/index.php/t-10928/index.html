<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am fairly new to the shaman class. I do a lot of duo'ing with my husband and we decided to get back in the fun of the game with 2 new toons, me a shaman and him a rouge.  We are having a lot of fun and plan to take these guys to the 55 plus game. <br />
<br />
I see by looking at magelo's getting gear for a shaman is much different than a cleric.  Wisdom/mana does not appear to as big as HPs are.  What mix of gear should I be lookign for ac/hp over wis/mana?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">keep around 200 wis , then focus on AC and HP . Pretty simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
Btw , if you really are taking a duo to the higher end/meduim/ past crushbone. You might wanna think about dumping that rogue for somethign else before its too late. Rogue is really only good at one thing . Standing behind thigns adn poking them , kinda hard to do that in duo status. There is many classes that would be MUCH better for this role.<br />
<br />
just some friendly advice</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>galelor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">i could see pop duoing with a rogue being tough...personally i tank quite a bit in guild groups when we don't have any tanks lfg.  as long as the mob is slowable and i have another healer in the group i am ok.  pov/pos/bot/hoh done them all /shrug.<br />
gonna be pritty hard to high end duo with a rogue unless you can manage an agro kite imo =/</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Work on getting your self buffed AC to around 1100 if your duoing with a rogue, then you can happily  tank for him for some additional dps.  Past that point, AC isnt worth focusing specifically on imho.<br />
<br />
Beyond that, litgruv has it spot on, 200wis is a nice figure to aim for, and of course, Hps &gt; All.<br />
<br />
If you can get hit those goals and have a decent HP tally, you'll find that a rogue is actually a pretty fine partner, don't listen to him saying that rogues are no use, he spent far too long in leather /nod =(  (Weak attempt at humor before I get flamed!)<br />
<br />
If you can get torpor you'll find that with enough avoidance AA's you'll tank trash suprisingly well.  If not, get a means of snaring between you 2, load up disempower and just agro kite, its hardly optimal but it works and in the right spot its actually reasonable xp.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>dugann</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">You can get by with a lot less wisdom than 200, find what suits you best and how much you need.  I was in the 150 wis range (untwinked) for a long time (even into my 50s) and it was plenty to solo or group.  Start off with some good hp items for survivablity (including the rogue) such as fire opal rings, black sapphire earrings, spider fur belts, etc.<br />
<br />
They arent the best duo for sure, but both classes are pretty fun to play and all you really need to do is add a tank and sometimes a cleric and you are good to go.  I have, but wont generally duo mine in PoP.<br />
<br />
edit-just looked at your magelo, the stuff you have is a lot better than I had at that level, and your wis is a lot higher, looks like you are doing fine balancing hp and wis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>soupypoopy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">I thought &quot;rouge&quot; is for the ladies.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Zabi Bbuzzin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I had a roommate rog and we duoed a lot.  root is your best friend, and if i need a med break or whatever then rog can tank the mob and i just send pet and slow.<br />
also elder wolf hide on shoulders might be better than the spaulders unless u need the resists.<br />
good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Bandicoot</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I would also suggest something other than rogue for shaman partner...<br />
<br />
Rogues rely upon backstab...would require shaman to be tank...shaman's better role is not to be tank...<br />
<br />
Monks still work as duos (from experience)...others say mages and necros work very well (plus other classes like SK).<br />
<br />
Of course if you really want a rogue go for it! I'm sure you'll work out decent tactics...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Oukast</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">add an sk or warrior to the mix or the rogue is going to hate it....and you are going to go oom fast from healing the rogue over and over again....<br />
<br />
shammy rogue not a good duo...Warrior and Rogues are group classes imo.  Best duo partner is a necro / Monk / SK</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>SimcimaTZ</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I duo Shammy and SK.  Great combo.  Don't need cleric.  Sometimes I add a rogue in the mix to bump up DPS which works very nicely.  I'd go with SK because of the tanking ability, aggro control, FD pulling, and spells.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Jindaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">Hey now - my dou partner is a cleric :)  We are both 61 and even though I thought it would not work, we are doing fine on most tier 1 PoP mobs.<br />
<br />
I pull with Slow and get BoN and Ebolt buring so the mob stays agro on me while him and puppy beat away on the mob from the back (he has Hammer of Souls and man does that sucker proc like a mother).<br />
<br />
While him and the pupster beat it down I keep the agro by staying in melle range all the while canning and torporing.  We end the fight both at full health and both at full mana ready for the next pull.<br />
<br />
Great for a two person EXP group.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Nruter</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Rogue/Shaman combo at 60 with Torpor is great, with the addition of the mini complete heal I could picture it at 58.<br />
<br />
The problems you will have for a lot of levels is the Shaman will eithere not be able to heal enough to be an efficient tank or the rogue will have to tank and  basically be a warrior with less hitpoints/ac and not be able to deal the damage that is the reason your husband is playing the class.  If you are starting from level 1 I would strongly recommend against this combo unless you are willing to go through some tough times.<br />
<br />
If your husband is set on being a melee I would recommend any other possible choice over a rogue. <br />
<br />
Rogues also have it very tough from level 40-50 (no new abilities and damage output does not increase enough to accomidate higher level mobs you will need to fight), so the weakest levels for the rogue will be exactly when the shaman's healing is getting to be insufficient.<br />
<br />
I do play both a rogue and a shaman and loved the combination at 60 (Velious--Luclin era), still like the combination but not as much in PoP tier 1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>ThraallFv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">you can tank for the rogue using root.  i dont know when this is easy to do or anything but with torpor you can easily keep yourself up while keeping the mob rooted.  i have in the past duoed a lot of ssra basement, and a decent amount of upper seb with a rogue (when we where both 60)  its a fun combo and chanllening</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Zhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">Shaman/Rogue Duo works really well both pre and post PoP.<br />
<br />
To get maximal advantage at levels 60+ the shaman needs to tank.<br />
That is so that the shaman can use his ultra-efficent Torpor heals AND to take advantage of the rogues Backstab damage.<br />
<br />
In this situation (shaman tanking - rogue backstabbing) you will supposedly outdamage any other shaman/melee combo.<br />
<br />
This means LOTS of HP/STA/AC gear.<br />
<br />
However.... SOME days I admit it would be good if I had a warrior who could tank stuff defensive.<br />
<br />
Those days are few and far between though (like last night when my rogue was tanking unslowed named Taskmasters in Ssra while finishing Emp Key).<br />
<br />
What do I duo in PoP? <br />
Well Planarian Larvae in Plane of Valour are not bad exp... some PoD mobs are probably still ok exp at 65.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">Thank you all very much.  You gave me a lot of good data. Currently we take turns pulling and I slow/dot,root tank the mobs.  I just dinged and got my first wolfie today can't wait to add him to the mix.<br />
<br />
I found you shamans to be a good bunch and enjoy your boards more than others I have seen.</div></div><hr />
