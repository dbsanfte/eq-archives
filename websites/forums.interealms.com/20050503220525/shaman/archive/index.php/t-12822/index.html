<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>bonestomper</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">i use the Ortin User Interface.<br />
<br />
i made a /pet attack hot key anyway.<br />
<br />
the thing is, the hotkey will not work if i am casting, but the command will when i use the ortin pet window.<br />
<br />
any clues?  i would like to change my hotkey so that it also worked when i was casting.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Loramin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I don't think which UI you have affects things.  As far as I know, you just can't use hotkeys while casting spells.  Unless someone else knows a solution, I'd say your best bet is to /bug it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">You can type it in and it will work, but it can't be hotkeyed.  That being said, the pet attack button in the pet window works if you click it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Soveraign</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Hotkeys have never worked for anything while casting a spell.  But you could always type the command in.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">you can do it while casting as long as you have it key'd in your actions window and not in your hotbuttons  i have mine setup that way <br />

<br />
thats how mine is setup (sorry for the big pic heh)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mamutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Hmm noticed your dismount one. So if it is under the action window and not moved to your hotkeys you can click dismount during casting of a spell? Ok, now I am going to have to log in and try it. Too bad there isn't a /duck command too.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>gangaskan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">yup you can preform any action under actions window thats key'd  from what i have done so far</div></div><hr />
