I'm not sure where Thantu is and I don't really have anyone that is keeping the main site content up (especially Alchemy,) but at least most things are up and correct (albeit a little old.)<br />
<br />
Thanks!</div></div><hr />

Oh boy, it looks exactly the way my 3.5 year old printout looks, with DEX affecting channeling, AGI affecting Dodging, and so on down the list. Wow!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">indeed.  I hope to be able to work on some revamps soon.  :)<br />
<br />
Most of the stuff on the Crucible site has been around for a long long time and certainly we have learned much since it was created.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Mojokyn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">thanks thantu :).  now we just need someone to maintain it!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Rathjar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'm a php developer. If you need some custom solutions I would be willing to dontate some time. Send me a PM, I dont check my email much.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grizlor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Strength  	Your strength is you weight allowance, also, the higher your strength the better the chance you will strike for maximum damage .<br />
Dexterity 	Increases the ability to hit, and affects you channeling.<br />
Agility 	Helps dodging and improves AC.<br />
Charisma 	Helps overcome resistance when &quot;effect&quot; style spells such as debuffs or charms are used on a critter. Also improves faction with NPCs and helps improve prices with vendors.<br />
Stamina 	Gives a few extra HP per level. Also allows you to fight longer and swim longer without getting tired.<br />
Intelligence 	Improves the rate of advancing your skills.<br />
Wisdom 	Determines mana store for priest classes, also affects trade skill failure rate.<br />
<br />
Might as well fix these now while the site is being worked on ;)<br />
<br />
Strength - Lets you carry more, Slightly increases Max Damage.<br />
Dexterity - Affects proc rate, and helps learn offensive weapon skills more quickly (1hb, offense, etc)<br />
Agility - Adds slight Avoidance AC, and helps learn defensive skills (dodge, defense, etc)<br />
Charisma - Affects Charm spells, and lowers vendor prices. Otherwise useless.<br />
Stamina - Gives more health. At level 60, one stamina is equal to three hit points gained (though there's a formula for it... I think we get 15hp per level base, with an extra 5 at first level, then the HP from stamina... that would give 905hp from levels, and 300 from stamina at 60 assuming you have 100, resulting in 1205 total.<br />
Intelligence - Helps learn all skills faster, including tradeskills<br />
Wisdom - Increases the max manapool for priests, and also affects fizzle rate, although only very slightly.</div></div><hr />
