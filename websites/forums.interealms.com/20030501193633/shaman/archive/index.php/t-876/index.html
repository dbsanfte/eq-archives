<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">HI all, <br />
<br />
seems to me that we might be missing some recipies.  does anyone know if verant has commeneted that all alchemy recipies are known by players.  or are there still some things we have to figure out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">What have you found that hints at other recipes not yet known?  Every potion that I know of is listed at the EQ Traders Alchemy Recipes (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm), including the recently reintroduced old alchemy.  I keep my eyes open at all times for new stuff, and would get it updated with EQ Traders if anything were found!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Buggs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I am more curious about what we have done as a community to ensure that there are no other recipies.  for example we have a recipe for swamp por anf halas port, but not feerott or lizzy town.<br />
<br />
we have recipe for greater purity, but not purity.  are we sure these don't exist or is there more to learn?<br />
<br />
Have we tried all possible combinations of vendor herbs now that the lost item restriction is gone it should be very easy, but time consuming to do.<br />
<br />
Have we tried using multiple items of the same herb to see if it yields something else?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Dandi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Methinks you'd find some pleasant surprises if ye check out the aforementioned list of recipes: here (http://www.eqtraders.com/secrets/recipes_alchemy.htm).  The Greater Purity potion is available as both Minor Aura of Purity and Aura of Purity.  There is a potion of gate to Cabilis, called Potion of the Bone Field.  I strongly suspect that the Innothule potion is meant to serve both Ogguk and Grobb...it's only one zone away from Feerott, after all.  (And yes, the Innothule one dumps you in the shadowman camp, but if you're high enough to be able to afford those things, you should have ways of escaping the shadow men....)<br />
<br />
I had not yet started alchemy when the revamp occurred (see A Brief History of Alchemy (http://www.eqtraders.com/learn/learn_alchemy4.htm) for more on that) but given the speed with which people tested all possible combinations for the new Luclin herbs when they were released, I would be very surprised if similar tests were not run at that time.  <br />
<br />
Not, of course, to discourage any further explorations...by all means, test away!  You never know what may have slipped through the cracks or been stealth-added since.  But given the cost of the herbs in question and the considerable time that's passed for others to have run tests of their own, I think the chances of finding anything new are slim.</div></div><hr />
