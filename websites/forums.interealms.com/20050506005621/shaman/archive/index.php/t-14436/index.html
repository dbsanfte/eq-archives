<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Calabar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Aside from the stat advantages, being able to change into a bear is simply a cool thing.  My kitty shaman transforms into a brown bear.  Unfortunately it’s a brown bear with a chronic lip problem.  If there were drool animation in game I would expect to see a poll of spittle on the floor any time I stood in bear form for more than two minutes.  Well, since this was the only real choice in game I could live with it.  But no more!  There’s a new brown bear in town and I want to look just like him.<br />
<br />
For those of you who have not been to the Plane of Storms, there is a brown bear native to that zone that’s everything I wanted to be in bear form.  Its big, it has ferociously sharp teeth and it has a lip that doesn’t droop.  Since this graphic is already in game, I feel those of us who take on the form of a brown bear should take on the form of THAT brown bear.<br />
<br />
*climbs upon a conveniently placed soapbox*<br />
<br />
I’m here today to encourage every barbarian who’s tired of wearing a droopy lip to take a couple of minutes of your game time and let Sony know how you feel.  When we’re brown bears we want to look like real brown bears.  Chant with me now.<br />
<br />
No more droopy lip!<br />
No more droopy lip!<br />
No more droopy lip!<br />
<br />
Seriously, I was very impressed with the brown bear graphic in the Plane of Storms.  I don’t know a lot about programming, but with the graphic already in game I wouldn’t think it very difficult to link our bear form spells to that graphic instead of the one currently in use.  I’ve always felt our current graphic a bit goofy looking, but at least it was a bear.  But if we looked like the brown bears in PoS I can tell you I’d be taking on bear form a lot more often.  <br />
<br />
I’m assuming the best way to get Sony to even consider making such a change is to contact them in game.  And the more of us who do so the better the chance of Sony taking a look at this.  If anyone has a better idea of how to pursue this I’d be most grateful to hear it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>ciccero</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The only problem with that idea is EQ uses 2 sets of graphics, global and local, to manage memory requirements.<br />
<br />
EQ can't load every single graphic for every animation, class, and mob in the game into global (worldwide) memory.<br />
<br />
Most graphics are local to the zones only, and are swapped in and out when you zone.<br />
<br />
Global graphics are for things that might be in every zone in the game.  Player character animations, illusion spells, pets, horses, etc.<br />
<br />
In the case of shaman, we get a few global bears for the different race shaman to squeeze into, and in some cases, EQ even tries to cut-down on the storage that a global animation will use since that's the most restrictive.<br />
<br />
Your best bet would be to petition to take out the current bear from the global graphicset and put this one in it's place if you like it better - however, that bearform in the global set is also used in lots of other zones as mobs, so that's an issue too.<br />
<br />
Personally, I only use bearform when doing tradeskills.</div></div><hr />

harrrrrr</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Whether or not you have the lip, is based purely on the helm that you're wearing when you cast the spell.  If you want to stop having the lip, carry around a leather cap and wear it when you cast.<br />
<br />
When you don't have the lip problem, there are two faces you can get.  The first is the chubby-cheeked look and the other is the &quot;face in the coke bottle&quot; look.  <br />
<br />
As you get higher and higher helms, you'll go through all three of these looks, so it's really nothing to get too worked up about...  Carry a leather helm or just ignore it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">i like the drooping lip :p<br />
<br />
but as far as the PoS bears, i think they look .. i dunno , odd, they are clumbsy and not shaped right. i enjoy the standing animation, but seems kinda queer if we are talking about making it our bearform.<br />
<br />
I said it once, ill say it again and ill probably say it in iall of these threads, the kodiak is the best animation IMHO for our new bearform<br />

<br />
not bad eh ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>finaljustice</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Yeah, I can just IMAGINE the yells I'd get for a standing bear animation, during 70-person raids!  :)<br />

To me, the Sanguine Kodiaks look too much like Beryeni's....</div></div><hr />

I like this much more then the kodiak, I don't even think the kodiak looks that much like a real bear anyway...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Helzik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I do like the look of the Storm Gruezok - it looks mean! But I don't mind ol' Bubba bear - the droopy lip graphic IS realistic. I've seen plenty of pics and film over the years of RL bears with droopy lips. I'm not an expert on bears so I don't know if it's all species or just certain ones. I think Grizzlies, maybe others.</div></div><hr />

bingo, thats kinda the point, looks like a werebear.<br />
<br />
Ok maybe its more suited for rabid bear</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Malkaven Maddness</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">what do shm have to do w/ bears anyways?  id rather turn into a spirit.  it would make more sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you serious Malk?<br />
<br />
Run a search on Shamanism friend, quite a few animal references there mate.<br />
<br />
Here's one taken Diane Paxon essay type thingy. (http://216.239.37.100/search?q=cache:foI6XfU27zcJ:home.earthlink.net/~lavrans/seith%2520dp.html+shaman%27s+%26+shape+changing+bear&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8) <br />
<br />
The &quot;shape&quot;, or were-animal form, seems to be an alternate personality of the shaman's-- that person as he would be if he were an animal. It is a skin that fits. Children often &quot;shape-change&quot; in play. Putting the animal-shape on is like putting on a ritual robe or mask; with the new clothing one &quot;becomes&quot; a different being with access to an expanded repertory of suppressed or alien abilities. This is related to taking on god-forms, but difference is that animal senses are more alien. When someone appears to physically change shape, perhaps what is being changed is the shape of the energy body.  <br />
<br />
Other than the scam hype bull you'll also get an awful lot of background &amp; history on something that existed before tacky new age crystals &amp; incense shops.<br />
<br />
Does anyone else feel this way about our Bear Form &amp; actually like it from a different perspective than it grants us regen  etc......?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">Basicly the bear is a symbol of power and wisdom in the natural world. Its is a very important animal symbol to alot of cultures as well as shaman. I think it fits very well that we can turn into bears and it role plays quite nicely, as did out bear hats, which im still upset about losing. I really like the look of the old barbarian shaman, but it was too blocky and crappy. I like the new one and all, but i miss the tribal feel that.<br />
<br />
Anyway, shaman are VERY rooted in nature, we arent just spirit talkers.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>Sebazy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">This topic has been done to death aye =)<br />
<br />
Imho, replace the old world bear model completely with the postorm's bear, and make rabid bear use the kodiak model.  That would be smooth =(<br />

Was the last incarntation of this thought btw, there were others before too, replacing the bear model is a popular idea, just VI seem uninterested in it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Rewts</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">I really think there should have been a bearform upgrade in PoP.  More regen, haste or attk, a proc of some sort, anything to make it worth casting.</div></div><hr />

other that i'm fine with my bear form. i don't see often the head.. using 3rd view.. but man.. i have a big butt :)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u25"><b>Karnn Sathir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p25">Replace the old bear model with the postorms model. Make the normal bear form medium size, the greater bear form something like cave bear size and rabid bear the size of a boss mob, real huge, the way I imagine Beorn battling in the War of the Five Armies.<br />
Although the huge rabid bear could get a bit in the way in raid situations, it would bring back a bit of the old mystical stature of a shaman in bear form.</div></div><hr />
