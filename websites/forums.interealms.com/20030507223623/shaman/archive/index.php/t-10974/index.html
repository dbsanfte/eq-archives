<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Metadone</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Subject says all. I'm a 45 shaman on FV server and will soon have enougth money for purchasing an Ikky BP (about 8k pp on FV) or a cheap horse (I got a friend with very hich charisma, so the price will be around that). What would you advise me to purchase ? Honestly, I would have preferred purchasing a JBB, but seeing them sold for 50k pp on FV, I know it's not for now...<br />
<br />
Ok, learnt to use the search button and find some topics about it. Thought, the answers do not take into account the new possible mini torpor we should get with LoY. What about if we really got this spell, BP or horse ?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your insight.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Jorlaan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">the bridles are nodrop so your friends chr won't help you (unless he's loaning you all his chr items).  <br />
<br />
Ikky helps you in all situations (ie outdoor versus dungeon).  Horsie only helps you in outdoor situation and only if you aren't attacking.  You don't get sitting regen on the horse, only standing regen 9for hp...for mana you get sitting regen), so the regen on the ikky helps even more.  <br />
<br />
Bringing in the mini torpor though ....hrmmmm  I'm not quite high enough to use it yet and I love my ikky bp :-) (but I don't have a horse and got the ikky for 5k which is cheaper than the horse).<br />
<br />
If you can wait,  wait until LoY comes out and find out how you get the stoicism.  It might be near impossible/rare or sooo expensive in the bazaar that you won't be able to afford it (or you might need that 8k if you want it NOW instead of waiting for prices to come down, etc...)<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">If you fight outdoors, the horse will give you much more than the BP, IMO.<br />
<br />
Especially if you plan to get or have a JBB. (med while clicking... med while casting.. med while everything except attacking or running)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>GandarrTheletch</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">He's on FV, so the horses are tradeable.   Go check out the bazaar on FV by creating a lvl 1 toon there, it's funny to see NToV items for sale.  :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Mondtanzer</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">even with stoicism going live, i'd still get the horse.<br />
<br />
not only does the extra mana help but it allows you to not have to devote all your time to canni dancing and making sure you get that extra tick.<br />
<br />
good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Morrighan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Get the horse. Nothing, I mean nothing, not even the JBB changed my Shamans life more than my lil' glue factory :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Baldkin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Not having to canni-dance is a WONDERFUL thing.<br />
<br />
Makes me feel like I am 60 with Torpor already :D<br />
<br />
It does kinda suck to have to be reminded to sit down when I visit dungeons though....<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">The horse will help you regen mana much faster than the ikky bp, in outdoor zones of course. Much faster. I'd go for the horse first and then if you get the plat later, get an ikky bp, or stoicism, depending on how it is acquired (mob drop or vendor sold). :)</div></div><hr />
