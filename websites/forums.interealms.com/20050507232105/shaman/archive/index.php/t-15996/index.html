<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As I move deeper into PoP and look back, I wonder where the requirement for CC went.  I haven't had a chanter in my group for months and I haven't needed to cast root in my group for ages.  When I found situations for it, it was difficult to land and hold, or the target was immune.  Granted, I'm a casual player with a regular semi-DPS group mostly EXPing in HoH, BoT and PoN caves.  My group is generally Cleric, Necro, Shaman, Ranger (EQ/AM3), Rogue, SK and does some pretty solid DPS.  The group is pretty tight and the SK is skilled at aggro generation.  Once mobs are slowed, the SK gets everything on him, or I off tank the add, or the ranger snares and kites depending on camp.  We don't root, and the necro RARELY mezzes undead flagged mobs (he can't most of the time).  What pins my ass to the wall is how we generally power through most situations rather than use old fashioned CC.  It just seems like the game takes less skill.<br />
<br />
I find that even now as we hit some of the old haunts like cash farming seblis, or the GY in Chardok (for some SK drop for some spell) that we let everything come in and blow through it all. I used to be a solid CC shaman from my solo days (root and rot tactics used mostly), but I find now my skills are in a state of atrophy as they are almost never needed.  I'm talking about a very specific part of the game (mostly the root then debuff rooted mob).  I'm pretty sure a lot of it has to do with where I'm hunting, but it seems to me that DPS&gt;CC and that classes like chanters and shaman are less critical.  My group for instance with it's tactics would be better served by replacing me with a BL and having a shaman buff bot.<br />
<br />
Some of this could be remedied when LDoN brings me the Bane spell (I have no ancient spells) as I can add more DPS then, but I'm almost 63 and I find that although my BoN and EBolt dots do make a noticable difference, that my role is generally as BU healer and debuffer.  Lately I feel like I'm restricted (every fight casting Malo, Tugur's, at least one Tnarg's, BoN, EBolt, plus canning mana back (cann5 and cann4) ... near the limits of what I can get back in the frequent pull 1 minute fights).  I thought with a little CC I could do more and spend less mana rather than just being the &quot;slow and save the necro/ranger/rogue/cleric from a bind point trip guy&quot;.  Maybe I'm too sensitive about the old crawling days when if a mob wasn't locked down it would be a painful CR, maybe I'm just playing in the wrong zones.  Anyway, just venting and hoping for some feedback on what you might think about CC skills, I just think that SoE has made it so that why use CC when DPS will make it dead.  I hope one day the new mobs that come out actually make more sense to CC than just plain kill.</div></div><hr />

On the few occasions when I've had reason to try rooting in PoP, it usually lasts all of 2 seconds, especially above tier 1.  I'm tempted to say that's just what people want, but the need for crowd control didn't keep Sebilis or Velks from being popular back in the day.  <br />
<br />
I've love to see crowd control become more of a priority just so groups would be willing to take chanters again, so they don't feel compelled to hold everything up while the cleric runs to PoK for another KEI.   :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Any gimp can pull singles in a Tier 3 zone.  Ever noticed how easy it is to get singles in the pit in tactics?  Just root one far enough away and it mem blurs.<br />
<br />
My theory is that verant realized that half of the playerbase is made up of lamer ebays that don't know how to play the game, so they dumbed it down so that a sick monkey could advance.</div></div><hr />

I don't hang out with crappy groups either, but I guess if you have a regular group where the ranger does your root parking, etc. you may not need to do it as much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
FD pulling still works, but with the speed you need to kill for good XP its not very efficient.  Pacification/Harmony works good, but bards are by far the best pullers now.<br />
<br />
Only real need for CC anymore is for trains.  But even still, some trains are just other peoples pulls.</div></div><hr />

if you want fun - CC is where its at<br />
<br />
2-5 bad ass mobs incoming and everyone needs to know their role.<br />
<br />
Old World dungeons is where the fun is.<br />
<br />
Sitting in one spot for 3-4 hours mindlessly pulling one mob to kill it and get some exp doesn't equate to much fun in my book.<br />
<br />
Maybe thats why I never did the DL thing. - To me its freakin BORING<br />
<br />
Is going to pop zones the new DL?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">FD pulling still works<br />
<br />
The point wasn't that you couldn't FD pull, the point was that FD pulling is almost completely irrelevent.  It used to be that you would look for classes that could FD pull, now you don't even remotely care.<br />
<br />
Old World dungeons is where the fun is.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately it isn't where the character advancement is.  And frankly, at 65, the old world content is way too easy.  <br />
<br />
Is going to pop zones the new DL?<br />
<br />
Yep.  Only easier.  In dreadlands stuff would at least come two at a time.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Mardark</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">2-5 bad ass mobs incoming and everyone needs to know their role.<br />
<br />

<br />
No reason to keep that to old world dungeons (still not sure what bad ass mobs you are talking about in old world tho).  You can get that in other zones too, should try it in BoT a few times, makes it extremely fun.  We got 4 adds from a train while killing a giant at the 4 way, really does wake you up.  Noone died and didn't have to stop pulling when all were dead either.  Group was 65 war, 65 necro, 64 druid, 65 druid, 65 shaman, 65 sk.  It really was fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>House</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I completely agree with you. The paladin I usually group with just tanks every add, whether we're in BoT, Tactics, or HoH. He's survived 5 MOBs before and it's pretty normal for him to have 2-3 on him at a time. Why have the damage spread around, with an enchanter possibly dying, when you can focus everything on one tank? And mez slows down xp, since there's always that pause for taunt/aggro between killing one thing and then beginning to kill the next one, whereas with everything piled on the tank he can just switch targets immediately. When you replace the CC with another damage dealer, XP grinding is currently really easy and really dumb. Not to bring up a &quot;dead horse&quot; topic, but I'm surprised more groups don't use beastlords as their slowers since DPS is currently more important for grinding than are buffs, CC, and versatility.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>khozik</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">the tiers are open and loot drops very very commonly.. so lots are getting equipped like mad, and are getting xp like mad, why wouldn't it be easy? The masses wanted things to be like this, easy xp where great loot drops.. and this is what they got.. trust me if cc was required lots would complain about how we need better mitigation, and would cry murder at why we can slow without debuffing cause when 2 come, what am I to do? Next thing you know either grc is very common or they come out with something even better than that and someone complains, are resists important anymore? etc.. bah taking a break from homework, my thinking process is not in high gear atm.. =]</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>Gart Egilsson</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">2 things need to be nerfed in EQ to breath more life into the game:<br />
<br />
(1) Lull/pacification - it's stupid how easy it is to pull.  How did bards end up being the end-all be-all of pullers?  Guaranteed one mob pulls = BORING.  Experience play in EQ has never been more sucky, in general.  <br />
<br />
(2) Hybrid aggro lock - no one needs to control aggro.  Just let the dogs fly!  The answer is not to give warriors aggro lock - it is to nerf paladins and shadowknights.  Flat out.  There is no other answer that does not further deteriorate gameplay.  They have too much aggro power, and it must be reigned in to encourage even a modest level of attenion/skill.  Giving warriors aggro lock just makes combats all the more boring.  Aggro seems broken to me.  How boring do experience fights have to be?  Pretty boring these days.  I understand Dreadland type exp fighting has been around since Kunark (or before in SK even), but I don't want to fight that way in DUNGEONS too.  <br />
<br />
Fix this, and the low aggro range issue isn't so big a problem.  It wouldn't phase me if they upped aggro a wee bit, but I don't want to see the days again when enchanters were required.  They used to be until folks overpowered those zones.  Make enchanters great to have, but replaceable and that's fine.  Nowadays, get KEI/whatever off a bot or enchanter vendor and you are good to go.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">(1) Lull/pacification - it's stupid how easy it is to pull.

<br />
And the worst part is when you have these annoying bards who insist on pulling.  So you have this group who doesn't have mana regen/haste half the time with these big pauses in between each kill whilst the bard goes running off to get another single mob.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Sithrax</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">Amen, Gart.<br />
<br />
While we're at it, let's touch on a few more things that make the game too easy.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Outdoor zones<br />
<br />
Mobs are spaced widely and generally each one has a small aggro radius. Single pulling is trivial even without a bard. Horse addiction is just as bad as KEI addiction. Why worry about aggro from sitting down to med or change spells? Who even sits down anymore? Managing your mana is a lot easier when everyone has FT25 on all the time, too.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Risk/reward way out of balance<br />
<br />
Now that I think about it, the PoP mob level &quot;challenge bonus&quot; and huge xp multipliers were a massive mistake. Pre-PoP, it was pretty hard to find high-level mobs in outdoor zones, which made for generally increased difficulty and tougher CRs. Now, there are a ton of graveyard equipped outdoor zones full of level 58+ mobs. The challenge bonus should have been tied to zone difficulty, not mob level. 4C in CT is far more difficult than Valor, yet mobs there yield much less xp because of their level. This is ridiculous.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Tanking... why bother?<br />
<br />
Except in zones where mobs routinely summon (pretty much just BoT for most of the EQ crowd), why even bother tanking? Aggro kiting makes so much more sense, even with melees in the group. No damage taken = no need for a healer. Replace a healer with a dps class and kill faster, and thus get better xp. Slow mitigation just makes this option even more appealing. Seriously, would you rather have:<br />
<br />
SK<br />
Necromancer<br />
Shaman<br />
Rogue<br />
Cleric<br />
Magician<br />
<br />
and tank the mobs... or would you rather replace the cleric with another necromancer (or other dps class) and just kite them? Sure, you lose the SK's melee DPS... but his pet and DoTs still work, not to mention the rogue you just picked up is going to add more DPS than the SK ever could. The shaman can be repaced with a higher DPS class, or can actually pump out a solid amount of damage because he NEVER has to worry about gaining aggro.<br />
<br />
The ability of some classes to generate virtually unlimited aggro is beyond stupid. Against xp mobs - who cares? Just run away and keep blasting. The vast majority of them don't summon, so there's no risk as long as you can snare. Even if you can't snare, horses and SoW make outrunning nearly any mob trivial. The aggro problem is not limited to plate hybrids, they are just the most obvious symptoms.<br />
<br />
As I understand it, there are plenty of mobs in Fire which don't summon, which is apparently the xp zone of choice for the elemental crowd. It's not as if this imbalance is fixed as you progress.<br />
<br />
<br />
-PoP xp mobs generally lack special abilities<br />
<br />
Except for slow mitigation, that is. There are a LOT more mobs that mitigate slow than mobs that mitigate root and snare. Summoning mobs are rare as well. This further diminshes the &quot;challenge&quot; that PoP mobs provide, yet the challenge bonus continues to increase xp gain. (Note that I am not elemental flagged, so if these mobs have some extremely nasty special abilities, perhaps there is some balance to be found.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the game is what you make of it.. by breathing life into eq you talk about how to make grinding experience more fun, but the truth is, grinding experience isn't the allure of everquest, it's what you do after you grind.. if you go on every day and xp and then be done with it, you can be very happy looking at you aa / level whatever it is.. but don't think there aren't thousands of folks out there not 65 not planning to be, that don't grind for xp and that have LOTS of fun!<br />
<br />
About one mob pulls being boring, another person on another thread was complaining about how multiple mob pulls = boring cause they just dps their way through it, no need for root/rot off tank or anything.. the mt just draws aggro and that's it.. <br />
<br />
So paladins do less dps than warriors, in exchange they get a group heal and nice aggro..<br />
<br />
Sks do more dps than warriors in exchange they get fd/snare and nice aggro.. <br />
<br />
Experience play in EQ has never been more sucky, in general - the reason for this is because you want to squeeze out as much xp in the time you spend as possible, if you didn't, there are lots of things you can do, like try camping an item before the mobs are green to you..<br />
<br />
What I see, in general, is a group of people complain about various things, then more groups of people complain about the exact opposite! The only conclusion I can come up with is that these people don't know what to do with themselves so they complain.. you make the game, the game does not make you..</div></div><hr />

This is not some Zen state of mind issue (undoubtedly more of that would be good for me of course).  It's my opinion on the state of the gameplay as it has evolved over the past 4.5 years.   <br />
<br />
The gameplay has changed so that even when you try to avoid boring Dreadlands-style gameplay by going into dungeons, you don't really escape it.  They have brought that style to the dungeons.  <br />
<br />
That's not the way it was really.  Lull/pacification are broken, and so is hybrid aggro lock.</div></div><hr />

Spawn doesn't seem fast enough to sustain the pull rate even for a single group /shrug That said, can't wait to get to PoT to try the pit.<br />
<br />
I hate BoT.  I hate it with an undying passion that burns in my soul like a festering cancer.  It's worse than KC used to be and my DPS drops through the floor in there.  Most times I find it better to melee than to bang my head against the desk trying to DoT most giants.  twisted.  Greater Immobilise works there but with pacification we usually split tightly packed rooms and pull it in singles.  The only times we get threatening adds is when we get sloppy and get respawn when we head out to fight into another named area after clearing it previously(no, we do not camp jump, we call and fight in, most of the times it gets respected).<br />
<br />
I know this will sound nuts, but I miss KC.  I used to group with some pretty good peeps and some serious ebayers.  Despite it all, I knew my stuff and pulled stuff off of the party, rooted and gimped it out of melee range.  Sometimes I saved the party with the simple application of some skilled CC.  It felt really good to be the guy who made it all happen even if others didn't see it all the time.  CC is fun and it's a continuation of the root and rot skills I developed soloing from 34-51.  I don't see this as a whine so much, but the simple fact that EXPing has become so boring that my group literally has to play badly to have fun (IE: don't use pacification, end up letting the ranger or necro CC on the resulting overpull while I lock everything down with malo and slow).  In HoHo crypts the most fun we had was 3 Wrulans (we routinley pull them in 3's, it's just easier), one human (add pulled just to shake it up), and a black suit (respawn, badly timed).  THEN we used CC, but there was no need for it if we used pacification.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I started post pop, when gold edition eq was out for a while... but all I'm saying is if you want it it's there.. for example, great xp in ponB.. have you gone there? unless you have an uber monk to split you're going to get 2 mobs at a time, and wow it's fun :) Had a monk who pretty much has sk aggro and a warrior who has pretty much sk aggro and they were hard pressed trying to hold aggro... <br />
<br />
group was cleric warrior shaman enchanter monk and we had lots of fun clearing to tt..<br />
<br />
before I was 65, 8 of us 6 in group 2 out of group botted went to pon mephids towards the horse guy.. sk,rogue, druid, clericx2, shaman x2, enchanter, you get lots of adds and it's very fun..<br />
<br />
have you been to bot towers? think it's almost all krigers, yeah most pulls are single but semi hard to slow and if you get 2 or 3 should be fun =]<br />
<br />
How about cod b? when you zone in there is a greater on each corner, just that alone is fun! <br />
<br />
How about pov guards? try taking 2 at a time to make it interesting.. <br />
<br />
Have you tried any of these? if not give it a try and tell me what you think..<br />

If I wanted, I could load Walking Sleep and revel in how much harder it is to fight that way.  I don't, because that's stupid and doesn't respond to the gameplay as designed by SOE.  Or rather, as it is has evolved unintentionally I think.  <br />
<br />
I don't know what it is you suppose I do for amusement, but it doesn't really matter.  Nothing you have written has anything to do with the power of pacification/lull and hybrid aggro lock.  <br />
<br />
Those are busted abilities.  You may not realize it because you haven't seen anything different, but they are.  IMHO.  <br />
<br />
For what it is worth, I probably did mephits when you were creating your toon.  You are right, that was fun.  While clearing down one time we got a host of mephits pulling one stuck in a rock or something.  It was a good time.  But that's a very narrow exception to the general experience in PoP.  An exception the proves the point really.<br />
<br />
PoV could not suck more really.  But the cave is good for simple grinding.</div></div><hr />

Not to be a snob or anything Siludorf, but you really don't have any experience with how the game used to be to compare to.  <br />
<br />
It is kind of like being born after ice cream is abolished, having never tasted ice cream, you wouldn't know what it is like to go without.  <br />
<br />
So now we're all bitching about not having ice cream, and you're standing there saying &quot;Hey guys, try some of this soilent green, this **** is good!&quot;  And we're saying &quot;NFW!&quot;<br />
<br />
Matter of fact, I would say that it is flat out impossible for you to know what we are talking about, because the experience just doesn't exist anymore.  Advancing your character in a 6 person setting that involves risk just doesn't exist anymore.<br />
<br />
The truth is that the path to advance your character is much less challenging and interesting now as compared to what it was during Kunark.  After Kunark everything followed a revision of the Dreadlands approach to character advancement.  <br />
<br />
Consider this.  Why the hell does BoT have awesome xp and loot and CT doesn't?  CT is easily a more challenging zone than BoT is (even at 65, take 4c area as example), but BoT's loot and xp blows CT out of the water.  Why?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u31"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p31">Hopefully LDON will fix this problem. Sure you can still advance in a mindless zone like PoV, but you will have the option of a challenging dungeon crawl.  I like this.  <br />
<br />
CT is getting revamped also Dartanian.  I'm anxious to see what's getting changed.  Hopefully it will be a cool zone to exp in after the change!  <br />
<br />
Needing an enchanter for a group, any group, was lame.  Getting past that &quot;need&quot; started with the shamans.  Us old timers were pioneers in the art of &quot;Ghetto CC&quot;, where you'd slow and root park any number of adds.  Anymore, this is beyond trivial for anything that hits for less than 300.  Even in tactics pit, I could CC up to 4 mobs without any real strain.  Actually that was some of the most fun playing I've had to date in a PoP zone, those times in the Tactics pit.  The elemental zones are boring.  The mobs hit like trucks and mitigate, often being immune to root.  SO you either have a decent FD/bard puller or you give up and go home.  I mean, what's the fun in a mob you can't root, that hits like the goddam Avatar of War?  I got ***owned by some earth elemental mofo in PoE the other day.  Mofo resisted my Turgurs, I take three rounds of unslowed melee for 900ish dmg a pop . . that's it for me, i'm one dead shaman.  *** are mobs doing hitting like boss mobs from Velious?  <br />
<br />
Just for kicks, me and a few guildies did all the trials in PoJ last night.  Wasn't too hard, tho trial of flame needed two attempts . . failed first one . . not sure how still, but bossmob never spawned.  So I went to speak with the 7th Hammer.  He asked me if I was ready to be judged.   I said I was and two rounds later I was waiting at the GY for my corpse.  O well, at least it wasn't boring!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u32"><b>Cirin</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p32">A group of us went to PoW and hunted Regruas and Hraqui to gather parts for the Grimel quest and farwater armor...and all I can say is that I've never been so glad to have an Enchanter in a group. It was much like Landragorans experience above, except it was underwater, so not only was I getting resisted and stunned, but everytime I got hit I moved back a bit. Easily to date the most dangerous place I have ever gone for exp...and without CC to control adds and even just mezz a mob to give ourselves a break now and again, impossible or very difficult at best. Quite a rush.</div></div><hr />
