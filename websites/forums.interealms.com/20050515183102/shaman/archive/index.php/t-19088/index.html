<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Most of the suggestions I see for improvements tend to be pretty overpowering but . . .<br />
<br />
What about a 20pt AA skill called slowing mastery for shaman only?  With the EXCEPTION of mobs over level 69 (ie, raid level mobs), it would reduce mitigation by one level. Thus, the effect might be:<br />
<br />
Fully slowable mobs: no effect<br />
Mostly slowable mobs: fully slowed<br />
Partially slowable mobs: mostly slowed<br />
Slightly slowable mobs: partially slowed<br />
Unslowable mobs: no effect<br />
Raid level mobs: no effect<br />
<br />
In terms of implementation, I don't think it'd be that hard to program--each mob is flagged for a % slowable anyway, and all the %'s slowable are already programmed in . . .  Just have it check if the slower is a shaman class (or using a shaman spell, whatever) and then send it to the different subroutine.<br />
<br />
Thoughts?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Barm McLir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I like that a lot.<br />
<br />
Enhances our role as the king of slows without being overpowered.  20 AA is pretty stiff though.  I don't want to encourage a trend for AA cost mudflation.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>AlynaRN</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Excellent suggestion..</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Giac</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Thott, you there?!<br />
<br />
Could we see a graph for this change, please?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd back this suggestion.  Best one I've heard for upgrading shaman slows via AA's.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>agomir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Like this idea alot.  Also would suggest instead of giving us a slow spell that has a -MR modifier on it, give us an AA ability that would grant it instead.  Maybe call it Slowing Adept or something, but basicly give a -10 MR for every level of this AA you buy and give 5 levels.  Make pricing say (5/10/15/20/25) per level.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Chifari</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Very cool idea, Chutoi.  The only thing I am not sure of is if there will be higher level xp mobs in GoD (i.e. level 70ish) that should be affected by this but wouldn't be... and if they could code it such that those mobs could be affected by the ability without level 70 PoP raid mobs being affected.<br />
<br />
If GoD xp mobs are all like PoP in terms of level, then no problem.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Got my vote on both ideas, mitigation aa and -MR aa.  However, I could make a case for giving the BST the mitigation aa also, since they have no other means of debuff.  Just being realistic.<br />

You go Chutoi<br />

<br />
Beastlords getting the mitigation AA? You must be kidding...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Tigran</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Not until they hand us Paragon.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gardeltron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">This would be interesting and helpful, but I don't think that the AA cost is realistic.  I think MR adjustments and mitigation adjustments both would be nice.  If there were levels of the AA as has been suggested, I don't think the total cost should exceed 20AA's for all levels.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">I really like this idea a lot, but I would like to see one small tweak.  I'd be nice if this AA only worked for a 2-minute period once every 90 mins or so.   Shamans currently do not stack on raids, I think a MGBable FA and your idea together would go a long ways towards making that 3rd and 4th shaman useful and important.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Fudapuda</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Why can't SOE be this creative?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Thunderwolfjr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">They don't play the game, that's why.<br />
<br />
And, OK, you can probably make a pretty good case against giving the BST the slow mitigation aa also.  :) (what was I thinking?)<br />

If you read the suggestion again, you will notice that this is NOT supposed to be a raid ability. It wouldn't be feasible to design a balanced Raid encounter with this ability. The impact on non raid environments on the other hand, is very acceptable.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>Ruatonim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">Instead of making our slows not mitigated (they claimed they want to balance encounters better via mitigation), the AA should add a -resist mod to the spell.  Maybe 2AA's for 10%, 5AA's for 20-30% and 8AA's for 40-50%.  It isn't overpowering and it would add a lot to our ability to slow and save me ~400 mana per mob that I would have had to malos previously for the same shot at landing a slow.  Also, this is probably a lot easier to code into the game than bumping the slow mitigation %.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u17"><b>smaaltz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p17">I should have been clearer with my suggestion.   I think it should be a raid-ability and should effect mobs of a raid-level.  <br />
<br />
This of course would mean if a guild had 3-4 shaman with these AAs it would make all their encounters a little easier.  I don't have a problem with this, as there is a long-standing tradition of expansions making legacy raids a little easier.  If event designers for some reason still want complete control over mob-dps they can still demark them immune to slow.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm looking for is a stackable ability, this might not be the best candidate necessarily but I'm doubtful we're going to get a MGBable heal or increased DPS.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>skwayb</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">Like the idea... another AA could be<br />
<br />
slow casting mastery<br />
Level 1 = -5 MR<br />
Level 2 = -15 MR<br />
Level 3 = -30 MR<br />
<br />
They should all stack like SCRM does so in then end you have a -50 MR on any MR slow spell you cast.  They could even put in an AA for our disease slows to have something similiar to the -dr.<br />
<br />
Just a thought.  I really like all the discussion going on.  Seems like we are more unified lately than we have been in the past.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u19"><b>Kazim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p19">&quot;slow casting mastery&quot; is much too specific.  If they're going to add a resist mod AA, how about if they fix slows and dots at the same time and make it &quot;detrimental spell mastery&quot; or to give it a more shamany feel, &quot;curse mastery&quot;.  Maybe that would fix our DoTs a bit, as well as making rain spells more useable.  Kill many birds with one stone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u20"><b>Ramhorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p20">SOE created mitigation for a reason (whether you think it's dorky or not).  Some mobs are just meant not to be slowed or fully slowed.  There's no way they'll alter that.<br />
<br />
I don't think we need a higher % slow, but lure slows and quicker casting slows of the current version of Turgur's would help.  Turgur's, a Kunrak and level 51 spell, is due to have some sort of facelift.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u21"><b>WastreldaLeezurd</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p21">Something I've thought on the slow and mitigation. Rather than use percentages, which reduces the effect and difference between the different classes slows, use simple whole numbers.<br />
<br />
No mitigate - full effect<br />
Slightly mitigates - subtract 20 from the effect (ex 75% slow becomes 55% slow)<br />
Partially mitigates - subtract 40.<br />
Mostly mitigates - subtracts 50/60?<br />
<br />
Some playing with numbers ofcourse, but something similiar. It retains the range of difference throughout the different classes slows, and still does the mitigation that SoE wanted to put into place.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u22"><b>Cragael</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p22">While I like the idea of making our slow better, however this is done... I really dislike the concept of having to buy what amount to bug fixes and needed rebalancing with AAs, levels, 'rare' drop, etc.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u23"><b>junkilo</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p23">been suggested a lot, either as a scaled AA with levels, or a single aa. <br />
<br />
cheers,</div></div><hr />
