<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gileean Crystalthorn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Well I finally got off my arse and registered over here.<br />
 <br />
Anyway most of you know me from way back some just recently and some not at all. But as most will know...I aint goin anywhere.<br />
 <br />
I would like to Thank KoE for some of the great days LOA and KoE have shared the past few days. Its been enriching and rewarding. I can also attest to the fact that many of us have had a lil morale boost cause of it.<br />
 <br />
I look forward to more of this interaction as the days, weeks and months come along. If for any reason you have need of my help or any of the others don't hesitate to ask. Just for your knowledge the main folks you can ask for reguarding raid style stuff are: Zlater, Mrald, Gileean, Paithon, Rycovias<br />
 <br />
I would also like to personally thank KoE for my Mantle of the Rainmaker. I'm still in shock of being awarded it. Thank you so very much.<br />
 <br />

Oh and for my blood Kin...the Curse has been lifted on our lineage!<br />
Moons of time passed for nine seasons when I finally faced our nemesis Innoruuk. With Centuries and 2 millenia of loathing, hatred, and revenge built up amongst our ancestors I lay into the foul breathing heathen and tore his blackened heart from his chest. The darkness in his eyes fading as he breathlessly uttered his last word to the heavens....&quot;Tulasiana&quot;.<br />
 <br />
His final word though, haunts me still...could he truley have loved the Mother of our Bloodline? He rememebred her after all this time.<br />
 <br />
............................<br />

Anyway It was a pelasure helping folks out lastnight. I'm looking into running more runs for Mini's if folks ned BoT keys as well as Hedge Maze for PoNb flags.</div></div><hr />
