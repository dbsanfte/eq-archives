<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">As a gift from the Tribunal and their loyal servant, Kubax, I have been able to obtain The Imbued Northman armor...Now that I'm pretty well off for armor for quite sometime, I'm wondering what I should save my coppers for now...<br />
<br />
A new weapon? (Howling Harppon for Range maybe???)<br />
A Really nice piece of equipment? JBB, Fungi, Spiritstone for Halas?<br />
<br />
Any other upgrades to the other areas that aren't Imbued?<br />
<br />
I only have about 500pp right now, but I will have more money now that I'll be saving most all of it.<br />
<br />
Whaddya think?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Faern</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">/e looks around for Talamay's thread.<br />
/e looks around...&quot; search &quot; button....yep still works.<br />
<br />
Me n Halle Berry getting REAL familiar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Talamay? Did a search...nothing there. I understand how the search button works...I just figured I'd get a couple of ideas on what to start saving for.<br />
<br />
/em looks around...&quot;Sarcasm&quot; in first reply...Yup, it's there.<br />
<br />
GD! Give a little help here! Took longer to write your note than it would to give your honest friggin' advice!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>TwoBrew</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Found the posts I think you were referring to...<br />
From Talamay Crystalspirit.<br />
<br />
Most of the posts don't give ANY specific advice...Most of them say they're putting together a FAQ list, but the consensus from most of the posts was that this topic is inevitably a &quot;dead horse&quot;. <br />
<br />
Look...I know it gets asked a LOT. So I'm asking! <br />
<br />
I'm not asking for a LOT of advice or opinions on lots of equipment, just what I should shoot for with extra money now that I have decent armor.<br />
<br />
SO...that being said, is there some ideas from anyone that would be the &quot;next good thing&quot; to shoot for?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Frekkels</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Hail,<br />
<br />
Here is my advice.  Take it or leave it.<br />
1.  Go back to Kubax w/ 2 ivories and ask him to imbue them for you.  Take them to a 250 Jewelcrafter and have him make you the Tribunal Imbued Ivory earrings.<br />
<br />
2.  Sell your old earrings.<br />
<br />
3.  BUY a slime coated harpoon at auction for 300-500pp.  Put it in primary.  Do not remove it until you have lots more money to spend &amp; your other areas are all upgraded.  This isn't the best piercer, but it is steady &amp; readily available.  If you can't find one for sale, a spine chill spear is another good weapon, but I don't know what it sells for anymore.  (The proc on the SCS won't work for you for a long time yet, and the slimey is a faster weapon)<br />
<br />
4.  Sell that horrendous (if culturally pleasing) weapon you have in primary.  Repeat for shield.  Or give them back to Kubax, which would be more honorable.<br />
<br />
4.  Buy a clay guardian or charred guardian shield with the money you have left if you can.  If not, look for a lesser shield w/ more ac than 10.<br />
<br />
5.  Go kill stuff &amp; make more money/levels.  Come back to post again for more help at level 29.<br />
<br />
EDIT:  Just saw that ring you have is a actually silver jasper.  Thought it was platinum or velium jasper.  REPLACE it with a platinum fire wedding ring (5ac/55hp) for now.  Velium is too expensive for you right now.<br />
<br />
Take care,</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>AvalachW</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Saw numerous postings about equipment, thought I'd try to help answer many of the questions by consolidating Magelo profiles into a single list that can be used by folks who are looking to benchmark their equipment and for upgrade ideas.<br />
The Thread that no one use despite the original author's purpose. (http://forums.interealms.com/shaman/showthread.php?threadid=1379)<br />
<br />
PS:  There's two kind of jewelry in magelo profile by the way.<br />
One is imbued version and another one is just a plain version.<br />
They have the same name, you need to look at the stats to notice.  (I'm talking about Fire Emerald Wedding ring and Jasper ring/earring)</div></div><hr />
