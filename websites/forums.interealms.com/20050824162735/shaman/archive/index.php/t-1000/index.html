<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Garf</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">A shaman in my guild said he was going to do Lord Ghisok's books a few times till he becomes ally. He already has his shield and boots, and he wants to get max ally, then skip to handing in the tear to Lord Rak, which would produce a scale (hopefully) and he could finish the epic. Is this possible or do we have to do all that other CoM crap?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>gandalfh</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">It is possible, but you might not get enough faction and Rak will eat the Tear.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Well unless Rak is spawned when you get there you have to do Reavers to spawn him right?  So if that's what you mean by CoM crap, yes, you have to do at least spawn Rak.<br />
<br />
I don't really remember.  Rak was up when I got there to do my turnin.<br />
<br />
It's possible to just do the Woe/Envy/Marr's Promise step over and over and over until you get Max ally(skipping Ghoisk, Kirn, Neh) and have someone MQ the tear from fear, you loot scale off dead Rak... wah lah, epic at any level.   :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The step in the Hole really isn't that hard and if you guys both need it, then you can take a raid down there and do ranger epics, shaman epics and others.  Might as well do the quest right  and take the guild down there for epic farming.  I know people who have done Kirn with a single group.<br />
<br />
Good luck</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drydon - Xegony</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Back when my shaman was just a newbie, my enchanter happened to loot a tear in fear. (no shaman's present).  Well, he had his epic, which was also on Truespirit faction, and I figured it wouldn't be hard for me to get his faction to ally....Wrong.<br />
<br />
After completing the Enc epic, his truespirit faction was I believe Apprensive.  With collaboration, I was able to turn in the ghiosk books.  Twelve times.  This only got me to about amiable.  So from there, I just did Kirn/neh, which brought me to ally, then books once more to get to Max ally.<br />
<br />
Then I had to also do the whole quest with my shaman (ever try and take a level 35 sham through the hole...not pretty).  Shaman did the whole quest in order (nice having 5 computers), and then at the end did books one additional time to max faction.  At this point the enchanter turned in tear to trigger Rak, mages killed him, and shaman looted the scale at the end and ran off and got epic.  16 level later he was able to use the click.<br />
<br />
Also, Kirn himself is an easy takedown.  I've fought down to his room &quot;solo&quot; (me running 5 chars), but it takes some practice and spawn timing.   Kirn himself is pretty doable for a cle/war duo.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gorre</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Why is everyone handing in an additional set of books to get to max ally after Neh? Just did her last night and turned in her diary. I am ally. You don't need to be max ally to do Rak, do you? Are you just playing it safe? I would hate to lose my tear at this point, but since I have done everything in order, and all triggers (aggros) have worked, I assume I am fine.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Grippa</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">You are fine. I did the quest from start to end, didn't repeat any steps, I just followed the instructions that the NPCs gave me at each stage.<br />
<br />
For reference, after handing in Neh's diary, I was ally to truespirit. The final stage made me max ally. All the people who are handing in extra books and stuff are just being a bit paranoid :)<br />
<br />
And just for my 2cp worth ... skipping stages of the quest is cheating. Why not just buy an epic shaman on ebay?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tarthug</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Same as Grippa.  Did the epic step by step as a casual player and landed my epic.  My truespirit faction is maxxed, but only on completeing the epic.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>thorvan</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Aye, I was going to hand in extra books/shield etc.. But what Gloriana said in her post rang with so much common sense that it quelled my paranoia. <br />
<br />
If you're recieving all the items from prior quest NPCs, you're just fine. Kinda a big ol'duh there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Tiqua Sunrise</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">I'm only considering skipping the neh part b/c my epic piece from the hole poofed from the bank.  since it was months before I even noticed the poofing the GMs can't do anything about it.  Sure my guild can easily take down Kirn but I don't really wanna wait to redo this again.<br />
<br />
I'm ally to truespirit.  I turned in an extra woe/envy/marr, and the mob will do that last talk through of the epic with me.  I'm hoping this is enough or I'll have to wait another few months to get my epic (my work schedule sucks).  So I don't really consider myself cheating on this epic nor the same as buying an epic shaman :P<br />
