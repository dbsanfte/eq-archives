<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Slithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I am an aspiring Iksar shaman, can not tell level.  I really need to be able to bank in Grobb or Oggok, does anyone know a way for Iksar to raise this faction?<br />
<br />
thanks ahead of time</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Seredith</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Might be a way but I can't think of one offhand.<br />
<br />
There are easier places with banks on Antonica to faction, they are W Freeport, Highhold and Paineel with Paineel being the easiest.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Juujuu</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I've never known a single person ever to be able to raise their faction from KOS to either of them up to dubious.  I don't think it's physicly possible to do so.  Learn to bank elsewhere.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Only 3 places I bank is:<br />
<br />
1. Cab - for obvious reasons lol<br />
<br />
2. Thurgadin - you are apprehensive to start you can bank and shop right away without faction work and can raise to indifferent for your shopping needs in a couple of hours of wolf hunting.<br />
<br />
3. Bazaar and Shadowhaven - apprehensive or indifferent to start - took me 2 hours on a lazy Sunday morning to get to allied with most of the place.<br />
<br />
Never found the need to bank anywhere else - the Nexus is a gateway to everywhere I want to go - so it takes me very little time to travel to a bank or go shopping.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Slithe</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Well from doing the red wine quest I have ally faction with all the guards and merchents in Neriak.<br />
<br />
The reason I want faction in Grobb or Oggok is very good...<br />
I play on Sullon Zek, when you are carrying hundreds of pp around you are very slow.  Now if you get ganked by the opposing alignment, you just lost ALL of the cash you worked so hard to get.<br />
<br />
I am sorry if bluebie servers don't understand why someone needs to be able to bank somewhere other than cabilis.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Cenkala</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Makes perfect sense - didn't know you had to worry about getting killed while ladden down with phat lewt :D <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I have no idea how to raise faction where the swamp people live.<br />
<br />
Good luck to you :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Impossible.  Grobb/Ogguk factions cannot be raised.  Wolf form might let you in and bank, if you've got a friendly druid around.  Not sure if that's even possible on sullon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can not cross team buff and druids can not be evil, only neutral and good.<br />
<br />
Someone told me in game that killing people in Grobb raises Oggok faction, I will have to test it out.<br />
<br />
I maxed my guard and merchent faction in Neriak but that is still too far to run from Rathe Mts.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Wally6500</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">You cannot raise faction in those cities. Sorry.<br />
<br />
NO quests NO faction adjustments for killing mobs.  There will always be someone in either city that will be KOS to you and they are always close to the zone and they will kill you.<br />
<br />
Is there a nero spell that turns you into a skele? I dont know if there is one or if it will help with faction, just a suggestion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Glog Galrog</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Amulet of Necropotence an option for you?<br />
<br />
It would be very pricey for banking.<br />
<br />
Or you could always use the bank in the basement of runnyeye, he'll deal with nearly anyone.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Cantiz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">killing Lynuga in Innothule swamp gives a + to troll city faction but i cant remeber what it was. Thats an extreme example considering she isnt exactly a common spawn. <br />
<br />
The other bonus to +troll/Ogre faction is old world alchemy vendors!!</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Lamm</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Here's something I would look into if I was you.  There is a gnome vendor that sells gems im RM.  If you can raise your faction enough to be able to buy from him, then your problems are fixed.   Then you can just convert your pp to gems from him and sell the gems later when you are ready to bank.  Yes you will lose a small amount of pp in the exchange, but it's better than all your pp getting ganked.<br />
<br />
I would suggest doing some research and finding the exact name of the gnome (i dont recall it) and looking around on alakazam.com and castersrealm.com etc to see how you would go around raising faction with this merchant.  Perhaps killing stuff in Steamfont will eventually raise your faction enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sorry if &quot;reddie&quot; servers can't be specific in their questions so us bluebies can give them the info they deserve.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Meschit</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">I tried a similar tactic to Red Wine quest in Grobb for an ogre friend of mine who is KOS there. There's a guard who takes fire beetle eyes in a newbie quest which raises troll faction.<br />
<br />
Ogre friend came in invis, got behind guard, put FB eyes in trade window, and waited for me to cast invis, but it never happened. The guard went aggro as soon as his invis dropped.<br />
<br />
I managed to raise faction with Ogre merchants from app to ind by doing the bread runner quest, but it is no longer in game. I had been turning in lizard tails to the Ogre warrior guild forever and never saw faction get better than dubious.<br />
<br />
Only thing I can suggest is bind yourself next to a friendly bank and gate there when you're laden with loot.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>T'harkis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">i wouldnt even bother with antoinica factions as an iksar, too much of a hastle for too little benefit.<br />
<br />
Shadowhaven / bazaar / thurg (or ss / kael) are where you'll be spending the majority of your time near once you level up, and for lower levels kunark can take you right up to 60</div></div><hr />
