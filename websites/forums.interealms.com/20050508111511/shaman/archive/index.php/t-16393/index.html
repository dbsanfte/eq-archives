<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Tiorr</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Hi all,<br />
<br />
In a ldon dungeon last night and was hit by an Acidic Mist Spell that almost wiped our party out.<br />
<br />
Puller decided to open a chest before the adventure was over.<br />
<br />
Anyone know what kind of resists to use againest it?<br />
<br />
And what do I need to dispell it?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Razco</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Blood of Nadox, group cure ... takes it out with one cast.  had the same thing happen to me, Dot wore off before we all died, but me and cleric were OOM ... and i couldnt find the spell in my book to load it quick enough between heals.  lol ... now i keep it loaded. <br />
<br />
Me and Wizzie were using AE spells, we had a monk and warrior tanking, me and wizzie and druid AE'ing .. and cleric healing with me on Backup heals.. Kills went fast ... but AE's do hit trapped things and set them off we found out ... <br />
<br />
My favortie trap is the one that makes you drunk as hell ... now that is funny! enjoy! and good luck.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jinheim</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Always keep blood of nadox up if you can.  Radient Cure3 is also even more worthwhile now than it was before.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Sionnach Taibhsear</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I posted my experience with Acid Spray and Dark Infection on spell forum.<br />
<br />
Radient Cure1 did not work on Dark Infection and one of the party members said that 3 casts of RC1 had not worked before in another adventure.  I can only assume that 3 different folks cast the spell since the timer would make 3 cast from on person seem unlikely.<br />
<br />
After having my RC1 not work on Dark Infection, I kept Nadox up for just such an emergency.  When the first Acid Spray went off, RC1 seemed to be of no help.  Nadox took care of the effect in one cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
that could be because at lev65 acid spray adds 17 poison counters(http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=4141&amp;source=Test)...<br />
<br />
rc1 only removes 9 poison counters (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3297&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
rc2 removes 12 (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3298&amp;source=Test)<br />
<br />
rc3 removes 16 (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3298&amp;source=Live)<br />
<br />
so rc3 wouldnt/shouldnt even remove it if ur lev65's<br />
<br />
while blood of nadox is 18 poison (http://lucy.fnord.net/spell.html?id=3842&amp;source=Live)</div></div><hr />
