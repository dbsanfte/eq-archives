<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">it is the one spell im missing, been passin on runes because of Cry of fire clicky is almost as good and mana free :).<br />
<br />
Im curious though, and havent been able to find one response to this question:<br />
Does the stun component in cry of thunder work on 55+ mobs or where we hosed with this spell?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Cry of Thunder has no stun component.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Taluvan Winterscar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">There is no stun component in Cry of Thunder.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Korkrest</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">well, guess that is an advantage in its own way, thanks guys :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Xzar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">According to lucy it's also resisted less, and it's on magic as opposed to fire on cry of fire.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Fandros</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">At 305 Dex is procs alot.  Generates alot of aggro so be prepared to load up Jolt once again.  heh<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Telon</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">I don't get much more aggro from it, but we have great tanks.  It's very very very rarely resisted.  I have yet to see it get fully resisted, and I've only seen a partial once.  Forget who it was, but some pop uber with extremely high MR.  I'd like to try it against Emp sometime.  The modifier is -150, which is more than tash(-50), malosinia (-70) and harmony of sound (-15) put together.  Curious if it would stick on Emp with full debuffs on.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Xaem</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">If you are meleeing and you have any type of proc loaded you should have jolt up.<br />
<br />
However seeing how Call of Fire had a stun component and one could rarely get a lot of aggro from that, Cry of Thunder should prove to have much less of an aggro factor in it.  Maybe most of the aggro was in the stun component rather than the slim damage component?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Telendir</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Emp resisted every time for me. :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Celt</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">It's a good spell, well worth having up constantly.  Also, it lasts a very long time, especially with reinforcement.  Nice nice spell, and much less agro than cry of fire :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Crydee Ossiriand</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">I have yet to get Cry of Thunder resisted. I also would say that the agro level for it is a lot lower than our other procs.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Drewno</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">Isn't emp immune to magic? Thus, that is why you use disease based slows ?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>StarGazeron</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">From my understanding, he's not immune, just has such insanely high mr that you can't land a slow on him.</div></div><hr />
