<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Obviously not many of you, as it hasnt been brought up, but if you are OW enabled but not GoD enabled then alot of models are the default human male models, and it sucking ****s that this was overlooked in my opinion.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Zamiel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You can still patch GoD models (and zone files, and sound files, and everything else) without having purchased the expansion.<br />
<br />
Otherwise you would have to enter in your account information every time before patching...<br />
<br />
Simply check the box that says Gates of Discord in the Advanced menu.<br />
<br />
And if your patcher sucks and you don't see that... then post again and I will post the link of my patcher.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Urdegish</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">But running a complete file check should cover that shouldnt it? Ive ran it twice... trying it woth box checked now.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">Uhm, It won't check those files if you tell it not to (by having box unchecked).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The port spells are only for GoD zones on the merchant in Abysmal Sea. So if you don't have GoD why would you want the port spells to places there?</div></div><hr />
