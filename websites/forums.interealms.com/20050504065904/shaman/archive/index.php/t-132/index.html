<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I'm in a situation, where alot of my guild has chosen to go with Giant faction.  I'd looked at the SS armor, and because I have very low resists/gear, though it best to go with Dragon Faction, as alot of that armor has Svs on it.  Soo...Help pls.  I'm a 52nd season Shaman, and would like to either make the switch soon, or stay.  I'm almost done with the 3rd Shawl quest, and allied with the Dwarves of Thurgadin.  Should I just stay with Dragon Faction, or switch to Giant for the better AC? And the ability to hunt with my Guild in WL and such.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Megumi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">The resists on Wolf Caller's armor are basically crap anyway.  I think you'll be better off going with your guild.  Get whatever Spirit Caller's you can and have fun killing in WW.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Litchebane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Switch to Giant, the resists on the SS armor are pathetic. They might total up to maybe 10 each if that.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Oogg</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">CoV faction lets you do the benevolance quest though, and that talisman is a nice item</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">Oy, good and bad to deciding on rather to switch or stay.  In the begining, I only saw the wis, and later really looked at the svs vs what I have.  Since then I've gotten some really nice ws items that have boosted me to almost 180.  Our guild has started to gather 2 to 4 groups to explore the higher end game, and WW, WL is among them.  I have not yet gone because I know one of them has neg hits on Thurgadin faction.  I sorta enjoy being able to go into most cities and bank, sell and such.  *grins*   I know one day that won't happen, especially if I go to PoG ;p  <br />
<br />
I never thought it would be such a hard decision to switch factions.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Chutoi</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Tell you guild to switch to giant faction.  Seriously.  I wish our guild had done it a year ago.<br />
<br />
CoV faction limits your raid targets substantially, and the loot is terrible.  What can you kill in velious that's not CoV?  Dozekar, Derekor the Vindicator, Statue, AoW, and Tormax.<br />
<br />
If you go giant faction, you can get Yelinik, NToV, WToV, WW dragons, etc.  Not to mention that the faction hits are nice enough that you can still kill Vindi, Tormax, the Statue, and the AoW!<br />
<br />
Compare loot tables.  If you can take the mobs on both lists, a guild on giant faction will far outstipe the CoV faction guild in 6 months.  The equipment is that much better.  Even VI admitted that Giant faction was far better.  They had planned to implement more quests for the CoV faction to balance the loot, and basically gave up on it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Well, it's not like you're going to be hunting in HOT by yourself to get SS quest armor, go where your guild goes.<br />
<br />
Don't worry too much about POG faction.  I trashed my POG faction and I've only noticed the following issues:<br />
<br />
* Ranger/druid guild in Kelethin (but far from the bank and not an issue)<br />
* Cleric guild in Felwithe (can still bank in Felwithe)<br />
* Some blue conning annoying ranger guy in BW that I always forget and he chases me all over<br />
* Right when you enter Dagnor's Cauldron and turn right heading to Kedge, there is a group of green NPCs that now chase me<br />
* Supposedly there is a POG faction ranger/druid near the docks in FV, but I never ran into them and I spent a LOT of time in FV</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Boraman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">Stick with your guild (unless you plan on deguilding)  Chances of you getting either SS or Kael armor without a guild are slim to none, at least at your level.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of benefits to both factions, and in the end if your guild goes the distance you will end up switching several times anyway.<br />
<br />
Also I dont think killing Dragons in WW hurts dorf faction...</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>taraddar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Unfortunately for shaman the resists even on the skyshrine gear are pretty pathetic. For what ever reason SoV shaman armor just has less resist than any other classes out there. The biggest things deciding what faction to go with is really what your guilds doing. You may prefer the CoV armor but if your whole guild is Giant faction and never hunts the halls of testing you aren't gonna get any CoV armor.<br />
<br />
I would recommend trying to do the talisman on benevolance quest if you already have the dragon faction for it before you start building your giant faction. The item is great quality for the difficulty of the quest.<br />
<br />
You can also keep dorf faction so you can continue doing the shawl quests if you want. Just kill dragons for storm giant faction and then turn in kobald paws or dorf heads (that you bought or got with out getting a faction hit) untill you get off kos. It takes a while but you can get giant faction while maintaining dorf faction.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Gildanni</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">I'm lost.  Where do I find about the Benevolence quest again?  I had it once, but lost it, it seems.  I forgot what zone it starts in :(</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">It starts in SS, you get a toolkit from Leuz.<br />
<br />
Then, you head on out to WW, Scout Charisa spawns every 12 hours or so, a bit up and behind the SG zone (she's a little human looking enchanter).<br />
<br />
Turn in the toolkit to Charisa and a bunch of giants and a Giant Captain spawn.   Use harmony or good pulling to get the giant captain solo.  He is super MR, but can be slowed with Plague of Insects (he loves that!)  One very strong group can do this (cleric and a tanky type is a MUST).  <br />
<br />
When the Giant Captain dies, he drops a mirror, take the mirror to Charisa to cycle through her rewards.  First she gives you a robe, hand it back and she gives you a bracer, hand it back and she gives you the lantern.<br />
<br />
Once the Charisa quest has been done, she doesn't despawn automatically but she has a bag in her hand, that lets you know the quest has been done and can't be done again until she respawns bagless (Charisa up NO BAG is a pretty common shout in my guild).<br />
<br />
You also get some kind of plans, which I think you can turn back to Leuz for more faction.<br />
<br />
The key to Charisa is MOBILIZATION.  She spawns pretty much every 12 hours and lots of guilds have folks looking out for Charisa.  I don't know the camping etiquette on your server, but one poor shaman sitting by Charisa is not enough to make other guilds back down on Emarr.  Whoever gets there first with a fighting force to do the quest, turns in the piece and starts the quest.<br />
<br />
A good idea is to get a really strong group exping in SG (gem drops are nice) with someone popping out to take a peek for Charisa occasionally.<br />
<br />
Good luck, Scout Charisa was a bit of an obsession with me!  Check Allakhazam for a more coherent quest walkthrough.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>engelica</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">it seems like if you have a small guild it is better to go ss/drof<br />
thurg armor is easy to get and atleast on most serverrs kael is always has a few groups there killing stuff. then moving to HoT side of ToV doesn't req the same raid force as the kael side.<br />
<br />
as for changing faction and the Benevolence quest.<br />
the guild i was in was mainly kael faction and i was max ally, max kos to CoV and dorf. In less than 4 days, about 24hours of play, i got cov and dorf faction back up by just standing around helping out groups in kael.  i never did finish the quest tho</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Asheran Mojomaster</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Heres what you do, do ToV with your guild til full kael, then take a weekend off and go to kael (after full kael) and kill giants with groups as much as you can and get SS high enough.  Go do the benevolence quest as fast as you can get it done, get your talise, and ruin SS faction again :D .  Next, go for dorf faction for the shawl and ring (shouldnt be too bad cause some of the giants in kael give dorf faction), this way you can go back to killing in tov again and still work on quests outside of it with other factions (since your done with talise, dont have to worry about the CoV hits in WToV).  Thats what I plan on doing when I get full kael (just need the bp now).</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>Jaradis</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">If you have good CoV faction, get the talisman of bene and then switch over to Kael.  The only resists you get on Skyshrine armor is the +15 MR.  Other than bracers and boots the Kael armor is much better imo, and the bracers/boots aren't really that hot anymore considering some of the other items out there.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Henora</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">The Talisman of Benevolence is nice, but I don't think it should be the deciding factor in your faction choice.  Luclin has introduced good range items up the wazoo.<br />
<br />
For example, the Divine Intervention, which I use.<br />
<br />
Divine Inspiration +15 AC, +15 Wis, +15 Int, +35 Mana<br />
<br />
Talisman of Benevolence  +7ac  +15wis +12 Magic/Cold Resist +38HP +55Mana<br />
<br />
You got a 20 extra mana, 38 hps, some good saves, but also 8 less ac from Talisman... I'd say they are reasonably comparable, considering the differences in level of difficulty to obtain.<br />
<br />
The Divine Inspiration drops in Maidens Eye, the guy who drops it is even soloable (I did it at 58, without my epic) but hard enough.   He is a rareish spawn you can camp while doing exp... which is nothing like Benevolence, which involves racing to WW, fighting with other people about triggering, requiring a defensive warrior and cleric, etc.<br />
<br />
My advice is if your guild is doing giant faction, do giant faction.   Everyone and their brother is in HoT these days, West is a lot more open anyways on my server.</div></div><hr />
