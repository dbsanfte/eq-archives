<hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Kyntanna</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I have 20 saved up and was going to do Spell Casting Subtlety, but I do a lot of CC in LDoN using AoE slow and root parking. If this wont interfere I think this would be my first choice.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of AA is play style and I also heal a lot, So am kind of at a crossroads<br />
<br />
Healing gift<br />
Combat Stability<br />
SCS<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>sirrini</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">Not sure what AA you already have but assuming with 150AA have something along the line of...<br />
<br />
MC3<br />
Canni5<br />
SCR<br />
SCRM<br />
SCM<br />
ND<br />
VP1<br />
RC1<br />
MGB<br />
<br />
I would probably go for these first...<br />
SCS<br />
VP3 (would be nice to root park in ldon)<br />
RC3 (also nice for ldon)<br />
CA3/LR5<br />
Healing Gift/AHG<br />
Healing Adept/AHA<br />
<br />
Then maybe these...<br />
Combat Stabilty/Innate Defense (at least after LR5)<br />
Planar power<br />
Innate enlightenment<br />
Critical Affliction (nice if you have a lot of AA to blow)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Drinnar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">nice troll :)  I guess I'm so lonely with my 230+ :(<br />
<br />
also, I'd do SCS and HG before CD3/ID5, but I don't think it much matters which order you do SCS and HG in</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">I'd finish out VP3 (I love that aa) and get quickbuff2. If you have no spell haste item (beneficial spell haste in this case) then I'd go for quickbuff3 to get Q down to 3 seconds. After that, work on the healing AA's while getting RC3. If you don't raid much, don't worry about RC3 but if you do, it's very handy. I'm only around 150 AA's myself (magelo not completely updated) but that's the road I am taking. SCS and secondary forte look really nice too unless secondary forte has a low cap. I'm unsure on that one. I am only starting on the healing AA's myself, so I can't say for sure how handy they are, but I do a lot of splash healing on raids and in exp groups, so they can't hurt. ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Quick buff2  (or even 3)<br />
Finish VP to level 3<br />
Finish RC to level 3</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Madalton</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">VP3 , healing gift</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Flufy</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I'm at 190 right now and have almost exactly the same AAs except no innate enlightenment.  If it's just 20 AA you want to spend, I would max both AHA and VP.  <br />
<br />
AHA will give you a 1500+ heal from Tnargs and a 2320 heal from Kraggs, always.  To my mind, that's better than a chance to heal double.  A lot of people seem real happy with crit heals though.  /shrug<br />
<br />
VP3.  Ahh, VP3.  If I was doing it all over again, I think I'd max VP right after Cannibalization.  It may sound kind of strange, but VP3 really is a lot better than VP1.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Litgruv</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">a girlfriend?<br />
<br />
Quite trolling. Ofcourse one might think that by feeling the need to degrade somone in that way would make you worse off then he is, cause you got nothing better. Maybe you should take your own advice.<br />
<br />
<br />
VP3 and healing gift 3 from what you asked. SCS is a playing style AA, some of us like and need our aggro, others view it as the plague, so thats really up to you.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>Snugglegutzs</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Well if you do not have CA3 and LR5 I would personaly put those at the top of the list. VP is a great CC tool. And lets not forgot the VP side game bowling for afk casters :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u11"><b>Donar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p11">VP is a great CC tool. And lets not forgot the VP side game bowling for afk casters :P<br />
<br />
LOL!! I haven't quite been able to bring myself to play that game yet. ;) It's just evil enough to sound really fun. :D</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u12"><b>Jaruden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p12">It's a fun game =)  Also interesting is to play keep-away from the melees.  I like to wait till they all gather around a mob in miragul's or tak and then try to VP it up onto a bookshelf.  They all just stand around confused for a minute, quite fun.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Grogbat</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Yes VP3 is awesome, especially when playing with the unenlightened ;)<br />
<br />
Healing gift is good, as is adept. I tend to heal a lot on raids, and healing is unresistable and stacks.<br />
<br />
Combat stability: hmm hard to say really, I take a lot less damage since my ac broke 1300 with max defense aa. I trained healing aa before this and probably would again.<br />
<br />
SCS, undecided on this myself, as you say, sometimes you 'need' aggro ;)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u14"><b>lightus_rn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p14">ok from the start....<br />
<br />
1. max channeling focus ( i think its one of the best AAs for a shaman)<br />
2. finish up healing gift<br />
3. get quick buff 2 (3 is not worth getting)<br />
4. max out Radiant Cure<br />
5. max out Virulent Paralysis<br />
6. Spirit Call just for the fun factor<br />
7. Critical Affliction is uber <br />
<br />
have fun the next year getting all your AAs :-)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u15"><b>Landragoran Heronwing</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p15">VP3 needs maxing.  That's one of the most useful activated AA's we get, I'd put it right behind Canni5.  It has uses:<br />
1) Root-parking CC, pushes the mob way back and out of melee range of the group.  <br />
2) combined with Malicious Decay, it can be great for having a reliable root on very MR mobs.  I use it in PoF tables for a reliable root on those mobs, since you really don't wanna be taking melee dmg from them.  VP3 lasts 2 min 6 sec, which is just enuf time for it to pop back up so u can reapply it.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u16"><b>shamuofxev</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p16">From your magelo you're more into single group stuff then heavy raiding.  I found SCF-FoM-FoMM one of the best AA series I put points in, since in most group scenarios I rarely get to use more then one bane, then nuke/rain.  With FoMM1 I seem to get enough criticals on rains to even out the resists, allowing for 200 DPS chaining tears/torrent.<br />
I didn't find VP all that usefull, but then I only know of one raid level fight where I routinely use VP to move adds.</div></div><hr />

I agree, VP3 seems to be the best choice.  Not that I'm at that point yet, but from what I've pre-planned, VP3 before Subtlety.  Especially if you're using slow and cripple to peel adds away, subtlety will affect how much you can take aggro from the rest of the group in that situation. But the knockback with maxed VP makes that irrelevent.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u18"><b>BlargX</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p18">If you want to be useful and an attractive person to have along on some raids and LDON's, get radiant cure 3 asap.  It can be very helpful to your group to get rid of DOTs, slows, etc.  Radiant cure 1 seems almost pointless, but once you get it up to radiant cure 3, it can really make a difference.<br />
<br />
If you don't raid much, different story.  But it's one of the things I would want in a shaman if I wanted to have a shaman handy, for many raids.  Not spectacular, kind of like MGB -- you may hate getting it and spending all the points on it, but having it sets you apart from the average joe and makes you more useful than he is.</div></div><hr />
