<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Iluvitar Ar'Simaril</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">I don't know if this game has been brought up before, but I'd thought I'd do so now and see what everyone thinks/feels about this MMORPG coming out.<br />
<br />
Everyday since I quit EQ I've missed not having a MMORPG to play. Ever since December of 2001 I've been without one. I left EQ because I was just so sick of the poorest Customer Support I'd ever dealt with, so bad I quit the game in frustration.  <br />
<br />
Thankfully I had been aware of the new MMORPG's on the way. So for almost a year I've waited patiently for them. Well now it's the dawn of Final Fantasy Online and I'm very, VERY excited. Your taking the biggest RPG Fantasy of all time and giving it the online play ability. <br />
<br />
There's just so much about this game I'm excited about I can't write enough about it. It's in beta in Japan for PS2 and Comp. It will be arriving in the US very early 2003. Gonna be great IMHO and here are just a few sites about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Siriath</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">You know. I had thought about this game, but, I was so thouroughly disappointed with the difficulty of Final Fantasy X, that I have almost lost faith in Square. Besides, in Febuary, I am moving to Seattle, to be with my girlfriend (live with her to be more precise, and yes, we live in the same area) so this will do.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Noggel</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">I heard Square were having some bad issues with FFXI.. first a ton of hardware problems (probably won't affect us in any way) and I hear they were being not too great as far as quality assurance, denying some bugs even existed... I heard this from someone who is sorta biased against squaresoft though, as he's the most antagonistic pessmist ever who always looks at the bad things in everything :|<br />
<br />
There was also a recent article on web news sites that Square might not have the money or something to start FFXI in the states. You can probably find it if you search for it...<br />
<br />
Assuming that all those problems get fixed and they do bring FFXI stateside, it's going to be a very evil thing.<br />
<br />
Combining the final fantasy series (I remember eagerly awaiting final fantasy 1 to come out, as I was hooked on dragon warrior before it and saw news on it in nintendo power :) been a big fan ever since) with everquest (some 210 days /played out of the two years that I played it hardcore.. that's a substantial bit of my life in 2000 and 2001 :P Combining these two forces might make a product appealing enough to me that I will actually play another mmorpg :( I swore all future mmorpgs off after I break free of EQ... but I dunno. FF and I go way back :(<br />
<br />
I'm hoping the problems mentioned in articles are maintained so they don't release it here, so I can maintain my freedom from mmorpgs :P That or I hope the vast amount of stuff you have to buy to even run the damned game prevents me from getting it. Evil, evil world...</div></div><hr />
