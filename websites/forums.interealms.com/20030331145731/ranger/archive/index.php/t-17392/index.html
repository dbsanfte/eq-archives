<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Hawkwind Dniwkwak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">How did you people manage to get him? Did you wait around KC until he spawned, then gathered up all your guildmates and friends to kill him? Or did you try and kill him with your exp group and brought another group along that was willing to help? I'm kind of confused on how I should go about trying to take down VSR. I'm guildless at the moment, and I have maybe 2-4 friends on at a time, most of them either raiding or exping elsewhere. (and their guilds are almost always raiding, which can be a pain sometimes)<br />
<br />
VSR was up last night, and I managed to get both my group and another group to help me (because one of the group members in that other group needed a stone) but then everyone left because it took too long to prepare. (I was extremely pissed off, mainly because if they waited another 2-3 mins we could've gotten a level 60+ enchanter to Rune [he was making his way to KC] the tank but everyone left and the cleric in my group even had the nerve to say &quot;Ok, screw this, you guys are wasting my time and money. I'm out.&quot; and disbanded, but that's another story)<br />
<br />
Should I wait until I join a guild to try and take him down? I've applied to a guild (Arcane Phalanx) but I don't want to join then be like &quot;Guys, VSR is up, need help taking him down please&quot; because it'd make me seem like I was just using them to finish my epic, which I'm not, to be honest.<br />
<br />
Gosh, this quest seems almost impossible unless you have loads and loads of friends or a great guild. I only got the JR part done because I found one for sale for 14k in the Bazaar and now I owe my friend 12k (it's worth it though, thanks Axemdraike! :) ).<br />
<br />
Think I should just try and find someone with an extra VSR stone on them, and buy the MQ? About how much would that cost me...5k? 10k? I have about 8k scrounged up at the moment, and am willing to use it all to move up another step. -.-</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Kinolen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">I originally bought the MQ for 7k from a nice druid I stumbled across.  Since then I've done VSR about 5 more times.  Really, he's extremely easy.  1-2 groups should be able to handle him without a problem, an enc to rune isn't really even needed.  If he's lucky, he'll proc once or twice during the fight at the most.  Don't be afraid to send me a tell if you ever need help with him.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Gavving</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">Doing epics is all about doing favors.  You have to do favors for (usually their epic stuff), to expect them to do favors back.  This works good in a guild where you're all at about the same level in the game.  But if you join a guild where everyone already has their epic, it can be difficult to get anyone to help you. <br />
<br />
I always viewed epics as a bank account.  You have to make deposits if your going to make withdrawls.  Thus you need to have people that you can build sweat equity with, and that requires you to get to know and get chummy with people.  Its alot easier to do that if your in a guild, and much more difficult to do it if your a loner.<br />
<br />
Your getting to the stage in the game where you have to get more than 1 group's help to advance in the game significantly.   I wish you good luck. :)</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Astroshak</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">When I got VSR, I stayed in KC for a week, keeping track of when he went down and repopped.<br />
<br />
I told the guild I was doing this, and that I was doing it to provide a window for him to pop in on the friday (when most of the guild would actually be online).<br />
<br />
We went in at the start of the window, and just split off into groups and pulled for xp/fun.  When he finally popped three hours later, we all went and I did the hand ins.<br />
<br />
If you've got the friends, you might want to do something similar.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u5"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p5">When I got VSR, it was after a couple of months of popping into KC to check track, then going on my merry way. One time, he was up, so I sent out a call to all my friends and eventually put together a couple groups and wasted him. Of course, being guilded helped, and having more than 2-4 friends available is also necessary.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>Mr. Zen</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">Great post! I am having a similar problem.  Only I have a guild but they arent experianced enough nor do they want to help jme take VSR down.  They are learning to raid these days starting at places like kael and Solb.  So I'm kind of stuck doing the epic on my own.  I got the soulbound hammer from Jaeil in the hole and did the karana part. I need VSR, a JR, and the PoA stone.  <br />
<br />
<br />
So my thing is that I hung around the Hole and eventually got invited to go to Jaeil with a raid party doing the shammy epic.  Thats how I got the hammer.  I think I am just going to stick around KC and get to know the zone really well.  And if VSR is up I will send tells to friends and guildies and beg for help, If that doesnt work I'll try and get peeps in the zone to help me through ooc.  And if that doesnt work Ill try it again and again and again lol.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Kensei</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">If they can raid anything in Kael, they can handle VSR. Two groups 50-55 is plenty, and it isn't like you need to camp him. Just find him, and all in the troops.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Dunaden</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">I got my VSR stone by teaming up with another ranger who was after VSR as well.   We both knew the spawn times, and knew VSR was due up soon.  But rather than race each other, each trying to get a raid together, we talked it over and decided to join forces since VSR drops two stones every time.  <br />
<br />
Between the two of us, drawing on two guilds and friends we had more than enough people to take him down easily.  <br />
<br />
So check around in KC there may be a ranger or druid you can pool resources with to help you both out.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Cymrich</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">vsr does not take much, pester some manaburn wizzies and you can keel him with 3 or 4 ppl. last time me keeled him, he died before my weaponshield went down, was me pulling and tanking. group was me, 2 wiz, 1 drooid, all lvl 60, pick up group that drooid got started. it was before the manaburn stacking nerf tho, but it wouldn't have mattered, as one of the wiz critted and came within 600hp of soloing venril. with the changes tho am not shure manaburn crits are still around.<br />
<br />
but a full group with some dps can keel him just as easy, can always find good tank and few eq/am3 rangers to help :)</div></div><hr />
