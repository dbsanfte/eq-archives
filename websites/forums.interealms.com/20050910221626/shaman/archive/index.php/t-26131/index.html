<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>Divinator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">I doubt you will get banned just for making an in game movie ... but there is a program called &quot;Fraps&quot; I believe which basically just takes a ****load of screen shots  and then you convert those screenshots into a movie. <br />
<br />
I used to do it in other games like that but now I can't remember for the life of me.<br />
<br />
Only Downside is you need a lot of space and your game lags a lot.</div></div><hr />

Im not sure what the author used.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u6"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p6">In beggining of video, assume was a rogue attacking you? Most awful rogue damage I have ever seen, wow. Was hitting for 158-159 most of the time and off hand for 50's? Eeks! Must have been low level.<br />
<br />
Not much lag it seemed like, good system? I wish I could ever see so much green, usually it is red, red, red, red, red, hit and run all night.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Uthgar</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">Video fps wasnt bad. I was getting 20-25 fps but i was getting casting lag which I believe was the server lagging.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>millman</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">true, impossibel for me to tell, I too get good framerate, but attack lag and rez lag gets awful with those numbers, I do not know what the heck they are going to do about battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
You must have like 12000 mana, jeez!<br />

hehe thats not me recording the video. Im actually one of the horde guys they are fighting  :P</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u10"><b>snapdragn</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p10">Nice video Uthgar, thanks for the link.<br />
<br />
How long were you guys fighting?  an hour, 2?<br />
<br />
<br />
My favorite part was the face off across the road, when the Horde charged in a wedge.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was atleast an hour. The wedge was actually when the tide started turning to the horde.<br />
<br />
It started out with the allience overruning TM twice before we could get numbers to hold them off. The video actually starts about when we had enough to drive them back to the road. Both sides regrouped and by that time it was even on both sides. It took about 4 waves of attacks but we drove them back to southshore :)<br />
<br />
Both sides regrouped and met at the open field for one final battle.</div></div><hr />

Easiest way I found to do it is using a video capture card on a separate computer (takes the capture load off your gaming computer).  Once you have that set up there's several freeeware programs to edit the film (like Microsoft's free Movie Maker).<br />
<br />
I was my guild's camera man for DAoC raids (we used the films for debriefings and goofing on each other).  Now I just screw around putting guild outings to music.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u13"><b>Viscerator</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p13">Most modern graphics cards also have a composite video out. You can run that out to RCA or S-Video cables and record your action direct to tape on a VCR or DV camera.<br />
<br />
As mentioned above, you can run it directly into a capture card as well.</div></div><hr />
