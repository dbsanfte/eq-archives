<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>Veon of Firiona Vie</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">Forgive my ignorance on this subject but all the post turgur's spells are less a percentage than Turgur's.  I heard they invoke a different resistance, but my guess is that Verant made Turgur's ineffective on some mobs and not others?  Am I right or are these later versions just simply less often resisted and therefore used more often by some who prefer them?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u2"><b>Gloriana</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p2">At 51, Turgur's is our last slow that saves vs magic.  It slows at a max of 75%.<br />
<br />
Since there are some mobs which can't be slowed with regular magic based slow (Seru, Vyemm), at level 54, we get Plague of Insects which is a disease based slow.  It slows up to 30%.  Finally, at level 62, we get Cloud of Grumnus, which slows 40%.<br />

Note, although Tugur's saves vs. magic to land, all the slows are curable via abolish disease.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u3"><b>Kialan Lecariuz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p3">(Not trolling you Glori, but Plague of Insects slows 25% :D)<br />
<br />
We can also use our unresistable disease debuffers to help the disease based slow land.<br />
<br />
And hmm..no one mentioned Tigirs...it is only 50% but AE slow, so you can get things under control to land turgurs on all the mobs.</div></div><hr />
