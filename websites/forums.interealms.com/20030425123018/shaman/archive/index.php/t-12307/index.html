<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u1"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p1">...and don't look back.<br />
<br />
i bought my horse yesterday, and the difference is huge.<br />
somebody suggested it's around FT 20 - perhaps not that extreme, but a horse gives me a regen boost almost akin to KEI when i'm soloing.<br />
<br />
how the horse changed my solo strategy:<br />
<br />
i never used to tank for my pet - w/o a horse, HP is simply too precious to waste tanking.  decreased HP regen rate = decreased mana regen rate = decreased kill rate.  so i'd pull, tank until pet taunted once, e-bolt and back off, sit, root if need be.<br />
<br />
now, however, i tank for my pet (letting it have the mob's back - no dodges/parries) and still regen sitting mana, making the sacrificed HP less crucial.  no need to regen or defensively buff pet, and i can work up weapon skills and add a little of my own meager DPS. i find my kill rate increased dramatically, maybe around 25%.<br />
<br />
grouping:<br />
<br />
well, the big issue is aggro management since i'm usually not OOM in groups unless i have to rebuff.  but needless to say, horsey helps a lot with aggro (no sitting).<br />
<br />
downsides:<br />
<br />
the head gets in the way, yeah. shrink x2 and it's pretty much gone.<br />
the old bug with turning off horses/your luclin graphic doesn't work anymore ('You must enable both your race graphic and horse graphic to summon a mount.'), so you still need to deal with the acceleration and decreased run speed (compared to SoW).  no big deal, though - bih'li and horse stack, so if you get in a pinch just click off mount and run for it.<br />
you only receive sitting mana regen while on a horse; HP regens as though you were standing.  this might in theory  be a problem if a larger portion of a shaman's regen came from sitting vs standing.  however, as a barbarian with regen III and regrowth up, i regen 20 HP standing vs. 23 sitting.  again, NBD.<br />
<br />
so that's about it... i did a lot of research and asked a lot of questions before buying my mount, but in retrospect i should've bought first and worried later.  it's hands down the gear upgrade that's yielded the most significant improvement in gameplay i've bought. (no JBB yet though)<br />
<br />
anyway, just thought i'd post in case any of you are considering buying a horse.  do it :)<br />

<br />
You do get sitting HP regen while on a horse though...not standing.  Not sure where qhor was coming from on that one.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u4"><b>qhor</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p4">HP regen, 54 barbarian with regrowth and regen III:<br />
<br />
-sitting, no horse: 23 HP/tick.<br />
<br />
-standing, no horse: 20 HP/tick.<br />
<br />
-on horse: 20 HP/tick.<br />
<br />
<br />

Wait... is this true or isnt it? :) Anyone actually keep detailed track and find out for sure?</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u7"><b>Tallanas</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p7">You fight, you get nothing...<br />
<br />
Oh, and it is FT 21 at max meditate skill... better than KEI.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u8"><b>Shandy Orcbane</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p8">&quot;Combat mode&quot; seems to diminish the mana regen from what I've seen.<br />
<br />
I've gotten mana back faster sitting, being thumped on, and JBB blasting, than when I pounded the critter.</div></div><hr />


<div class="post"><div class="username" id="u9"><b>Jikuliz</b></div><div class="posttext" id="p9">Fact: you gain sitting mana regen on a horse if your doing anything but attacking. Attacking negates it. <br />
Fact: you do NOT gain sitting hp regen on a horse ever. <br />
<br />
Hey, maybe thats just a fact for me, but ive checked and also numerous others have said the same to me before i bought the horse.</div></div><hr />
